House Report 107-436 accompanying the Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 107-314) directed GAO to review compensation programs for reservists serving on active duty. GAO evaluated information on income change reported by reservists when activated; reserve families' readiness for call-ups and their awareness and use of family support programs, focusing on personal financial management; and a legislative proposal for the Department of Defense (DOD) to offer TRICARE, the military's health care program, to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD lacks sufficient information on the magnitude, the causes, and the effects of income change to determine the need for compensation programs targeting reservists who (1) fill critical wartime specialties, (2) experience high degrees of income loss when on extended periods of active duty, and (3) demonstrate that income loss is a significant factor in their retention decisions. Such data are critical for assessing the full nature and scope of income change problems and in developing cost-effective solutions. DOD self-reported survey data from past and current military operations indicate that activated reservists have experienced widely varying degrees of income change. While many reservists lost income, more than half of reservists had either no change or a gain in income. However, survey data are questionable primarily because it is unclear what survey respondents considered as income loss or gain in determining their financial status. DOD has placed greater emphasis on preparing reservists' families for potential call-ups, yet survey data show that one-third of spouses do not feel prepared, over half of reservists are not aware of family support programs, and more than 90 percent of spouses do not use these programs. Personal financial management, one of DOD's core family support programs, illustrates the continuing challenges DOD faces in providing outreach to reservists. The 2000 survey data showed that 61 percent of reservists did not know whether personal financial management services were available. The survey also showed that reservists have financial problems similar to their active duty counterparts. DOD is taking steps to improve personal financial management, but it has not assessed the financial well-being of reserve families, assessed the impact of reservists' financial problems on mission readiness, or determined how to tailor its programs to reservists. Available DOD data do not identify a need to offer TRICARE to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty. Estimates from DOD's 2000 survey showed that nearly 80 percent of reservists had health care coverage when they were not on active duty. This rate is similar to that of comparable groups within the overall U.S. population. DOD has expressed concern over the estimated costs of this proposal. Cost estimates range up to $5.1 billion a year. However, DOD has not fully assessed the ramifications of this proposed legislation, including the impact on recruiting and retention, the effects on active duty personnel, the extent reservists and their families might participate in such a program, or the impact on the TRICARE system. In addition, a high percentage of reservists' civilian employers who currently pay some or all of health care premiums for reservists during activations could discontinue providing such assistance. A number of recent improvements have been made to reservists and their families' health care when members are activated. However, DOD lacks data on problems reservists and their families have experienced with health care since the mobilizations following September 11, 2001; the causes of these problems; and their effects on readiness, recruiting, and retention."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, National Guard and Reserve personnel  have been deployed to a number of contingency operations, including  those in Southwest Asia and the Balkans.

Some  reservists have served for a year or more, and the pace of reserve  operations is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Citing the  increased reliance on the reserves, House Report 107-436 accompanying  the Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act directed us to  review compensation programs for reservists serving on active duty. Our  objectives were to evaluate (1) information on income change reported by  reservists when activated for a military operation to determine the need  for compensation programs; (2) reserve families\u2019 readiness for call-ups and  their awareness and use of family support programs, specifically focusing  on personal financial management; and (3) a legislative proposal for the  Department of Defense (DOD) to offer TRICARE, the military\u2019s health care  program, to reservists and their families when members are not on active  duty.

One of DOD\u2019s guiding principles for military  compensation is that servicemembers, both reserve and active component  members, be treated fairly. Military compensation for reservists is  affected by the type of military duty they perform. In peacetime\u2014when a  reservist is training or performing military duty not related to a  contingency operation\u2014certain thresholds are imposed at particular  points in service before a reservist is eligible to receive the same  compensation as a member serving in the active component. For  contingency operations, these same thresholds generally do not apply.  Thus, reservists activated for contingency operations such as Iraqi  Freedom, Noble Eagle, and Enduring Freedom are generally eligible to  receive the same compensation as active component personnel.", "Our review focused on the more than 870,000 reservists who generally drill  and train part-time with their military units (referred to as drilling unit  members in this report). To review compensation programs for reservists  on active duty, we analyzed legislation, policies, and other pertinent  documents; obtained and analyzed proposals to enhance reserve  compensation; and discussed these with officials from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, the Office of Military  Compensation, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for the Office of  Military Community and Family Policy, reserve component headquarters,  and the TRICARE Management Activity. To gain the perspective of  reservists and their spouses, we obtained and analyzed the results of a  2000 DOD survey of reservists, which covered reservists\u2019 experiences  during military operations between 1991 and 2000, and a 2002 DOD survey  of spouses of activated reservists.

Today, reservists not only supplement but also replace active forces in  military operations worldwide. In fact, DOD has stated that no significant  operation can be conducted without reserve involvement. Figure 1 shows  per capita involvement of reservists annually since 1986 and illustrates the  spikes in reserve participation in military operations in fiscal years 1991  (Desert Shield and Desert Storm) and 2002 (Noble Eagle and Enduring  Freedom), as well as a fairly steady level of involvement between 1996 and  2001. We derived per capita calculations by dividing the total days of  support for military missions by the end strength of the Selected Reserve.  However, force structure within the Selected Reserve qualifies only a  portion of those available to serve for a particular mission.

Such data are critical for  assessing the full nature and scope of income change problems and in  developing cost-effective solutions. Based on the 2000 survey data, DOD  estimated that the average total income change for all reservists (including  losses and gains) was almost $1,700 in losses. However, this figure should  be considered with caution because of the estimating methodology that  was used and because it is unclear what survey respondents considered as  income loss or gain in answering this question. For example, when  members reported income loss or gain, they may or may not have included  the value of indirect compensation, such as health care benefits, or  considered changes in their expenses, such as those for household and car  maintenance and for child care. In addition, it is unclear whether survey  respondents included paid civilian leave received concurrently with  military pay or whether they included differential pay if provided by their  employer. Further, reservists were mobilized or deployed for varying  lengths of time, which is likely to affect their overall income change.  According to DOD\u2019s analysis of the survey data, certain groups reported  greater losses of income on average. For example, self-employed  reservists reported an average income loss of $6,500, physicians/registered  nurses reported an average income loss of $9,000, and self-employed  physicians/registered nurses reported an average income loss of $25,600.  DOD\u2019s analysis presents little data on those groups who reported an  overall income gain. Two groups that were identified as reporting a gain  were clergy and those who worked for a family business without pay.", "The existing survey data provide incomplete information on the causes of  income change. Income change can be attributed to various factors,  including a difference between civilian and military pay, a change in  spousal income, a change resulting from continuing losses from a business  or practice, a different job being performed, or some combination of these.  The 2002 spouse survey estimates showed that about 60 percent had an  increase in the military member\u2019s earnings, 10 percent had an increase in  their own earnings due to working more hours or taking a second job,   31 percent had a reduction in the military member\u2019s earnings, 19 percent  had a reduction in their own earnings because they were unable to work  as much, 6 percent had other increases in income, and 15 percent had  other reductions in income. In addition to these factors, military  households may also experience a change in expenses during the  activation period. The 2000 survey estimates showed that about 22 percent  of drilling unit members had an increase in child-care expenses, 26 percent  had an increase in household maintenance and car repair expenses, and   63 percent had an increase in telephone expenses. However, neither  survey provides complete information on the extent these individual  factors contribute to overall income change.", "Although reservists have reported that income loss causes problems for  them, the effects of these problems are not clear. When asked to rank  income loss among other problems they have experienced during  mobilization or deployment, about 41 percent of drilling unit members  ranked it as one of their most serious problems. But the survey data are  inconclusive concerning the effects of income loss problems on  servicemembers\u2019 attitudes toward military life or on retention. Our prior  work has shown that retention decisions are highly personal in nature and  that many factors may affect the decision of a servicemember to stay in  the military or leave. A 1998 RAND study conducted for DOD found that  income loss during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, while widespread among  reservists, did not have a measurable effect on the retention of enlisted  reservists. The study was cautiously optimistic that mobilizing the  reserves under similar circumstances in the future would not have adverse  effects on enlisted recruiting and retention. However, the effects of future  mobilizations can depend on the mission, the length of time reservists are  deployed, the frequency of deployment, the degree of support from  employers and family members, and other factors.

About 10 percent of self-employed drilling unit members had  income loss of $25,000 or more, compared with about 3 percent for drilling  unit members overall.

Under this proposal, an eligible reservist would receive an  additional monthly pay that would vary by specialty, level of training, and  years of active duty service as a Medical Corps officer. The monthly pay  would be limited to no more than twice the special pay currently earned  by an eligible individual. The Army estimates the mean cost at $6,000 per  month per eligible professional.

These retention difficulties are  due, in part, to reservists\u2019 concerns about financial loss during  deployment. According to the Army, it has been unsuccessful in recruiting  and retaining enough fully trained physicians to meet authorized personnel  levels in the Selected Reserve and has had to rely on transfers from the  Individual Ready Reserve to reconstitute its Selected Reserve strength.  The Army attributes retention challenges within the reserves to a decrease  in the number of active duty physicians transferring to the reserve  component, attrition due to an aging force and professionals meeting  retirement eligibility, and the inability of some medical professionals to  tolerate income loss resulting from frequent or lengthy activations.", "Every 2 years, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs  publishes a list of critical officer skills needed to meet Ready Reserve  medical shortages and for which the services could offer retention and  recruiting incentives.

The survey showed that catastrophic financial  loss associated with long-term deployments was the primary factor in their  decisions to leave the Army Reserve. Furthermore, over three-quarters of  all Army Reserve physicians surveyed in 1996 and 2001 required  mobilization periods of 90 days or less to avoid seriously affecting their  medical practices. Fifty-nine percent of respondents to the 2001 survey  preferred a maximum deployment length of 60 days or less. However,  these respondents indicated that a special deployment pay would allow  them to deploy for longer periods of time and would increase the  likelihood that they would remain in the Army Reserve. The amount of  special pay that respondents would need varied by medical specialty, with  the majority indicating a need for less than $10,000 a month to maintain  their practices while deployed.", "To increase retention among medical professionals concerned about the  financial impact of lengthy mobilizations on their practices, the Army  implemented the Presidential Reserve Call-Up 90-Day Rotation Pilot  Program in 1999. The 3-year pilot program limited deployments of  physicians, dentists, and nurse anesthetists to 90 days in the area of  operations. A 2001 survey of Army Reserve medical personnel found that  intent to remain in the Army Reserve increased among self-employed  medical professionals who were aware of the 90-day rotation pilot  program. By 2001, the percentage of Army Reserve medical professionals  who indicated that they did not intend to remain until retirement had  dropped slightly. Those aware of the 90-day cap who indicated that they  would leave because of the financial impact of mobilization decreased by  23 percent from 1996 to 2001. Moreover, those indicating that they would  leave because of concerns about future mobilizations decreased by   20 percent over the same time period. Respondents to the 2001 survey  indicated that a special deployment pay would allow them to deploy for  longer periods of time.

Under various legislative proposals introduced  during the current congressional cycle, federal agencies that employ  reservists called to active duty would be required to pay the difference, if  any, between the employee\u2019s civilian pay and military pay from  appropriated funds. DOD\u2019s 2000 survey estimates indicated that 9 percent  of drilling unit members were federal employees in 1999. Proponents of  differential pay for federal employee reservists state that providing this  pay (1) would recognize the demands and burdens placed on reservists  and their families, (2) would help federal employee reservists maintain  their standard of living, and (3) would set an example for other employers  of reservists. The Office of Personnel Management has opposed similar  legislation in the past on the basis of equity and cost issues. In addition, as  noted earlier, available data indicate that federal employee reservists are  not suffering income loss to a greater extent than other reservists, such as  certain health care professionals.", "Federal law provides many rights and benefits for federal employees  called to active military duty. In December 2001, federal agencies were  granted discretionary authority to pay both the employee and government  shares of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program premium for  any or all of an 18-month period when an employee is called to active duty  in support of a contingency operation. As of March 2003, about   64 percent of federal agencies reported paying the entire premium when  an employee is called to active duty. At agencies that have not used this  discretionary authority, employees may continue to pay their share of  premiums for the first 12 months and their share of premiums plus the  government\u2019s share of premiums and a 2 percent administrative  processing fee for the next 6 months.", "Other benefits for activated federal employee reservists include the  following:    continuation of life insurance for up to 12 months at no cost;    continued accrual of military leave, which may be carried over to the  following fiscal year or used while activated; and  retroactive retirement credits upon return to their civilian positions.", "In an August 2002 memorandum, the Office of Personnel Management  cited \u201cequity issues\u201d in its opposition to differential pay for federal  employee reservists. While the Office of Personnel Management did not  elaborate, differential pay could create inequities in pay between federal  employee reservists and their active duty counterparts who are serving in  the same positions and pay grades. Two servicemembers performing the  same military job could receive different amounts of compensation simply  because one is a reservist with a full-time job in the federal civilian sector.  In addition, there may not be a correlation between a reservist\u2019s civilian  and military pay grades. A federal employee\u2019s civilian salary is based on  work performed at a certain pay grade and may require different skills and  knowledge than the employee\u2019s military job. Providing differential pay  would, in effect, be paying the reservist for a job other than that being  performed.", "The Office of Personnel Management also stated that the cost of providing  differential pay for activated federal employee reservists on an indefinite  basis would be significant and that data are lacking to make an accurate  cost projection. It noted that because federal agencies would fund the cost  of differential pay, agencies with greater numbers of activated reservists  would have higher costs, reducing the amount of funds available for other  program operations. The Congressional Budget Office developed a cost  estimate for one of the legislative proposals. It estimated that this  proposal would cost $201 million for the fiscal year 2003-08 period, which  includes retroactive payments for federal employees called to active duty  since September 11, 2001.", "A factor that complicates calculation of the total cost of differential pay is  DOD\u2019s lack of complete information about reservists\u2019 employment. Until  recently, DOD did not require reservists to provide information to DOD  about their civilian employers. In response to our recommendation that  DOD collect complete data about reservists\u2019 employment, DOD and the  services implemented the Civilian Employment Information Program in  March 2003. Under this program, Selected Reserve members are required  to provide their employment status, employer\u2019s name, and civilian job title,  among other information. When fully established, the program will allow  DOD to consider employment-related factors during premobilization  planning and assist the department in accomplishing its employer  outreach efforts. The data could also help to identify the number of federal  employees who could be called to active duty and to develop a total cost  estimate if a pay differential were offered to them.", "While civilian employers are not required under the Uniformed Services  Employment and Reemployment Rights Act to provide differential pay to  activated reservists, we have found that many employers do so. As part of  our earlier work on employer support for the Guard and Reserve, we  contacted 359 employers of reservists in high tempo units between  November 2001 and March 2002 about their pay practices for activated  employees. Of 183 employers who completed and returned the survey,  about 40 percent indicated that they provide either full pay, differential  pay, or a combination of both to activated reservists. For this report, we  also surveyed officials from 22 states about their compensation policies  for state employees called to federal active duty and found that most offer  some type of financial assistance to their activated employees. Nineteen of  the 22 states offer financial assistance, such as pay differentials, to  employees who are on military leave without pay and can document a loss  of income.

The program was canceled after it failed  financially. Through DOD\u2019s Unified Legislation and Budgeting process, the  Air Force has proposed that DOD establish a somewhat similar income  insurance program that addresses some of the problems associated with  the original program but not others.", "The original DOD program was initiated after concerns were raised  following the 1991 Persian Gulf War that income loss would adversely  affect retention of reservists. According to a 1991 DOD survey of reservists  activated during the Gulf War, economic loss was widespread across all  pay grades and military occupations. In response to congressional  direction, DOD in 1996 established the Ready Reserve Mobilization  Income Insurance Program, an optional, self-funded income insurance  program for members of the Ready Reserve ordered involuntarily to active  duty for more than 30 days. Reservists who elected to enroll could obtain  monthly coverage ranging from $500 to $5,000 for up to 12 months within  an 18-month period. Far fewer reservists than DOD expected enrolled in  the program. Many of those who enrolled were activated for duty in  Bosnia and, thus, entitled to almost immediate benefits from the program.  The program was terminated in 1997 after going bankrupt.", "We reported in 1997 that private sector insurers were not interested in  underwriting a reserve income mobilization insurance program due to  concerns about actuarial soundness and unpredictability of the frequency,  duration, and size of future call-ups. Certain coverage features violated  many of the principles private sector insurers usually require to protect  themselves from adverse selection. These features include voluntary  coverage and full self-funding by those insured, the absence of rates that  differentiated between participants based on their likelihood of  mobilization, the ability to choose coverage that could result in full  replacement of their lost income rather than those insured bearing some  loss, and the ability to obtain immediate coverage shortly before an  insured event occurs. DOD officials told us that private sector insurers  remain unsupportive of a new reserve income insurance mobilization  program and that the amount of federal financial commitment required for  the program is prohibitive. Thus, DOD has no plans to implement a new  mobilization insurance program.", "However, the Air Force has proposed that DOD establish a self-funded  income insurance program for reserve component members ordered  involuntarily to active duty for more than 30 days, or in support of forces  activated during a war declared by Congress or a period of national  emergency. The Air Force proposal attempts to address adverse selection,  low participation rates, and funding concerns that contributed to the  failure of the Ready Reserve Mobilization Income Insurance Program. For  instance, to address adverse selection and low participation rates, all  drilling unit members and individual mobilization augmentees would be  automatically enrolled in the program for $1,000 of monthly coverage with  the option to opt out. Individual Ready Reserve members would have the  option to enroll. To further mitigate adverse selection and funding  concerns, payments would not be made during the first 6 months of  enrollment in the program, regardless of mobilization or recall status. This  delay would allow funds to accrue for future payouts. Furthermore, DOD  would be able to suspend the annual enrollment open season during  national emergencies and periods of war that are declared by Congress.  Mandatory waiting periods for coverage to become effective would help  counter adverse selection that resulted when reservists with knowledge of  their imminent mobilization enrolled in the Ready Reserve Mobilization  Income Insurance Program. However, instituting waiting periods and  requiring mandatory participation still would not overcome financial  liability associated with large mobilizations. Even infrequent mobilizations  could produce a large number of claims. As a result, funding for the  program could be exhausted quickly. In 1998, the Congressional Research  Service estimated that if every Selected Reservist were enrolled for  coverage of $1,000 per month and paid premiums of $10 per month, the  fund would accumulate $9 million in income each month and $702 million  over 5 years, assuming that premiums were invested at a 10 percent  compound interest rate. A mobilization of 250,000 reservists would create  a monthly liability of $250 million, making the fund insolvent by the fourth  month of mobilization.", "The Air Force proposal does not completely address some of the problems  experienced with the prior program, including adverse selection, low  participation rates, proof of loss of income, and funding concerns. As  currently structured, the Air Force\u2019s proposed income insurance program  would not have graduated premiums that differentiate between  participants based on their likelihood of mobilization. However,  participants would be able to purchase additional coverage or opt out of  the program depending on their perceived risk of activation. Similar to the  Ready Reserve Mobilization Income Insurance Program, the Air Force\u2019s  proposed program is designed to be financed entirely by premiums paid by  individual members. DOD would need to assume responsibility for any  unfunded liability that may result from a larger than expected  mobilization. As a result, the Secretary of Defense would need to submit a  supplemental appropriation request.", "In addition, the Air Force\u2019s proposed income insurance program does not  require proof of loss of income. As designed, the program would pay  benefits based on the amount of coverage chosen by the reservists  regardless of actual losses incurred. Premium rates would be set for a  specified amount of insurance coverage. There is no provision to prevent  reservists from subscribing to amounts of coverage significantly greater  than their actual loss of income. To minimize the program\u2019s financial  liability, reservists could be required to document income loss when  submitting claims. However, verifying losses from self-owned businesses,  lost commissions or bonuses, or additional expenses could be difficult and  delay timely payment of benefits.", "Even if these design criteria were addressed, designing a financially sound  program may not be possible. There is no reliable way to estimate the  duration, number, and timing of future mobilizations and the number and  specialties of reservists that would be called up. DOD\u2019s increased reliance  on the reserve components in a changing and unpredictable world  situation makes projections of future call-ups exceedingly difficult. To be  financially sound, an insurance program, at a minimum, should have a  large eligible population of whom a large proportion are insured and the  proportion of those insured who file claims should be reasonably stable  over time. In addition, to be affordable, the majority of those insured will  not, in any period, incur the losses that they insure against.", "Furthermore, it is unclear whether reservists want or need an income  insurance program. Although the 2000 DOD survey indicated that an  estimated 41 percent of drilling unit members had losses in family income  when mobilized or deployed, it is unknown whether reservists would be  willing to participate in a new income insurance program. For example,  high premiums and a mandatory waiting period before becoming eligible  for payouts could discourage participation. A survey conducted before the  Ready Reserve Mobilization Income Insurance Program was implemented  showed that about 70 percent of enlisted members and 55 percent of  officers indicated interest in participating in such a program. The DOD  Office of the Actuary estimated that about 40 percent of reservists would  participate. However, only about 3 percent of Selected Reserve members  actually enrolled. The enrollment pattern indicated that reservists in  certain military specialties had a greater need or demand for income  protection. Of the approximate 5,500 military specialties in the reserve  components, about 1,930 (35 percent) had some reservists enrolled in the  program, including 420 military specialties that had enrollment levels of   10 percent or more. Although these 420 military specialties accounted for  less than 8 percent of the total military specialties within the reserve  components, they made up over 25 percent of the total reservists enrolled  in the program.

Of these 121 employers, 105 (88 percent) reported that they paid  the full heath care premium or the employer share of the health care  premium during the activation period. Of the 22 states we surveyed about  pay and benefit policies for their activated reserve employees, 13  (59 percent) reported that they paid the full health care premium or the  employer share of the health care premium. Most of these states provided  these benefits during the entire activation period.", "In our prior work, we found that many reservists who did drop their  civilian insurance and whose dependents did use TRICARE reported  difficulties moving into and out of the system, finding a TRICARE  provider, establishing eligibility, understanding TRICARE benefits, and  knowing where to go for assistance when questions and problems arose.  While reserve and active component beneficiaries report similar  difficulties using the TRICARE system, these difficulties are magnified for  reservists and their dependents. For example, 75 percent of reservists live  more than 50 miles from military treatment facilities, compared with   5 percent of active component families. As a result, access to care at  military treatment facilities becomes more challenging for dependents of  reservists than their active component counterparts.", "Reservists may also transition into and out of TRICARE several times  throughout a career. These transitions create additional challenges in  ensuring continuity of care, reestablishing eligibility in TRICARE, and  familiarizing or refamiliarizing themselves with the TRICARE system.  Reservists are also not part of the day-to-day military culture and,  according to DOD officials, generally have less incentive to become  familiar with TRICARE because it becomes important to them and their  families only if they are mobilized. Furthermore, when reservists are first  mobilized, they must accomplish many tasks in a compressed period. For  example, they must prepare for an extended absence from home, make  arrangements to be away from their civilian employment, obtain military  examinations, and ensure their families are properly registered in the  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DOD\u2019s database system  maintaining benefit eligibility status). It is not surprising that many  reservists, when placed under condensed time frames and high stress  conditions, experience difficulties when transitioning to TRICARE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Assessed the Need for or Ramifications of Expanding TRICARE to Reservists Not on Active Duty and Paying Health Insurance Premiums of Activated Reservists", "paragraphs": ["To further expand reservists and their family members\u2019 access to health  care, Congress is considering legislation to offer TRICARE to reservists  when they are not on active duty. The legislation would entitle members  of the Selected Reserve and certain members of the Individual Ready  Reserve and their dependents to the same TRICARE benefits as a  member of the uniformed services on active duty or a dependent of such a  member. An enlisted reservist enrolled in the TRICARE program would  pay an annual premium of $330 for self only coverage and $560 for self and  family coverage, while a reserve officer would pay an annual premium of  $380 for self only coverage and $610 for self and family coverage. (Military  personnel on active duty and family members of personnel on active duty  do not pay a premium for TRICARE coverage.) The legislation also would  require DOD to pay premium costs incurred by reservists who choose to  continue their civilian health care insurance coverage when activated.  DOD would cover the civilian insurance costs up to the total cost of the  reservist\u2019s premium and would be required to pay an amount equal to  TRICARE\u2019s average cost of providing TRICARE for self and family  coverage. Proponents have stated that the legislation (1) would recognize  an expansion of reserve roles and missions in recent years and an  increased demand placed on reservists and their families, (2) would assist  DOD in recruiting and retaining reservists, and (3) would help reservists  who opt to join TRICARE maintain continuity of their health care  coverage.", "We have a number of concerns with the proposal to extend TRICARE  coverage to reservists not on active duty and their family members and to  require DOD to pay premium costs incurred by reservists who choose to  continue their civilian health care insurance coverage when activated.  First, while there has been an expansion of reserve participation in  military operations, with a dramatic increase in mobilizations to support  operations in Iraq, many reservists have deployed only once or not at all.  According to the results of DOD\u2019s 2000 survey, only 25 percent of  reservists reported in 2000 that they had been mobilized or deployed. Of  those mobilized or deployed at least once, nearly 70 percent had  participated in only one operation. Since September 2001, DOD has called  300,000 reservists to active duty, representing one-fourth of the 1.2 million  reservists eligible for call-up. Second, DOD officials we spoke with about  the proposed legislation noted that DOD currently has not identified an  overall recruiting and retention problem in the reserves and that it was too  early to project the potential for future recruiting and retention problems  that might result from the ongoing mobilization. They also could not tell us  what effect the proposed legislation would have on the military\u2019s ability to  recruit and retain reservists. Third, as noted previously, most reservists  activated prior to 2001 achieved continuity of care for their families by  retaining civilian health insurance during activation. However, DOD  officials said that little is known about reservists\u2019 behavior patterns of  health care usage during mobilizations since September 2001 and that it is  difficult to project their behavior if the current proposal were approved.  According to a DOD official, it is unknown whether younger members of  the reserve force would purchase TRICARE health care coverage even at  reduced rates. In addition, a high percentage of reservists\u2019 civilian  employers who currently pay some or all of health care premiums for  reservists during activations could discontinue providing such assistance  if DOD makes this coverage available to reservists year-round.", "Other concerns with the proposed legislation have also been raised. DOD  officials said that creating greater uniformity of benefits between active  and reserve forces could have unanticipated effects on the active  component if active component members are enticed into leaving the  active component and joining the reserves. The OSD Health Affairs Policy  Director also noted that DOD could have difficulties tracking reservists\u2019  premium costs in order to pay these costs during activation as required by  the legislative proposal. Another concern is the stress that could be placed  upon the TRICARE system. Currently, TRICARE provides care for   8.7 million beneficiaries\u2014eligible active duty personnel, retirees, and  dependents. It is not clear to what extent reservists and their eligible  dependents would use TRICARE and the impact this could have on the  system. Beneficiary groups have described problems with access to care  from TRICARE civilian providers. In March 2003, we testified on DOD\u2019s  oversight of the TRICARE civilian provider network, noting the problems  with assessing the network\u2019s adequacy due to insufficient information.", "In addition, controlling rising health care costs is a major concern of  DOD\u2019s. According to a 2003 Congressional Budget Office analysis of   long-term defense spending, spending for military medical care, which  already makes up more than 10 percent of DOD\u2019s operation and support  costs, is the fastest growing category of operation and support spending.  In this projection of the administration\u2019s plans, annual medical spending  rises by 67 percent over the 2007-2020 period, from $33 billion to   $55 billion. Many of the same forces that cause national health  expenditures to rise\u2014an increase in the volume of health care services  available and expanded use of new, high-cost drugs and procedures\u2014 translate into higher military medical costs. In addition, retirees and their  dependents now make up a larger share of beneficiaries, increasing the  average age and costs of the people who receive health coverage through  DOD. Two reasons military medical costs are expected to rise dramatically  over the next 5 years are (1) new benefits for military retirees over age 65  (called TRICARE for Life), which had an actuarial liability estimated at  $592 billion as of September 30, 2001, and (2) a switch to an accrual  accounting system\u2014with DOD\u2019s budget being charged each year for the  expected costs of future benefits. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget for the  defense health program was $14.8 billion.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementing the  legislation\u2014 extending TRICARE coverage to reservists not on active duty  and their family members and requiring DOD to pay premium costs  incurred by reservists who choose to continue their civilian health care  insurance coverage when activated\u2014would cost a total of $466 million in  2004 and $7.3 billion over 2004-2008.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending TRICARE  coverage to reservists who are not on active duty would cost $393 million  in 2004 and $7.1 billion over 2004-2008. On the basis of DOD data, the  Congressional Budget Office estimated that the provision would apply to  760,000 reservists after excluding 120,000 who work for the federal  government. It also estimated that about 70 percent of qualified reservists  would opt to enroll in the TRICARE program.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that requiring DOD to pay  premium costs for continued civilian health care coverage during  activation would cost $73 million in 2004 and $155 million over 2004-2008.  According to this estimate, the amount DOD would pay reservists would  cover about 60 percent of the average civilian premium.", "DOD estimated that the cost of extending TRICARE coverage to reservists  who are not on active duty would be $5.1 billion per year. DOD\u2019s estimate  does not include the costs to pay the premiums of activated reservists\u2019  civilian health care. DOD\u2019s estimate is significantly higher than the  Congressional Budget Office estimate due to certain assumptions  concerning the number of potential beneficiaries, the proportion of  potential beneficiaries that would opt to enroll in TRICARE, and the per  capita costs of providing care. DOD officials told us that they used  historical cost profile data to develop their cost estimates. However, we  did not independently verify either the DOD or the Congressional Budget  Office cost estimate. Noting the high cost of this proposed legislation, the  Secretary of Defense has expressed opposition to this legislation, stating  he will recommend that the President veto the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 if a provision to expand TRICARE  is included."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD survey estimates showed income change varied considerably among  activated reservists, with a sizeable proportion of reservists experiencing  income loss, but more than half experiencing no change or a gain in  income. However, these data are questionable because it is unclear what  survey respondents considered as income loss or gain in determining their  financial status. For example, the number of reservists reporting income  loss could be lower if respondents did not include the sum of their military  pay\u2014 basic pay, special pays, allowances, and indirect compensation,  such as health care benefits. Currently, DOD cannot determine the need  for compensation programs to provide income protection to reservists  because it lacks sufficient information on the scope and nature of income  change experienced by activated reservists. More specifically, DOD lacks  sufficient data on the magnitude of income change, the causes of income  change, and the effects of income change on reservists\u2019 retention  decisions. Survey results showed that a higher percentage of reservists in  certain groups, such as self-employed reservists and health care  professionals, experienced greater income loss compared with reservists  overall and that, for some, income loss or the potential for income loss is a  significant factor in their decisions on whether to stay in the reserves. A  number of approaches to providing income protection have been  proposed, including an income insurance program, differential pay for  activated federal employee reservists, and special pay for certain reserve  physicians. Of these three, only the last is targeted at reservists who (1) fill  critical wartime specialties, (2) experience high degrees of income loss  when on active duty, and (3) demonstrate that income loss is a significant  factor in their retention decisions. This is the kind of business case  approach that we think is necessary to determine the need for income  protection compensation programs.", "In the area of family support, DOD and the military services have taken  steps to improve personal financial management programs. They have also  identified challenges such as increasing reservists\u2019 and spouses\u2019 awareness  of and access to personal financial management programs. However, they  have not developed specific plans to address these identified needs.  Further, while DOD has assessed the financial well-being of active duty  members and linked financial well-being with mission readiness, it has not  conducted similar assessments of the reserve force. Our review of DOD  survey data showed that reservists reported having many of the same  financial problems as their active duty counterparts. For instance, a higher  percentage of reservists reported having such financial difficulties as  bouncing checks and receiving a letter of indebtedness than have their  active duty counterparts. Conducting these assessments would provide a  better understanding of financial difficulties reservists encounter and the  impact these difficulties have on mission readiness.", "Recent improvements have been made to reservists and their families\u2019  access to TRICARE when the member is activated. In past military  operations, most activated reservists retained civilian health care  insurance coverage for their families during the activation period.

Furthermore, the  legislation would require DOD to pay premium costs incurred by reservists  who choose to continue civilian health care insurance coverage when  activated. While proponents have cited a number of reasons for this  legislation, concerns have also been raised. We believe these concerns  may outweigh the perceived benefits and costs of the legislation.  Currently, DOD lacks sufficient information to determine the need for the  expanded health care benefits offered in the legislation and the  implications of the proposal for reservists, active duty members, and the  military health care system. DOD officials further stated that currently no  problem has been demonstrated in overall reserve recruiting and  retention. DOD has not yet identified problems reservists and their  families have experienced with access to health care during mobilizations  since September 11, 2001, such as problems in maintaining continuity of  health care; the causes of these problems; and their effects on readiness,  recruiting, and retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to determine the need for  compensation programs aimed at addressing reservists\u2019 income loss  during periods of active duty by obtaining more complete information on  the magnitude of income change, the causes of income change, and the  effects of income change on reserve retention.

At least $850,000 went to about 900 reservists for  emergency travel assistance, vehicle repairs, rent or mortgage assistance,  and as an income supplement while waiting for delayed military pay when  called to active duty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Selected States\u2019 Policies on Compensation for Activated Employees", "paragraphs": ["This appendix displays the results of our survey of 22 states to obtain their  policies regarding pay and benefits offered to state employees who are  called to federal active duty. It describes the military leave policies and  financial assistance programs such as state pay differentials for activated  state employees who experience income loss as a result of federal  activation. It also describes each state\u2019s policy on the continuation of  dependent health care coverage and other reported benefits. To determine  the 22 states, we chose the 11 states with the highest total population of  reservists in the state, the 5 states with the smallest total reservist  population, and 6 states in the middle. We conducted our survey of the   22 states between April and July 2003.", "In summary, we found that 19 of the 22 states surveyed offer pay  differentials to employees who are on military leave without pay and can  document a loss of income. Of these 19 states, 16 are mandated under  state law or executive order to provide financial assistance, while   3 states\u2014Colorado, Georgia, and Texas\u2014allow the individual state  agencies to offer pay differentials at the agencies\u2019 discretion. The other  three states do not offer pay differentials to activated employees on  unpaid leave. The manner in which states calculate the amount of the pay  differential varies. For example, 7 states calculate the amount of the pay  differential as the difference between an employee\u2019s civilian salary and  basic military pay, not including military special pays and allowances. In  contrast, 10 states include military special pays, allowances, or both in the  calculation, which can lower the differential amount that the state pays to  its activated employees. Georgia allows state agencies to formulate their  own differential calculation, while Pennsylvania offers a flat rate monthly  stipend to all activated employees. States offering financial assistance do  so for a period of time ranging from 90 days in Colorado to the duration of  the activation in states like Florida and Alabama. We did not find a  correlation between the size of a state\u2019s reservist population and the type  or extent of financial assistance the state offers.

Based on spouses\u2019 self-reported feelings of being prepared or  unprepared upon receiving a notice of activation for the military member,  we compared their responses to questions concerning preactivation  activities\u2014volunteering or participating in unit family readiness programs  or groups, attending preactivation briefings, receiving preactivation  materials. We also compared their responses to questions concerning  other factors that could affect preparedness, such as being assigned a  military point of contact and the amount of advance notice received prior  to activation. Finally, we compared their responses to a question  concerning how well they have coped with the activation.
