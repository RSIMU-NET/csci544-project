However, until  DHS and its sector partners develop appropriate outcome-oriented  metrics, it will be difficult to gauge the effectiveness of efforts to protect  the nation\u2019s core and access communications networks and critical  support components of the Internet from cyber incidents. While no cyber  incidents have been reported affecting the nation\u2019s core and access  networks, communications networks operators can use reporting  mechanisms established by FCC and DHS to share information on  outages and incidents.", "The pilot programs undertaken by DOD with its defense industrial base  partners exhibit several attributes that could apply to the communications  sector and help private sector entities more effectively secure the  communications infrastructure they own and operate.

Our audit  focused on the core and access networks of the communication network.  These networks include wireline, wireless, cable, and satellite. We did not  address broadcast access networks because they are responsible for a  smaller volume of traffic than other networks. Additionally, we focused on  the Internet support components that are critical for delivering services:  the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Domain Name System (DNS).", "To identify the roles of federal entities, we collected, reviewed, and  analyzed relevant federal law, policy, regulation, and critical infrastructure  protection-related strategies. Sources consulted include statutes such as  the Communications Act of 1934, Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the  Defense Production Act of 1950, as well as other public laws; the Code of  Federal Regulations; National Communication System Directive 3-10; the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan; the Communications Sector- Specific Plan; the Information Technology Sector-Specific Plan; the  Communications Sector Risk Assessment; the Information Technology  Sector Risk Assessment; Homeland Security Presidential Directives;  selected executive orders; and related GAO products. Using these  materials, we selected the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and  Homeland Security, and FCC to review their respective roles and actions  related to the security of the privately owned communications network  because they were identified as having the most significant roles and  organizations for addressing communications cybersecurity.", "To identify the actions taken by federal entities we collected, reviewed,  and analyzed relevant policies, plans, reports, and related performance  metrics and interviewed officials at each of the four agencies. For  example, we reviewed and analyzed Department of Commerce  agreements detailing the process for how changes are to be made to the  authoritative root zone file and Internet Policy Task Force reports on  cybersecurity innovation and the Internet. In addition, we analyzed and  identified current and planned actions outlined in DOD\u2019s National  Security/Emergency Preparedness Executive Committee Charter. Also,  we analyzed reports issued by the Communications Security, Reliability,  and Interoperability Council on a variety of issues, including the security  of the Domain Name System and the Border Gateway Protocol. Further,  we reviewed and analyzed the risk assessments and sector-specific plans  for both the communications and information technology critical  infrastructure sectors, as well DHS\u2019s plans for realignment in response to  Executive Order 13618.", "In addition, we interviewed agency officials regarding authority, roles,  policies, and actions created by their department or agency, and actions  taken by their departments and agencies to encourage or enhance the  protection of communications networks, BGP, and DNS, and fulfill related  roles. For Commerce, we interviewed officials from the Bureau of Industry  and Security, National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  For DOD, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Chief Information  Officer, including those from the National Leadership Command  Capability Management Office and the Trusted Mission Systems and  Networks Office. We also interviewed officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. For DHS, we interviewed officials  from the National Protection and Programs Directorate\u2019s Office of  Cybersecurity and Communications. For FCC, we interviewed officials  from the International, Media, Public Safety and Homeland Security,  Wireless Telecommunications, and Wireline Competition Bureaus. Based  on our analysis and the information gathered through interviews, we  created a list of actions taken by each agency. Additionally, we reviewed  documents (including the communications sector risk assessment) from  and conducted interviews with officials from the Communications  Information Sharing and Analysis Center to assess federal efforts to fulfill  roles and responsibilities.", "To assess what is known about the extent to which cyber-incidents  affecting the communications networks have been reported to FCC and  DHS, we analyzed FCC policy and guidance related to its Network  Outage Reporting System. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of  outage reports submitted from January 2010 to October 2012 to  determine the extent to which they were related to cybersecurity threats,  such as botnets, spyware, viruses, and worms affecting the core and  access networks. To assess the reliability of FCC outage reports, we (1)  discussed data quality control procedures with agency officials, (2)  reviewed relevant documentation, (3) performed testing for obvious  problems with completeness or accuracy, and (4) reviewed related  internal controls. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. We also interviewed officials from FCC\u2019s  Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau to understand incident  reporting practices of its regulated entities, and how reported incident  data were used by FCC to encourage improvement or initiate  enforcement actions. Further, we interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s United  States Computer Emergency Readiness Team regarding the extent to  which incidents were reported to it that affected core and access  communications networks. We also conducted an analysis of information  security reports from nonfederal entities, to determine if cyber incidents  on the core and access communications networks had been reported to  nonfederal entities. Additionally, we interviewed Communications  Information Sharing and Analysis Center officials to identify the  mechanisms and processes used to report cyber-related incidents in the  communications sector to the center and then to the federal government.", "To determine if DOD\u2019s pilot can be used to inform the communications  sector, we reviewed our August 2012 report on DOD efforts to enhance  the cybersecurity of the defense industrial base critical infrastructure  sector. We then identified and summarized attributes of the program that  could be publicly reported and that were potentially applicable to the  communications sector. The information used to compile the attributes  from the August 2012 report was determined by DOD at that time not to  be considered official use only. We also interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s  Office of Cybersecurity and Communications to ascertain the current  status of the pilot programs and efforts to determine the applicability of  the pilots to all critical infrastructures, including the communications  sector.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
