These controls and processes are to be used for reviewing agencies' implementation plans and monitoring agencies' progress against these plans. In addition, as of July 2016, OMB had not determined the complete population of agencies that are required to report spending data under the DATA Act and submit implementation plans to OMB. OMB staff stated that their purpose for directing agencies to submit implementation plans was to use the implementation cost estimates to assist them in formulating the fiscal year 2017 budget, while Treasury officials stated that the purpose of their review of the plans was to facilitate discussions with the agencies. In addition, OMB and Treasury staff initially informed GAO that they were not going to request that agencies submit updated implementation plans that considered new technical requirements and guidance that was released on April 29, 2016. However, on June 15, 2016, OMB requested updated implementation plans by August 12, 2016, but only from Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies. Lacking fully documented controls and processes as well as a complete population of agencies that are required to report under the DATA Act increases the risk that the purposes and benefits of the DATA Act may not be fully achieved, and could result in incomplete spending data being reported. Further, without updated implementation plans, including revised timelines and milestones, cost estimates, and risks that reflect the impacts of new technical requirements and guidance, from all agencies that are required to report under the DATA Act, OMB and Treasury may not have the information needed to assist them in properly monitoring resource needs and agencies' progress in implementing new requirements government-wide.", "Based on OMB and Treasury guidance, GAO identified 51 plan elements in four separate categories\u2014timeline, cost estimate, narrative, and project plan\u2014to be included in agency implementation plans. None of the 42 implementation plans GAO received and reviewed contained all 51 plan elements described in OMB and Treasury guidance. For example, many agencies' cost estimates did not provide all the elements for cost estimates, including total work years and a list of assumptions, or did not differentiate between their business process costs and technology costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB, in collaboration with Treasury, determine the population of agencies required to report under the DATA Act, establish fully documented controls and processes to help ensure agencies' effective implementation of the DATA Act, and request updated plans from non-CFO Act agencies.

Among other things, the DATA  Act expands the required federal spending information reported online by  agencies; mandates that the information appear in a form that is both  searchable and downloadable; requires the establishment of data  standards to generate uniform agency data that are consistent and  comparable; and directs agency inspectors general (IG) and GAO to  report on agencies\u2019 implementation and use of data standards as well as  the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of federal spending  data submitted. The DATA Act identifies the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) as the two  agencies responsible for establishing data standards and issuing related  guidance, and therefore they are responsible for leading government- wide implementation of the act.

Given the challenges associated with efforts to  improve the quality and completeness of federal spending data reported  by agencies, which are discussed further in this report, it is crucial that  oversight and monitoring of DATA Act implementation be undertaken in a  formal and organized manner.", "We and the Treasury IG have previously reported on OMB\u2019s and  Treasury\u2019s efforts to implement the requirements of the DATA Act. We  reported that OMB and Treasury have made progress in developing a  governance framework that includes structures for both project  management and data governance. In May 2015, the Treasury IG  reported on Treasury\u2019s project management practices and raised a  number of issues that the IG believes could hinder the effective  implementation of the act if not addressed. In addition, we reported on  OMB\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s steps taken to establish a governance process for  developing data standards. We recommended that OMB and Treasury  establish a set of clear policies and processes for developing and  maintaining data standards that are consistent with leading practices for  data governance, but our recommendation has yet to be fully addressed.  We have also previously reported on persistent challenges involving  efforts to improve the quality and completeness of federal spending data  reported by agencies to USAspending.gov, a free, publicly accessible  website containing data on federal contract, grant, loan, and other  financial assistance awards. In that report, we recommended that the  Director of OMB (1) clarify guidance on reporting and maintaining records  of award information and (2) develop and implement oversight processes  to ensure that award data are consistent with agency records.

We did not receive implementation plans from the  remaining 9 agencies because they (1) had determined the DATA Act  was not applicable to them, (2) did not prepare plans because they were  using or relying on their shared service providers\u2019 implementation plans,  or (3) had not completed and submitted their plans to OMB yet. We did  not validate the agencies\u2019 determination that the DATA Act was not  applicable to them or review shared service providers\u2019 implementation  plans because it was not within the scope of this review. We reviewed the  42 implementation plans we received and assessed them against 51 plan  elements described in OMB and Treasury guidance. We also analyzed  the OMB and Treasury guidance to agencies on preparing  implementation plans and found it generally consistent with the PMBOK\u00ae  Guide.

We determined that the average inclusion  rate across the 11 plan elements of the timeline category was 74 percent.", "Of the four categories, the project plan category had the lowest average  inclusion rate.", "As shown in table 3, the 5 plan elements most often included in agency  implementation plans were related to milestone dates, tasks, and  changes to information technology systems (in the timeline category) and  information on conducting an inventory of agency data (in the narrative  category).", "As shown in table 4, the 5 plan elements that were most often not  included in agency implementation plans were information on resource  needs and dependencies (in the project plan category), information on  which steps can be or have been done with existing resources (in the cost  estimate category), notation on the project plan of which steps require  OMB and Treasury action (in the project plan category), and information  relating to procedures for verifying the completeness of data submitted to  Treasury (in the narrative category). OMB guidance also requested that  agencies report cost savings, if any. However, our review of the  implementation plans found that no agencies reported cost savings.", "In our review of the 42 agency implementation plans, we found that the  amount of information varied based on whether the agency was a CFO  Act agency and whether the agency referred to a shared service  provider. For example, we found that CFO Act agency plans were  generally more complete than non-CFO Act agency plans, which  highlights the importance of obtaining updated implementation plans from  non-CFO Act agencies, as previously discussed. Table 5 shows  differences between the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 and the 18 non-CFO Act  agencies\u2019 implementation plans in their average inclusion rates across the  four categories of DATA Act implementation plan elements.", "We also found that less information was provided in the plans for  agencies that indicated they used a shared service provider than for  those agencies that did not indicate they used a shared service provider.  Agencies that indicated they used a shared service provider often made  reference to their shared service provider\u2019s implementation plan instead  of identifying what steps the agency would take for a particular plan  element to implement the DATA Act. Of the 42 agency implementation  plans we reviewed, we found there were 26 agencies that did not make  reference to using shared service providers and 16 agencies that referred  to using a shared service provider for implementation. Table 6 shows that  the average inclusion rate among agencies not referencing use of a  shared service provider was higher for all four categories than among  those agencies that referenced using a shared service provider.", "Given the lack of consistent and complete agency implementation plans,  it may be difficult for OMB and Treasury to determine whether agencies  will be able to implement the data standards finalized by OMB and  Treasury in August 2015.

In addition, as of July 2016, OMB had not yet  determined the complete population of federal agencies that are required  to report spending data under the DATA Act and only requested that CFO  Act agencies submit updated implementation plans to OMB. As a result,  OMB and Treasury may not be fully informed of government-wide issues  or concerns, which may impair their ability to help ensure that all agencies  have the full range of resources and guidance needed to fully achieve the  purposes and benefits of the DATA Act. In addition, without updated  implementation plans from all agencies required to report under the DATA  Act that reflect the impacts of new technical requirements and guidance  on timelines and milestones, cost estimates, and risks, OMB and  Treasury may not have complete information to properly monitor resource  needs and progress in implementing new requirements government-wide.

OMB agreed that a  more formalized process should be established for reviewing agency  updates to implementation plans and stated that it would work to  systematically report on the contents of the implementation plan updates.  However, we are still concerned about OMB focusing primarily on the 24  CFO Act agencies. In its response, OMB reiterated its view that because  the 24 CFO Act agencies represent over 90 percent of federal spending,  they provide OMB with the visibility needed to address significant  implementation challenges. We recognize that the CFO Act agencies  represent the majority of federal spending, but as we discussed in this  report, the DATA Act is a government-wide initiative requiring full  reporting of all federal spending.

We also made inquiries about their actions taken  in response to the issues identified and the extent to which their reviews  assist agencies in implementing the DATA Act. Further, we reviewed  examples Treasury provided to us of correspondence between Treasury  and agencies discussing feedback on agency implementation plans. We  had discussions with OMB and Treasury officials to determine if there  were any updates or revisions to agencies\u2019 implementation plans or  implementation status reports. We used Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government and the Project Management Institute\u2019s A Guide  to The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide) to  assess OMB\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s processes and controls that were in place  from November 2015 through July 2016.", "For our second objective, we requested agencies\u2019 DATA Act  implementation plans from OMB and, at OMB\u2019s request, requested them  directly from 51 agencies that we identified based primarily on a listing of  agencies in an OMB information system used to support OMB\u2019s federal  management and budget processes. The 51 agencies we identified  included the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies, 13 other  agencies significant to the Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Report of the  United States Government, and 14 smaller federal agencies. However,  we note that the 51 agencies we identified may not be all of the agencies  required to report under the DATA Act. We received plans from 42 of  these agencies; 9 agencies did not submit their plans for various reasons  (see table 8).

Based on this guidance and the  PMBOK\u00ae Guide, we identified 51 specific plan elements for inclusion in  an agency\u2019s implementation plan if it was prepared in accordance with the  guidance. The 51 plan elements were grouped into four separate  categories: (1) timeline, (2) cost estimate, (3) narrative, and (4) project  plan. According to OMB\u2019s DATA Act Implementation Plans Guidance,  agencies\u2019 implementation plans should consist of multiple parts: (1) a  timeline of tasks and steps toward implementing the requirements of  OMB Memorandum M-15-12; (2) an estimate of costs to implement these  tasks and steps; (3) a detailed narrative that explains the required steps  the agency will take to implement the DATA Act, identifies the underlying  assumptions, and outlines the potential difficulties and risks to  successfully implement the plan; and (4) a detailed project plan that  agencies will develop over time. See appendix II for a list of the 51 plan  elements. We did not evaluate the quality of the information provided in  the agencies\u2019 plans, such as whether the implementation plan steps were  sufficient to achieve successful implementation by the agencies, as this  was outside the scope of this review. We reviewed OMB and Treasury  guidance to agencies on preparing DATA Act implementation plans,  assessed it against the PMBOK\u00ae Guide, and found that it was generally  consistent.

Of the 31 agencies reporting challenges in their  implementation plans, 23 reported competing statutory, regulatory, or  policy priorities that could potentially affect DATA Act implementation.  One competing priority certain agencies reported is meeting the  requirements of OMB Circular No. A-11, which provides agencies with  guidance on the budget process, including how to prepare and submit  required materials for budget preparation and execution. For example,  requirements on \u201cobject class\u201d and \u201cprogram activity\u201d reporting create  competing priorities both for the agency\u2019s software vendors and for the  agency\u2019s internal resources.

The agency added that its ability to engage  effectively on the DATA Act requirements while working to implement the  Another competing priority some agencies reported is the data  requirement set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Specifically, in October 2014 the FAR was amended to standardize the  format of the Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) that must be in  effect for new awards issued beginning in October 2017. The PIID must  be used to identify all solicitation and contract actions, and agencies must  ensure that each PIID used is unique government-wide for at least 20  years from the date of the contract award. Some agencies reported that  they were concerned about the amount of effort involved in also  implementing the PIID for the DATA Act. For example, one agency noted  that it had implemented a standard PIID and developed processes and  systems to handle the new identifiers to meet the FAR requirements, but  the extent of any changes necessary to implement the PIID for the DATA  Act, which also requires a unique identifier, is unknown. Another agency  noted that this initiative and other agency initiatives will compete for many  of the same resources, including subject matter experts.", "Systems integration. Systems integration is another challenge reported by  23 agencies in their implementation plans. Some agencies noted  concerns about their systems\u2019 ability to obtain and easily submit to the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) all the data elements needed to  implement the DATA Act, including the requirement to establish a unique  award identification number. For example, one agency reported that it  does not have a systematic link to pull data from multiple systems by a  unique award ID and it does not have an automated grants management  system because the agency noted that it reports grants data manually  using spreadsheets. This agency noted that it needs to replace its  financial system and modify supporting systems to fully comply with the  DATA Act. Another agency noted that five of the required data elements  are not included in its procurement and financial assistance system. As a  result, the agency noted that it will have to modify its system\u2019s software to  include these elements in order to comply with the DATA Act. These  statements from agency implementation plans indicate that given the vast  number and complexity of systems government-wide that are potentially  involved in DATA Act implementation efforts, agencies may face a variety  of challenges related to systems integration.", "Resources. Limited resources are another concern reported by 22  agencies in their implementation plans. Agencies frequently identified  funding and human resources as needs for efficient and effective  implementation. For example, one agency noted that the execution of its  implementation plan greatly depends on its receiving the requisite funding  and human resources as estimated in the plan, and the agency added  that delays in securing additional resources for fiscal years 2016, 2017,  and beyond will have a direct impact on its DATA Act implementation and  schedule. Similarly, another agency pointed out that having insufficient  funds for contractor support, managing the overall implementation, testing  interfaces between systems, and addressing data mapping issues will  pose a challenge for its components and systems.", "Some agencies also reported that human resources are key to successful  DATA Act implementation. One agency reported that it is concerned  about the adequacy of its human resources, which could impair its ability  to comply with changes or additional DATA Act requirements. In addition,  the agency added that this may prevent it from being able to address any  deficiencies in its data and operations. Specifically, the agency reported  that resources are required for project management, data analysis, data  management, and training for financial inquiry and analysis. The need for  subject matter experts, such as data architects, was raised as a challenge  by another agency. Furthermore, one agency noted that the need to  share limited resources for DATA Act implementation with other  operational activities presents a significant challenge for its  implementation strategy.", "Guidance. In their implementation plans, 19 agencies reported the lack of  adequate guidance as a challenge to implementing the DATA Act.  Several agencies noted that they cannot fully determine how their  policies, business processes, and systems should be modified to support  DATA Act reporting because, in their view, OMB and Treasury have not  yet issued complete, detailed, finalized DATA Act implementation  guidance on required data elements, the technical schema, and other key  policies. According to these agencies, issuance of such guidance is part  of the critical path to meeting their implementation goals. For example,  one agency noted that its implementation plan greatly depends on  Treasury developing the technical schema for DATA Act implementation.  The agency also reported that any delays or changes to Treasury  requirements in the technical schema will significantly affect the agency\u2019s  solution design, development and testing schedule, and cost estimate.  Another agency included a list of unanswered questions in its  implementation plan that it wanted OMB to address in its guidance related  to the time frames, various technical requirements, level of reporting,  linking systems, and tracking and reconciling data.", "Dependencies. Eighteen agencies reported in their implementation plans  that the completion of certain implementation activities is subject to  actions or issues that must be addressed by OMB and Treasury in order  for the agencies to effectively implement the DATA Act. Some agencies  also noted that they were relying on their shared service providers\u2019  implementation of the DATA Act for agency compliance with the act. For  example, one agency noted that it will rely on its shared service provider  to enhance its system, but funding may be restricted to enhance a system  that the agency does not own. Another key dependency noted in one  agency\u2019s implementation plan is the need for Treasury to provide detailed  information or requirements regarding the data formats, validation  module, error correction and resubmission process, and testing schedule.  Without this information, the agency noted that it cannot provide complete  cost estimates, determine changes to system and business processes,  and determine the level of effort and resources required to develop the  data submissions.", "Time frames. In their implementation plans, 16 agencies reported time  constraints as a challenge in implementing the DATA Act. For example,  one agency noted that the time frame to get everything done indicated in  the original guidance coupled with the complexity of the known issues  makes it highly unlikely that its DATA Act initiative will stay on target. The  agency also noted that there is no mitigation strategy for meeting the  expected deadline on all aspects of the reporting because even if all tasks  were worked concurrently, the schedule is not attainable for the agency.  Another agency noted that its current reporting of award and awardee  information to USAspending.gov is in accordance with the Federal  Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. This information is  reported 3 days after the award is made for contracts and bimonthly for  financial assistance, while the DATA Act requires reporting of account- level information monthly where practicable but not less than quarterly.  This agency noted that linking financial information with nonfinancial  information that is reported with a different frequency creates a \u201cmoving  target\u201d and poses a challenge to linking the financial and nonfinancial  data.", "Other challenges. Agencies reported several other challenges in their  implementation plans less frequently than the ones listed above. For  example, a few agencies reported challenges related to the overall  policies, procedures, and processes, such as governance, risk  management, and training. Some agencies also noted challenges related  to the level of detail required in DATA Act information differing from  existing financial reporting processes, including the ability to reconcile  information and data to sources and official records. Finally, agencies  reported concerns about the quality and integrity of data in underlying  agency systems and its effect on DATA Act reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigating Strategies Reported by Agencies in Their DATA Act Implementation Plans", "paragraphs": ["Leveraging existing resources. To effectively use limited resources, some  agencies noted in their implementation plans the importance of leveraging  available systems and human resources by reassigning staff, using  subject matter experts, and multitasking when possible to maximize  efficiency. For example, one agency reported that it will leverage senior  executive support to make the DATA Act implementation a priority and  see what resources might be available in the \u201cleast expected places,\u201d as  well as work on tasks concurrently. In addition, agencies reported the  need to update systems to encompass more data elements and  streamline reporting. For example, one agency reported that it plans to  designate a Chief Data Officer to oversee a multitiered review of agency  data and implement solutions for consolidating agency data.", "Communication and information sharing. In their implementation plans,  some agencies reported the need for frequent communication with OMB,  Treasury, shared service providers, vendors, and other agencies in order  to keep one another updated on their implementation activities, as well as  to share best practices and lessons learned throughout the process.  Agencies also suggested that reviewing other agencies\u2019 implementation  plans for best practices, common challenges, and solutions would  facilitate information sharing. For example, one agency pointed out that in  its view lines of communication between Treasury and the agencies must  be transparent to help ensure that the submission of financial data is  accurate and the process for submitting them runs smoothly. Another  agency noted that it believes that collaboration with other agencies to  share common concerns will be beneficial.", "Process and policy review/adaptation. In order to implement the DATA  Act, agencies also plan to review and adapt their current processes and  policies in order to incorporate the act\u2019s requirements. For example, one  agency noted in its plan that it will develop a continuous process to  analyze, plan, track, and control potential risks throughout DATA Act  implementation. Another agency noted that it plans to align the  implementation schedules for its system upgrades as closely as possible.  In its plan, the agency pointed out that performing testing, independent  validation and verification, and other tasks at the same time for both  projects will save time. The agency\u2019s plan also noted that this strategy will  minimize the burden on both agency and contractor personnel while  keeping them on track to meet the required completion dates.  Furthermore, agencies reported that they will conduct reviews of their  business processes and procedures to find gaps and help ensure that  submitted data are complete and accurate. For example, an agency  noted in its plan that it will conduct reconciliations to review the data  processed and ensure that the submitted data match the supporting  documentation.", "Utilizing external resources. Agencies noted plans to use external  resources in implementing the DATA Act. For example, several agencies\u2019  plans noted that they plan to work closely with their shared service  providers throughout the implementation process. One agency also noted  that it will hire a contractor to assess cost and risk management  procedures to determine their alignment with leading practices. Another  agency noted that it intends to leverage access to external working  groups for addressing concerns as well as decision making. Finally, one  agency discussed the need to replace its current financial system in order  to comply with DATA Act requirements.", "Monitoring and developing guidance. In their implementation plans,  agencies also discussed plans to closely monitor DATA Act  implementation guidance in order to adapt agency implementation  strategies as the guidance changes. For example, one agency noted that  it will monitor and evaluate the release of DATA Act guidance as well as  data elements and the technical schema in order to identify the effect on  the project. Another agency noted that it plans to use its established  governance structure to immediately facilitate solutions when additional  guidance is provided. Further, some agencies discussed developing  guidance and training materials for internal use. For example, one agency  stated that it plans to create a common set of tools by establishing a  \u201cproject management toolkit\u201d for agency leaders to ensure that DATA Act  implementation needs are addressed efficiently and effectively.", "Technical solutions. Some agencies plan to utilize various technical  solutions as part of their DATA Act implementation plans. For example,  one agency noted in its plan that it will leverage existing technologies and  processes available to extract, transform, load, and build on established  and successful mappings and minimize cost and schedule impacts.  Another agency\u2019s plan noted that it may use an interface file that contains  both the award ID and the document number used in its financial system  to crosswalk between the financial detail and the award ID in its systems.
