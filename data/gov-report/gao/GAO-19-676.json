According to USCIS officials, the self-petition program is vulnerable to fraud, such as self-petitioners' use of false or forged documents. USCIS has adopted some, but not all, of the leading practices in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. While USCIS has established a culture and a dedicated entity to manage fraud risks for the program, it has not fully assessed fraud risks and determined a fraud risk profile to document its analysis of the types of fraud risks the program could be vulnerable to. Further, the number of self-petitions filed has grown by more than 70 percent over the past 5 fiscal years. At the end of fiscal year 2018, USCIS had received 12,801 self-petitions and had over 19,000 self-petitions pending adjudication. Planning and conducting regular fraud risk assessments would better position USCIS to identify fraud risks when reviewing self-petitions. USCIS has instituted some fraud controls, such as developing antifraud training for self-petition adjudicators, but has not developed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy based on a fraud risk assessment.

The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the  Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 and subsequent  reauthorizations, provides for immigration relief for self-petitioning foreign  nationals who are victims of battery or extreme cruelty committed by their  U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent or their adult U.S. citizen son or  daughter (self-petition program or process). Such foreign nationals  claiming to have suffered domestic abuse may self-petition for  classification as an immigrant, and ultimately apply for lawful permanent  resident status. The decision by the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to approve a VAWA self-petition is a consequential one, as the  program allows a victim to seek relief independent of their abuser. If the  self-petition is approved, a foreign national has established that he or she  is a qualifying victim of domestic abuse, and will generally not be subject  to immigration enforcement as he or she goes through the process of  obtaining work authorization and LPR status. According to DHS\u2019s Office  for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), VAWA self-petition relief brings  safety, security, and stability to legitimate victims who might not otherwise  be able to escape domestic abuse.

If the self-petitioner has  not submitted evidence to address each of the eligibility requirements,  USCIS policy directs the service center to issue a request for evidence to  the self-petitioner to provide additional evidence for the full adjudication of  the petition. In addition, the service center conducts a safe address  assessment on the self-petition to identify the address to be used for  future communications with the self-petitioner to protect the self- petitioner\u2019s confidentiality and safety. Finally, the service center\u2019s  Background Check Unit uses the TECS database to determine whether  the self-petitioner is connected to any administrative or criminal  investigations, is the subject of a national security concern, or is a public  safety threat.

If a USCIS adjudicator determines that the evidence  submitted by the self-petitioner satisfies the eligibility requirements  noted above, the self-petition is approved. Once USCIS approves a  self-petition, DHS will generally defer any removal action against the  individual, as he or she goes through the process of applying for LPR  status.

Self-petitioners who obtain LPR status are not eligible  for U.S. citizenship until they have been an LPR in the United States  for at least 3 years.", "Deny. An adjudicator may deny a self-petition if the petitioner has not  demonstrated that he or she is more likely than not eligible for petition  approval, considering all credible evidence provided by the self- petitioner. In some circumstances, an adjudicator will issue a  request for evidence to the petitioner to provide an opportunity for the  petitioner to send additional information or documents. In response to  this request, the petitioner has an opportunity to provide additional  evidence; if that evidence does not sufficiently demonstrate that the  petitioner meets the eligibility requirements, or additional evidence is  not provided, USCIS may deny the self-petition. In other  circumstances, an adjudicator will issue a notice of intent to deny to  the self-petitioner in cases where it does not appear likely that the  self-petitioner could overcome the deficiencies. This provides the self- petitioner an opportunity to respond. If the self-petitioner\u2019s response  does not sufficiently demonstrate that the petitioner meets the  eligibility requirements or a response is not provided, the self-petition  is subsequently denied. An adjudicator may also deny a self-petition if  the petitioner abandons his or her self-petition or withdraws the self- petition by providing notice to USCIS in writing. According to USCIS  data, among self-petitions adjudicated from fiscal year 2009 through  fiscal year 2018, about 28 percent were denied.

For example, officials at the Vermont Service Center stated that VAWA  self-petition unit adjudicators and CFDO immigration officers collaborate  and share information to combat potential fraud through activities that  include monthly meetings, regular contact through their co-location, and  an electronic bulletin board. Officials stated that during monthly meetings,  immigration officers answer questions from adjudicators on fraudulent  schemes and activities uncovered in their administrative investigations of  self-petitions.

USCIS\u2019s  specific fraud control activities include, for example, the Vermont Service  Center Background Check Unit conducting TECS checks on foreign  nationals who submit self-petitions during the pre-adjudication stage to  determine whether the self-petitioner is connected to any administrative  or criminal investigations, is the subject of a national security concern, or  is a public safety threat. In addition, USCIS has a process for adjudicators  to refer petitions when they suspect fraudulent activities to CFDO for  administrative investigation. Specifically, USCIS official stated that in  cases where an adjudicator suspects potential fraud in a self-petition, the  adjudicator is to complete and submit a supervisor-approved fraud  referral sheet to CFDO. After receiving a referral, the center is to  determine whether the referral has sufficient information to warrant an  administrative investigation. CFDO also provides fraud training to  adjudicators.", "While these controls help USCIS prevent and detect potential fraud in the  self-petition program, USCIS has not developed and implemented a risk- based antifraud strategy based on a fraud risk assessment as provided  under the Fraud Risk Framework. This is because, as noted earlier, the  agency has not undertaken an assessment of inherent program fraud  risks. USCIS officials told us that even with adjudicator and CFDO staff  experience with identifying and investigating potential fraud in self- petitions, unknown fraud risks may nevertheless remain. USCIS officials  acknowledged the benefits of conducting a fraud risk assessment, such  as designing and implementing new control activities, as well as revising  existing controls, if they determine that controls are not effectively  designed to reduce the likelihood or impact of an inherent fraud risk to a  tolerable level. USCIS officials told us that adjudicators and CFDO staff  conducting administrative investigations have identified trends in  fraudulent activities; however, officials also stated that it is difficult for staff  to identify fraud risks that are present but that are not identified through  adjudication or investigation.

Increasing fraud awareness can also enable  managers and employees to better detect potential fraud. To achieve  these benefits, the Fraud Risk Framework notes that a leading practice is  to require all employees to attend training upon hiring and on an ongoing  basis thereafter. Training should convey fraud-specific information that is  tailored to the program and its fraud risk profile.

According to CFDO  officials, USCIS provides general training to new adjudicators during a 6- day classroom training program. During this training, new adjudicators are  instructed on eligibility and evidence requirements across several  application types, including the VAWA self-petition. The training includes  information on eligibility requirements, supporting documentation needed,  and evidentiary requirements for these applications. Application forms are  used to teach adjudicators fraud identification, and adjudicators are given  a list of common fraud indicators to assist when reviewing applications,  according to adjudicators. This training also includes a 2-hour  presentation on the VAWA self-petition program where general fraud  concepts, such as document fraud, are discussed.", "While adjudicators receive general training when hired, USCIS had not  provided tailored antifraud training on the self-petition prior to fiscal year  2019. Adjudicators we spoke to noted that fraud schemes continue to  evolve, and that fraud schemes and tactics are becoming more  sophisticated and thus more difficult to identify during adjudication of  VAWA self-petitions. Adjudicators we spoke to also noted that ongoing  training that included information on evolving fraud schemes and tactics  specific to the self-petition program would help increase their ability to  identify potentially fraudulent activities. Further, adjudicators noted that  additional training on how to identify potential fraud when a petitioner  submits an attested affidavit would help to identify potentially fraudulent  self-petitions.", "In response to our discussions and adjudicator feedback, a senior CFDO  official stated that they recognized the need for fraud training, including  training tailored to the self-petition program, and planned to hire an  additional four immigration officers in fiscal year 2019 to increase fraud  training for adjudicators, among other duties. In response to discussions  we had during our review, officials at the center also stated they planned  to develop and implement tailored fraud training for the self-petition  program by the end of fiscal year 2019.

Further, predictive analytics can identify particular types of  behavior, including fraud, before transactions are completed.", "According to USCIS officials, the agency has developed and uses data  analytics capabilities as part of its efforts to identify and prevent fraud  within immigration benefit programs. These officials said the agency has  not had sufficient resources to pursue data analytics separately for each  type of immigration benefit program. Thus, they stated that USCIS  deploys its data analytics resources strategically across immigration  benefit programs, based on factors including, among other things, the  volume of filings or applications for specific benefit programs, the amount  of data available for electronic analysis, and whether the type of  application is one that can lead to a change in immigration status, such as  asylum or permanent residency. Under this approach, for example,  USCIS officials stated that marriage and employment-based benefit  programs are areas where there is a greater amount of electronic data  available for analysis.", "USCIS\u2019s development and use of data analytics in other programs are  positive actions in helping the agency in its efforts to prevent and detect fraud risks to immigration benefit programs. However, USCIS has not  conducted a comprehensive assessment of fraud risks in the self-petition  program to provide an understanding of the likelihood and impact of  program risks and to help inform the level of resources USCIS should  allocate to addressing those risks. Consistent with the Fraud Risk  Framework, using data analytics capabilities in the self-petition program  could help position USCIS to better identify and assess fraud risks in the  program. Such data analysis does not by itself necessarily confirm the  existence of fraud, but the use of data analytics could help USCIS to  determine indicators of potential fraud. Further, consistent with the Fraud  Risk Framework, this type of analysis can aid in decisions on prioritization  of investigative resources.", "According to the Fraud Risk Framework, specific data analytic tests that  are most effective in helping managers prevent or detect potential fraud  vary by program because of the different fraud risks programs face. By  using information on previously encountered fraud schemes or known  fraud risks, managers can identify signs of fraud that may exist within  their data. In the absence of an assessment of fraud risks in the self- petition program, we asked USCIS officials about fraud risks or schemes  they have identified in the program and analyzed program data to identify  examples of ways USCIS could use program data to better prevent or  detect potential self-petition program fraud. As examples, we analyzed  variables that generally serve to identify individuals, such as address and  Social Security number, because multiple instances of the same identifier  in program data can indicate misuse of personally identifying information.  In addition, we examined other variables associated with self-petition  filings and outcomes of self-petition adjudications, as trends in variables  associated with denial outcomes, for example, can provide indicators of  potential fraud. We offer the following examples not as illustrations of  confirmed or even potential fraud, but rather to help illustrate the use of  data analytics as a tool for helping to prevent and detect fraud in the self- petition program.", "For example, one area in which we identified multiple instances of the  same variable was with addresses. While not necessarily indicative of  fraud, our review of USCIS data showed that from fiscal year 2009 to  January 2019, thousands of self-petition filings had addresses that were  used in multiple self-petition filings. According to USCIS officials, this is  not unexpected and further research would be required to authoritatively  explain the multiple address use we identified. The self-petitioner program  also allows self-petitioners to use a \u201csafe address\u201d for communications, in  an effort to ensure confidentiality in filing of the petition. According to  USCIS officials, self-petitioners often use an assisting attorney or  representative\u2019s business address as their safe address. In prior work on  other immigration benefits, we have highlighted where DHS officials have  used multiple instances of the same address in program data to target  investigative follow-up. Our analysis of data on the number of times  unique addresses were used in filing self-petitions showed, for instance,  37,201 filings had addresses used at least 10 times each from fiscal year  2009 to January 2019. In some cases, an address was used hundreds of  times\u2014\u2013in a group of 6,302 self-petitions, there were 31 instances in  which addresses were used 100 or more times. Table 2 provides  examples of multiple uses of addresses, which we selected for illustrative  purposes from among all the multiple uses of addresses we identified. It  shows, for example, in the last row, that there was one unique address  that was used 845 times in self-petition filings, all of which were separate  filings. Thus, the total number of self-petitions involved with this address  was 845.", "Another example of multiple instances of the same variable was  identification numbers. In particular, our review of USCIS data showed  that from fiscal year 2009 to January 2019, there were thousands of self- petition filings that used duplicative identifying numbers \u2013 Social Security  numbers and Alien numbers. According to USCIS officials, as with  multiple uses of the same address, further research would be required to  authoritatively explain the multiple identification number use we identified.  For example, according to USCIS officials, a foreign national parent and  child may file separate self-petitions, resulting in multiple petitions using  the same Social Security number. Also, it is common for people to file  more than one self-petition if, for instance, they are able to obtain  additional evidence after a decision is made. Our analysis of the number  of times unique Social Security numbers were provided in self-petition  filings, as well as unique Alien numbers, showed that for each, there were  several thousand filings in which the numbers were used in multiple self- petition filings. In prior work, we have highlighted examples where  multiple instances of the same Social Security number in program or  payment data has indicated Social Security number misuse, such as  where multiple individuals may have been using the same Social Security  number for employment, and use of Social Security numbers to create  synthetic identities, to obtain benefits for ineligible individuals using the  Social Security numbers of eligible applicants. Table 3 provides  examples of multiple uses of Social Security and Alien Registration  numbers, selected for illustrative purposes from among all the multiple  uses of identification numbers we identified. It shows, for example, in the  last row, that there were 28 instances in which a unique Alien number  was used in five different self-petition filings, all of which were separate  filings. Thus, the total number of self-petitions involved with these 28  Alien numbers was 140.", "Another example of multiple instances of the same variables was  assistance provided to self-petitioners by attorneys or other organizations.  According to USCIS officials, self-petitions filed with assistance are  expected, as organizations specialize in providing assistance to  petitioners and applicants for immigration benefits, including self-petitions.  Thus, USCIS officials noted that the appearance of the same attorneys or  other organizations in program data is not necessarily indicative of fraud  without further investigation. However, USCIS officials also noted that  application \u201cmills,\u201d in which a relatively large number of incomplete or  deficient self-petitions are submitted through a single preparer, also exist  and could indicate avenues for further investigation. For example, if  investigation revealed submission of self-petitioner affidavits or other  supporting evidence across multiple self-petitions and using common  information, such as duplicate wording, that could be an indicator of  potential fraud. In July 2019, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont  announced an indictment against a self-petition preparer, charging the  man with filing false statements with USCIS, including more than 1,800  fraudulent submissions for more than 1,000 self-petitioners over four  years. The preparer is alleged to have falsely claimed that his clients  were victims of abuse, without their authorization, according to the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s office.", "Our analysis of USCIS data from fiscal year 2009 to January 2019  showed that a large portion of self-petitions were filed with assistance by  either attorneys or by other organizations. In the case of attorneys,  according to our analysis, about 80 percent of self-petitions were filed by  foreign nationals with assistance from attorneys or accredited  representatives from fiscal year fiscal year 2009 through January 2019.  However, while USCIS collects attorney identifying information on the  paper form that self-petitioners submit, officials told us the agency does  not capture this information electronically. Therefore, it is not available  for analysis. Such analysis could indicate particular attorneys\u2019 or  representatives\u2019 relative shares of self-petitions, and allow USCIS to  conduct further analysis, as appropriate. In the case of organizations  providing assistance, we found that about 70 percent of self-petitioners  from fiscal year 2009 through January 2019 listed various organizations in  their filings, and we identified a number of organizations assisting  hundreds of self-petitioners each. For example, in one case an  organization was listed as providing assistance in over 500 filings and in  another case two entities were listed as providing assistance in over 400  filings each. However, according to USCIS officials, one legal  organization providing assistance for 500 filings over a 10-year period is  not uncommon or necessarily an indicator of fraud, given that, unlike  other petitions, most VAWA self-petitions are filed with the assistance of  an attorney or legal representative.", "Consistent with leading practices as described in the Framework,  analyses of multiple uses of unique identifiers or instances of certain  variables in self-petition program data could help USCIS identify areas for  more targeted review, to determine what accounts for the duplicates in  the program data and the extent to which they or other variables could be  indicators of potential fraud. Moreover, according to the Fraud Risk Framework, data analytics, such as data mining, can identify suspicious  activity or transactions, including anomalies, outliers and other red flags in  a program\u2019s data. Activity or transactions that deviate from expected  patterns can potentially indicate fraudulent activity and program  managers who effectively use data analytics to detect potential fraud look  for unusual transactions or data entries that do not fit an expected  pattern. However, as noted earlier, USCIS has not applied data analytics  as an antifraud tool for the self-petition program. For example, as  previously discussed, while adjudicating self-petitions, USCIS officers  may request additional evidence from petitioners for reasons including  incomplete or inconsistent information provided in filings, or suspected  fraud, USCIS officials told us. The officials told us the agency does not  compile data on the nature of these requests for additional evidence,  which number in the thousands annually.", "Maintaining and analyzing such data\u2014especially when adjudicators are  requesting further information because they suspect possible fraud\u2014 could provide program-level insights into where self-petitions are  incomplete or suspected to be fraudulent. Further, as noted earlier,  USCIS does not assess data on the outcomes of self-petition  adjudications to determine whether there are any trends or patterns in  such data that could be indicative of fraud. In particular, denials or  referrals can be based on multiple factors, including potential fraud.  Analyzing such outcomes for any patterns or trends that could suggest  potential fraud could help USCIS strengthen its efforts to identify and  prevent fraud risks in the self-petition program. For example, USCIS  officials told us they sometimes observe patterns or trends among self- petitions that may seem suspicious and warrant further review and noted  as an example an increase in cases involving potentially false claims of  abuse from self-petitioners from one country. While not necessarily  indicative of fraud, and to provide some example of trend analysis on data  on the outcomes of self-petition adjudications, we analyzed data on the  outcomes of adjudications from the 10 countries with the largest number  of self-petition filings and found the denial rate by country of birth of the  self-petitioner varied by as much as a factor of three. Additional analysis  across data on adjudication outcomes could help better identify areas for  further investigation or review.", "In addition, the Fraud Risk Framework notes that one leading practice for  using data analytics as an antifraud tool is to verify key information,  including self-reported data and information necessary to determine  eligibility. To effectively prevent and detect instances of potential fraud,  managers are to take steps to verify reported information, particularly self- reported data and other key data necessary to determine eligibility for  programs or receiving benefits. For example, according to officials,  USCIS does not check the validity of key identification information  submitted by self-petitioners, and it does not analyze outcomes across  characteristics of self-petitions\u2014practices our prior work indicates could  strengthen USCIS\u2019s use of data analytics. More specifically, although  USCIS may conduct background checks on self-reported self-petitioner  information, officials told us the agency does not have the capability to  check the validity of Social Security numbers or passport information that  self-petitioners report in their Form I-360 filings. Nevertheless, USCIS  officials told us the agency routinely performs overseas verification of self- petitioner documents, such as birth certificates, marriage/divorce  certificates, and passports.", "Based on our analysis of USCIS data, the agency maintains data that  could be used for data analytics. For example, the majority of self-petition  filings have full name information, addresses, Alien numbers, and, to a  lesser extent, Social Security numbers. This relative completeness of  data items provides opportunities for data-matching, which, as noted, is a  key data analytics technique. USCIS officials told us that generally, they  see the value of developing a data analytics capability for the self-petition  program, noting that such a capability would be beneficial both in aiding  fraud detection and prevention efforts, as well as by allowing timely,  accurate reporting on self-petitioner data as part of routine program  management and oversight. However, officials also noted that while  expanding the range of electronic self-petitioner data maintained would  increase analytical capabilities, there would be a cost to implementation,  which would need to be balanced against the benefit of the additional  antifraud tool, and any data analytics would need to be conducted so as  to not target individuals or groups solely based on certain self-petitioner  characteristics indicated by data.", "In other work, we have noted that leading practices in data analytic  techniques alone may not be sufficient to prevent fraud in obtaining  benefits but can help an agency prioritize and enhance fraud  investigations. Developing and implementing a data analytics capability  for the self-petition program would provide USCIS with tools to aid in  identifying potential fraud in self-petition filings and aid in focusing  resources. Further, analysis and insights developed through use of data  analytics could inform the self-petition program\u2019s periodic fraud risk  assessments, which, as described earlier, are a key aspect of the fraud  risk management process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Provides Assistance to Potential Victims of Immigration-Related Crimes and Refers Suspected Self- Petition Fraud for Review and Investigation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS VOICE Office Provides Assistance to Potential Victims of Immigration-Related Crimes", "paragraphs": ["The DHS VOICE Office provides assistance to potential victims of  immigration-related crimes.

Of those 130 calls, the Office referred 78 alleged victims to ICE\u2019s  HSI Tip Line.

Per statutory protections for self-petitioners,  DHS treats tips as inherently suspect, and is barred from making adverse  determinations of inadmissibility or deportability in adjudications based  solely on information provided by certain individuals, such as the alleged  abuser or a member of the abuser\u2019s household. However, DHS may  consider such information if it can be independently corroborated  consistent with DHS policy. As for the alleged abuser\u2019s information,  which may have been included in a VAWA self-petition, USCIS officials  noted that USCIS never provides such information to anyone including  law enforcement even where allegations of criminal conduct are reported  with a self-petition.

Within USCIS,  FDNS immigration officers review self-petition fraud referrals, conduct  administrative investigations when warranted, and in limited  circumstances, refer cases to ICE for criminal investigation. Fraud  referrals related to self-petitions typically originate from five sources: (1)  the TECS checks that the Vermont Service Center Background Check  Unit conducts prior to adjudication, which include notifications that  indicate potential national security concerns, public safety threats, and  fraud leads in the preadjudication screening process; (2) USCIS  adjudicators reviewing self-petitions at any time during the adjudication  process; (3) other USCIS offices that may encounter potential self-petition  fraud in the course of their work on other USCIS applications; (4) other  law enforcement sources, including other federal law enforcement  entities; and (5) benefit fraud tips received from the general public. After  receiving a referral, FDNS immigration officers determine whether the  referral has sufficient information to warrant further investigation.", "According to FDNS\u2019s fraud detection standard operating procedures,  FDNS immigration officers either determine that the referral becomes a  lead and the lead is accepted, or the referral is declined. After accepting  the referral, immigration officers are responsible for conducting an  administrative investigation to, among other things, obtain relevant  information needed by Vermont Service Center adjudicators to render the  appropriate adjudicative decision.

The Statement of Findings concludes the  administrative investigation with one of three types of findings: (1) Fraud  Found: the investigation determined fraudulent activities exist in the self- petition; (2) Fraud Not Found: the investigation did not uncover fraudulent  activities in the self-petition; or (3) Inconclusive: the investigation could  not make a determination of whether fraudulent activity occurred. Once  completed, the Statement of Findings is returned to the appropriate  referral source.", "In cases where FDNS immigration officers find self-petition fraud, the  case can be referred to ICE\u2019s HSI for criminal investigation. According to  a 2008 immigration benefit fraud memorandum of agreement between  USCIS and ICE, FDNS is to refer individual petitions involving suspected  fraud to HSI where (1) the alien is the subject of a TECS record; (2)  USCIS suspects misconduct on the part of the self-petitioner\u2019s attorney,  notary, interpreter, or preparer of the application; or (3) evidence of a  criminal conviction of an offense that is not grounds for inadmissibility or  removability is present, among other things. Typically, referrals are sent  to the National Lead Development Center, where they are distributed to  ICE Special Agent In-Charge local offices for further investigation,  according to FDNS officials. If a referral is the result of a task team,  petitions may be referred directly to ICE Special Agent In-Charge local  offices. ICE either accepts the referral and conducts a criminal  investigation or declines the referral and sends it back to FDNS. If a  referral is declined by ICE, FDNS continues its administrative  investigation.

Total leads and cases increased from 198 in fiscal year 2014 to  801 in fiscal year 2019 (data as of March 2019), an increase of about 305  percent. USCIS officials attributed this increase to an overall increase in  the number of self-petitions filed and an increase in fraud leads and cases  obtained through USCIS\u2019s fraud tip hotline. FDNS data showed that 2,151  leads and cases were accepted by FDNS between fiscal year 2014 and  March 2019, or about 97 percent.
