Patients will have increased knowledge about, and potential control over, what information is shared, with whom, and for what purposes.  At the same time, entities that receive personal health information will be responsible for ensuring that the information is effectively protected.", "Most groups we interviewed acknowledged that HHS was responsive in addressing many of their comments on the draft regulation.  However, given the newness, breadth, and complexity of the regulation, they also expressed uncertainty about all that organizations may need to do to comply.  Many raised questions about the requirements for entities to obtain patient consent or authorization prior to disclosing or using personal health information.   Other concerns focused on how regulated entities will apply the privacy provisions to their business associates. Most groups focused on the HIPAA provision that more stringent state privacy requirements preempt the federal regulation.  Some groups favored this flexibility, whereas others asserted that the lack of a single set of privacy standards will add regulatory burden.

Another representative commented that public confidence in the protection of their medical information could be eroded as a result of the marketing provisions.  One representative also concluded that allowing patients the opportunity to opt out in advance of all marketing contacts would better reflect the public\u2019s chief concern in this area.  HHS officials told us that this option exists under the provision granting patients the right to request restrictions on certain disclosures but that providers are not required to accept such patient requests.", "Several organizations questioned whether the scope of the consent provision was sufficient.  For example, American Medical Association (AMA) representatives supported the requirement that providers obtain patient consent to disclose personal health information for all routine uses, but questioned why the requirement did not apply to health plans. Plans use identifiable patient information for quality assurance, quality improvement projects, utilization management, and a variety of other purposes.  The association underscored its position that consent should be obtained before personal health information is used for any purpose and that the exclusion of health plans was a significant gap in the protection of this information. AMA suggested that health plans could obtain consent as part of their enrollment processes.", "The American Association of Health Plans (AAHP) also expressed concerns about the scope of consent, but from a different perspective. AAHP officials believe that the regulation may limit the ability of the plans to obtain the patient data necessary to conduct health care operations if providers\u2019 patient consent agreements are drawn too narrowly to allow such data sharing.  They suggested two ways to address this potential problem.  First, if the health plans and network providers considered themselves an \u201corganized health care arrangement,\u201d access to the information plans needed could be covered in the consent providers obtained from their patients. Second, plans could include language in their contracts with physicians that would ensure access to patients\u2019 medical record information. pharmacies could obtain written consent prior to treatment\u2014that is, filling a prescription for the first time.  The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) similarly noted the timing issue for hospitals with respect to getting background medical information from a patient prior to admission.   HHS officials told us that they believe the regulation contains sufficient flexibility for providers to develop procedures necessary to address these and similar situations.", "Research organizations focused on the feasibility of requirements for researchers to obtain identifiable health information.  The regulation requires them to obtain patient authorization unless an independent panel reviewing the research waives the authorization requirement. Although this approach is modeled after long-standing procedures that have applied to federally funded or regulated research, the regulation adds several privacy-specific criteria that an institutional review board or privacy board must consider.  The Association of American Medical Colleges and the Academy for Health Services Research and Health Policy expressed specific concerns over the subjectivity involved in applying some of the additional criteria.  As an example, they highlighted the requirement that an independent panel determine whether the privacy risks to individuals whose protected health information is to be used or disclosed are reasonable in relation to the value of the research involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationships Uncertain Regarding Covered Entities and Their Business Associates", "paragraphs": ["Several groups were concerned about the requirement for covered entities to establish a contractual arrangement with their business associates\u2014 accountants, attorneys, auditors, data processing firms, among others\u2014 that includes assurances for safeguarding the confidentiality of protected information.  This arrangement was HHS\u2019 approach to ensure that the regulation\u2019s protections would be extended to information shared with others in the health care system.  Some provider groups we spoke with were confused about the circumstances under which their member organizations would be considered covered entities or business associates. questioned the need for two covered entities sharing information to enter into a business associate contract.  The regulation addresses one aspect of this concern.  It exempts a provider from having to enter into a business associate contract when the only patient information to be shared is for treatment purposes.  This exemption reflects the reasoning that neither entity fits the definition of business associate when they are performing services on behalf of the patient and not for one another.   An example of such an exemption might include physicians writing prescriptions to be filled by pharmacists.", "Some groups also commented on the compliance challenges related to the business associate arrangement.  For example, the representatives of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) noted that it would need to enter into contracts for each of the 18,000 facilities (including hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and behavioral health providers) that it surveys for accreditation.  However, JCAHO officials hope to standardize agreements to some extent and are working on model language for several different provider types.  They explained that, because assessing quality of care varies by setting, JCAHO would need more than one model contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views Divided on Partial Preemption of State Laws", "paragraphs": ["Most of the groups we interviewed cited as a key issue the HIPAA requirement that the privacy standards preempt some but not all state laws.  Although every state has passed legislation to protect medical privacy, most of these laws regulate particular entities on specific medical conditions, such as prohibiting the disclosure of AIDS test results. However, a few states require more comprehensive protection of patient records.  The patient advocacy groups we spoke with believe that partial preemption is critically important to prevent the federal rule from weakening existing privacy protections.  According to the Health Privacy Project, the federal regulation will substantially enhance the confidentiality of personal health information in most states, while enabling states to enact more far-reaching privacy protection in the future.", "Despite the limited scope of most state legislation at present, other groups representing insurers and employers consider partial preemption to be operationally cumbersome and argue that the federal government should set a single, uniform standard.  Organizations that operate in more than one state, such as large employers and health plans, contend that determining what mix of federal and state requirements applies to their operations in different geographic locations will be costly and complex.", "Although they currently have to comply with the existing mix of state medical privacy laws, they view the new federal provisions as an additional layer of regulation. A representative of AHIMA remarked that, in addition to state laws, organizations will have to continue to take account of related confidentiality provisions in other federal laws (for example, those pertaining to substance abuse programs) as they develop policies and procedures for notices and other administrative requirements.", "The final regulation withdrew a provision in the proposed regulation that would have required HHS to respond to requests for advisory opinions regarding state preemption issues.  HHS officials concluded that the volume of requests for such opinions was likely to be so great as to overwhelm the Department\u2019s capacity to provide technical assistance in other areas.  However, they did not consider it unduly burdensome or unreasonable for entities covered by the regulation to perform this analysis regarding their particular situation, reasoning that any new federal regulation requires those affected by it to examine the interaction of the new regulation with existing state laws and federal requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Believe Compliance Challenges May Be Costly", "paragraphs": ["Several groups in our review expressed concern about the potential costs of compliance with the regulation and took issue with HHS\u2019 impact analysis.  In that analysis, the Department estimated the covered entities\u2019 cost to comply with the regulation to be $17.6 billion over the first 10 years of implementation.  Previously, HHS estimated that implementation of the other administrative simplification standards would save $29.9 billion over 10 years, more than offsetting the expenditures associated with the privacy regulation.  HHS therefore contends that the regulation complies with the HIPAA requirement that the administrative simplification standards reduce health care system costs.", "HHS expects compliance with two provisions\u2014restricting disclosures to the minimum information necessary and establishing a privacy official\u2014to be the most expensive components of the privacy regulation, in both the short and the long term.

AHA cited concerns about potentially significant new costs associated with developing new contracts under the business associate provision.
