In addition, agencies reported that 87 of their high risk projects (totaling about $4.8 billion) were poorly performing. Twenty-six projects (totaling about $3 billion) are considered both poorly planned and poorly performing. OMB has taken steps to improve the identification of the Management Watch List and high-risk projects since GAO testified last September, including publicly disclosing reasons for placement on the Management Watch List and clarifying high-risk project criteria. However, more needs to be done by both OMB and the agencies to address recommendations GAO has previously made to improve the planning, management, and oversight of poorly planned and performing projects so that potentially billions in taxpayer dollars are not wasted. In its rebaselining review, GAO reports that 48 percent of the federal government's major IT projects have been rebaselined for several reasons, including changes in project goals and changes in funding. Of those rebaselined projects, 51 percent were rebaselined at least twice and about 11 percent were rebaselined 4 times or more. In addition, while the major agencies have all established rebaselining policies, these policies are not comprehensive. Specifically, none of the policies were fully consistent with best practices, including describing a process for developing a new baseline and requiring the validation of the new baseline. Agencies' policies varied in part because OMB has not issued guidance specifying what elements these policies are to include.

To improve this oversight, Congress enacted the  Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996, expanding the responsibilities delegated to  OMB and agencies under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Among other  things, Clinger-Cohen requires agencies to better link their IT planning and  investment decisions to program missions and goals and to implement and  enforce IT management policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines.  The act also requires that agencies engage in capital planning and  performance and results-based management. OMB\u2019s responsibilities under  the act include establishing processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the  risks and results of major capital investments in information systems made  by executive agencies. OMB must also report to Congress on the net  program performance benefits achieved as a result of these investments.", "In response to the Clinger-Cohen Act and other statutes, OMB developed  policy for the planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of federal  capital assets. This policy is set forth in OMB Circular A-11 (section 300)  and in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide (supplement to Part 7 of  Circular A-11), which direct agencies to develop, implement, and use a  capital programming process to build their capital asset portfolios. Among  other things, OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide directs agencies to    evaluate and select capital asset investments that will support core  mission functions and demonstrate projected returns on investment that  are clearly equal to or better than alternative uses of available public  resources,  institute performance measures and management processes that monitor  actual performance and compare it to planned results, and    establish oversight mechanisms that require periodic review of operational  capital assets to determine if mission requirements have changed and  whether the asset continues to fulfill those requirements and deliver its  intended benefits.", "To further support the implementation of IT capital planning practices as  required by statute and directed in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide,  we have developed an IT investment management framework that  agencies can use in developing a stable and effective capital planning  process. It is a tool that can be used to determine both the status of an  agency\u2019s current IT investment management capabilities and the additional  steps that are needed to establish more effective processes.

A rebaselining  policy should describe the development of a new cost estimate and a  new project plan that details the scope of the remaining work along  with schedule and resource allocation.  3.  Require validating the new baseline. A rebaselining policy should  identify who can validate the new baseline and how the validation is to  be done.  4.  Require management review. A rebaselining policy should identify the  authority who decides whether the rebaselining is warranted and the  rebaselining plan is acceptable. In addition, the policy should outline  decision criteria used by the decision authority to determine if the  rebaseline plan is acceptable.  5.  Require that the process is documented. A rebaselining policy should  identify and document rebaselining decisions, including the reasons  for rebaselining; changes to the approved baseline cost, schedule, and  scope; management review of the rebaseline request; and approval of  new baseline. The policy should also require an explanation of why the  current plan is no longer feasible; identify the problems that led to the  need for a new plan of the remaining work; and discuss measures in  place to prevent recurrence.", "Our analysis shows that agencies do not have comprehensive rebaselining  policies. Specifically, none of the agencies\u2019 rebaselining policies are fully  consistent with all of the five practices mentioned above. Most policies  fully or partially addressed reasons for rebaselining, requiring  management review, and requiring that the rebaselining process be  documented (79 percent, 96 percent, and 88 percent, respectively), while  describing the process for developing the new baseline and requiring  validation of the new baseline were addressed the least (46 percent and 54  percent of the policies, respectively, did not address these practices).  Table 9 summarizes our assessment of agencies\u2019 rebaselining polices.", "Agencies\u2019 policies vary in part because no guidance has been issued  specifying what elements these policies are to include. As previously  noted, OMB has issued guidance which, among other things, requires  baseline change requests to be approved by the agency heads and to be  submitted to OMB for approval. However, this guidance does not  specifically address how agencies are to implement their rebaselining  activities, including the key elements that should be addressed in their  policies. In addition, officials from OMB\u2019s Office of E-government and  Information Technology and the Acting Chief of OMB\u2019s Information Policy  and Technology Branch told us that, in their oversight function, they  review agencies\u2019 earned value management policies, and in doing so  determine whether these policies address rebaselining. However, they  noted that they have not established specific criteria to evaluate the  earned value management policies (and therefore their rebaselining  aspects) and acknowledged that having such criteria would improve  consistency among the policies and facilitate their oversight process.  Without comprehensive policies to guide their rebaselining activities,  agencies may not be optimizing the effectiveness of rebaselining as a tool  to improve performance management. In addition, their rebaselining  processes may lack the transparency needed to ensure effective oversight.", "To address the weaknesses identified with agencies\u2019 rebaselining policies,  we made recommendations to the Director of OMB and to the 24 major  agencies. Specifically, we recommended that  the Director of OMB issue guidance for rebaselining policies that  would include a minimum set of key elements, taking into  consideration the criteria used in our report, and each of the heads of the 24 major agencies direct the development of  comprehensive rebaselining policies that address the weaknesses we  identified.", "We received comments on a draft of our report from 20 of the major  agencies--4 of which stated that they had no comments. Of the remaining  16 agencies, 10 generally agreed with our findings and/or  recommendations, and 6 disagreed with our assessment of certain  practices associated with their rebaselining policies.", "In summary, effective management and oversight of federal IT projects  remains a crucial task for OMB and executive branch agencies. Hundreds  of projects, amounting to billions of dollars in expenditures, have been  identified as poorly managed, poorly performing, or both. While OMB has  taken steps to improve the identification of poorly managed and poorly  performing projects, more needs to be done to improve management and  oversight, as evidenced by the number of recurring Management Watch  List projects and the surge of these projects at the beginning of every fiscal  year.", "In addition, without sound policies guiding agencies\u2019 rebaselining efforts,  changes to projects\u2019 cost and schedule goals are not as transparent as  desired and may in fact mask cost overruns and schedule delays. Having  sound rebaselining guidance from OMB and more diligent oversight of  rebaselining efforts from federal agencies will result in more accurate  information on cost and schedule performance shortfalls and provide the  necessary transparency to agency officials, OMB, and other oversight  organizations. As we transition to a new administration, it is essential to  maintain the current momentum of identifying troubled projects and the  reasons they are poorly planned and/or performing and to continue to  focus attention more keenly on solutions and long-term improvement  efforts.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
