FTA supports public transportation systems through a variety of federal grant programs.", "GAO was asked to review various issues related to such partnerships. This report examines, among other things: (1) the types of partnership projects that selected transit agencies have initiated with private mobility companies and (2) how DOT's efforts and funding and federal requirements may impact such partnerships. GAO interviewed DOT officials and reviewed DOT documents; interviewed 16 local transit agencies and 13 private mobility companies involved in transit partnerships; and reviewed 22 projects initiated by the selected partners, including 5 funded by the Mobility on Demand Sandbox grant program.

Most of the transit partnership projects that GAO selected (14 of 22) involved private partners providing on-demand transportation for the \u201cfirst- and last-mile\u201d connections to or from public transit stations (see figure). Local transit agencies use first- and last-mile connections to increase their public transit ridership. Other services provided through selected projects included filling transit service gaps in under-served areas. Most selected projects have not yet been evaluated to determine whether they achieved intended outcomes.", "The Department of Transportation's (DOT) efforts, especially the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) initiation of the Mobility on Demand Sandbox program, have facilitated partnerships, but confusion about how to meet some requirements and how to report data pose challenges to implementing projects. In October 2016, FTA announced the selection of 11 projects to receive grants and has since provided assistance to the grantees. FTA also issued clarifications about how certain federal requirements\u2014such as those related to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)\u2014apply to transit partnerships. However, most selected local transit agencies (14 of 16) said that additional information beyond what FTA has already disseminated, including how agencies have successfully structured partnerships and met federal requirements, would be helpful. Collecting and disseminating such information could help FTA be better positioned to respond to changes in the transit industry that could impact its own efforts and goals, such as planning for future Mobility on Demand grants. In addition, most selected local transit agencies reported confusion related to reporting information about their on-demand projects into the FTA's National Transit Database, including confusion about which on-demand project data would qualify for entry. This confusion has led to possible reporting inconsistencies by some local transit agencies. Ensuring that data contained in the National Transit Database are complete and accurate is important, since according to FTA officials, FTA uses these data (1) to apportion certain grant funds to local transit agencies based on factors such as passenger miles traveled, and (2) to track its progress in achieving goals such as promoting efficient transportation systems, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations including that FTA disseminate information about how partnership projects met federal requirements and how data on partnerships should be entered into the National Transit Database.

Such transit partnerships may  become more common as mobility technologies emerge, many of which  are enabled by smartphone applications. Partnerships include, for  example, arrangements where local transit agencies seek to increase  public transit ridership by subsidizing ridesourcing rides to or from rail  stations, making access more convenient.", "In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) launched a new  program to explore such transit partnerships and in turn to make  transportation services more integrated and efficient. FTA\u2019s funding  opportunity announcement for its Mobility on Demand (MOD) \u201cSandbox\u201d  grant program generated a lot of interest among transit providers such as  local transit agencies, generating 78 eligible proposals. From these  applications, FTA announced the selection of 11 projects to receive about  $8 million. Such partnerships can offer benefits, but some private mobility  companies\u2019 business models may run counter to providing accessible and  equitable transit. For example, riders without a smartphone could be  excluded from accessing some emerging services.", "In the light of these developments, you asked us to examine several  aspects of partnerships between local transit agencies and private  mobility companies such as ridesourcing companies, including potential  benefits from partnerships and challenges to their implementation. This  report addresses:  1.  the types of partnership projects that selected transit agencies have  pursued with private mobility companies and the potential effects of  these partnerships;  2.  how DOT\u2019s efforts and funding, and various federal requirements  impact such emerging partnerships; and  3.  other considerations that may affect the future prevalence of such  partnerships.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed documents from and  conducted interviews with a selection of local transit agencies and private  mobility companies engaged in transit partnerships. Specifically, we  selected 15 transit partnerships, to represent a range of type of project,  type of service, and geographic location. The selected transit  partnerships also include 5 projects that received funding through FTA\u2019s  MOD Sandbox grant program. We interviewed 29 stakeholders involved  in these partnerships including representatives from 16 local transit  agencies and 13 private mobility companies, including three ridesourcing  companies, 3 taxi companies, 5 technology companies focused on  transit, a bike-share company, and a car-share company. Although the  views of these selected officials are not generalizable to those of all local  transit agencies or private mobility companies, they represent a range of  perspectives and expertise regarding partnerships. We also interviewed  officials and reviewed documents from the Department of Transportation  (DOT), including in FTA and the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint  Program Office (ITS JPO) and interviewed five other stakeholders with  knowledge of transit issues, such as the Shared Use Mobility Center  (SUMC) and the Community Transportation Association of America.

One facet of the sharing economy is  shared mobility, meaning the shared use of a motor vehicle, bicycle, or  other transportation mode that is often facilitated by requests from users,  largely through mobile applications. See figure 1 for examples of shared  mobility services available \u201con demand\u201d through mobile applications.", "The increased use of ridesourcing services has been particularly  noticeable in recent years. Since Uber first initiated ridesourcing services  in the U.S. in 2010, such services have become increasingly popular,  especially in urban areas. While data on the use of ridesourcing are  limited, researchers reported in 2017 that about 21 percent of adults in  major U.S. cities had used ridesourcing services, and about a quarter of  them used these services on a frequent (weekly or daily) basis.  Ridesourcing services offer convenience benefits for riders (see fig. 2,  which explains how such services work).", "Millions of Americans\u2014especially those unable to provide their own  transportation due to age, disability or income constraints\u2014rely on public  transit to fully participate in society and access vital services. The types of  services typically provided by local transit agencies include:  rail services, in which vehicles operate along railways.  fixed-route bus services, which operate according to regular  schedules along prescribed routes with designated stops. paratransit services, which generally speaking are accessible,  origin-to-destination transportation services that operate in response  to calls or requests from riders. other demand-response services, which are sometimes called dial- a-ride.", "Local transit agencies have historically contracted out some services, in  part to decrease their operating costs. For example, a survey we  conducted in 2013 showed that a majority (61 percent) of the 463 responding local transit agencies contracted out one or more services.  Services most frequently contracted out included paratransit services for  individuals with disabilities and demand-response services. In particular,  taxi companies have often been used to fulfill paratransit services and  other demand-response services.", "Within DOT, FTA is responsible for providing grants that support the  development of safe, comprehensive, and coordinated public  transportation systems, among other things. Specifically, FTA:", "Annually distributes about $12 billion to support and expand transit  systems, according to DOT. Two of these funding sources are  Urbanized Area Formula Grants and Formula Grants for Rural  Areas. These grant funds go to local transit agencies, but these  local transit agencies may in some cases use these funds to procure  the services of third parties such as private mobility companies.", "Ensures that local transit agencies receiving certain federal financial  assistance do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, national  origin, sex, disability, or age. Furthermore, FTA ensures local transit  agencies comply with DOT regulations implementing certain portions  of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, (Title VI) and  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, (ADA).", "Administers the National Transit Database (NTD), which is intended to  provide information to the federal government and others on which to  base public transportation service planning.

According to officials, FTA  believes that the U.S. public transportation system will be heavily  influenced by the \u201cMobility on Demand\u201d concept in the future, so has  incorporated this concept into its planned research efforts. The MOD  program is the agency\u2019s main effort to help local transit agencies to  explore emerging shared mobility technologies, in part by partnering with  private mobility companies. The MOD program involves several  components, including funding projects through the competitive MOD  Sandbox grant program. In May 2016, FTA published a notice of funding  opportunity and solicitation of project proposals for the MOD Sandbox  grant program. In October 2016 FTA announced the selection of 11  projects to receive about $8 million.

The private  mobility companies involved in selected partnerships include some well- known companies such as Uber and Lyft, and some lesser-known types  of companies such as a bike-share company and technology companies  focused on transportation. Selected local transit agencies most  frequently partnered with ridesourcing companies (11 projects), while 8  partnership projects included more than one type of private partner. Five  of the 22 partnership projects were in FTA\u2019s MOD Sandbox program.", "Most selected projects (14 of 22) involved on-demand first- and last-mile  transportation connections, through which respective local transit  agencies aim to increase ridership on their transit systems (see table 1).  Addressing the first- and last- mile issue has been identified as an  ongoing challenge for many local transit agencies seeking to increase  their transit ridership. Research suggests that the easier it is to access a  transit system, the more likely people are to use it.", "Connecting on-demand services for the \u201cfirst- and last-mile\u201d\u2014which refers  to the distances riders need to travel to or from a public transit station or a  stop to arrive at their final destination\u2014could improve transit access by  effectively extending service beyond the respective fixed-route buses and  commuter trains (see fig. 4). To attract riders to use such first- and last- mile services, eight projects provided a discount to pay for a portion of the  fare for the ridesourcing ride to access public transit. Figure 5 below  shows a selected local agency\u2019s advertisement for such a voucher  program.", "The second most common type of service provided through selected  projects was on-demand paratransit service, which could help the  respective transit agencies offer eligible riders more convenient options  and also help address the high cost of providing such services. More than  half of the selected projects (13 of 22) provided on-demand services  targeted toward paratransit-eligible riders, either as the primary project  goal or to ensure equivalent service for eligible customers. Officials from  two local transit agencies told us that by providing more convenient ADA  paratransit services\u2014as compared to traditional services that require  booking a day or more in advance\u2014these projects in turn produce other  benefits. For example, officials from one local transit agency with such a  partnership thought their program could really benefit the broader  community because the targeted riders could make more spur-of-the- moment decisions to participate in activities such as shopping, work, and  church. Also, as we have previously reported, the costs of paratransit  services are much more costly to provide than fixed route trips.", "Some local transit agencies also aimed to improve their public trip  planning and ticketing systems, to increase convenience for riders in their  communities. Specifically, five selected local agency projects involved  early experiments with the Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept,  meaning offering riders a central electronic platform\u2014such as an app\u2014to  plan end-to-end trips including booking, ticketing, and paying for any  transportation needed to make the trip, both public or private. If fully  implemented, MaaS would allow riders to, for example, use one app to  view and compare real-time availability of various modes (e.g., a traveler  might be directed to a train if one is arriving quickly, or to a ridesourcing  vehicle if train service has ended for the night). Riders could tailor their  trip to meet their needs and payments could be processed through their  phone. Implementing MaaS apps could increase convenience for  consumers, and may also increase transit ridership. As an example of an  \u2018early\u2019 MaaS experiment, Chicago Transit Authority\u2019s MOD Sandbox project seeks to integrate the city\u2019s bike-share system into CTA\u2019s central  trip planning and fare payment app, so that riders can more easily pay for  a bike-share ride along with their transit trip. Figure 6 shows a sample of  a current trip planner and a future MaaS concept.", "To initiate their on-demand projects, half of selected local transit agencies  relied on local funds and not federal funds. Specifically, officials from half  of the local transit agencies (8 of 16) indicated that their projects did not  use federal funds, with the projects either partially or entirely funded  through a local transit agency or local government subsidy, where the  transit agency subsidizes or pays the entire cost of the on-demand  service. The remaining 7 local transit agencies used federal funds for  their projects. For example, the 5 FTA MOD Sandbox projects in our  selection received federal funds to support 80 percent of project costs,  with the remaining 20 percent of project costs supported through local  matching funds.

However, a few transit  officials told us that their agencies\u2019 costs had decreased since initiating  the partnerships. For example, an official from one transit agency  reported that the on-demand service provided through their partnership  had helped them reduce costs for paratransit. Two of the completed  partnerships in our review generated insufficient ridership to succeed.  The partnerships were widely covered by the press, which transit agency  officials believe provides other transit agencies the opportunity to learn  from them as well. Specifically, Kansas City\u2019s Bridj project and the Go  Centennial project in the city of Centennial, Colorado failed to attract  sufficient riders despite the money and time invested by the local transit  agencies and their private partners. The transit officials involved indicated  that the projects should have incorporated more marketing of the services  being offered and allowed more time for riders to adapt to the new on- demand services, an issue which we will further discuss later in this  report.", "In addition, according to some selected local transit agencies and  literature, the increase in such partnerships may have negative effects on  public transit ridership and on local transit agencies more broadly. For  example, as riders become comfortable with the new on-demand options,  they may elect to use these transportation modes instead of public transit,  thus reducing public transit ridership. In addition to the possible loss of  ridership revenue, on-demand services could decrease other transit  agency revenues, such as parking fees charged at some transit stations.  Further, one researcher that regularly reviews emerging mobility topics  discussed the concern that over time, an increase in on-demand services  offered could result in inequitable public transit. Specifically, she noted  that if on-demand services offered continue to increase, riders may begin  to perceive fixed route transit services as inferior to these new services,  which could divert riders and revenues away from public transit.  Eventually, this could result in two systems: an inferior public transit  system and a superior on-demand system for those who can afford it.", "To provide more information about potential outcomes from such  partnerships, DOT officials have commissioned a study to evaluate the  outcomes of the MOD Sandbox partnerships and anticipate publishing  results in 2019. In collaboration, FTA and DOT\u2019s ITS JPO developed an  evaluation framework for each of the 11 funded MOD Sandbox projects.  As part of this evaluation, the transit agencies plan to collect information,  such as ridership and cost data, to demonstrate how the project has  influenced transit rider behavior. ITS JPO plans to use the data to  measure the extent to which each project has fulfilled its goals and  impacted travel behavior.

According to FTA officials, they received many such waiver  requests from applicants, many of which they could not grant. For  example, some of the MOD Sandbox grantees\u2019 private partners  requested waivers from ADA requirements, which according to FTA  officials the agency does not have the authority to waive. FTA officials  also clarified that they do not intend to immediately change policies or  regulations based on the feedback received through the MOD Sandbox  program.

Table 2 below shows four  categories of requirements cited as having the potential to impact  partnerships, along with examples of stakeholder views on their potential  impacts. Although some stakeholders identified these requirements as  potentially impacting partnerships, they did not agree that the  requirements should be waived to facilitate partnerships. For example,  officials from two local transit agencies told us that requirements related  to providing accessible and equitable transportation are important to  maintain even if they could deter partnerships. However, FTA designed  the MOD Sandbox grant application process so that the applicant local  transit agencies could choose their private mobility partners using a  noncompetitive process, bypassing the procurement requirements that  normally require a full and open competition. One MOD grantee told us  that their ability to bypass a competitive process was helpful and  expedited their project planning efforts.", "As FTA has gained more knowledge about such partnerships, the agency  has sought to clarify how some of these requirements apply to such  partnerships. For example, in December 2016, shortly after announcing  MOD Sandbox grantees, FTA issued documentation clarifying various  aspects of transit partnerships, as well as certain federal requirements.", "FTA issued a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to local transit agencies which  addressed how certain ADA and Title VI requirements apply when a  local transit agency enters into a partnership with a ridesourcing  company.", "FTA published a dedicated webpage of frequently asked questions  (FAQ) about shared-mobility partnerships.

As noted above, FTA has  issued various documents for local transit agencies about how federal  requirements, such as Title VI requirements, apply to emerging  partnerships. Nonetheless, officials from some local transit agencies told  us that without examples, they were unclear about how such partnerships  could ever meet requirements.

In another example, officials from one agency told us that they had tried  to look at the NTD database to find peer local transit agencies with similar  on-demand programs to ask these agencies for advice, but could not find  any peers using that method. These officials wanted to know how other  local transit agencies were dealing with customers without bank cards in  their on-demand services.

For example, transit officials  managing four of the 11 selected projects involving a ridesourcing  company told us they had added a taxi or paratransit company as an  option for riders to comply with requirements. According to two taxi  representatives we interviewed and research studies, taxi companies  already have procedures for fulfilling federally-required drug and alcohol  tests. Several local transit officials told us that taxi companies usually  have call centers and accept cash payments, making it easier to ensure  that the services comply with Title VI. In addition, according to taxi  representatives and research reports, taxi companies may have  experience complying with the ADA since some of DOT\u2019s implementing  regulations may already apply to them.", "Gathering and disseminating more information on partnerships  corresponds with best practices for collaboration with external parties  identified in prior work by GAO and others. For example, as we have  previously reported, if federal agencies can identify and share best  practices, this can help the entities that federal agencies oversee\u2014such  as local transit agencies in this case\u2014make changes to successfully  adapt to changes in the environment. Additionally, a recent industry  report argues that local transit agencies seeking to form transit  partnerships will strongly benefit from learning directly from peer agencies  with relevant experiences in the emerging area.", "As discussed above, FTA has gathered local transit partnership  information from its MOD Sandbox projects. However, the majority of  local transit agencies that participate in partnerships are not in the MOD  Sandbox program; and many of their projects may already be underway  or complete. Gathering information from those local transit agencies  would provide FTA with more information about how partnerships are  meeting federal requirements. It would also likely provide FTA with more  examples to disseminate to all local transit agencies interested in  pursuing partnerships to help those agencies structure their partnerships  in accordance with federal requirements.

Under the statute, public  transportation means regular, continuing shared-ride surface  transportation services that are open to the general public or open to a  segment of the general public defined by age, disability, or low income.  However, public transportation does not include intercity passenger rail  transportation provided by Amtrak, intercity bus service, charter bus  service, school bus service, sightseeing service, courtesy shuttle service  for patrons of one or more specific establishments, or intra-terminal or  intra-facility shuttle services. FTA officials told us that for a  transportation service to be considered \u201cshared-ride\u201d the service must  have the real possibility of being offered on a shared-ride basis.  According to FTA officials, for a transportation service to be \u201copen to the  general public\u201d it cannot be limited to a specific group (except those  groups specified in the definition), and neither the driver nor passenger  can deny another person on board. For example, a service provided by a  ridesourcing company in which a passenger or driver can refuse  additional passengers would not be considered \u201copen to the general  public,\u201d according to FTA officials. Furthermore, FTA officials told us that  a time-limited pilot providing transportation service is not considered  \u201cregular\u201d and \u201ccontinuing.\u201d", "Additionally, FTA officials told us that, even if a transportation service  meets the statutory definition of public transportation, the local transit  agency may not be required to report the associated data if that agency  did not directly provide the transit service. For example, according to FTA  officials, whether or not a local transit agency would have to report  transportation service provided by a private partner would depend on the  contract between the local transit agency and the private partner. Also,  according to FTA officials, a local transit agency cannot report data about  service provided by a private partner if it is a voucher program, because  those services are not considered \u201cshared ride\u201d and thus do not meet the  statutory definition of public transportation. If the service provided by the  private partner meets the statutory definition of public transportation and  is considered a service provided by the local transit agency, then FTA  officials told us most services provided through these partnerships should  be reported under the Demand Response or Demand Response-Taxi  transportation modes.", "Despite available NTD manuals that discuss the statutory definition of  public transportation, officials from most (10 of 16) selected local transit  agencies expressed confusion about NTD reporting for on-demand  projects, such as about which types of on-demand rides qualify as \u201cpublic  transportation\u201d for NTD reporting purposes and how qualifying rides  should be entered into NTD. These officials told us that further  clarification is needed from FTA about this issue. For example, three  projects in our review offered similar on-demand paratransit rides\u2014 through ridesourcing or taxi company partners\u2014but officials from the  three local transit agencies involved had different views on whether and  how these rides should be entered into NTD.", "Officials from the first local transit agency told us that they were  planning to report these rides into NTD and had met with the FTA  officials responsible for maintaining NTD to ask them how to report  them. These FTA officials had told them it should theoretically be  possible to enter those rides into NTD, but they did not clarify how to  do so.", "Officials from the second transit agency told us that if they extend the  dates of their current partnership with two ridesourcing companies,  then they will need more clarification from FTA about the information  that should be reported into NTD, such as passenger miles traveled.  These officials also noted that they already use an extensive process  for entering paratransit information into NTD, including tracking  vehicle hours and passenger miles of all vehicles used to provide  such services.", "Officials from the third local transit agency told us that they did not  intend to report these rides into NTD. In these officials\u2019 opinion, these  rides should not be entered into NTD since they do not meet the  definition of public transportation in the NTD policy manual.", "Selected transit agencies in our review seem to be interpreting the  information about whether and how to enter data from their partner- provided on-demand services\u2014as outlined in NTD manuals\u2014differently,  leading to inconsistencies in whether and how these agencies planned to  enter data. For example, one local transit agency\u2019s project offered shared  microtransit services on-demand through a technology company partner.  In our interview, officials from this local transit agency told us that they  intended to report these rides into NTD, but had received unclear and  seemingly incorrect advice from the regional FTA staff on how to do so.  According to these officials, the regional FTA staff had told them to  include these microtransit rides with the agency\u2019s demand-response  paratransit rides, since some of the riders of this on-demand service were  also qualified for paratransit. The local transit officials told us that they  hesitated to report to NTD in the way instructed because it seemed  inaccurate. In this local transit agency\u2019s response to follow up questions,  the local officials said they were no longer planning to report data on their  on-demand service into NTD. We asked FTA officials if this type of  service provided by a private partner qualifies as public transportation,  and thus should be entered into the NTD by the local transit agency, and  FTA officials said it seemed to qualify for entry. In another example, one  transit official managing a first- and last- mile voucher project told us that  she planned to report these rides into NTD. However, FTA officials told us  services provided through voucher programs generally do not meet the  definition of public transportation and therefore do not qualify for NTD  entry.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. To ensure that quality data  are used to track progress toward achieving objectives, agencies should  obtain relevant data from internal and external sources in a timely  manner, according to the standards. Further, the standards state that  agencies should use an iterative and ongoing process to identify what  information is needed. As changes to the agencies\u2019 objectives occur\u2014or  as external events occur that impact such objectives\u2014the standards  indicate that agencies should change information requirements as  needed to meet these modified objectives.", "The above examples of local transit agencies\u2019 confusion about NTD  reporting requirements raise questions about whether NTD data  accurately reflect the status of the U.S. public transportation system, a  key goal of the NTD. According to officials, FTA is considering issuing  more information clarifying required NTD reporting for on-demand  services provided through partnerships. They explained that rather than  change any reporting requirements, this new information would clarify  how emerging on-demand services fit into current NTD reporting  requirements. These officials also told us that local transit officials with  questions related to NTD reporting can call an FTA NTD help desk or  they can direct their questions to the designated NTD analyst. Officials  said that they would consider issuing a document on frequently asked  questions about NTD reporting for these partnerships, but that thus far  FTA had received few relevant questions from transit agencies.  Specifically, FTA officials told us that their NTD office had received  relevant questions from two local transit agencies (both of which are in  our selection), both about what types of ridesourcing services would be  reportable to the NTD. According to FTA officials, they responded to  these inquiries by explaining that all services entered into NTD must be  shared and meet the statutory definition of \u201cpublic transportation.\u201d", "While FTA officials told us that only two local transit agencies had  contacted them about NTD reporting confusion, this did not include some  other agencies in our selection that had contacted their regional FTA  offices for clarification. This raises the possibility that more transit  agencies nationwide with such partnerships might have confusion about  NTD reporting than the FTA headquarters office was aware of. FTA  officials also told us that, in the longer-term, they are considering  developing a separate NTD reporting category\u2014or transportation mode\u2014 for shared ridesourcing services that qualify as public transportation.  However, FTA officials did not commit to taking action on this issue.", "Without clarified information from FTA on whether services provided  through on-demand projects qualify as public transportation, and how to  enter data about these services into NTD, some local transit agencies will  likely remain confused, potentially leading to inaccurate data in the NTD.  Also, according to FTA officials, without accurate NTD data, (1) FTA will  not be able to effectively track its own progress toward achieving goals\u2014 such as improving the efficiency of transit systems, and (2) the  apportionment of certain grant funds to local transit agencies could be  affected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties Gathering Data from Some Ridesourcing Partners", "paragraphs": ["Selected local transit agencies reported difficulties obtaining some data  from their ridesourcing partners\u2014such as the total miles travelled with  passengers on board\u2014and according to some stakeholders, local transit  agencies nationwide have faced similar challenges. Some of these data  may be needed for NTD reporting but they could also be useful to local  transit agencies in tracking the outcomes of their on-demand projects.  Specifically, officials from six selected local transit agencies that had  partnered with ridesourcing companies had experienced issues obtaining  data from them, mostly due to these companies\u2019 concerns about rider  privacy and proprietary data. For example, one local transit official told us  that she requested, but did not receive, data needed for NTD reporting  from a ridesourcing company, including miles travelled with passengers  on board.", "While representatives from most selected private mobility companies we  spoke to (11 of 13) expressed no issues with sharing data,  representatives from the two large ridesourcing companies did.  Specifically, Uber and Lyft representatives said their companies are  uncomfortable with sharing riders\u2019 personally identifiable information,  such as the exact destination and origin addresses of their ridesourcing  trips, with a public entity without riders\u2019 previous consent because they  believed the data would be subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)  requests. Representatives of two industry associations and a researcher  told us that issues gathering data from ridesourcing companies is a  broader challenge faced by local transit agencies in such partnerships.  However, representatives of the two ridesourcing companies stated that  they are working with local transit agencies and FTA to figure out how to  provide data to local transit agencies for NTD reporting while still  protecting privacy.", "FTA officials told us they have reached an informal agreement with  ridesourcing companies participating in the MOD Sandbox program,  including Uber and Lyft, for the collection of one category of data.  According to FTA officials, that agreement relates only to certain data  needed to assess the ADA equivalent level of service requirement. If the  local transit agencies participating in the MOD Sandbox program need  additional data for NTD reporting, FTA officials told us it is up to those  local transit agencies to obtain it from the ridesourcing companies. In  addition, FTA officials told us that local transit agencies partnering with  ridesourcing companies outside of the MOD Sandbox program would not  benefit from this informal agreement.", "To help address data collection issues, officials from some (5 of 16)  selected local transit agencies suggested that FTA could play a greater  role in encouraging ridesourcing companies to provide some minimum  level of data needed for NTD reporting. For example, several transit  officials suggested that FTA could circulate effective practices for data  sharing, such as a template contract between a local transit agency and a  private mobility company that includes data sharing obligations. Several  transit officials discussed how such additional information from FTA could  be helpful for local transit agencies in pursuing or maintaining their  partnerships. For instance, officials from one local transit agency argued  that FTA information in this area could help the many local transit  agencies that are too small to have sufficient market power to get the  needed NTD data from ridesourcing companies.", "The above examples of local transit agencies seeking templates of data  sharing agreements suggest that these and other local transit agencies  could benefit from more communication from FTA on this issue. If local  transit agencies could use such data sharing templates from FTA to  gather more complete and accurate data from their ridesourcing partners,  this would in turn help ensure the accuracy and completeness of NTD  data.", "As noted above, the internal control standards instruct federal agencies to  use quality data. If FTA communicated more information about practices  for data sharing, this would assist local transit agencies and also help  FTA be better poised to track its overall progress in furthering its goals,  including promoting efficient public transit systems.", "However, FTA officials told us that they do not track information about  partnerships that did not receive funding through the MOD Sandbox  program, such as details of data sharing agreements, and so could not  disseminate examples of how those local transit agency partnership  participants are handling data sharing issues. However, local transit  agencies with partnerships that are outside of the MOD Sandbox program  may still be required to report data into the NTD and could benefit from  additional information. FTA officials explained that they want to avoid  duplicating the work of other groups that are gathering and sharing  information about partnerships. For example, SUMC gathers some  information about such partnerships nationwide in a public database  and has sponsored conferences to facilitate information sharing about  local transit agencies\u2019 experiences with their partnerships. However,  SUMC\u2019s public database of partnerships does not include details about  how all partnerships are handling data sharing issues. Further, because  FTA oversees local transit agencies, the documents that it issues may be  viewed as more authoritative than those of a contracted agency such as  SUMC.", "As FTA continues its efforts to address data sharing with the ridesourcing  companies involved in the MOD Sandbox program, the agency could also  develop broader information on best practices for data sharing  agreements\u2014in collaboration with the MOD Sandbox grantees and  possibly also with SUMC\u2014and share that information so it would be  available for interested local transit agencies. By sharing such gathered  information on partnerships, FTA could in turn help transit agencies make  sound decisions regarding the data needed from their private mobility  partners, and about various options for structuring partnerships to achieve  that end."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Considerations Impacting the Future Prevalence of Transit Partnerships Include Industry Changes, Available Funding for Local Transit, and Access to Services, Among Others Roles of Local Transit Agencies and Private Mobility Companies Could Change as the Broader Transportation Industry Evolves", "paragraphs": ["The transportation industry as a whole is rapidly evolving, with more on- demand services being offered, which could increase the use of transit  partnerships. According to SUMC, the U.S. is currently experiencing a  seismic shift in transportation, as breakthroughs in mobile technology, an  influx of new mobility options and changes in travel behavior have  significantly altered today\u2019s transportation landscape, a trend likely to  accelerate in the years ahead. Most selected local transit agencies (15  of 16) and private mobility companies (12 of 13) agreed that the industry  is changing, and some discussed how transit agencies\u2019 roles and  operations are changing as a result. For example, officials at five local  transit agencies told us that the transit industry is shifting to offer more  mobility on-demand services. Some of these stakeholders predicted that  as local transit agencies increasingly use contracted services, these  agencies will increasingly become \u201cmobility managers\u201d rather than direct  service providers. Officials from three agencies said they are already  making or planning for this shift.", "The increasing automation of vehicles is another key industry change that  could impact local transit agency operations and partnerships, but the timeframes needed for full automation remain unclear. As we have  reported, automated vehicles promise transformative benefits such as  reducing crashes and fatalities and increasing mobility, but such vehicles  also pose challenges for policymakers, such as assuring safety and  addressing data privacy and other issues. We also reported that these  technologies are rapidly evolving, but there is no consensus about the  time needed for their full deployment. According to a recent study,  vehicle automation could result in significant changes to transit agencies\u2019  operations. For example, FTA has reported that automated transit  vehicles could be used to address first- and last-mile issues, which could  in turn decrease the need for local transit agencies to partner with private  mobility companies to fill such gaps.", "According to several stakeholders and research reports, some  automakers and others have started investing in automated vehicle  technologies and in private mobility companies in response to the  projected rollout of shared automated vehicles in the near future. If these  entities continue making such investments, this could help address  challenges related to private mobility companies\u2019 long-term sustainability,  which could increase such companies\u2019 ability to enter into partnerships.  Of the 13 private mobility companies in our review, representatives of 5  told us that they receive significant financial support from an automaker.  In addition to a car-share company, recipients of such support included,  for example, three technology companies and a bike-share company.", "Representatives from two of these companies told us that such support  helps ensure their long-term sustainability or provides them with the  flexibility to try different business models and enter into transit  partnerships without worrying about each being profitable. Such  investments from well-established companies may also help address  some local transit agency concerns about whether some private mobility  companies would be reliable partners, thereby increasing partnerships.  For example, according to a recent industry report, some transit officials  have questioned the long-term financial viability of the ridesourcing  business model, citing high driver turnover rates and other factors as  concerns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Available Local Transit Funding and Transit Ridership Levels Will Impact Transit Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["All 16 selected local transit agencies and most private companies (10 of  13) told us that local transit agencies\u2019 constrained budgets will impact  transit partnerships, and most transit officials agreed that this would  encourage partnerships.

For example, local  transit agencies may seek to maintain their transit riders by, for example,  offering first- and last-mile connections to make accessing transit services  more convenient. Based on GAO analysis of FTA data, overall transit  ridership decreased by about 1 percent between 2012 and 2016, but  ridership changes varied greatly by metropolitan area. For example, since  2010, some larger metropolitan areas have experienced more significant  ridership decreases, such as Los Angeles (over a 9 percent decrease)  and Washington, D.C. (over a 9 percent decrease). However, ridership  grew by more than 10 percent in several areas, including Seattle (24  percent increase), and Nashville (12.5 percent increase).

For example, officials at several local transit agencies  told us that they dedicated resources for outreach to target riders to  ensure these riders understood the new services being offered. One  agency advertised its new on-demand taxi services for paratransit-eligible  customers through phone calls to customers and residential mailings, and  also encouraged the taxi companies involved to separately advertise  these services.", "Even with outreach and marketing to target riders, some potential riders\u2014 particularly the elderly and low-income earners\u2014may not be able to  easily access some on-demand services. For example, the current  ridesourcing model generally requires riders to have a smartphone and a  bank card to request a ride, which could exclude some riders.", "According to recent reports, less than one-third of Americans over age  65 own a smartphone and only 4 percent had used a ridesourcing  service as of 2016. However, according to literature, older  Americans will be a key demographic for transit providers to target in  coming years, since their numbers are projected to grow significantly  and some will stop driving their own vehicles in the near future.", "Reflecting similar concerns, several officials from local transit  agencies (4 of 16) told us that it can be challenging for older residents  in their communities to learn to use the smartphone apps that are  needed to access some on-demand services.", "According to a 2016 Pew Research Center report, of those surveyed  with household incomes greater than $75,000, 86 percent had heard  of ridesourcing services and 26 percent had used them. For those  surveyed with incomes less than $30,000, however, only 51 percent  had heard of these services and 10 percent had used them.  According to a recent report, those with lower incomes could  particularly benefit from more on-demand services, especially since  reliable access to transportation can help people acquire and keep  better jobs.", "Several selected transit and private mobility stakeholders had efforts  underway to address such access issues. For example, two local transit  agencies had done targeted outreach to senior communities to educate  them about using the new services, including instructions for using the  smartphone apps. According to transit officials involved, these efforts had  increased the use of these on-demand services by elderly riders. In  addition, one ridesourcing company offers gift certificates to offer an  option for those without bank cards, which can be purchased with cash  and used to redeem rides.
