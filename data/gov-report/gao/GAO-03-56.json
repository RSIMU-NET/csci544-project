The data were inconsistent primarily because GSA did not precisely define criteria for the information it was seeking from the banks. Therefore, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn at this time about where agencies spend purchase card dollars or the effect of purchase cards on small businesses. Nevertheless, GSA has been working with the Small Business Administration, the Department of Defense, and the private sector to develop strategies to improve the data's reliability. By building on the lessons learned in its initial attempt to collect the data, GSA hopes to produce more reliable socioeconomic data for future fiscal years. We identified several challenges that prevent GSA from gathering data on 100 percent of the merchants doing business with the federal government. These challenges stem from the nature of the purchase card transaction processing system, which focuses on the data needed to ensure that the merchant is paid and the cardholder's account is charged. It is not designed to collect socioeconomic data for the government. Despite the challenges that prevent the collection of socioeconomic data on all purchase card merchants, well-defined criteria and consistent use of available data sources would provide decisionmakers with a clearer picture of the extent to which small businesses are receiving federal dollars through purchase cards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The amount of money spent on goods and services via government purchase cards has increased rapidly over the past decade. In fiscal year 2001, the federal government spent $13.8 billion in transactions using government purchase cards for individual purchases\u2014the vast majority of which are under $2,500\u2014and for payment on existing contracts. Purchase cards streamlined the process of acquiring goods and services by authorizing a broad range of government employees to purchase directly from merchants rather than going through the regular procurement process. However, because the government does not collect detailed socioeconomic data on purchase card expenditures and cannot accurately determine the share of such expenditures going to small businesses, the impact of purchase cards on small businesses is unknown. Currently, individual purchase card transactions are not counted toward achievement of the annual governmentwide goal of awarding 23 percent of prime contract dollars to small businesses.", "Federal agencies, along with the congressional small business committees, would like to capture data on purchase card merchants to track the amount of spending that is going to small businesses. They believe that better data would enable decisionmakers to assess the impact of purchase card policies on small businesses. In October 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA), which administers the purchase card program, took steps to collect socioeconomic data on merchants doing business with the government through purchase cards during fiscal year 2001. The Department of Defense (DOD), payment card associations (MasterCard and Visa), and the five banks under contract with GSA as card issuers also participated in GSA\u2019s effort.", "Because of the uncertainties about the impact of purchase cards on small businesses, you requested that we (1) assess GSA\u2019s governmentwide efforts to collect data on the socioeconomic status of merchants and (2) identify the challenges to collecting and reporting the data. You also asked us to verify the information collected by the banks and payment card associations by means of a survey.

Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the governmentwide commercial purchase card is now the preferred method of paying for micropurchases. Further, the purchase card is also authorized to be used in greater dollar amounts to place a task or delivery order under an existing contract (if authorized in the basic contract, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement) and to make payments under existing contracts when the contractor agrees to accept payment by the card.", "GSA administers the purchase card program governmentwide. This program has issued more than 2 million purchase cards to federal employees at government agencies, organizations, and Native American tribes. Purchase card volume increased by almost $1.5 billion, to $13.8 billion, between fiscal years 2000 and 2001.

An estimated 4 million U.S. merchants accept MasterCard, Visa, or both, and at least 2.1 million of these merchants did business with the government in fiscal year 2001.Because the banks that issue purchase cards do not have access to data on all of the merchants accepting the cards, MasterCard and Visa collected this information on the banks\u2019 behalf, contracting in one case with Austin- Tetra, a private firm, to assist in the task.

However, this information is not useful because the data collected were inconsistent and incomplete, making them unreliable. The lack of clear definitions and guidelines from GSA for the collection of socioeconomic data resulted in inconsistent reporting by the banks and payment card associations. In addition, some available sources of socioeconomic data are incomplete and unreliable.

However, in its initial data collection effort, GSA did not precisely define the information it was requesting or clearly specify the criteria to be used by the banks and associations as they categorized merchants. Therefore, the data reported to GSA contained widely varying information on the socioeconomic status of merchants. The following are examples of the inconsistencies we found:   A payment card association, reporting on behalf of some of the card- issuing banks, reported that it had socioeconomic information for 89 percent of the merchants, while another bank reported that it had this information for 23 percent of the merchants. These differences do not reflect relative success or failure in collecting the information; rather, they were due to varying interpretations of GSA\u2019s guidance.", "Neither the associations nor the banks reported the number of merchants whose socioeconomic status was unknown. As a result, the information presents an incomplete and misleading picture of the socioeconomic status of purchase card merchants.", "MasterCard, Visa, and the banks used different methods to classify merchants. One method placed businesses that were corporations but where no socioeconomic data were available in the same category with large businesses. Another method followed SBA standards more closely in categorizing the size of businesses.", "In one case, GSA\u2019s guidance compounded the problem. GSA instructed banks to use the criterion of 500 employees or fewer to identify small businesses, if no other verification was available, rather than directing them to follow SBA\u2019s guidance that ties size to specific industry classifications. SBA officials, who had not been involved in GSA\u2019s initial data collection effort, raised concerns about this definition and are now providing GSA with assistance in determining appropriate guidelines to categorize the data.

The banks and payment card associations were only able to establish merchants\u2019 size or socioeconomic status for about 40 percent of total purchase card dollars because, in some cases, available data sources did not provide complete and reliable information. For example, Pro-Net yielded information on size status for only 9.5 percent of merchants. While some categories of small businesses are required to register in SBA\u2019s Pro-Net in order to be certified, other categories of small business are not required to register. Therefore, businesses requiring certification, such as HUBZone and small disadvantaged businesses, are easier to categorize than businesses for which registration is voluntary, such as woman-owned small businesses.", "Further, according to industry officials, it is not uncommon for the data in some merchant transaction data fields to contain incorrect information. For example, merchants sometimes place their customer service telephone numbers in the field designated for city so that their telephone number is included on the customer\u2019s credit card statement. In our review of MasterCard and Visa reports and merchant data files, we found obvious errors such as this, as well as duplicate files for the same merchant, the same telephone number for multiple businesses, and missing zip codes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA, Agencies, and Private Sector Working to Improve Data", "paragraphs": ["Since the spring of 2002, GSA has been working with SBA and other agencies to create more specific guidance for banks and payment card associations.

Visa has been involved in two campaigns to collect and update merchant data. According to Visa officials, as recently as last year, Visa mailed half a million letters to merchants requesting socioeconomic information, but less than 2 percent of merchants responded. In January 2000, MasterCard sent out 30,000 letters on behalf of DOD to current DOD suppliers accepting the government MasterCard from DOD buyers.

Of the roughly 360,000 vendors with whom DOD uses the purchase card, very few were included in government databases.

The official noted that there is a tradeoff between the desired level of accuracy and the cost of obtaining socioeconomic information on purchase card merchants. He said that, because the purchase card makes up a relatively small proportion of total procurement dollars, the level of granularity the government is requesting might not be worth the dollars needed to obtain this information on each merchant.

For example, defining a universe of merchants from which to draw a sample would be difficult, as the amount of information available for each merchant varies widely. Because so little basic information on merchants exists, a representative sample cannot be ensured. The lack of contact information due to missing or inaccurate data would make it impossible to reach some of the merchants. Because of short life cycles, small businesses are generally more difficult to track. Given that response rates to surveys of small businesses have historically been low, high error rates can also be expected. Without basic information to describe the universe, it would be impossible to determine whether response bias exists. Further, the impact of the use of the purchase card on small businesses cannot be determined without prior years\u2019 data.
