Such efforts help state and local election officials protect various election assets from threats (see figure).", "In August 2019, the CISA Director identified election security as one of the agency's top five operational priorities. CISA security advisors, who are located throughout the country, consult with state and local election officials and identify voluntary, no cost services that CISA can provide. According to CISA, as of November 2019, 24 cybersecurity advisors and 100 protective security advisors perform and coordinate cyber and physical security assessments for the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Election Infrastructure Subsector. Technical teams at CISA headquarters generally provide the services, once requested.", "To further assist state and local election officials, CISA conducted two exercises simulating real-world events and risks facing election infrastructure in August 2018 and June 2019. According to CISA, the 2019 exercise included 47 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, CISA has funded the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC). According to CISA officials, the EI-ISAC is the primary mechanism for exchanging information about threats and vulnerabilities throughout the election community. The EI-ISAC director reported that, as of November 2019, its members included 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 2,267 local election jurisdictions, an increase from 1,384 local jurisdictions that were members in 2018. As a result of its efforts, CISA has provided a variety of services to states and local election jurisdictions in the past 2 years (see table).", "State election officials with whom GAO spoke were generally satisfied with CISA's support to secure their election infrastructure. Specifically, officials from seven of the eight states GAO contacted said that they were very satisfied with CISA's election-related work. Also, officials from each of the eight states spoke positively about the information that they received from the EI-ISAC. Further, officials from five states told GAO that their relationship with CISA had improved markedly since 2017 and spoke highly of CISA's expertise and availability.", "To guide its support to states and local election jurisdictions for the 2020 elections, CISA reported that it is developing strategic and operations plans. CISA intended to finalize them by January 2020, but has faced challenges in its planning efforts due to a reorganization within CISA, among other things. In the absence of completed plans, CISA is not well-positioned to execute a nationwide strategy for securing election infrastructure prior to the start of the 2020 election cycle. Further, CISA's operations plan may not fully address all aspects outlined in its strategic plan, when finalized. Specifically, according to CISA officials, the operations plan is expected to identify organizational functions, processes, and resources for certain elements of two of the four strategic plan's lines of effort\u2014protecting election infrastructure, and sharing intelligence and identifying threats.

According to officials  from six states, CISA\u2019s involvement in election security has increased the  officials\u2019 understanding of the threat environment that the election  community faces. They also said that CISA\u2019s involvement has helped  them to plan for cybersecurity threats and to prioritize their election  security efforts. For example, officials from one state said that CISA  recommended that the state set priorities and focus on risk assessments  and network segmentation.", "In addition, election officials from five states spoke highly of CISA\u2019s  expertise and availability. The officials said, for example, that CISA  regional and headquarters personnel were easy to get in touch with and  knowledgeable about the election community. As a result, the officials  said that they had better access to training opportunities and informal  advice.", "Further, officials from each of the eight states spoke positively about the  information that the officials received from the EI-ISAC. For example,  state officials said that the EI-ISAC updated them regularly on election  security incidents and vulnerabilities nationwide, allowing them to prepare  for potential incidents.", "Officials also stated that the EI-ISAC presented the information in a way  that was understandable to election administrators who may not have  backgrounds in information technology. For example, in a monthly  \u201cspotlight\u201d email, the EI-ISAC defines a key cybersecurity term and  explains to the election officials why it should matter to them. One official  told us that through membership in the EI-ISAC, the state has learned  about election security best practices from other states, and other officials  said that EI-ISAC allows them to maintain visibility of nationwide threats  and other election security issues. Officials from one state said that their  contacts through the EI-ISAC helped them to identify a point of contact at  social media companies so that they could inform the companies about  election-related misinformation being spread online.", "In addition, election officials from two states said that they have  encouraged or required local election jurisdictions to enroll in the EI-ISAC.  According to EI-ISAC officials, the number of local election jurisdictions  enrolled in the EI-ISAC increased from 1,384 at the end of 2018 to 2,267  in November 2019, and included all three election jurisdictions that we  contacted. Officials from two of the three local jurisdictions said that the  EI-ISAC emails were valuable. For example, election officials from one  local jurisdiction said that communication from the EI-ISAC is meaningful  and targeted to bolster their election security efforts. Election officials  from the other jurisdiction said that they use the EI-ISAC information to  improve their continuity of operations plans. On the other hand, officials  from the third local jurisdiction said that the information provided in EI- ISAC emails was too general and not specific enough to their  circumstances.", "Election officials from five states also spoke positively of the EI-ISAC  situational awareness chat rooms, which DHS hosted on its Homeland  Security Information Network. These officials stated that they  participated in and monitored the chat rooms on Election Day to maintain  awareness of any emergent election security issues nationwide. For  example, officials from one state said that the chat rooms helped them  receive real time notification of issues in other states and possible  solutions to those issues.", "In addition, as previously mentioned, one of CISA\u2019s major efforts was the  3-day tabletop exercises held in August 2018 and June 2019, which state  and local officials were able to attend remotely by video teleconference  from sites around the country. Elections officials from five states said that  the exercises conveyed important information and prompted thoughtful  discussions among state and local officials. Election officials from four  states said that the exercises helped them build relationships within their  states, and election officials from three states also said the exercises  helped to build relationships with federal agencies as well. In addition,  officials from four states said that they conducted or were planning to  conduct tabletop exercises modeled on CISA\u2019s exercises.", "Election officials from three states said that CISA\u2019s cybersecurity  assistance has helped them to assure voters that elections in their states  are secure or to promote election security efforts. For example, officials  from one state said that, when they get questions from the public about  election security, they tell voters that CISA\u2019s assessments have shown  that the state\u2019s election systems are free of malicious code. Election  officials from another state said that CISA officials\u2019 outspokenness has  created opportunities for state officials to discuss the importance of  election security issues with local officials. Additionally, officials from five  states told us they encourage local election officials to request election  security services from CISA to increase the security posture of the local  jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Cited Challenges Linked to DHS\u2019s Election Security Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Even though state and local election officials provided mostly positive  feedback on DHS\u2019s election security assistance, officials also identified  two challenges linked to DHS\u2019s assistance efforts. First, officials from  three states stated that it is challenging to find time to schedule election  security services. For example, officials from one state said that their  biggest challenge is to find time in their state\u2019s election schedule for  receiving CISA services because the state has seven to nine elections in  off years (that is, years without congressional or presidential elections).  Officials from another state said that they might have requested additional  election services from CISA if the state had more time in its election  calendar. However, none of the state officials with whom we spoke  attributed this difficulty to CISA, as election calendars are outside of  CISA\u2019s control.", "In commenting on this challenge, CISA officials said that they have tried  to accommodate states\u2019 and local election jurisdictions\u2019 needs, when  possible. For example, CISA started offering remote penetration testing  as an alternative to the risk and vulnerability assessment. The officials  said that the two services are similar, but the remote penetration testing  can be completed in fewer days and does not require CISA personnel to  be physically present in the election offices. CISA officials told us that  smaller jurisdictions sometimes prefer this option.", "Election officials also identified an additional challenge related to the  intelligence briefings that were provided by DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence  and Analysis for state and local officials with security clearances leading  up to the 2018 elections. According to Office of Intelligence and  Analysis officials, the briefings allowed state and local officials to become  more informed about the national threat picture, which in turn, allowed  them to adjust to the threat more effectively.", "Election officials from two states said that the intelligence briefings had  provided helpful contextual information about cyber threats. However,  election officials in two other states said that the briefings were not as  useful as the election officials had hoped because the briefings only  provided information that was already available publicly, and election  officials from another state said that they learned about a significant  election security issue possibly related to their state through news  reports. For example, an election official from a different state said that  the state learned about threats from the Department of Justice\u2019s July  2018 indictment against foreign intelligence officers.", "CISA officials stated that they are aware of this issue and have been  trying to improve the communication of intelligence information to state  and local election officials. For example, at a October 2019 hearing of the  House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, a CISA  senior cybersecurity advisor testified that DHS has begun working with  the Intelligence Community to rapidly declassify relevant intelligence or  provide as much intelligence as possible, at the lowest classification level  possible, to state and local election officials.", "CISA officials also told us that the agency has started working with  cybersecurity intelligence firms to provide election security information to  state and local officials without the need for national security clearances  or travel to secure facilities. According to CISA officials, two cybersecurity  intelligence firms provided webinars to election officials in September and  October 2019. CISA officials said that these firms have sophisticated  capabilities that they use to analyze information that is not classified. As a  result, the cybersecurity intelligence firms can more easily share  information with states and local election jurisdictions. CISA officials said  that state and local officials will benefit from these briefings because they  provide actionable threat information to election officials without requiring  them to have security clearances or travel to secure facilities."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "CISA Has Not Finalized Its Plans to Address Key Objectives and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["According to DHS planning guidance, strategic-level planning provides a  framework for guiding homeland security activities and generates the  objectives and priorities, which influence the roles, responsibilities, and  actions that are detailed in the operational-level plans. Further,  subsequent operational-level plans are to identify the tasks and resources  needed to execute strategic plans.", "Prior GAO work has shown that strategic and operations plans can help  further define capabilities, including opportunities to leverage resources.  Such plans can also provide a roadmap for addressing identified gaps  and better position an agency and its components to work collaboratively  and strategically with external partners, such as states and local  jurisdictions.", "CISA has begun developing strategic and operations plans for assisting  states and local jurisdictions in securing election infrastructure in  preparation for the 2020 elections. Specifically, CISA has developed a  draft strategic plan for securing election infrastructure, known as the  #Protect2020 Strategic Plan. According to the draft, CISA intends for its  strategic plan to be used to achieve the high-level goals and outcomes  called for in the agency\u2019s August 2019 Strategic Intent. The draft  strategic plan focuses on four areas, also referred to as lines of effort: (1)  protecting election infrastructure, (2) supporting political campaigns, (3)  raising public awareness on foreign influence threats and building  resilience, and (4) sharing intelligence and identifying threats.", "In addition, the draft strategic plan identifies several objectives for each  line of effort. For example, it includes three objectives for the protecting  election infrastructure line of effort: building stakeholder capacity to manage risks and handle  adversaries, through activities such as creating incident response and  communication plans and encouraging states to adopt and practice  them; providing technology services to stakeholders to monitor and secure  their networks, by promoting the use of CISA\u2019s voluntary services and  assessments, among other things; and  facilitating information sharing between the federal government,  private sector, and state and local partners by, among other things,  hosting situational awareness chat rooms prior to, during, and after  state and federal elections.", "As another example, the draft strategic plan identifies three objectives for  the sharing intelligence and identifying threats line of effort: partnering with private sector firms and vendors to improve cyber  threat intelligence, through activities such as developing threat  indicators and warnings;  cooperating across federal partners\u2014including federal law  enforcement and the Intelligence Community\u2014by, among other  things, advocating for the creation of a joint memorandum to  consolidate and highlight current knowledge on election threat  intelligence; and monitoring threat activity through actions such as using network  monitoring capabilities to spot malicious activity and reveal key trends.", "In addition, CISA officials stated that the agency has begun developing a  draft operations plan, known as the 2020 Election Security Operations  Plan. This plan is to\u2014in conjunction with the strategic plan\u2014describe key  organizational functions, processes, and resources employed to carry out  the agency\u2019s efforts in support of elections in 2020. CISA officials stated,  as of November 2019, that the agency intended to finalize the strategic  and operations plans by January 2020.", "However, as of January 2020, CISA\u2019s plans were not yet complete.  According to a CISA official, the plans were not finalized due to an  ongoing reorganization within CISA and limited staffing resources within  the Election Security Initiative.", "While CISA has drafted the strategic plan, the agency has not yet  completed a draft of its operations plan. CISA officials have noted the  importance of the operations plan to help ensure the agency is  adequately prepared to support election officials in securing election  infrastructure in advance of elections, which begin with presidential  primaries in February 2020, as well as subsequent primaries leading up  to the November 2020 general election.", "Further, CISA\u2019s operations plan may not fully address the four lines of  effort outlined in its strategic plan when finalized. Specifically, according  to CISA officials, the operations plan is expected to identify organizational  functions, processes, and resources for certain elements of two of the  strategic plan\u2019s lines of effort\u2014protecting election infrastructure and  sharing intelligence and identifying threats. However, agency officials did  not identify the extent to which the operations plan would address all of  the objectives from these lines of effort in the strategic plan.", "CISA officials also stated that the agency is unlikely to develop additional  operations plans for the other two lines of effort\u2014providing security  assistance to political campaigns, and raising public awareness on  foreign influence threats and building resilience. The officials stated that,  given the limited amount of time remaining before election preparation  activities commence, the agency decided to prioritize developing a plan  for the first line of effort that addresses the primary customers of the  agency\u2019s election services. In the absence of completed strategic and  operations plans, a CISA official in one region stated in October 2019 that  the region is moving forward with its own strategy for assisting states and  local jurisdictions because the 2020 election cycle is scheduled to start  with state primary elections in the region in March 2020.", "The lack of finalized plans can affect CISA\u2019s achievement of higher-level  objectives that take time to accomplish, such as building stakeholder  capacity and public awareness. Until CISA finalizes its strategic and  operations plans for supporting elections in 2020 and ensures that the  operations plan fully addresses all of the aspects of its strategic plan,  CISA will not be well-positioned to execute a nationwide strategy for  securing election infrastructure prior to the start of 2020 election activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CISA Identified Challenges Related to Its Efforts to Secure Election Infrastructure, but Has Not Documented How It Intends to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection Plan, which provides strategic  direction for national, critical infrastructure protection efforts, calls for  sector-specific agencies to coordinate lessons learned and corrective  actions and rapidly incorporate them to improve future efforts.

Following the 2018 midterm elections, CISA and the RAND  Corporation conducted two reviews of CISA\u2019s efforts supporting the  elections, in order to inform strategic planning and strengthen future  operations. The first review, conducted by the RAND Corporation under a  contract with DHS, assessed election security operations that CISA  undertook from January 2017 through the November 2018 midterm  elections. The review relied upon input from DHS personnel, the EI- ISAC, associations representing state election officials, and election  system vendors to identify lessons learned from CISA\u2019s activities to assist  in securing election infrastructure. In the second review, CISA conducted  an after action review covering its efforts to assist in securing election  infrastructure from September 2018 to December 2018, based on input  from personnel within DHS and its federal partners who participated in the  agency\u2019s election security operations.", "Both reviews identified various challenges that CISA needed to address  in its planning for 2020. For example, the RAND review cited challenges  related to the services and threat briefings CISA provided to states and  local jurisdictions. The review noted, among other things, that CISA:  lacked an approach for prioritizing its activities based on election  security risks, which could limit the agency\u2019s ability to dedicate  increased attention and resources to the jurisdictions with the highest  risk; did not adequately tailor services, which could have made it more  difficult to meet the resource and time constraints of customers such  as local election jurisdictions; and did not always provide actionable recommendations in DHS classified  threat briefings or make unclassified versions of the briefings  available, which may have hindered election officials\u2019 ability to  effectively communicate with information technology and other  personnel in their agencies who did not have clearances.", "Additionally, the CISA after action report identified a number of internal  operational challenges associated with its election-related efforts in 2018.  For example, the report cited: a lack of understanding by CISA headquarters staff of the roles and  functions of regional field staff, which led to redundant requests for  information from headquarters staff to regional staff;  the lack of a single agency-wide platform to maintain an awareness of  election threats, which resulted in confusion among CISA personnel  about which threat information was accurate and current; and  the inability of CISA personnel supporting election security operations  to access social media websites from situational awareness rooms,  which hindered their collection and analysis of threat information.", "Further, both reviews cited challenges regarding CISA\u2019s ability to manage  incident information and provide Election Day incident response  capabilities in the event of a compromise. For example, with regards to  the 2018 election, the reviews noted:  few capabilities that CISA field staff could quickly provide on Election  Day, which could limit the agency\u2019s timeliness in mitigating or  responding to an incident; a lack of clarity regarding CISA\u2019s incident response capabilities in the  event of a compromise that exhausts state and local resources, which  may limit knowledge about agency capabilities that are available; and a lack of outreach and situational reporting on incidents, threats, and  trends on Election Day from headquarters to regional staff following  the closure of the polls on the East Coast, which hindered CISA\u2019s  coordination of such information with state and local officials.", "While CISA identified challenges related to its prior efforts, it has not  developed plans to address them. According to a CISA official, the  agency does not intend to develop a separate plan addressing how it will  remediate the identified challenges in the RAND report. Rather, CISA  officials noted that the agency plans to address the challenges from that  report in the strategic plan and operations plan that it is developing. In  addition, the officials noted that CISA may address challenges through  other actions that the agency expects to take, such as hiring additional  staff.", "However, CISA\u2019s draft strategic plan, as of November 2019, had only  addressed three challenges from the RAND report\u2014countering the threat  of disinformation, clarifying how CISA is to support political campaigns,  and prioritizing outreach to local jurisdictions. The extent to which the  strategic plan, when finalized, will address the other outstanding  challenges remains unclear. In addition, the extent to which the  operations plan will document how the agency is to address challenges in  the RAND report remains uncertain as the operations plan has not yet  been completed. Further, CISA has not documented how the agency is to  address challenges in the RAND report through other actions that it  expects to take before the 2020 elections.", "Similarly, CISA officials stated that the agency intends to address a  subset of the challenges from CISA\u2019s after action report in its anticipated  operations plan.
