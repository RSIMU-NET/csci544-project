The technology component of SBI, which is known as SBInet, involves the acquisition, development, integration, and deployment of surveillance systems and command, control, communications, and intelligence technologies. GAO was asked to testify on its draft report, which assesses DHS's efforts to (1) define the scope, timing, and life cycle management approach for planned SBInet capabilities and (2) manage SBInet requirements and testing activities. In preparing the draft report, GAO reviewed key program documentation, including guidance, plans, and requirements and testing documentation; interviewed program officials; analyzed a random probability sample of system requirements; and observed operations of the initial SBInet project."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Important aspects of SBInet remain ambiguous and in a continued state of flux, making it unclear and uncertain what technology capabilities will be delivered and when, where, and how they will be delivered. For example, the scope and timing of planned SBInet deployments and capabilities have continued to be delayed without becoming more specific. Further, the program office does not have an approved integrated master schedule to guide the execution of the program, and the nature and timing of planned activities has continued to change. This schedule-related risk is exacerbated by the continuous change in, and the absence of a clear definition of, the approach that is being used to define, develop, acquire, test, and deploy SBInet. SBInet requirements have not been effectively defined and managed. While the program office recently issued guidance that is consistent with recognized leading practices, this guidance was not finalized until February 2008, and thus was not used in performing a number of important requirements-related activities. In the absence of this guidance, the program's efforts have been mixed. For example, while the program has taken steps to include users in developing high-level requirements, several requirements definition and management limitations exist. These include a lack of proper alignment (i.e., traceability) among the different levels of requirements, as evidenced by GAO's analysis of a random probability sample of requirements, which revealed large percentages that were not traceable backward to higher level requirements, or forward to more detailed system design specifications and verification methods. SBInet testing has also not been effectively managed. While a test management strategy was drafted in May 2008, it has not been finalized and approved, and it does not contain, among other things, a high-level master schedule of SBInet test activities, metrics for measuring testing progress, and a clear definition of testing roles and responsibilities. Further, the program office has not tested the individual system components to be deployed to the initial deployment locations, even though the contractor initiated testing of these components with other system components and subsystems in June 2008. In light of these circumstances, our soon to be issued report contains eight recommendations to the department aimed at reassessing its approach to and plans for the program, including its associated exposure to cost, schedule and performance risks, and disclosing these risks and alternative courses of action to DHS and congressional decision makers. The recommendations also provide for correcting the weaknesses surrounding the program's unclear and constantly changing commitments and its life cycle management approach and processes, as well as implementing key requirements development and management and testing practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Secure Border Initiative (SBI).

We plan to issue our final report on  September 22, 2008. Both the report and this statement are based on work  that we performed in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Radars mounted on fixed and mobile towers are  to detect movement, and cameras on fixed and mobile towers are to be  used to identify, classify, and track items of interest detected by the  ground sensors and the radars.

SBInet requirements are  to consist of a hierarchy of six types of requirements, with the high-level  operational requirements at the top. These high-level requirements are to  be decomposed into lower-level, more detailed system, component,  design, software, and project requirements. SBInet testing consists of a  sequence of tests that are intended first to verify that individual system  parts meet specified requirements, and then verify that these combined  parts perform as intended as an integrated and operational system.

Specifically, the program office does not yet have an approved  integrated master schedule to guide the execution of SBInet.

Only through establishing such  commitments, and adequately defining the approach and processes to be  used in delivering them, can DHS effectively position itself for measuring  progress, ensuring accountability for results, and delivering a system  solution with its promised capabilities and benefits on time and within  budget constraints. For SBInet, this has not occurred to the extent that it  needs to for the program to have a meaningful chance of succeeding. In  particular, commitments to the timing and scope of system capabilities  remain unclear and continue to change, with the program committing to  far fewer capabilities than originally envisioned. Further, how the SBInet  system solution is to be delivered has been equally unclear and  inadequately defined. Moreover, while the program office has defined key  practices for developing and managing requirements, these practices were  developed after several important requirements activities were performed.  In addition, efforts performed to date to test whether the system meets  requirements and functions as intended have been limited.", "Collectively, these limitations increase the risk that the delivered system  solution will not meet user needs and operational requirements and will  not perform as intended.
