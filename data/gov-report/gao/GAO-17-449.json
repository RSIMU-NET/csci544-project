This report identifies trends in the costs and annual prices that DLA has charged for commodities and distribution services; and evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to more efficiently use its network of U.S. distribution centers. GAO analyzed the most currently available DLA cost data, estimated and actual revenue, and prices for commodities and distribution services since fiscal year 2009; reviewed DOD documentation; and interviewed knowledgeable DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that since fiscal year 2009, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)\u2014the largest logistics combat support agency for the Department of Defense (DOD)\u2014had reduced costs and maintained fairly constant prices for commodities, such as repair parts, clothing, and food. When developing annual budgets, DLA has generally underestimated revenue from the sales of commodities. The underestimated revenue contributed to gains that were applied to future year prices in the form of reductions, and helped offset inflationary increases in material costs.", "GAO also found that since fiscal year 2011, DLA had reduced costs for distribution services (e.g., the processing and storing of inventory) by about 25 percent through the use of existing authorities to reduce infrastructure. However, DLA has often increased annual prices for distribution services by more than 10 percent due, in part, to a declining workload. DLA has generally overestimated revenue from the sales of distribution services. The overestimated revenue contributed to losses as well as to price increases in subsequent years as DLA sought to recover those losses.", "DOD has taken steps to increase the use of DLA's 17 U.S. distribution centers to improve efficiency of DLA's operations, but additional opportunities for efficiencies exist across DOD's network of approximately 256 U.S. distribution centers. In January 2017, DOD revised guidance to require storage of government-owned inventory at DLA's distribution centers instead of at privately owned storage when both are located in the same geographic area to reduce costs. DOD has also identified inefficiencies in the provision of its distribution services. Specifically, the military departments, along with DLA, provided distribution services using U.S. distribution centers that often were in close proximity to or located on the same installation. To address inefficiencies, DOD established a program to, among other things, decrease the number of U.S. distribution centers. In October 2014, DOD discontinued the program without implementing its plan to reduce the number of distribution centers. Though DLA has been able to use existing authorities to realign functions and demolish some facilities to gain efficiencies at its distribution centers, DOD officials told us the department needs Base Realignment and Closure authority\u2014a process whereby Congress authorizes an independent federal commission to review and determine whether to forward to the President for approval DOD's proposals to realign and close military installations\u2014to address any additional inefficiencies. GAO found, however, that DOD had not assessed the extent to which the department could further use its existing authorities to minimize unnecessary overlap or duplication in its network of distribution centers. Without assessing the use of its existing authorities, inefficiencies in DOD's network of U.S. distribution centers that the department has previously identified may remain."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD assess and direct the implementation of actions, as appropriate, that can be taken using existing authorities to close, realign, or dispose of existing infrastructure to more efficiently use the department's network of U.S. distribution centers.

DOD\u2019s goal in operating this system,  referred to as the department\u2019s supply chain, is to deliver the right item to  the right place at the right time and at the right cost. The Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA)\u2014DOD\u2019s largest logistics combat support  agency\u2014provides commodities and services to support U.S. military  forces. To operate supply chain management activities, DLA uses the  Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, a revolving fund whereby DLA\u2019s  customers pay for the support that they receive. In fiscal year 2015, DLA  generated $23 billion in revenue to reimburse the fund from supply chain  management sales to the military departments and other customers, such  as federal agencies and U.S. international allies. These sales included  commodities (e.g., troop support items such as clothing, medicine, food,  and consumable repair parts for weapon systems) and distribution  services (e.g., the processing and storing of inventory). While DLA aims  to stabilize its prices during each budget execution year, the military  departments have expressed concerns about fluctuations in distribution  service prices between budget years. In addition, DLA and the military departments operate a large network of approximately 256 distribution  centers. Some of these centers are co-located or in close proximity to  one another.", "For more than 25 years, we have identified opportunities for DOD to  improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its supply chain management  to support the needs of U.S. military forces while reducing the  department\u2019s spending to potentially make funds available for other  defense priorities. For example, in 1990 we added DOD\u2019s supply chain  management to our list of high-risk areas in the federal government due,  in part, to weaknesses in inventory management practices and  procedures in forecasting the demand for inventory items and other  challenges. In February 2017, we found that DOD had made significant  progress in improving inventory management, although additional actions  were needed to improve two other aspects of supply chain  management\u2014materiel distribution and asset visibility. Further, in June  2016 we reported on the military departments\u2019 efforts to implement a  2005 Base Realignment and Closure recommendation to transfer retail  supply, storage, and distribution functions from the military departments  to DLA to gain efficiencies in delivering these functions. We found that  the Air Force had transferred all of its retail functions to DLA and that the  Navy had transferred its fleet readiness centers\u2019 retail functions, but not  its shipyards, to DLA. We found that the Army and the Marine Corps had  not transferred their retail functions from their depots to DLA. We  recommended that DOD conduct business case analyses, drawing on  lessons learned, to determine if further transfers of retail functions are  warranted. DOD concurred with our recommendations.", "Senate Report 114-255 and House Report 114-537, to accompany bills  for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, include  provisions for us to evaluate DLA\u2019s overhead costs to provide  commodities and distribution services funded using the Defense-wide  Working Capital Fund. We examined material costs of commodities and  operating costs\u2014including direct and indirect costs\u2014to provide  commodities and distribution services. We also examined the  relationship between costs, estimated revenue, and the prices that DLA  has charged for its commodities and distribution services. Specifically, we  identified any trends since fiscal year 2009 in (1) the costs and the annual  prices that DLA has charged for commodities and (2) the costs and the  annual prices that DLA has charged for distribution services; and we (3)  evaluated the extent to which DOD has taken steps to more efficiently  use its network of U.S. distribution centers.", "For objectives one and two, we reviewed the process that DLA used to  set prices for commodities and distribution services. Specifically, we  reviewed cost data, estimated and actual revenue, and prices that DLA  ultimately charged for commodities and for distribution services. In  addition, we reviewed sections in DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation specific to working capital funds. For commodities, we  analyzed operating costs as a percentage of the material costs of  commodities sold, as reported in DOD budget justification materials  submitted to Congress for fiscal years 2009 through 2015. We began with  fiscal year 2009 to provide us with a 7-year period of data on actual costs.  Unlike for commodities, DOD does not have an approach to report DLA\u2019s  operating costs to provide distribution services in budget justification  materials for the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund because DOD is not  required to report this information. Therefore, we requested data from  DLA on its operating costs, including direct and indirect costs, for  distribution services for fiscal years 2009 through 2015. We began with  fiscal year 2011 because DLA did not have complete data available for  fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and ended with fiscal year 2015 because this  was the last full year available with complete data on actual costs at the  time of our review.

Our analysis ends with fiscal year  2015 because this was the last full year with complete available data on  actual revenue at the time of our review. We adjusted the estimated and  actual revenue into constant fiscal year 2015 dollars. We compared  estimated revenue with actual revenue for commodities and for  distribution services to identify any differences. We also analyzed data on  aggregate price changes for commodities from DOD\u2019s budget materials  from fiscal years 2009 through 2017. For distribution services, we  analyzed data on prices for selected distribution services from DOD\u2019s  budget materials from fiscal years 2009 through 2017. We adjusted the  prices into constant fiscal year 2017 dollars and calculated the annual  percent change. We interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD Comptroller) and Defense  Logistics Agency, Finance (DLA Finance) to obtain information on the  relationship between costs, revenue, and annual prices within the context  of the Defense-wide Working Capital fund.

Material cost is the cost of procuring a commodity  from a vendor (e.g., purchasing fabric and having uniforms sewn) and  operating costs are the non-material costs to provide a commodity  (e.g., storing uniforms and shipping once ordered). Operating costs\u2014 also referred to as \u201coverhead\u201d\u2014are further defined as direct or indirect  costs. A direct cost is associated with direct support to a specific  mission (e.g., labor to process uniform orders) while an indirect cost is  associated with support provided to multiple missions or agency-wide  operational activities (e.g., information technology). Both direct and  indirect costs can include labor and non-labor costs.", "Price adjustments: There are four types of price adjustments that can  be used to increase or decrease cash balances with the fund. These  include responses to revenue gains or losses as well as cash  surcharges, capital surcharges, and depreciations. DLA adjusts prices  for both commodities and distribution services based on revenue  gains or losses to remain revenue-neutral over time. In addition, DLA  may use cash surcharges, capital surcharges, and depreciation to  adjust prices for commodities. Cash surcharges are used to recover  unplanned investments in inventory to ensure that the appropriate  cash balance is maintained. Capital surcharges or depreciations are  used to cover the costs associated with capital or infrastructure- related investments, depending on the number of years needed to  recover the cost to prevent steep increases in the year-to-year price.", "Estimated workload: DLA\u2019s estimation of its customers\u2019 requirements  for a future budget year is based on input from the military  departments on their budget planning decisions and execution data  from prior years.

DLA officials told us they have  contributed to reductions in their operating costs, in part through various  actions such as improvements to customer delivery methods and  integration of information technology systems. For example, for items that  are readily available from commercial vendors, such as most medical and  subsistence commodities, DLA keeps operating costs low by not  purchasing or storing these items. Instead, DLA has these items shipped  directly from the vendors to DLA\u2019s customers when ordered.

When actual  revenue is more than estimated revenue, DLA must adjust future prices to  return the gained revenue to its customers. Similarly, when actual  revenue is less than estimated, DLA must increase future prices to make  up for lost revenue.", "In the fiscal years that DLA underestimated revenue for commodities, the  difference between the estimated and actual revenue ranged between 9.9  percent and 26.4 percent. For these years, DLA yielded a gain above  estimated costs that ranged between $1.9 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal  year 2015 dollars. According to DLA officials, in years for which they  underestimated revenue, the military departments had more workload  demand than DLA had initially anticipated. Specifically, the military  departments purchased more commodities than anticipated when DLA  was formulating the budget for that fiscal year, a process that typically  occurs more than 18 months earlier. Some of the difference can be  explained by unanticipated changes in DLA\u2019s actual workload that were  not part of the estimated workload demand. For example, in 2010, the  Defense Health Agency implemented a home prescription service that  increased revenue for DLA\u2019s medical supply chain group. Also, in 2014,  the firefighting equipment and materials, known as \u201cstock group 80\u201d, was  transferred from the General Services Administration to DLA, increasing  DLA\u2019s customers for the items to all federal, state, and local firefighters.", "In contrast, in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, DLA overestimated revenue by  3.2 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, and experienced lost revenue  of approximately $670 million and $970 million, respectively, in fiscal year  2015 dollars. These losses are much smaller in magnitude compared with  the gains in other fiscal years. The workload demand in these 2 fiscal  years was less than DLA had initially anticipated. For example, DLA  officials told us that the military departments\u2019 workload demand when  formulating the budget for fiscal year 2013 did not anticipate the  sequestration ordered in March 2013, which triggered a reduction in  spending authority across all DOD accounts funded with nonexempt  discretionary amounts. Also, when formulating the budget for fiscal year  2014, the workload estimates did not anticipate lower enacted funding  than DOD planned due to the Budget Control Act of 2011.", "Our prior work has found that, while challenging to do, the military  departments can take action to better estimate their workload demand for  commodities. For example, we identified weaknesses in the demand  forecasts for spare parts that have contributed to the military departments  creating at times inventory in excess of current need and backorders of  spare parts across DOD. DOD has taken steps to address weaknesses  in this forecasting for commodities through the implementation of the  department\u2019s Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement  Plan. As part of this effort, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness, in collaboration with the  military departments and DLA, began using two metrics to track and  monitor each organization\u2019s performance in accurately forecasting the  workload demand for spare parts.

According to DLA data, distribution services have experienced annual  losses ranging from $39.2 million to $352.9 million in every year from  fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2015, as shown in figure 4.", "According to DLA officials, they have generated less revenue than  estimated for distribution services because the military departments\u2019  workload demand was less than they had initially anticipated when  formulating the budget for the budget year at least 18 months earlier.  Some of the difference can be explained by unanticipated changes in  DOD\u2019s planned operations. For example, DLA planned in years 2008  through 2010, based on the military departments\u2019 estimates, that the  workload to move equipment and materiel from Iraq to other locations  would be greater in fiscal years 2010 through 2013 than the actual  workload demand for those years. Also, DLA planned in 2011 and 2012,  based on the military department\u2019s plans for withdrawal from Afghanistan  that the workload demand for processing inventory to these locations  would decrease in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. However, the actual  reduction in workload demand was greater than planned.", "DLA officials stated there are opportunities for the military departments to  improve their estimates of workload demand for distribution services. As  such, DLA has taken actions since 2014 to work with the military  departments to improve workload estimates by holding quarterly meetings  with senior-level military department representatives from their finance  and logistics offices. According to DLA officials, these quarterly cost  summits are used to discuss estimates of workload demand and how  differences during budget execution can affect DLA\u2019s cost recovery and  the military departments\u2019 budgets. For example, during the November  2016 cost summit, DLA officials provided 5 years of data for second  destination transportation costs\u2014a distribution service cost associated  with processing\u2014that compared the price each military department was  charged based on their combined workload estimates with the cost for the  actual amount each military department had used. DLA officials had not  previously shared these data with the military departments. DLA reported  that over the 5 years, two of the three military departments had used less  second destination transportation than their workload estimate and  cumulatively had overpaid by approximately $100 million, while the third  military department had underpaid by $12.6 million. In response to  questions during the cost summit about the status of the surplus  payments, DLA officials stated that any gains were returned through  reductions in price to all customers regardless of whether they had  previously overpaid or underpaid compared with their workload estimate.  DLA plans to continue to share data that compares estimates with actuals  to encourage the military departments to develop more accurate workload  estimates. In addition, DLA has proposed to the military departments to  not include second destination transportation in the price for processing,  but to bill separately for actual second destination transportation costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Has Often Increased Prices Significantly for Its Distribution Services", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2009, DLA\u2019s annual prices for distribution services have  often increased above 10 percent. DOD reports its annual prices for  distribution services in the budget justification materials, but does not  include information on the year-to-year change in price. Therefore, we  calculated the year-to-year change in annual price for four types of  distribution services to determine the trends in pricing. The four types of  distribution services\u2014covered storage, open storage, specialized  storage, and processing\u2014all experienced significant price increases. For  example, covered storage prices increased by more than 10 percent in 5  out of the 9 years reviewed. The largest increases in the price for all  distribution services occurred in fiscal year 2017, as shown in figure 5.", "As discussed earlier, any losses from prior fiscal years as a result of  overestimated revenue must be eventually recovered by DLA in its future  pricing. In addition to such losses, DLA\u2019s declining workload at its  distribution centers has also contributed to significant increases in annual  prices for distribution services. DLA officials told us that the costs to  operate these centers are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate based on  the workload. As DLA\u2019s workload has declined with combat operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan and through inventory reduction initiatives, DLA has  had to continue to apply the fixed costs of operating these distribution  centers to the declining workload. For example, in fiscal year 2009, DLA  spread the operating cost across a larger storage workload, which  resulted in an average cost per cubic foot for covered storage of $3.05,  but by fiscal year 2012 these costs spread across a smaller workload  resulting in an average cost per cubic foot of $5.67.", "Moreover, DLA\u2019s decision to delay recovering its prior revenue losses  when setting prices for distribution services in fiscal years 2014 through  2016 led to the largest price increases for distribution services in fiscal  year 2017 for the period reviewed. Specifically, DLA set lower-than-actual  prices to keep prices constant in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 while  military departments recovered from budgetary cuts due to sequestration.  In fiscal year 2017, DLA returned to its usual procedure and set prices  based on estimated costs, estimated workload, and prior years\u2019 losses.", "When we asked OUSD Comptroller officials about these price increases,  they told us that they do not separately track the aggregate price changes  for distribution services over time. Instead, the officials stated that they  can assess price growth in distribution services through the price change  information reported in the budget justification materials because the  costs for approximately 70 percent of DLA\u2019s distribution services workload  is included in DLA\u2019s prices for commodities. Moreover, when workload  decreases and DLA experiences prior-year revenue losses in providing  distribution services, the Financial Management Regulation allows DLA to  increase prices significantly to recover its full operating costs.", "DLA has taken steps to manage growth in indirect costs and to improve  workload estimates for distribution services. In addition, DLA officials  stated they have also sought opportunities to reverse the recent decline in  workload for distribution services in order to lower prices. Specifically, our  analysis of DLA covered storage shows that its usage declined from 70.8  million cubic feet in fiscal year 2009 to 42.1 million cubic feet in fiscal year  2015, a decrease of 41 percent. To address this decline in usage, DLA  reviewed how the department is consuming these services and found  instances where the military departments are using private storage for  government-owned inventory in close proximity to DLA distribution  centers. For example, the Army\u2019s Stryker program stores inventory in  commercial locations that are located near DLA distribution centers in  Anniston, Alabama and Puget Sound, Washington. DLA estimates  moving Stryker inventory from storage owned by private companies to  DLA distribution centers in Anniston, Alabama and San Joaquin,  California could save DOD approximately $4 million in distribution costs in  the first year. In addition, according to DLA officials, they found  instances where the military departments had moved storage workload  from DLA\u2019s distribution centers to their own storage facilities. DLA officials  told us that increasing their workload could contribute to reducing prices  and this could be achieved by changing, when appropriate, the military  departments\u2019 practice of obtaining distribution services outside of DLA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Could More Efficiently Use Its Distribution Centers, Including Those That DLA Operates", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken steps to increase the use of its U.S. distribution centers,  but additional opportunities exist to more efficiently use this network of  distribution centers, including those that DLA operates. For example, the  department has recently taken steps to address the military departments\u2019  use of private storage when DLA distribution centers are in the same  vicinity as the private storage locations. In January 2017, the department  revised DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition  System, to require that program managers who are responsible for  contracts with DOD maintenance depots store government-owned  inventory at DLA\u2019s distribution centers when located in the same  geographic area as those depots. According to officials, this revision is  intended to reduce unnecessary costs to DOD\u2019s total budget by utilizing  DOD\u2019s existing investment in DLA\u2019s network. In addition, the department  sought authority from Congress to make DLA\u2019s storage and distribution  services support available to defense weapon system contractors. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 provided such  authority under a 6-year pilot program whereby DLA and defense weapon  system contractors can enter into a separate contract for the storage and  distribution of materiel and spare parts used in the support of a defense  weapon systems contract.", "DOD has other opportunities to more efficiently use its network of  distribution centers to provide distribution services. Specifically, DOD  previously identified inefficiencies, including overlapping and duplicative  distribution service functions, across its distribution network. The Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics has the  responsibility to ensure that its policies and programs are designed and  managed to improve efficiency, among other things, and to use DOD\u2019s  existing systems, facilities, and services to avoid unnecessary overlap  and duplication and to achieve maximum efficiency and economy. As a  subordinate to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness has been delegated the responsibility  and authority to prescribe policies and procedures in the department for  the conduct of logistics and materiel readiness, to include supply and  transportation, among others. In carrying out this responsibility, starting  in 2010, DOD established a program called Strategic Network  Optimization that identified and undertook actions to address  inefficiencies in its distribution network. The program had a three-phased  approach with each phase primarily focused on one of the following  areas: transportation, inventory, and infrastructure.", "In the context of distribution infrastructure, Strategic Network Optimization  program officials identified in 2011 that DLA and the military departments  provided distribution services\u2014including storage and processing\u2014at 256  distribution centers in the United States that often are in close proximity to  one another and, in some cases located on the same installations. In  addition, they found that 91 of the distribution centers accounted for 95  percent of the total network\u2019s historical workload while the other sites  accounted for the remaining 5 percent. To address this issue, Strategic  Network Optimization program officials suggested a number of possible  actions to improve the efficiency of the distribution service network. In  January 2012, the Joint Logistics Board approved an approach whereby 5  DLA distribution centers were designated as the main suppliers within an  assigned region of the United States to the remaining 12 DLA distribution  centers, which are smaller, and to other distribution centers run by the  military departments. The 5 main suppliers would ship inventory to all  customers within the distribution network. Each of the other distribution  centers would be limited to providing service to local customers located  on its individual installation. See figure 6 for an example of the regional  consolidation that was proposed in the redesign of the U.S. distribution  network. This approach was intended to minimize DLA and the military  departments providing unnecessary overlapping or duplicative distribution  services by redistributing the workload. In addition, the workload  redistribution was to have decreased the number of distribution centers  within DOD\u2019s network and increased DLA\u2019s overall distribution services  workload.", "In October 2014, DOD discontinued the Strategic Network Optimization  program. By this time, DOD had implemented a majority of the actions for  the first two\u2014transportation and inventory\u2014of the program\u2019s three  phases. But DOD had not yet developed a business plan to guide the  implementation of the third phase intended to reduce infrastructure in the  distribution network through consolidation. According to DOD and DLA  officials, all of the remaining actions from the first and second phases of  the program were incorporated into normal business processes. DOD and  DLA officials acknowledged that unnecessary overlap and duplication  continues to exist in DOD\u2019s network of distribution centers. However, in  the case of the effort to reduce infrastructure, the officials stated that  without Base Realignment and Closure authority, they would not be able  to address unnecessary overlap and duplication in functions at DOD\u2019s  U.S. distribution centers, as many of the distribution centers are owned by  the military departments. According to DOD and DLA officials, proposals  within the department on the appropriate course of action to address  unnecessary overlap and duplication in DOD\u2019s network of distribution  centers have evolved since the 2011 study to include options for base  closures. In each annual budget request since fiscal year 2013, the  department has requested Base Realignment and Closure authority, but  Congress has yet to approve DOD\u2019s request.", "DOD has existing authorities it can use to minimize unnecessary overlap  and duplication and more efficiently use the department\u2019s network of  distribution centers. For example, DOD could use its existing authorities  to close or realign its installations and functions outside of a Base  Realignment and Closure round. However, if doing so would exceed  certain thresholds set out in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2687\u2014based on the number of  civilian personnel affected or potentially affected\u2014DOD must notify  Congress and wait 60 days after notification before taking any irreversible  actions. In addition, DOD has authority to dispose of real property  through demolition when a facility\u2019s condition has deteriorated. We found  that DOD had not assessed the extent to which it could use existing  authorities to minimize unnecessary overlap and duplication and more  efficiently use the department\u2019s network of U.S. distribution centers,  beyond the actions DLA has already taken. We previously reported that  while DOD makes hundreds of basing decisions a year that are not  subject to congressional notification, it has yet to take any actions that  require notification. In discussions about DOD\u2019s existing authorities,  officials at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy, Installations,  and Environment told us that the department does not believe 10 U.S.C.  \u00a7 2687 is a viable tool to achieve significant base closures because under  that section, DOD\u2019s authorities are narrowly circumscribed and the  statutory requirements are burdensome. However, other DOD  components could assess and implement similar actions as DLA using  existing authorities. Further, in discussing the current fiscal pressures  and budgetary constraints within the department and the need to reduce  lower priority programs to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act, DOD\u2019s  budget overview for fiscal year 2017 states that \u201cthe need to reduce  unneeded facilities is so critical that in the absence of authorization for a  new round of base realignment and closure, the department will explore  any and all authorities that Congress has provided to eliminate wasteful  infrastructure.\u201d While these actions may not entirely address  inefficiencies in its network of U.S. distribution centers, they could achieve  efficiencies and potential cost savings.", "Without maximizing the use of its existing authorities in the absence of a  Base Realignment and Closure round, DOD\u2019s network of distribution  centers will continue to result in inefficiencies and pose difficulties in  minimizing price increases for distribution services.
