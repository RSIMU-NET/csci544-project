Established between 1937 and 1977, PMAs sell electricity primarily on a wholesale basis with the legislated goal of encouraging widespread use of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers consistent with sound business principles. By law, they are required to give priority in the sale of federal power to public power entities, such as public utility districts, municipalities, and customer-owned cooperatives. These customers are referred to as \u201cpreference customers.\u201d PMAs helped make electricity available for the first time to many consumers who lived in rural areas.", "PMAs generally control and operate power transmission facilities, but do not control or operate the facilities that actually generate electric power.", "These power generating facilities are controlled by other federal agencies\u2014most often by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) or the Department of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The dams at which the power generating facilities are located also serve a variety of nonpower purposes, including flood control, irrigation, navigation, and recreation. The project must be operated in a way that balances all of these uses\u2014and, in many instances, power is not the primary use. Responsibility for operating the facilities to serve all of these multiple functions rests with the Corps and the Bureau, which are called the \u201coperating agencies.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Power-Related Appropriations to PMAs and to Operating Agencies Must Be Recovered Through Rates", "paragraphs": ["Unlike most other federal agencies, PMAs are required by law to recover through rates funds appropriated for power-related costs. Funding for the three PMAs is generally through the annual appropriations process. The PMAs receive annual appropriations and make both capital expenditures, such as for PMA-controlled transmission facilities, and operating and maintenance (O&M) expenditures. PMAs generally pay for these expenditures by requesting Treasury to cut checks on their respective appropriation accounts. The operating agencies also receive appropriations. The operating agencies allocate the portions of those appropriations that are used to fund power-related capital and O&M expenses to the PMAs for recovery from power rates.", "The allocated portion includes all capital costs and O&M expenses that are solely related to the generation of power. In addition, a portion of the operating agency\u2019s \u201cjoint costs\u201d are allocated to the PMAs. These are capital costs and O&M expenses related not only to power production but to the dam\u2019s other purposes. The operating agencies allocate the amount of joint costs that are power-related by applying a percentage established for each multiple-purpose project.", "PMAs recover these appropriations through revenues generated from power sales. The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 and the Flood Control Act of 1944 require PMAs to set power rates at levels that are forecasted as adequate to recover costs. The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 requires that rates for electric power be adequate to recover the power-related share of construction costs, to include interest charged at a rate of not less than 3 percent. The act also requires recovery of annual O&M costs and \u201cother fixed charges as the Secretary deems proper.\u201d The Flood Control Act of 1944 requires that rates for electric power be adequate to recover the cost of \u201cproducing and transmitting such electric energy.\u201d Power-related capital costs are to be recovered \u201cover a reasonable period of years.\u201d", "These legislative provisions have been implemented by the Department of Energy in DOE Order RA 6120.2 (September 20, 1979, as revised on October 1, 1983). This order specifies that the total revenues of any project administered by a PMA must be sufficient to recover O&M costs in the year incurred, to recover federal investment in generation and transmission facilities within a 50-year period, and to recover capital costs allocated to completed Bureau of Reclamation irrigation facilities that are beyond the capability of irrigators to repay (also called \u201cirrigation assistance\u201d). Under the order, capital investments have a longer recovery period than O&M costs. PMAs are generally required to recover, without interest, appropriations used to fund O&M costs in the same year that the expenses are incurred. In contrast, the PMAs are required to recover appropriations that fund capital investments (which we refer to as appropriated debt), with interest, over a specified repayment period. The recovery period is generally 50 years for assets used to generate power and 35 to 45 years for assets used to transmit power.", "The order specifies that the adequacy of power revenues be tested by the preparation of an annual study, known as a \u201cpower system repayment study,\u201d which is submitted by the PMAs for approval to the Secretary of Energy. This study forecasts power-related capital and O&M costs that the PMAs will be required to recover in the future. It also forecasts revenues expected to be forthcoming under current rates. If the study projects that revenues will not be adequate to recover power system costs over the remainder of the repayment period, rates may be increased or other cost recovery actions may be taken.", "During the year, PMAs generate revenues based on the rates they have established in accordance with the power repayment studies. The three PMAs bill customers for power sales. Southeastern\u2019s and Southwestern\u2019s customers generally make payments directly to a U.S. Department of Treasury \u201clock box\u201d at a bank. The bank processes the account payments and transfers the cash to Treasury\u2019s General Fund, where it is categorized as miscellaneous receipts. To finance their operations, Southeastern and Southwestern request Treasury to cut checks on their respective appropriations accounts.", "Western and its customers deposit collections directly to Treasury\u2019s \u201clock box\u201d or federal reserve bank and then the receipts are posted to various Treasury accounts. Western either seeks annual appropriations from these accounts to finance its operations, or for certain accounts has the legal authority to spend funds without further appropriations. Those Treasury accounts include the Reclamation Fund; Colorado River Dam Fund; Boulder Canyon Project Fund; Falcon and Amistad Operating and Maintenance Fund; Central Valley Project Restoration Fund; Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund; Upper Colorado River Basin Fund; and Colorado River Basins Power Marketing Fund. In this report, we refer to the recovery from revenues of power-related operating and maintenance appropriations and capital construction costs as a \u201crepayment\u201d or \u201cpayment\u201d to Treasury, even though in most cases the PMAs do not write a check or otherwise transfer funds to Treasury.", "Ideally, over the course of a year, collections received by Treasury will offset, or \u201crepay,\u201d amounts appropriated to the PMAs and operating agencies for O&M expenses, as well as an amortized amount of capital construction costs. The PMAs, pursuant to the DOE Order, monitor expenses and revenues to ensure that power rates are sufficient to generate revenue to recover expenses. The DOE Order prescribes the sequence in which PMAs are to offset expenses with revenues as follows: (1) operations and maintenance, (2) purchased and exchanged power, (3) transmission services, and (4) interest. The remaining revenues are to be applied to the balance due on any payments of annual expenses that have been deferred (these are called \u201cdeferred payments,\u201d which the Order requires be repaid with interest) and then toward the repayment of capital investments.

In all, it sold about 6.8 billion kilowatthours (kWh) of energy. The percentage of cost allocated to power by the Corps averages about 69 percent and ranges by facility from about 45 percent to about 81 percent.

Slightly less than two-thirds of the plants (and 56 percent of the capacity) have been added since 1960. In 1995, Southwestern marketed power to 95 customers, selling about 7.7 billion kWh of energy. The percentage of cost allocated to power by the Corps averages about 35 percent and ranges by facility from about 21 percent to about 68 percent.

Historically, investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and other electricity providers have operated as regulated monopolies. IOUs typically are required to provide electric service to all customers within their power service areas in exchange for exclusive service territories. To serve customers, utilities incur costs for building new generating plants and operating the power system. Through electricity rate charges, IOUs generally recover all costs incurred plus a regulated rate of return.", "Several key laws have resulted in an increasingly competitive electricity market. The Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) facilitated the creation of small (less than 80 megawatts of capacity) electricity generators that were exempt from many federal and state regulations. Called \u201cnonutility generators\u201d or \u201cindependent power producers\u201d (IPPs), these entities typically use new technologies, such as cogenerating plants or natural gas-fired generation units, to generate power. The National Independent Energy Producers estimated that, at the end of 1995, IPPs accounted for about 8 percent of the total generating capacity in the United States.", "IPPs pose a direct competitive threat to PMAs, IOUs, and other utilities, in part because they can build generation facilities near large industrial or municipal customers and sell power to these customers for a lower rate than the established utility. In addition, recent technological advances have significantly increased the efficiency of natural gas-fired generation units. The growth and increased efficiency of IPPs have placed downward pressure on wholesale electricity rates.", "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 promoted increased competition in the electricity market. The act encouraged additional wholesale suppliers to enter the market and opened the transmission of electricity by allowing wholesale electricity customers, such as municipal distributors, to purchase electricity from any supplier, even if that power must be transmitted over lines owned by another utility\u2014referred to as wheeling of power. Fees are paid to the transmitting utility for use of its system. Under the act\u2019s provisions, FERC can compel a utility to transmit electricity generated by another utility into its service area for resale. More recently, FERC has issued a final rule implementing this provision of the act. DOE has directed the PMAs to comply with the intent of the act and FERC\u2019s rule. According to Western and Southwestern, they have always operated with a policy of open access to their transmission systems on a first-come, first-served capacity available basis.

The DOE order states that all costs of operating and maintaining the power system, as well as the costs of transmission, should be included in rates. The order does not define operating and maintenance costs. Given the flexibility this lack of specific guidance provides, the PMAs have interpreted it to exclude certain costs from rates.", "To define the full costs associated with producing and marketing federal hydropower, we referred to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25, \u201cUser Fees,\u201d which provides guidance for federal agencies to use in setting fees to recover the full costs of providing goods and services. DOE Order RA 6120.2 does not adopt this guidance or otherwise refer to OMB Circular A-25. Nevertheless, the circular does offer a definition of full costs that is useful in identifying power-related costs that the PMAs do not now recover through power rates. OMB Circular A-25 defines full costs as all direct and indirect costs of providing the goods or service. This definition is consistent with that contained in federal accounting standards recommended by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and adopted by GAO, OMB, and Treasury.

The employee and the employing agency both contribute annually toward the costs of the future CSRS pension benefits. Since the employee and agency contributions toward CSRS pensions are less than the full cost of providing the pension benefits, the federal government must, in effect, make up the funding shortfall. In addition, neither the agency nor the employee pays the federal government\u2019s portion of postretirement health benefits, which will eventually be paid by the general fund of the Treasury. For 1995 alone, these unrecovered costs for the three PMAs were an estimated $16.4 million. The cumulative unrecovered CSRS pension and postretirement health benefit costs for the three PMAs totaled an estimated $436 million as of September 30, 1995. According to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) officials, pensions for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) are fully funded each year and cumulatively, so there are no relevant unrecovered costs. See appendix I for a discussion of our methodology for computing unrecovered pension and postretirement benefit costs.", "As with all other federal agencies, the full cost of CSRS pension benefits is not paid by the PMAs or the operating agencies. As required, CSRS employees and the agency each pay a fixed percentage\u20147 percent\u2014of the employee\u2019s salary to offset future pension costs. However, this combined contribution does not cover the full cost of the employee\u2019s future pension benefits, which amounted to more than 25 percent of salary as of September 30, 1995. Thus, the annual funding shortfall is more than 11 percent of every CSRS employee\u2019s salary.

The in-service dates for hydropower generating units range from January 1980 to September 1982. Total power-related construction costs were about $158 million as of the end of fiscal year 1995.", "The Truman Project has six generating units, also designed to operate as pumping units, which provide 160,000 kilowatts of capacity. However, because of excessive fish kills by the pumping units, the Truman project has never been operated at its 160,000 kilowatt capacity. Instead, only 53,300 kilowatts have been declared to be in commercial operation, and use of the pump-back facilities has never been commercially implemented. As a result, the Corps determined that it would be inappropriate to recover through Southwestern\u2019s power rates the costs associated with the units that have not been used commercially. The Corps prepared an interim cost allocation for this project that accounted for the fact that the project was not fully operational. Southwestern petitioned FERC to have the cost of the nonproducing portion of the assets deferred from inclusion in power rates until it becomes fully operational. FERC concurred as part of its approval of Southwestern\u2019s 1989 power rates. As a result of FERC\u2019s decision, Southwestern has deferred the inclusion of the estimated amount of the costs associated with the nonoperational units in Southwestern\u2019s reimbursable share of the project\u2019s costs. Thus, $31 million, which consists of capital construction costs and capitalized interest, has been deferred from recovery through power rates, reducing the total to be repaid from $158 million to $127 million. This deferral is accomplished through an adjustment to Southwestern\u2019s appropriated debt each year. According to Southwestern officials, the $31 million adjustment is not a permanent elimination of these costs from Southwestern\u2019s appropriated debt; these costs will be included in rates if the Harry S. Truman facility operates as designed.", "Through 1994 the Corps calculated the interest expense associated with hydroelectric projects related to Southwestern.

About $930,000 in interest associated with the Truman deferral was therefore not paid and was excluded from Southwestern\u2019s rates.

Unlike the PMAs and operating agencies, IOUs build new capacity to meet the future needs of customers. The higher construction costs for the other utilities shown in figure 4.2 reflects more recent construction of coal and nuclear plants. Many IOU and POG nuclear plants that were completed and are operating had significant capital construction costs, which is at least partly due to stringent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations.

POGs generally prepare financial statements in accordance with SFAS 71 since GASB has not addressed regulatory accounting for governmental entities.", "IOUs typically use the accrual basis (as modified by SFAS 71) to determine costs to be recovered through electricity rates, using depreciation to recover capital costs. Depreciation as a basis for recovery of capital costs provides a consistent, systematic method on which to base rates by recognizing the cost of the asset equally over its useful life. PMAs and POGs generally use a cash basis or debt service method of setting rates. Under this method, capital costs are recovered through rates as payments for the asset are made. For example, if a capital asset is debt financed, the cost would be included in rates when principal on the debt is repaid or scheduled to be repaid. Repayment terms between PMAs and POGs differ. POGs generally repay principal on debt in fixed annual or semiannual installments, whereas most PMA debt has flexible repayment terms and as such is not required to be repaid until the final year.", "Rate recovery terms for the various types of utilities vary. Depreciable lives of hydroelectric assets for the IOUs we contacted range from 22 years to 96 years, with most asset types exceeding 40 years. POGs\u2019 tax-exempt bonds are generally repaid over 18 to 40 years. PMAs have 50 years to repay federal appropriations for hydro assets. Therefore, even though the PMAs have flexible repayment terms, in some cases, their costs may ultimately be recovered sooner than the IOUs overall.", "The financial statements of the PMAs and POGs are presented on an accrual basis in accordance with SFAS 71. The financial reporting difference created by setting rates on a cash basis and reporting on the accrual basis is recognized in the Federal Investment (Equity) section of the PMA financial statements as accumulated net revenues. POGs generally eliminate a mismatch of income between cash basis rate-setting and accrual basis financial statements by recording an asset (liability) on the balance sheet with an offsetting credit (debit) to the income statement.", "There are differences among IOUs, POGs, and PMAs regarding the types of expenses included in power production costs and resultant rates. The types of expenses included in wholesale and retail rates are subject to approval by utility commissions and may be determined by legislation as well as accounting practices. We found that IOUs typically include all expenses in retail rates unless disallowed by a utility commission. If the utility commission deems that certain expenses do not benefit ratepayers, they will prohibit such expenses from being included in retail rates. For example, one state utility commission decided that advertising expenses, membership dues, lobbying fees, and nonutility operation expenses do not benefit ratepayers and therefore were not allowed to be recovered through retail rates. However, these costs are often recovered fully through wholesale rates because FERC generally allows such costs. An example of costs that FERC may disallow from wholesale rates is a portion of CWIP if FERC determines that the IOU has requested an unreasonable amount to be included in rates. Most POGs we contacted include all of their expenses in rates. PMAs\u2019 rates, on the other hand, do not include some costs, as discussed in chapter 2. However, PMAs are required to recover certain nonpower costs. For example, Western is required to recover the Hoover Dam Visitor Center costs, which are estimated at about $124 million. In addition, Western is required to repay about $1.5 billion of capital costs related to assistance on completed irrigation facilities (irrigation debt).", "According to FERC, often an IOU will determine within the first 3 years of construction that a project is not viable and halt construction so as to minimize expenses which will not provide benefit to ratepayers. Normally if an IOU halts construction on a project, it will pass these costs through to the ratepayers. A customer may challenge the inclusion of such costs in rates with the appropriate utility commission. The commission may then conduct a prudency test which serves as the basis for allowing such costs in rates. The purpose of the prudency test is to determine whether it was prudent to build the project at the time construction began. If so, then the cost of the abandoned project would be fully included in the rate base. Even if the project does not meet the prudency test, according to FERC, the ratepayers would still be responsible for some portion of the costs and shareholders would be responsible for the remainder of the costs. PMAs are not subject to FERC\u2019s prudency test.", "PMAs, because of DOE Order RA 6120.2, do not include project costs in rates until put into commercial service. The Russell Project, although not yet operational but determined viable according to Southeastern, was in construction for 16 years and has been awaiting commercial operation for the last 4 years. As such, costs related to the Russell Project totaling $488 million, including accumulated interest, are still in CWIP and excluded from rates. Compared to other utilities, the relative magnitude and length of time for Southeastern\u2019s deferral of Russell from its rates is unique.", "IOUs\u2019 and POGs\u2019 basic rate-setting methods also differ from PMAs. IOUs and POGs generally use a revenue requirements study. For IOUs, the revenue requirement is the amount of money the utility requires to cover its annual expenses while earning a reasonable rate of return for its investors. POGs follow similar methods but do not require a rate of return since they are publicly owned, although some may include an allowance to provide equity capital for the system. Power repayment studies are prepared annually by the PMAs to determine the adequacy of current rates and determine new rates. The power repayment study tests the adequacy of rates; it entails a 5-year cost evaluation period and recovery of costs within their legally permitted repayment periods. The study also forecasts power-related capital and O&M costs that the PMA will be required to repay in the future and projects future revenues based on current rates. If the study shows that revenues generated under current rates will be inadequate to cover expenses, new rates may be designed. Most of the unrecovered costs identified in chapter 2 are not included in the study and, therefore, are not included in the determination of rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing of Capital Projects", "paragraphs": ["The methods and costs of capital financing vary greatly among the PMAs, POGs, and IOUs. Federal power-related capital projects rely primarily on debt financing from Treasury. This financing is dependent on the appropriations process, discussed in chapter 1. POGs rely primarily on debt financing from the capital market for capital projects. In addition to debt financing, IOUs are able to use equity financing.", "PMAs have substantial balances of appropriated debt that have been used to finance the construction of hydroelectric and transmission facilities. As discussed in chapter 3, because of several factors, PMA interest rates on appropriated debt have been subsidized by the federal government. POGs and IOUs also issue debt to finance capital projects. POGs and IOUs typically go to the financial markets to issue various short-term and long-term debt instruments. POGs generally issue bonds that are exempt from federal and state income taxes. This results in POGs getting favorable interest rates on their debt. IOUs issue long-term debt and some short-term instruments, such as commercial paper. IOU interest rates are based on market forces and typically vary based on the bond ratings of the particular IOU. Unlike PMAs, IOUs and POGs have the flexibility to refinance debt in times of falling interest rates. However, as discussed previously, PMAs have the ability to repay higher interest rate debt first, thereby allowing them to effectively manage their debt costs.", "According to EIA, the average interest rate for 1994 for all POGs was 5.6 percent. For IOUs, it was 7.3 percent. The average interest rates of the POGs and IOUs we contacted for 1995 were in the same range as for the entire industry in 1994. For the POGs, the low was 5.1 percent and the high was 6.1 percent. The IOUs\u2019 range was 6.5 percent to 7.9 percent. In 1995, the PMAs\u2019 average interest rates ranged from 2.9 percent for Southwestern to 5.5 percent for Western.", "The Bureau has obtained financing for several capital projects from Western\u2019s customers, which we will refer to as \u201cthird-party financing.\u201d The Bureau has the authority to accept contributions from Western\u2019s customers to defray the costs of capital construction. As of September 30, 1995, outstanding third-party financing, or customer advances, amounted to about $154 million for the Hoover Dam capital improvement (uprating) program (Boulder Canyon Power System) and about $25 million for the Buffalo Bill project (Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Power System). The interest rates for the Hoover Dam uprating program range from 5.5 percent to 8.2 percent, and the interest rate for the Buffalo Bill project is 11.07 percent.", "Under third-party financing arrangements, Western customers provide funding (primarily from the issuance of bonds) to the Bureau to use for the capital project. The customers pay the debt service cost, and Western records the proceeds as a liability and records interest expense. Western then bills the customers for the production costs of electricity, including the debt service on the third-party financing, and credits the customers for the debt service costs. Essentially, this arrangement results in customers directly paying for capital improvements rather than paying for them indirectly through rates. Unlike the Russell Project, which was financed with appropriated debt, third-party financing shifts many of the risks of construction projects to the customers, who are responsible for the bonds, rather than the federal government.", "In addition to debt financing, federal power-related capital projects are financed using a method similar to revenue financing. Revenue financing is paying for capital projects with net cash generated from operations. Revenue financing for the PMAs occurs when power revenues exceed O&M expenses and the resulting net revenue is used to pay off appropriated debt on new projects or replacements in the first year of the repayment period. In effect, the capital appropriation is repaid in the year that it was made with revenue from current power customers. Southwestern, for example, has been able to keep its average interest rate at 2.9 percent by revenue financing its new projects that would have been financed at DOE policy rates. POGs and IOUs also use revenue financing for capital projects. To the extent a utility is able to finance capital projects from net cash flow rather than debt it will reduce future interest expense. In addition to revenue and debt financing, IOUs have access to equity financing. IOUs are able to issue common and preferred stock and typically pay a large portion of earnings out in common dividends. In 1994 the IOU payout ratio was 80 percent. Dividends represent a financing cost for IOUs.", "As discussed in chapter 1, PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt generally has terms of 50 years for generating projects and 35 to 45 years for transmission investments. Most of the PMA debt follows a \u201cballoon payment methodology,\u201d in which principal is due at the end of the repayment period with no required annual amortization. This differs from the IOUs we contacted, who reported maximum maturities on debt of 30 to 40 years. IOUs reported that they generally pay principal off in balloon payments at maturity, either through cash flow from operations or refinancing. POGs reported maximum maturities of 18 to 40 years; however, the POGs generally repay principal in fixed amounts each year. As discussed in the rate-setting section, inclusion of capital costs in rates for PMAs and other utilities varies from the cash (debt service) to the accrual basis.", "We noted several other differences in financing, including control of capital expenditures and placement costs. The PMAs and operating agencies face the constraints of federal budget pressures in obtaining capital financing. According to the Corps, the focus on the federal deficit has put pressure on PMA and operating agency budgets and has resulted in less funding for PMAs and operating agencies for hydropower capital programs. POGs and IOUs have more direct control over capital budgets. However, POGs and IOUs are thus subject to the scrutiny of the market, such as the bond rating system, which affects the appeal of the bonds to the investing public. IOU financing is also subject to the scrutiny of regulators.", "The PMAs, as federal agencies who are appropriated capital funds, do not pay any placement costs or transaction fees. In contrast, POGs and IOUs must pay placement costs. The POGs and IOUs we contacted reported placement costs from .09 percent of the face value of the debt offering up to 1.5 percent. In addition, IOUs reported placement costs on common and preferred equity offerings of about 3 percent.", "When compared to IOUs, PMAs and POGs are generally more highly leveraged. Figure 4.3 shows that the PMAs and POGs rely heavily on debt financing for capital projects.", "The PMAs\u2019 and POGs\u2019 ratios of long-term debt as a percentage of total assets are much higher than IOUs because PMAs and POGs finance most of their capital expenditures with debt rather than equity or revenue. IOUs may utilize a combination of debt, equity, and revenue financing which results in lower leverage. However, IOUs\u2019 also pay dividends to stockholders which are, in essence, a financing cost. This cost is not a factor in the calculation of interest on long-term debt to operating revenue in figure 4.3. If IOUs\u2019 common dividends were included in this calculation, then an average of 15 percent of IOUs\u2019 operating revenue would be paid for financing costs. There is an expected correlation between long-term debt to total assets and interest on long-term debt to operating revenue for each of the entities. Those utilities that utilize debt to a greater extent to finance capital expenditures have greater interest expense relative to operating revenue.", "The PMA ratio of interest on long-term debt to operating revenue would be much higher if interest rates were not subsidized by the federal government, as discussed in chapter 3. The ratio shown for Southeastern is higher than the other PMAs because of the Russell Project, which is incurring capitalized interest but generating no revenue. Southwestern\u2019s ratio is only 18 percent because of its low average interest rate of 2.9 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the PMAs stated that they are not truly comparable to other utilities because they have unique characteristics that make certain comparisons against other utilities of limited value. The PMAs stated, for example, that unlike \u201ctraditional utilities,\u201d they do not have a responsibility to meet load growth in their regions or the authority to acquire new firm power resources. The PMAs stated that it is inappropriate to compare their hydropower costs to coal and nuclear generation of other utilities.", "We agree with the PMAs that they are different from other utilities in the ways discussed in this chapter, including cost of production, types of generating facilities, payment of taxes, accounting and rate-setting, and financing. We also discuss in this chapter the different missions and responsibilities of PMAs, IOUs, and POGs. We believe that power customers are primarily concerned with production costs and resultant electricity rates, not whether the supplier is an IOU, POG, or PMA or whether the supplier is using coal, nuclear, or hydroelectric generation. Given increasing competition and electricity rates that are expected to fall, if the PMAs do not remain low-cost suppliers, then they may not be able to recover all power-related costs. Therefore, our discussion of the differences in power production costs between PMAs, IOUs, and POGs and the reasons for these differences is essential.", "The PMAs agreed with our statement in this chapter that PMAs are low-cost suppliers of electricity. However, the PMAs are concerned that our use of average revenue per kilowatthour (kWh) is overly simplistic and may mislead readers about the magnitude and causes of differences in costs between PMAs and other utilities. The PMAs do not believe average revenue per kWh takes into account differences in types of electricity sold that result in different prices. They believe a more accurate measure would be to compare similar products being offered by different utilities.", "The PMAs appear to be concurring with the results of our analysis but disagreeing with the methodology that led to those results. We continue to believe that the average revenue per kWh is a strong indicator of the relative power production costs of the PMAs as compared to IOUs and POGs. For PMAs and POGs, over time, average revenue per kWh should equal cost because each operates as a nonprofit organization that recovers costs through revenues. For IOUs, average revenue per kWh should represent cost plus the regulated rate of return. Given that a large portion of IOU rate of return (net income), 80 percent, is used to pay common stock dividends, which is a financing cost, average revenue per kWh also approximates power production costs for IOUs.", "We acknowledge in appendix I that we did not perform a detailed electricity rate comparison of PMAs to nonfederal utilities. We also state in this chapter that the price that any one utility charges another for wholesale energy comprises numerous factors. We believe that the PMAs\u2019 alternative methodology of comparing similar products being offered would provide a reasonable rate or price comparison. However, as the PMAs note in their comments, this analysis would be difficult, and the PMAs themselves have not done it. Also, the PMAs\u2019 proposed analysis would not necessarily result in a better indicator of relative production costs because different types of power may be sold above or below total production cost. Average revenue per kWh, on the other hand, better captures total production costs.", "The PMAs also stated that a related problem with using average revenue per kWh as a measure of the PMAs\u2019 competitiveness is the variability in output of PMA hydropower projects. The PMAs believe our use of average revenue per kWh to indicate competitiveness could result in wide variations in a PMA\u2019s competitive position from year to year. In order to address this factor, we reviewed the PMAs\u2019 average revenue per kWh for 1990 through 1994. For each of these years, the PMAs\u2019 average revenue per kWh was consistently at least 40 percent less than those of IOUs and POGs. We believe that this 5-year comparison is a strong indicator of the PMAs\u2019 current competitiveness.", "The PMAs also expressed concern that the report gives greater focus to advantages enjoyed by the PMAs without giving equal attention to other costs that the PMAs\u2019 customers must repay that would not normally be charged to nonfederal utility customers. The PMAs stated that we report that irrigation assistance is a large subsidy paid by Western\u2019s customers and suggested that we also note other examples, such as future replacement costs, the Hoover Dam Visitor Center, payments in lieu of taxes, and billions of irrigation investments that are not even in service.", "We believe that our report provides an appropriate discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages the PMAs have compared to nonfederal utilities. However, we believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The PMAs\u2019 use of hydropower plants built 30 to 60 years ago, tax-exempt status, unrecovered costs discussed in chapter 2, and the financing subsidy discussed in chapter 3, in aggregate, provide the PMAs with a substantial cost advantage compared to nonfederal utilities. We believe this large difference is reflected in the average revenue per kWh comparisons shown in this chapter and appendix V.", "We agree that the PMAs have disadvantages compared to nonfederal utilities, and we have more fully reflected those in this chapter. For example, we added the Hoover Dam Visitor Center as a nonpower cost that Western must recover through rates. However, we do not agree with the PMAs\u2019 statement that our draft report said that irrigation assistance is a large subsidy paid by Western\u2019s customers. Our draft report stated that \u201cas of September 30, 1995, according to Western, about $32 million of the total $1.5 billion of total irrigation debt has been recovered through electricity rates.\u201d To the extent that Western actually repays this irrigation debt, the power users are subsidizing irrigators. The billions of future irrigation investments that are not even in service are not costs that have been incurred, and it is questionable whether they ever will be incurred. To the extent that these planned future costs are included in Western\u2019s power repayment studies and impact current rates, the actual application of any relevant power revenue would be to other appropriated debt. We believe that until these future irrigation costs are incurred and repaid, or funds are set aside for their future repayment, they do not represent a disadvantage to Western.", "The PMAs stated that Southwestern\u2019s inclusion of future replacement costs in its current repayment study results in its rates being 10 to 15 percent greater than they would otherwise be. We do not agree with this statement. The actual application of the revenues generated by inclusion of these costs in current rates has been to current year capital appropriations or other appropriated debt. As a result, Southwestern has been able to pay off most of its recent, higher interest debt and currently has a weighted average interest rate of 2.9 percent compared to 4.4 percent for Southeastern and 5.5 percent for Western. In addition, as discussed in chapter 3, Southwestern has reduced its balance of appropriated debt from $769 million at September 30, 1991, to $686 million at September 30, 1995. Thus, we believe that Southwestern has managed its appropriated debt using sound business principles and has minimized its interest expense that must be recovered through rates.", "Another disadvantage cited by the PMAs relates to tentative project cost allocations. The PMAs stated that the tentative cost allocations may very well be higher, as in the case of the Clarence Cannon Project, than the final allocated costs. According to Southwestern\u2019s 1995 annual report, there are four projects that still have tentative allocations. Southwestern states in this report that \u201che amount of adjustments that may be necessary when final allocations are approved for these projects is not presently determinable.\u201d", "Because final allocations can either increase or decrease the percentage of costs allocated to power, the net effect of changes to allocations will not be known until all are finalized. Therefore, we do not believe that these tentative allocations represent a disadvantage to the PMAs."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
