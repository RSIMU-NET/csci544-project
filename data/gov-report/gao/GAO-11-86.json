For example, the scope of effort in ERA's work breakdown structure is not adequately defined, thus impeding the ability to measure progress made on contractor deliverables. These weaknesses exist in part because NARA lacks a comprehensive EVM policy, training, and specialized resources and also frequently replans the program. As a result, NARA has not been positioned to identify potential cost and schedule problems early and thus has not been able to take timely actions to correct problems and avoid program schedule delays and cost increases. ERA's earned value data trends do not accurately portray program status due to the program's weaknesses in implementing EVM; however, historical program trends indicate that future cost overruns will likely be between $195 million and $433 million to fully develop ERA as planned and between $205 and $405 million at program end.

Effectively managing projects entails,  among other things, pulling together essential cost, schedule, and  technical information in a meaningful, coherent fashion so that managers  have an accurate view of the program\u2019s development status. Without  meaningful and coherent cost and schedule information, program  managers can have a distorted view of a program\u2019s status and risks. To  address this issue, in the 1960s, the Department of Defense developed the  EVM technique, which goes beyond simply comparing budgeted costs with  actual costs. This technique measures the value of work accomplished in a  given period and compares it with the planned value of work scheduled  for that period and with the actual cost of work accomplished.", "Differences in these values are measured in both cost and schedule  variances. Cost variances compare the value of the completed work (i.e.,  the earned value) with the actual cost of the work performed. For  example, if a contractor completed $5 million worth of work, and the work  actually cost $6.7 million, there would be a negative $1.7 million cost  variance. Schedule variances are also measured in dollars, but they  compare the earned value of the completed work with the value of the  work that was expected to be completed. For example, if a contractor  completed $5 million worth of work at the end of the month, but was  budgeted to complete $10 million worth of work, there would be a  negative $5 million schedule variance. Positive variances indicate that  activities are costing less or are completed ahead of schedule. Negative  variances indicate activities are costing more or are falling behind  schedule. These cost and schedule variances can then be used in  estimating the cost and time needed to complete the program.", "Without knowing the planned cost of completed work and work in  progress (i.e., the earned value), it is difficult to determine a program\u2019s  true status. Earned value allows for this key information, which provides  an objective view of program status and is necessary for understanding the  health of a program. As a result, EVM can alert program managers to  potential problems sooner than using expenditures alone, thereby  reducing the chance and magnitude of cost overruns and schedule  slippages.

Specifically, NAR considers costs such as project management, research and develop concept exploration and planning activities, and operations of the syst em  to be nondevelopmental and thus excludes them from its projections. We  disagree that this reflects the true cost of developing the system. True  system development cost should include the costs for all program  a ept  cycle, including project management, research and development, conc exploration and planning activities.

NARA further stated that, as a result, the agency cannot know now  when new development efforts may start, or the scope or cost of such  development. As discussed above, NARA\u2019s cost distinction does not  provide for a comprehensive estimation of system development costs;  therefore, we believe our cost projections are sound.

Specifically, we compared program documentation  with EVM and scheduling best practices as identified in GAO\u2019s cost guide.  We characterized the extent to which the program met each of the 11  practices as either fully implemented (all sub-elements of the practice  were met), partially implemented (some but not all sub-elements were  met), or not implemented (none of the sub-elements were met). To have  fully implemented a key practice, the program must have implemented all  characteristics of the practice. We also interviewed program and  contractor officials (and observed program status review meetings) to  obtain clarification on how EVM practices are implemented and how the  data are used for decision-making purposes.", "To accomplish our second objective, we analyzed earned value data  contained in contractor EVM performance reports, program budget  reports sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as well as  past GAO work on ERA costs and system requirements. To perform this  analysis, we compared the cost of work completed with budgeted costs for  scheduled work in the contractor performance reports over an 18-month  period to show trends in cost and schedule performances.", "We determined that the earned value cost data were not sufficiently  reliable to estimate the likely costs at contract completion. As a result, we  developed an alternative methodology by using other historical ERA  performance data to make cost projections at contract completion, as well  as to make further cost and schedule projections about the system  development phase beyond the contractor\u2019s baseline plan. To do so, we  used our past work to identify the percentage of ERA requirements  completed through September 2010. Our alternative methodology was as  follows:    Completed requirements estimate: We divided the total number of  completed requirements by the duration (in months) it took to complete  them to calculate a productivity factor. We then multiplied this factor by  the remaining duration of the contract to calculate our estimate of the  percentage of requirements that will likely be completed at contract end.", "Low end of contract completion cost estimate range: We used the cost  overrun incurred to complete the amount of requirements described above  by the duration (in months) it took to complete them to calculate a burn  rate of overrun dollars. We then multiplied the burn rate by the remaining  duration to determine an estimated total overrun beyond what had already  been incurred.", "High end of contract completion cost estimate range: We divided the  current contract value by the total number of completed requirements to  calculate an efficiency factor. We then multiplied this factor by our  estimate of completed requirements at contract end (calculated as  described in the first bullet) to determine our estimate.", "Development phase schedule estimate: We used the productivity factor to  estimate the duration to complete 100 percent of the requirements (i.e., the  development phase).", "Development phase cost estimate range: We applied the same general  methodology as described above to determine both the low-end and high- end estimates.", "To generate our total life cycle cost estimates, we added the NARA- provided cost estimate for operations and maintenance to our estimated  development phase costs.", "To assess the reliability of the budget cost data, we compared them with  other available supporting documents (including financial reports to  OMB); performed limited testing of the data to identify obvious problems  with completeness or accuracy; and interviewed agency and contractor  officials about the data.
