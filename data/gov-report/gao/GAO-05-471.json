Key planning considerations for federal agencies include recognizing that the transition is already under way, because IPv6-capable software and equipment already exists in agency networks. Other important agency planning considerations include developing inventories and assessing risks; creating business cases that identify organizational needs and goals; establishing policies and enforcement mechanisms; determining costs; and identifying timelines and methods for transition. In addition, managing the security aspects of an IPv6 transition is another consideration since IPv6 can introduce additional security risks to agency information. For example, attackers of federal networks could abuse IPv6 features to allow unauthorized traffic or make agency computers directly accessible from the Internet. DOD has made progress in developing a business case, policies, timelines, and processes for transitioning to IPv6. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, including finalizing plans, enforcing policy, and monitoring for unauthorized IPv6 traffic.
