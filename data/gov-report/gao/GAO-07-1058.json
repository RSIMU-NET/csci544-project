DOD organized this request using program element (PE) codes, which are designed to convey key information about the budget request. DOD also provides documents called budget exhibits detailing the activities for which funds are being requested. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 mandated that GAO examine the program elements and budget exhibits. GAO assessed (1) whether the RDT&E program element code structure and the associated budget exhibits provide accurate, consistent, complete, and clear information, and (2) what factors contribute to any problems found.

First, one-third of the requested RDT&E funding is for efforts that are not identified as research and development in their program element codes. In addition, a majority of the remaining funding request misidentifies the budget activity (which is a classification of the stage of development and ranges from BA 1 for basic research to BA 6 for management support) as it is stated in program element codes. Second, some of the budget exhibits justifying the programs' funding requests do not provide consistent, complete, and clear information with suitable levels of detail needed to understand DOD's research and development efforts. GAO found that DOD budget exhibits were difficult to understand, frequently lacked information about the accomplishments and planned efforts of each project, lacked appropriate cross-references between efforts, and were frequently missing key schedule data. The RDT&E program element codes are not always accurate nor are the budget exhibits always accurate, clear, consistent and complete for two major reasons. First, DOD's regulation does not require identification of any RDT&E effort as such in its program element code if it is taking place on a weapon system that is approved for production or already fielded. This affects over a third of all RDT&E funds. Second, the regulation governing the structuring of the coding and the content of the exhibits is vague. For example, the regulation does not require the coding to be updated from one year to the next to ensure the correct stage of development has been accurately identified. The regulation also does not provide sufficiently detailed guidance to ensure consistency in the format and content of the budget exhibits. This results in budget exhibits being insufficient as decision-making tools, according to DOD officials."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2007, the Department of Defense (DOD) asked Congress for  $73.2 billion for research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E).  DOD organized this request for funds for more than 1,000 projects by using  the long-standing program element (PE) code structure. This system  produces a code that is structured to give decision makers key information  such as the development stage of the project. The PE code, for example,  describes whether the effort is for basic research in a laboratory on  directed energies, integration of weapon system prototypes, or upgrades  to long-fielded weapon systems such as the B-52 bomber. PE codes are the  building blocks of the defense programming and budgeting system, and  can be aggregated to display total resources assigned to specific programs,  to specific military services, or in other ways for analytical purposes. For  example, decision makers use the reported stages of development to  assess how much is being invested in fundamental science and technology.  These efforts determine the future capabilities of U.S. military forces.", "Each development effort that is assigned a unique PE code has its  activities detailed in accompanying documents known as budget exhibits.  DOD directs that these documents include such information as a  description of the effort, an assessment of progress, and the expected  accomplishments.", "Although other sources of information are also available to Congress  about some of these RDT&E programs, the decision to authorize and  appropriate funds for many programs is based primarily on budget  exhibits. Accurate classifications of programs and projects by budget  activity are needed for decision-makers to readily understand how  projects are progressing and on what money is being spent. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 required that we examine  the program element codes and budget exhibits. We responded with a  briefing to the committees in February 2007. In this follow-on report,  which summarizes the briefing, we assess:  1.  Whether the RDT&E program element code structure and the  associated budget exhibits provide accurate, consistent, complete and  clear information, and  2.  What factors contribute to any problems found.", "In conducting our evaluation, we reviewed pertinent program element and  budget justification policies and guidance; analyzed all of the fiscal year  2007 program elements and the associated budget exhibits for over 47 of  these programs; and interviewed officials from the offices of the Secretary  of Defense and each of the military services. We conducted our review  from June 2006 to July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Additional information about our  methodology is contained in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the DOD Financial Management Regulation (FMR), all major new  systems are to be identified with a unique PE code. PE codes have   10 positions. In general, each position conveys information, as seen in  figure 1.", "The first and second positions of the PE code illustrated above define the  Major Force Program (MFP), which contain the resources necessary to  achieve a broad objective or plan. In figure 1, for example, the \u201c06\u201d in the  first positions indicate this is a research and development effort. Because  it is a research and development effort beginning with \u201c06,\u201d under the  FMR, the third and fourth positions must define the budget activity. In  general, the budget activity codes that fill positions three and four are  intended to describe the current nature of the research and development  effort for each PE code. For example, budget activities 1 through 3 cover  initial development efforts and should describe activities that take place in  what is often called the science and technology realm. Research and  development efforts in these first three budget activities may produce  scientific studies and experimentation, develop paper studies of  alternative concepts, or test integration of subsystems and components.  Budget activities 4 and 5 cover efforts used to fully develop and acquire  integrated weapon systems respectively. Programs in these budget  activities may perform efforts necessary to further mature a technology or  conduct engineering and manufacturing development tasks. Budget  activity 6 funds efforts to sustain or modernize the installations or  operations required for general RDT&E. Test ranges, military construction,  maintenance support of laboratories, studies and analysis, and operations  and maintenance of test aircraft and ships are funded with this budget  activity.", "Budget activity 7 is used to designate R&D efforts for systems that have  already been approved for production or those that have already been  fielded. Unlike budget activities 1 through 6, budget activity 7 is not  indicated in a PE code. This information is seen in the accompanying  budget exhibits. Despite the fact that these are research and development  efforts, their program element code does not contain any indication that  they are for research and development.", "The FMR also requires that DOD justify the annual RDT&E budgets  requests in budget exhibit documents. These accompanying budget  exhibits are the primary information source for Congress and analysts  throughout the government. Generally, there are six sections in each  budget exhibit that are used to justify each funding request made using an  RDT&E PE code. These include a mission description and budget item  justification section; an accomplishments and planned program section; a  program change summary section showing total funding, schedule, and  technical changes to the program element that have occurred since the  previous budget submission; a performance measures section to justify  100 percent of resources requested; a section that shows connections and  dependencies among projects, which should also include information such  as the appropriation, budget activity, line item, and program element  number of the related efforts; and, a section providing a schematic display  of major program milestones that reflect engineering milestones,  acquisition approvals, test and evaluation events, and other key milestones  for the program events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Element Codes and Budget Exhibits Do Not Consistently Provide Key Information", "paragraphs": ["The program element code structure and budget exhibits do not  consistently provide accurate, clear, and complete information regarding  RDT&E budget requests. The PE codes given for many programs do not  indicate that they are for an R&D effort at all or do not accurately reflect  the reported nature of the development.

Under DOD\u2019s current regulation, programs in  this budget activity are not required to report in the code itself that the  funds are for research and development, nor are they required to report  the nature of the development effort. This budget activity was used to  request $23.5 billion in fiscal year 2007, or about a third of DOD\u2019s entire  RDT&E funding request. Instead, the information available about these  funding requests is contained in their budget exhibits.", "Programs classified as budget activity 7 do not begin their PE code with  06, which would identify them as RDT&E requests. Instead, budget activity  7 RDT&E efforts use PE codes that begin with the major force program  code established for the system being modified. For example, PE  0102419A, the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missiles Defense Elevated Netted  Sensor System (JLENS) program, provides no indication that the effort  uses RDT&E funds, nor does it identify the nature of the development. It  begins with 01, indicating it is for strategic forces and ends with A,  indicating that it is an Army request.", "In addition, we found that nature of the efforts funded in budget activity   7 overlap with the nature of the efforts undertaken in other budget  activities, making it difficult to determine the amounts requested for the  different stages of development across the entire RDT&E budget. While  the definition for budget activity 7 describes efforts that are fielded or  approved for production, several defense acquisition efforts covered under  budget activity 7 are involved in phases ranging from technology  development to production, as shown in figure 2. The JLENS program, for  example, is currently developing an aerostat for cruise missile defense, but  its code does not indicate that it is in system development and  demonstration. There is a separate code, budget activity 5, which also  funds efforts in system development and demonstration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Element Codes also Misidentified the Specific Nature of R&D Efforts", "paragraphs": ["We found that 65 percent of the RDT&E PE codes for budget activities   1 through 6 misidentified the nature or stage of the development in fiscal  year 2007. While the early development efforts described by budget  activities 1 through 3 generally properly identified the nature of the effort  in their codes, budget activities 4 through 6 generally did not, as seen in  figure 3. Programs reported in budget activities 4 through 6 requested  more than half of the total RDT&E funding.", "The challenge of clearly identifying the nature of the development efforts  is actually much worse when the budget activity 7 programs are  considered along with the misidentified programs in budget activities   1 through 6. As a result of these combined problems, the PE code provides  only limited visibility into 85 percent of the requested funding, as seen in  figure 4."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Exhibits Were Sometimes Inconsistent, Incomplete, or Unclear", "paragraphs": ["While reviewing a set of 47 RDT&E budget exhibits from fiscal years 2006  and 2007, we observed that some of the exhibits omitted key information.  While DOD presents some valuable information in these exhibits, we  found in many cases that the justification narratives were not clear or  provided little or no additional information from the previous year\u2019s  justification. In a number of cases the narratives appeared to be \u201ccopy and  paste\u201d descriptions of activities from prior years, making it difficult to  determine recent changes or program progress. We also observed that  information on accomplishments from the past year was provided for few  programs. In addition, few programs provided detailed narratives of  planned activities for the current budget year. For the few exhibits that did  contain narratives on planned activities, the level of detail was minimal.  For example, the Air Force Global Positioning System (GPS) Block III  program requested $315 million for fiscal year 2007 and had requested  $119 million combined in the previous 2 fiscal years. In this section, the  accomplishments were described as \u201cContinue Program Support and  Modernization Development for GPS III,\u201d and the planned program was  described as \u201cBegin Modernization Segment.\u201d", "Furthermore, funding changes from year to year were inconsistently  reported. In some cases they were provided at the PE code level and in  other cases at the project level, when the PE code involved multiple  projects. These funding change summaries also routinely provide limited  detail on the reasons for the changes. For example, the Navy\u2019s EA-18G and  DD(X) programs had funding changes of millions of dollars to their  previous and current budgets but failed to provide details of why these  changes had occurred.", "Additionally, the budget exhibits did not always identify the connections  and dependencies among related projects consistently as required by the  FMR. In general, these connections can be vital to the successful  development of some programs. In some instances, key components to a  system under development are being developed in other programs. A delay  or failure in one program can mean delay and failure in the related  program. For example:    C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) exhibit did not identify  all of the required information for related programs in the Navy and  Special Forces nor did it identify C-130 Talon II procurement, which  included C-130 AMP upgrades.", "DDG-1000 (formerly the DD(X)) destroyer program is developing dual- band radar that will be used on the CVN-21 aircraft carrier. No  reference is made to this link/dependency in the exhibit.", "Expeditionary Fire Support System is being developed to be  transported by the V-22 aircraft, but makes no reference to the V-22  program.", "Warrior UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is being developed in two  PEs\u2014one for the system and one to weaponize. Only one program  references the other.", "Our review found the schedule profiles in the budget exhibits were  generally provided but sometimes did not provide a detailed display of  major program milestones such as engineering milestones, acquisition  approvals, or test and evaluation events. Also, we could not find the  standard program milestones in a number of the schedule profiles we  reviewed. In some cases we found it difficult to determine the program\u2019s  phase of development. For example, in two cases the development  schedule showed \u201ccontinue development\u201d across all fiscal years displayed.  In another example, a program simply reported \u201cS/W Development\u201d with a  bar covering all fiscal years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Guidance and Practices Contribute to Reduced Visibility", "paragraphs": ["We found the RDT&E program element code and the budget exhibits are  not always accurate, clear, consistent, and complete for two major  reasons.

As a result,  these PE codes, accounting for one-third of the requested RDT&E budget,  do not identify the efforts as R&D activities and do not indicate the nature  of the R&D effort.", "In addition, the regulation is unclear on how or when program element  coding should change over time as the development progresses into a  different stage. As a result, even if the program element code is accurate  when a program is assigned a code, without updating the code, the  programs that successfully mature will automatically develop inaccurate  coding over time.", "Several DOD officials said that one of the reasons that the budget exhibits  are insufficient as decision-making tools is the lack of clear and consistent  guidance for the budget exhibits in the FMR. For example, while the FMR  requires a \u201cProgram Schedule Profile\u201d exhibit, it is not standardized. The  FMR provides examples of the budget exhibits that include an  \u201cAccomplishment/Planned Program\u201d section.

We recognize the importance to the department of enabling the  department\u2019s leadership to make decisions on the full scope of a program;  however, we note that program element codes also have the purpose of  providing important oversight information to Congress and the current  practice significantly lacks the clarity of the RDT&E funding justifications  to Congress. As we reported, RDT&E funds for programs approved for  production and fielded systems currently represents one-third of the total  RDT&E budget. As a result, we believe this level of investment warrants  improved clarity. We have modified the wording in the recommendation to  focus on providing clearer information to Congress either through the  program element code structure or the budget exhibits.", "DOD fully concurred with the second part of that recommendation to  ensure that the program element codes reflect the state of development of  the requested effort as it progresses toward production. DOD noted that  the program element structure accommodates this progression. However,  our analysis found that a significant amount of funding is misidentified in  the coding. DOD has not identified any proposed actions to correct this  misidentification.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation and will place  greater emphasis on proper reporting of program progress and planned  efforts as reported in its budget exhibits. However, DOD took issue with  developing a template, stating that it is doubtful any single template would  be feasible or desirable given the complexity of the RDT&E activity. We  believe more specific guidance is needed to ensure that DOD is more  effectively communicating the purpose for which funding is sought, the  progress made with prior funding, as well as the other key funding  justification information.

We also determined the number of program  elements that properly matched their assigned budget activity to  determine if guidance contained in the Financial Management Regulation  was properly followed.
