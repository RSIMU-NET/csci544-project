Congress has raised concerns over school preparedness, with a particular interest in how federal agencies provide assistance to school districts. This testimony discusses preliminary findings related to GAO's review of emergency management in school districts, including (1) the roles of federal and state governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to school districts for emergency management planning, (2) what school districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies, and (3) the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for emergencies, and communicating and coordinating with first responders, parents, and students. To obtain this information, GAO interviewed federal officials, surveyed a stratified random sample of all public school districts, surveyed state agencies that administer federal grants that can be used for school emergency management planning, conducted site visits to school districts, and reviewed relevant documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state governments have a role in supporting emergency management in school districts. While no federal laws require school districts to have emergency management plans, 32 states reported having laws or policies requiring school districts to have such plans. The Departments of Education and Homeland Security (DHS) provide funding for emergency management planning in schools. However, some DHS program guidance, for specific grants, does not clearly identify school districts as entities to which state and local governments may disburse grant funds. Thus, states receiving this funding may be uncertain as to whether such funding can be allocated to school districts or schools and therefore may not have the opportunity to benefit from this funding. States also provide funding and other resources to school districts to assist them in planning for emergencies. School districts have taken steps to plan for a range of emergencies, as most have developed multi-hazard emergency management plans; however some plans and activities do not address federally recommended practices. For example, based on GAO's survey of a sample of public school districts, an estimated 56 percent of all school districts have not employed any procedures in their plans for continuing student education in the event of an extended school closure, such as might occur during a pandemic, and many do not include procedures for special needs students. Fewer than half of districts with emergency plans involve community partners when developing and updating these plans. Finally, school districts are generally not training with first responders or community partners on how to implement their school district emergency plans. Many school district officials said that they experience challenges in planning for emergencies and some school districts face difficulties in communicating and coordinating with first responders and parents, but most said that they do not experience challenges in communicating with students. For example, in an estimated 62 percent of districts, officials identified challenges stemming from a lack of equipment, training for staff, and personnel with expertise in the area of emergency planning as obstacles to implementing recommended practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss emergency management in public  school districts. The nation\u2019s more than 17,000 school districts are  responsible for maintaining the safety and security of approximately   49 million public school students. Events such as the recent shootings by  armed intruders in schools across the nation, natural disasters such as  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, and potential pandemics have heightened awareness of the need for  school districts to be prepared to address a range of emergencies within  and outside of school buildings.", "My testimony today is drawn from ongoing work we have conducted for  this Committee and other congressional requesters on emergency  management in school districts. We anticipate completing the report in  June 2007. \u201cEmergency management\u201d refers to the range of efforts  involved in building the capacity to prevent, protect against, respond to,  and recover from an incident. Planning for such incidents varies by the  type and scale of the incident. The federal government\u2019s role in emergency  management is principally to support state and local activities and develop  the federal capabilities to respond effectively when state and local  governments require federal assistance. Some federal support comes in  the form of guidance and recommendations. Because the federal  government serves as a partner to all states, it is uniquely positioned to  observe and evaluate the range of emergency management activities  across states and local governments, including school districts, and  disseminate information on recommended practices and successful  strategies.", "My testimony today will focus on (1) the role of the federal and state  governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to  school districts for emergency management planning, (2) what school  districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies, and, briefly,   (3) the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for  emergencies and communicating and coordinating with first responders,  parents, and students. When discussing the federal government, I am  primarily referring to the three agencies included in our report\u2014the  Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Education (Education), and  Health and Human Services (HHS).", "To determine the role of the federal and state governments, planning  requirements for school districts and schools, and the types of resources  provided to districts, we conducted interviews with officials representing  DHS, Education, and HHS and reviewed relevant federal laws. We also  administered two surveys, one to state education agencies and one to state  administering agencies (the state agencies to which DHS disburses  emergency management funding) in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia. To better understand how school districts plan and prepare for  emergencies, we administered a mail survey to a stratified random sample  of school districts in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using a   95 percent confidence interval, all percentage estimates included in this  statement have a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent or less,  unless otherwise noted. To further understand the experiences districts  have had in planning for emergencies and communicating and  coordinating with first responders, parents, and students, we visited  selected districts in the states of Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, North  Carolina, Ohio, and Washington. In total, we conducted semi-structured  interviews, either in person or by telephone, with officials in 27 school  districts. We are conducting the review in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, federal and state governments support emergency  management in school districts with a range of resources and most school  districts have developed emergency management plans despite facing  challenges; however not all of these plans incorporate recommended  practices. Federal and state governments provide funding, guidance,  training, and equipment; and many states require school districts to  develop emergency management plans or engage in other planning  activities. However, funding guidance for some federal grant programs  does not clearly identify school districts as entities to which state and  local governments may disburse these grant funds. Therefore, some states  receiving this funding may be uncertain as to whether such funding can be  allocated to school districts or schools; and as a result, school districts  may not have the opportunity to benefit from this funding. At the local  level, school districts have taken a number of important steps to plan for a  range of emergencies, most notably developing emergency management  plans; however, in many districts these plans, or their implementation, do  not align with federally recommended practices. For example, many  school districts do not include procedures for special needs students in  their plans and many districts have not employed any procedures in their  plans for continuing student education in the event of an extended school  closure, such as might occur during a pandemic. Additionally, school  districts are generally not training with their first responders (i.e., law  enforcement, fire, and Emergency Medical Services ) and  community partners (such as the local head of government and local  public health agency), which are both federally recommended practices.  Finally, many school district officials said that they experience challenges  in planning for emergencies due to a lack of equipment, training for staff,  and expertise and some school districts face difficulties in communicating  and coordinating with first responders and parents, but most said that they  do not experience challenges in communicating emergency procedures to  students. We are currently considering recommendations that federal  agencies clarify and improve guidance to states and school districts to  better enable  school districts to incorporate recommended practices for  emergency management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS and consolidated most of  the federal programs and agencies with responsibilities for emergency  management into that agency. DHS serves as a federal partner to state and  local governments in emergency management. DHS provides technical  assistance and homeland security grant funding to states and local  governments to enhance their emergency management efforts. States and  local governments have the responsibility for spending DHS grant funds in  accordance with DHS guidelines to meet local emergency management  needs. In fiscal year 2006, DHS awarded $1.7 billion to states, urban areas,  and territories to prepare for and respond to terrorist attacks and other  disasters. States and local governments may then provide a portion of this  funding to a range of entities, as specified in DHS\u2019s program guidance.", "As we have noted in prior reports, emergency management requires  coordinated planning and implementation by a variety of participants.  Effective emergency management requires identifying the hazards for  which it is necessary to be prepared (risk assessments); establishing clear  roles and responsibilities that are effectively communicated and well  understood; and developing, maintaining, and mobilizing needed  capabilities, such as people, skills, and equipment. The plans and  capabilities should be tested and assessed through realistic exercises that  identify strengths and areas that need improvement, with any needed  changes made to both plans and capabilities.", "The hazards that school districts may face will vary across the country  depending upon the natural hazards to which their particular areas are  prone and an assessment of other risks for which they need to be  prepared, such as pandemic influenza or the discharge of hazardous  substances from nearby chemical or nuclear plants. Similarly, who should  be involved in emergency planning and response for schools, and the roles  of the various participants will vary by type and size of the emergency  incident.

Although the  number of special needs students in the schools is growing, our survey  finds that an estimated 28 percent of school districts with emergency  management plans do not have specific provisions for them in their  emergency management plans. Education officials told us that because  there is no agreement among disability groups on what the best practices  are for special needs students in an emergency, districts usually devise  their own procedures. According to these officials, some of these  procedures such as keeping special needs students in their classrooms  during some emergencies may not ensure the students\u2019 safety in an  emergency.", "Develop Procedures for Recovering from an Incident. Over half of all  school districts with written emergency plans include procedures in their  plans to assist with recovering from an incident, in accordance with  recommended practices. School districts\u2019 plans include such procedures  as providing on-site trauma teams, restoring district administrative  functions, and conducting assessments of damage to school buildings and  grounds.", "Develop Procedures for the Continuation of Student Education.  Few school districts\u2019 emergency plans contain procedures for continuing  student education in the event of an extended school closure, such as a  pandemic outbreak, although it is a federally recommended practice.  Based on our survey, we estimate that 56 percent of school districts do not  include any of the following procedures (see table 3) in their plans for the  continuation of student education during an extended school closure.  Without such procedures school districts may not be able to educate  students during a school closure that could last from several days to a year  or longer.", "Determine Lessons Learned. Based on our survey of school districts,  we estimate that 38 percent of districts have emergency management  plans that contain procedures for reviewing lessons learned to analyze  how well the plans worked in responding to a drill or emergency. Of the  remaining school districts, 53 percent indicated they have procedures but  those procedures are not included in their plans and 7 percent have no  such procedures.", "Develop Multi-Purpose Manuals. Some school districts have multi- purpose manuals that contain various types of information such as roles  and responsibilities for staff, descriptions of how to respond to different  types of emergencies, as well as site specific information for individual  schools to complete in order to tailor their plan. In contrast, other districts  provide less information. For example, one district\u2019s plan consisted of a  flipchart with contact information on whom to call during an emergency.", "Involve Local Government and Public Heath Agencies in  Developing and Updating Plans. School districts differed in the extent  to which they involve community partners in the development and  updating of their plans. Fewer than half of school districts with  emergency management plans involve community partners such as the  local head of government (43 percent) or the local public health agency  (42 percent) when developing and updating their emergency management  plans, as recommended by HHS. According to written guidance provided  by Education, those school districts that do not include community  partners in the development and updating of their plans may limit their  opportunity to exchange information with local officials, take advantage of  local resources, and identify gaps in their plan. More than half (52 percent)  of all school districts with emergency management plans report regularly  (i.e., at least once a year) updating their emergency management plans in  accordance with recommended practices. However, 10 percent of all  school districts had never updated their plans.", "Train with First Responders. Based on our survey, we estimate that   27 percent of all school districts with emergency management plans have  never trained with any first responders on how to implement the plans, in  accordance with federally recommended practices. The reasons why  school districts are not training with first responders are not readily  apparent. As we have previously reported, involving first responder groups  in training and exercise programs can better familiarize first responders  with and prepare first responders for their roles in an emergency as well  as assess the effectiveness of a school or district emergency plan.", "Train with Community Partners. School districts report training with  community partners\u2014such as local government and local public health  entities\u2014on activities to prepare for an emergency with similar frequency.  Specifically, we estimate that 29 percent of all school districts train with  community partners. As with first responders, the reasons for the lack of  training with community partners are not readily apparent. In our work on  Hurricane Katrina, we reported that involving local community partners in  exercise programs and training could help prepare community partners  and enhance their understanding of their roles in an emergency as well as  help assess the effectiveness of a school district\u2019s emergency plan.

For example,  officials in one Massachusetts school district we visited reported that they  do not have adequate locks on some of the doors to school buildings to  implement a lockdown procedure. In a North Carolina district we visited,  officials said a lack of two-way radios for staff in the elementary schools  hinders their ability to communicate with one another and with first  responders during an emergency. As demonstrated in these school  districts, the lack of equipment would prevent districts from implementing  the procedures in their plans and hinder communication among district  staff and with first responders during emergencies. In addition to not  having sufficient equipment, school district officials we spoke with  described a shortage of expertise in both planning for and managing  emergencies. These officials said their districts lacked specialized  personnel and training with which to develop needed expertise. For  example, district officials in 5 of the 27 districts we interviewed noted that  they do not have sufficient funding to hire full-time emergency  management staff to provide such training or take responsibility for  updating their district plans.

Eleven of these districts  have a system that can send instant electronic and telephone messages to  parents of students in the district. Despite having these methods, 16 of the  27 districts we interviewed experience difficulties in implementing the  recommended practice that school districts communicate clear,  consistent, and appropriate information to parents regarding an  emergency. For example, officials in a Florida school district said that  with students\u2019 increased access to cellular telephones, parents often arrive  on school grounds during an incident to pick up their children before the  district has an opportunity to provide parents with information. Thus,  according to these officials, the district experiences challenges in  simultaneously maintaining control of both the emergency situation and  access to school grounds by parents and others.
