From October 1992 to January 2018, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council used about 86 percent of the fund's roughly $1 billion, primarily on habitat protection and restoration of damaged natural resources. According to the council, all but 5 of the 32 natural resources and human services identified as damaged by the spill have recovered or are recovering. The health of Pacific herring is one example of a resource that has not yet recovered. Further, the presence of lingering oil remains a concern almost 30 years after the spill. In May 2018, GAO accompanied trustee council researchers to the spill area and observed the excavation of three pits that revealed lingering oil roughly 6 inches below the surface of the beach, as captured in the photo below. The Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council finalized a programmatic restoration plan in 2016; four trustee implementation groups have since issued initial restoration plans for designated restoration areas, and three anticipate issuing restoration plans in 2019 or later.

At  the time, this was the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Enacted  following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)  included several provisions to prevent and respond to oil spills, such as  requirements to assess damages to natural resources from oil  discharges, including spills, and to develop and implement plans for  restoration. Approximately 20 years later, in April 2010, an explosion on  the BP America Production Company\u2019s (BP) leased Deepwater Horizon  oil rig spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, setting  a new record as the largest oil spill in U.S. waters.", "OPA established a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d system, placing the primary burden of  liability and costs of oil spills on the responsible party for the vessel or  facility from which oil is discharged. Under this system, the responsible  party assumes, up to a specified limit, the burden of paying for spill costs,  including both removal costs (for cleaning up the spill) and damage  claims (for restoring the environment and paying compensation to parties  economically harmed by the spill). Above specified limits, a responsible  party is no longer financially liable, although there are exceptions if, for  example, the oil discharge is the result of gross negligence.", "Following initial response and cleanup efforts, restoration activities related  to a significant offshore oil spill, such as those from Exxon Valdez or  Deepwater Horizon, can endure for decades. Under OPA, federal, state,  tribal, and foreign government officials may be designated to act on  behalf of the public as trustees of natural resources. In the wake of both  oil spills, federal and state trustees entered into legal settlements with  responsible parties to resolve certain claims. In October 1992, the federal  government and the state of Alaska created the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill  Trustee Council (Exxon Valdez Trustee Council) to administer the $900  million civil settlement designated for cleanup costs, damage  assessment, litigation, and restoration after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In  April 2016, the federal government and affected states established a  memorandum of understanding that created the Deepwater Horizon  Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council (Deepwater  Horizon Trustee Council) to administer the eventual $8.8 billion  restoration fund to address natural resource damages resulting from the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill.", "OPA also established the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil  Pollution Research (interagency committee) to coordinate a  comprehensive program of oil pollution research, technology  development, and demonstration among federal agencies in cooperation  and coordination with external entities, such as industry, universities,  research institutions, state governments, and other nations, as  appropriate. Federal agencies of the interagency committee conduct and  fund research projects related to preventing, preparing for, responding to,  and restoring the environment after oil spills. Later in this report, we  describe in more detail the extent of research funded by the interagency  committee. In accordance with OPA, the chair of the interagency  committee\u2014a representative of the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard)\u2014 must submit a report to Congress every 2 years on its past and planned  activities for oil pollution research.

Among other things, we  recommended that the Commandant of the Coast Guard direct the chair  of the interagency committee, in coordination with member agencies, to  provide a status update regarding the revisions of the committee\u2019s  research plan and establish a more systematic process to identify and  consult with key nonfederal stakeholders. The agency agreed with the  recommendations, and the interagency committee implemented them by  publishing an updated Oil Pollution Research and Technology Plan  (research and technology plan) that includes a retrospective analysis of  completed research as well as a forecast of new research needs. In  addition, the interagency committee has employed several sources of  information to better understand ongoing research needs and activities  within industry, academia, and the government.", "To help inform offshore oil spill response efforts and decision making,  government, industry, and academic scientists conduct research on the  use and effect of various response techniques in different situations and  environments, such as the icy waters of the Alaskan Arctic and the deep  waters of the Gulf of Mexico. One such response technique used to  manage the environmental impacts after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill  was the application of chemical dispersants. In May 2012, we reported  on the use of dispersants and recommended that the Commandant of the  Coast Guard direct the chair of the interagency committee in coordination  with member agencies to, among other things, identify information on key  dispersant research in its research and technology plans and periodically  update and disseminate this information in its biennial reports to  Congress. We also recommended that the application of dispersants in  subsurface and Arctic conditions be among the areas prioritized in future  research. The member agencies generally concurred with our  recommendations. In its research and technology plan for fiscal years  2015 through 2021, the interagency committee identified dispersants as  one of the committee\u2019s standing research areas, specifically noting the  use of dispersants in cold weather conditions and deep sea  environments.", "You asked us to review issues related to the federal government\u2019s  response, restoration, and research efforts following the Exxon Valdez  and Deepwater Horizon oil spills.

We identified existing literature from 1989 (the year of the Exxon Valdez  oil spill) to March 2018 by conducting searches of various databases,  such as Scopus and ProQuest. We chose to focus on three primary  response techniques\u2014mechanical recovery, in-situ burning, and the use  of dispersants\u2014used to clean up offshore oil spills. Our subject matter  expert helped the team narrow the list of literature results and we relied  on 16 studies and articles that we determined were relevant to our  research objective. These studies and articles covered both regions and  the three response techniques, but each study did not cover the entire range of these topics. For example, some of the studies were focused on  one response technique in a specific region or environment. We  supplemented the list of studies from these databases with information  from our previous reports and those of the Congressional Research  Service, the National Academies Press, the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), the Coast Guard, the American Academy of Microbiology, and  the Arctic Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Program.

Although  the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council set a target of 5 percent administrative  costs in the 1994 restoration plan, according to a written statement that  the trustee council provided, administrative costs averaged around 6  percent from 1994 through 2001. The trustees and council staff we  interviewed told us that in hindsight the 5 percent target was unrealistic as  it did not reflect the actual administrative costs at that time, although such  costs were included in project budgets or were absorbed by federal and  state agencies. Therefore, in 2012, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council  changed the way it accounted for administrative costs and has included  these costs in the administrative budget. According to the trustee council,  under the new accounting policy, administrative costs were recalculated  and estimated at around 19 percent for the period 2002 through 2018.", "The remaining $210 million Exxon Valdez restoration trust fund balance is  held by the Alaska Department of Revenue in two interest-bearing  subaccounts. As of January 2018, the research subaccount and the  habitat subaccount each held approximately $105 million. In the 1994  restoration plan, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council established the need  for a restoration reserve to ensure that restoration activities could  continue to be supported after the final annual payments from the Exxon  Corporation were received in September 2001. According to the 1994  restoration plan, the trustee council planned to set aside $12 million per  year for a period of 9 years into the restoration reserve, totaling $108  million plus interest. In 1999, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council resolved  to transfer the estimated remaining balance of $170 million to the  restoration reserve and split the money into two subaccounts. Since  2002, the trustee council is to make allocations for its annual work plans  and ongoing habitat acquisition using these accounts.", "In 2010, the trustee council established a 20-year strategic plan to spend  the remaining trust funds using four 5-year incremental work plans. In  November 2010, the trustee council issued a call for project proposals for  the first 5-year work plan, for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Although  the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council solicited invitations on a 5-year cycle, it  has authorized money for each project annually. In a written statement,  the trustee council also stated that it continues to pursue and acquire  from willing sellers remaining parcels of land that prior studies have  identified as high-priority habitat. According to the Exxon Valdez Trustee  Council\u2019s long-term spending scenario, both of the subaccounts are  expected to be depleted by 2032 or earlier as determined by the market\u2019s  performance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Status of Restoration Efforts", "paragraphs": ["According to the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council\u2019s 2014 restoration plan  update\u2014its most recent assessment of injured resources and services\u2014 all but 5 of the 32 natural resources and human services identified as  injured by the spill have recovered, are recovering, or are very likely  recovered. In the 1994 restoration plan, the trustee council established  a list of resources and services that suffered injuries from the spill, and  developed specific, measurable recovery objectives for each injured  resource and service. The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council has  periodically assessed the status of those resources, most recently in  2014. As of the 2014 assessment, the following 4 resources were listed  as not recovering: (1) marbled murrelets, (2) Pacific herring, (3) pigeon  guillemots, and (4) one group of killer whales. In addition, the recovery of  Kittlitz\u2019s murrelets was listed as unknown. According to the Exxon  Valdez Trustee Council, the status of these resources in 2018 is largely  similar to their status in 2014 except that one population of pigeon  guillemots has likely increased as a result of a predator-control project  that the council supported. However, the overall status of this species has  not been determined. In a written statement, the trustees stated that the  trustee council plans to initiate its next assessment of injured resources in  late 2018.", "The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council remains particularly concerned about  the health of the Pacific herring population and the presence of lingering  oil. According to the trustee council\u2019s 2014 restoration plan update,  Pacific herring are considered an ecologically and commercially important  species that in addition to being fished for human consumption is a  source of food for various marine species. The assessment noted a  combination of factors, including disease, predation, and poor recruitment  of additional fish to the stock through growth or migration, appear to have  contributed to the continued suppression of herring populations. As a  result, the herring fishery has been closed for 23 of the 29 years since the  oil spill and has not met the trustee council\u2019s recovery objective. To  address concerns regarding the Pacific herring, the trustee council plans  to authorize additional money for ongoing Pacific herring research and  monitoring through the anticipated end date for the fund in fiscal year  2032, for an estimated total cost of roughly $23 million over 20 years.", "The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council also has concerns regarding the  presence of lingering oil in the spill area. According to a March 2016  report for the trustee council, approximately 27,000 gallons of lightly  weathered oil from the Exxon Valdez spill remains, located along almost  22 miles of shoreline at a small number of subsurface sites, where  oxygen and nutrients are at levels too low to support microbial  degradation. In May 2018, we accompanied researchers working with  the trustee council to the spill area and observed the excavation of three  pits that revealed lingering oil roughly 6 inches below the surface of the  beach, as captured in figure 3. According to the researchers, oil  previously recovered from this location was identified as belonging to the  Exxon Valdez oil spill. Evidence of exposure to lingering oil was observed  as recently as 2009 in a variety of marine species, including sea otters  and harlequin ducks, according to the 2016 lingering oil report. The report  also noted that the most recent studies show that the sea otter and  harlequin duck populations have recovered and that lingering oil is no  longer causing ecological damage. Further, studies demonstrated that  minimally intrusive remediation of the oil would only be effective at a small  number of sites, according to the 2016 report. Therefore, although the  trustee council has decided not to pursue remediation of the oil, it stated  that it has authorized money for projects to study the effects of oil and  lingering oil totaling over $16 million and will continue to monitor the oil to  document its physical and chemical changes over time. The Exxon  Valdez Trustee Council expects that lingering oil will persist for decades;  however, its representatives said that the evidence indicates that there  are no current biological effects of the oil.", "The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council\u2019s priorities for future spending are  outlined in the 2014 restoration plan update, and in addition to long-term  herring research and lingering oil, the priorities include long-term  monitoring of marine conditions and injured resources, shorter-term  harbor restoration projects, and habitat protection."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council Has Used 13 Percent of the Restoration Trust Fund, and Most Restoration Activities Are in the Initial Planning Phase", "paragraphs": ["Since the federal and state governments reached a final settlement with  BP in 2016 and the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council finalized a  programmatic restoration plan, four trustee implementation groups have  issued initial independent restoration plans. Specifically, the Alabama,  Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas trustee implementation groups have  issued initial restoration plans. According to the Deepwater Horizon  Trustee Council, the trustee implementation groups covering Florida,  Open Ocean, and Region-Wide restoration are in the midst of a multiyear  planning effort and anticipate issuing initial restoration plans in 2019 or  later. The trustee implementation groups are responsible for developing  and approving restoration plans and resolutions, which, when approved,  authorize money to be spent on restoration projects. This process  includes soliciting project ideas, submitting proposed plans for public  comment, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations,  such as the National Environmental Policy Act. According to the trustee  council, there is no specific timetable for approving future restoration  plans, as plans are approved on an ongoing basis\u2014typically for several  projects at a time. The four completed restoration plans, together with  early restoration spending and other activities, including planning and  administrative efforts, account for all authorizations made by the  Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council as of December 31, 2017, according  to NOAA\u2014the agency that manages the system the trustee councils uses  for financial reporting. As shown in figure 4, these authorizations include  approximately $1.1 billion, or 13 percent, of the $8.1 billion restoration  trust fund on five goals.", "The Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council has authorized roughly $460  million for habitat protection\u2014about 10 percent of the almost $4.7 billion  ordered for this use by the settlement. According to the 2016  programmatic restoration plan, habitat protection includes both  conservation acquisition and habitat enhancement, such as creating,  restoring, or enhancing coastal wetlands. For example, during the first  phase of early restoration in 2012, the trustee council authorized $14.4  million to the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to  create 104 acres of new brackish marsh at Lake Hermitage in Barataria  Bay, Louisiana. The project involved dredging sediment and planting  native marsh vegetation to restore marsh habitat damaged by the spill.  The project is currently in the monitoring phase. As of the end of 2017,  the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council had approved 34 habitat  protection projects, many of which were still in progress as of December  2017. The initial results of these projects include the restoration of over  4,000 acres of habitat and the creation of over 40 artificial reefs,  according to a written statement by the federal trustees.", "The trustee council has authorized roughly $349 million to enhance  recreational use\u2014about 83 percent of the almost $420 million ordered for  this use by the settlement. According to the 2016 programmatic  restoration plan, enhancing recreational use includes acquiring land along  the coast, building improved or new infrastructure, and improving  navigation for on-water recreation. For example, during the first phase of  early restoration in 2012, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council  authorized approximately $5.3 million to the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection to repair and construct boat ramps in Pensacola  Bay and Perdido Bay, Florida. Construction was completed in 2016, and  the project is currently in the monitoring and operations and maintenance  phase. As of the end of 2017, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council  had approved 43 projects to enhance recreational use, many of which  were still in progress as of December 2017.

According to the 2016 programmatic restoration plan,  restoring coastal and marine wildlife includes activities that restore the  resources, such as fish, sea turtles, and deep coral communities, which  contribute to a productive, biologically diverse, and resilient ecosystem.  For example, during the first phase of early restoration in 2012, the  trustee council authorized $11 million to the Mississippi Department of  Environmental Quality to deploy a mixture of oyster shells, limestone, and  concrete on 1,430 acres in waters off Hancock and Harrison Counties in  Mississippi. This material, when placed in oyster spawning areas,  provides a surface for free swimming oyster larvae to attach and grow  into oysters. The project is currently in the monitoring and operations and  maintenance phase. As of the end of 2017, the Deepwater Horizon  Trustee Council had approved 32 projects to restore coastal and marine  wildlife.", "Although the trustee council authorized millions of dollars to restore  coastal and marine wildlife, it authorized 1 percent or less of funds  ordered by the settlement for sturgeon, marine mammals, submerged  aquatic vegetation, and other seafloor species\u2014such as corals.  According to the 2016 consent decree, the Open Ocean implementation  group is responsible for authorizing the majority of the restoration funds  for these types of wildlife, but that trustee implementation group has not  yet completed its initial restoration plan. According to NOAA, the  complexity of restoring several of these resources necessitated additional  preplanning and restoration technique development prior to considering  specific restoration projects for several of these types of wildlife. The  trustee implementation group is developing two restoration plans that will  include projects for birds and sturgeon, as well as for sea turtles, fish,  marine mammals, and corals, according to a Deepwater Horizon Trustee  Council press release. The trustee council released the first draft plan for  public comment in October 2018, and plans to release the second plan in  early 2019.

The majority of the funding ($25 million)  was for administrative oversight activities, and the balance was for  monitoring. According to the 2016 programmatic restoration plan,  administrative oversight includes the costs for trustees to guide project  selection, implementation, and adaptive management. For the state  trustees, all administrative costs are covered by their respective trustee  implementation groups, and for federal trustees, all administrative costs  are covered by the Open Ocean implementation group. For example,  during the postsettlement phase, the trustee council authorized  approximately $6.6 million to Interior for (1) participation on the trustee  council; (2) restoration planning, plan development, and coordination with  other trustees; (3) environmental compliance reviews; (4) technical  assistance; and (5) financial management, among other uses. As of the end of 2017, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council had approved nine  administrative oversight and monitoring projects, which remained ongoing  as of December 31, 2017.

As  of the end of 2017, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council approved two  nonpoint nutrient reduction projects to address excessive nutrient loads in  Gulf waters but no water quality projects in Florida. For example, in  2017, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council authorized approximately  $224,000 to conduct restoration planning to develop, draft, and finalize a  restoration plan addressing nonpoint nutrient reduction, among other  goals. The trustee council has authorized few funds to date for this  restoration goal because, in part, the Florida implementation group has  not yet completed its first postsettlement restoration plan. In September  2017, the trustee council announced that the Florida implementation  group was reviewing water quality project ideas for its initial restoration  plan, and it released a draft of the plan for public comment in September  2018.

Further, according to the  literature we reviewed, these conditions determine which response  techniques are appropriate.", "Environmental conditions, such as ocean water and air temperature, can  influence the effectiveness of natural oil removal through evaporation or  biodegradation. These processes may occur more quickly in warmer  climates, such as in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of an oil spill,  communities of microbes can bloom to respond to the new supply of oil.  According to a 2011 report from the American Academy of Microbiology,  these microbes can biodegrade up to 90 percent of some light crude oil,  but the largest and most complex molecules\u2013\u2013such as the ones that  make up road asphalt\u2013\u2013are not significantly biodegradable. A 2016  study found that higher temperatures lead to increased biodegradation,  and increased salinity had a small positive impact on crude oil removal.  However, the American Academy of Microbiology report also states that  while microbes can biodegrade oil over time, the process may not be fast  enough to prevent ecological damage. Therefore, immediate containment  or physical removal of the oil is an important first response.", "The effectiveness of oil removal is also influenced by conditions of the  water, determined by wind, waves, and currents. According to literature  we reviewed, winds and currents can make it more difficult to remove the  oil, increasing the likelihood of the oil spill affecting larger areas and  additional plant and animal populations. Further, high seas and rough  waters can make some response techniques less effective. According to  a 2017 study that estimates the effect of environmental conditions on  deploying oil spill response techniques in the Arctic Ocean, most  response techniques are not suitable during Arctic winters, between  November and June.", "Literature we reviewed also shows that other factors influence the  effectiveness of response techniques, including oil type, oil thickness, and  the location and depth of oil spill events. Light crude oil typically  evaporates and biodegrades more quickly than heavy crude oil, which is  more viscous. However, if the oil slick is too thin, it becomes difficult to  contain and limits response options. Oil spilled in a remote location, such  as the place where the Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred, may complicate  response efforts because equipment and personnel are far away and may  not be able to respond within the window of opportunity before the oil  spreads.", "According to Coast Guard officials, during an oil spill response, various  response techniques are used to minimize the negative effects on the  water surface, water column, and shorelines, each with different  applications, advantages, disadvantages, and risks.

If the  oil slick is thin, it is difficult to achieve a significant rate of recovery and  requires a lot of equipment to concentrate the slick so it is thick enough to  be collected. According to literature we reviewed, mechanical recovery is  less effective during inclement weather or high seas because the oil  spreads and can emulsify in these conditions and is difficult to contain.  Low temperatures and the presence of ice also make it challenging to  achieve high recovery rates, and mechanical recovery becomes  increasingly ineffective as wave heights increase, according to literature  we reviewed.", "Furthermore, the process of recovering the oil is labor- and cost-intensive,  and recovery can be delayed if the equipment is not readily available.  Mechanical recovery is especially challenging to implement quickly when  spills occur in remote areas, such as with Exxon Valdez, or where the oil  is traveling quickly and broadly, such as with Deepwater Horizon. For  example, according to a 1999 EPA report, skimmers were not readily  available during the first 24 hours following the Exxon Valdez oil spill,  repairs to damaged skimmers were time-consuming, and continued  inclement weather slowed down the recovery efforts. In addition, a  disadvantage of mechanical recovery is that temporary storage for large  amounts of oil is frequently needed and recovered oil is generally brought  back to the shore for disposal, according to Interior officials. Because of  the resources required to physically remove the oil, it is difficult to recover  a large percentage of the spilled oil through mechanical recovery in large  oil spills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In-Situ Burning Can Efficiently Eliminate Oil but Has Potential Side Effects", "paragraphs": ["According to two studies and an agency document we reviewed, in-situ  burning can be a highly effective technique for eliminating spilled oil from  the sea surface.

In ideal  conditions, this method can quickly eliminate spilled oil. According to  several reports we reviewed, in optimal conditions, in-situ burning can  eliminate up to 90 percent of the spilled oil contained for burning with a  relatively minimal investment of equipment or manpower. Literature we  reviewed suggests that it is especially suited for response in Arctic  conditions, particularly in ice-covered water where logistics and  environmental conditions may preclude other options and where the ice  can act as a natural barrier to help keep the oil slick thick enough to burn.", "However, in-situ burning also has its disadvantages. Burning has a  narrow window of opportunity, and if the approval process takes longer  than it takes to prepare for the burn, the opportunity for using in-situ  burning may be lost, according to a NOAA document. Similar to  mechanical recovery, burning can only be used if the oil slick is a certain  thickness and when waves, wind, and currents are not too strong. In-situ  burning becomes increasingly difficult in strong winds or with waves over  3 feet tall. A second disadvantage is that the burn residue caused by in- situ burning may have negative effects on ocean life, though studies we  reviewed differed on this matter. According to a 2014 National Academies  Press report about oil spills in the U.S. Arctic environment, a series of  studies in the 1990s found that burn residues have little to no impact on  oceanic organisms. However, a 2015 review on burn residues from in- situ burning in Arctic waters concluded that not enough research has  been done on the side effects of burn residue from in-situ burning.  According to NOAA officials, another disadvantage of in-situ burning is  that the soot from inefficient combustion can result in unsightly and  unhealthy particulates that may affect any downwind populations before  the smoke dissipates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Dispersants Is Versatile but Its Effectiveness Depends on Several Factors", "paragraphs": ["According to Coast Guard officials, chemical dispersants are typically  used in conjunction with mechanical means and are considered when  offshore mechanical methods are recognized as inadequate because of  the spill volume, the geographical extent of the slicks, or specific on- scene environmental conditions.", "According to the literature we reviewed, an advantage of dispersants is  their versatility. Dispersants are not as limited by environmental  conditions as other response techniques, and they can be applied on  surface or underwater environments. Further, dispersants can be applied  through a variety of mechanisms. For example, they can be applied on oil  slicks at the water\u2019s surface by boats, planes, or helicopters. Dispersants  can also be used below the surface, through subsea injection at the site  of the spill, as was applied in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.", "However, the literature suggests that the effectiveness of dispersants  depends on many factors, such as the type of oil, type of dispersant used,  and sea and weather conditions. According to Coast Guard officials, the  decision to use dispersants is made after careful consideration of the  location of the spill, type of oil spilled, seasonal resources at risk, and the  environmental conditions at the time, as these factors influence the  effectiveness and practicality of using dispersants, as well as the  advisability of the tactic in the face of other options and risks. These  officials also noted that dispersants are rarely used in the United States,  but in certain situations, where mechanical means such as booming and  skimming may not be effective, dispersants may be considered.", "In addition to the uncertainty of their effectiveness, the potential  environmental risks associated with dispersants are also uncertain. One  2014 study states that while dispersants were thought to undergo rapid  degradation in the water column, there was evidence that the dispersants  remained on Gulf of Mexico beaches almost 4 years after the Deepwater  Horizon oil spill. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, responders  applied over 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants to the spilled oil\u2014 an unprecedented volume in the United States. It was the first major oil  spill to use dispersants on such a large scale, and approximately 42 percent of these dispersants were applied sub-sea in the first operational  sub-sea application of this technique. According to Coast Guard  officials, the toxicity and long-term effects of large-scale application of  dispersants on the ecology of marine life are unknown. According to  literature we reviewed, there is evidence that chemically dispersed oil and  some dispersant compounds may be toxic to some marine life, especially  those in early life stages. Coast Guard officials also said that continued  monitoring and further review of scientific research should improve the  understanding of the impact of dispersants on mitigating the effects of oil  spills as well as their overall environmental impact."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Following initial response and cleanup efforts, restoration activities related  to a significant offshore oil spill, such as those from Exxon Valdez or  Deepwater Horizon, can endure for decades.

The interagency committee has improved the coordination  of federal oil spill research efforts since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in  2010. However, the interagency committee has not systematically  reviewed its membership to determine which offices within current  member agencies are the most relevant to its mission and whether  adding other federal agencies as members would be beneficial. By  systematically reviewing its membership to determine whether any  additional agencies should be involved in coordinating oil spill research  and that the most appropriate offices within member agencies are  represented, the interagency committee could improve its ability to  coordinate research among federal agencies.", "In addition, the interagency committee does not coordinate with the  NRDA trustee councils that manage the large restoration funds and  monitor the restoration of damaged resources after a specific spill, such  as the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills.

To assess the  reliability of the financial data, we reviewed related budget  documentation; interviewed knowledgeable council staff about how fund  balances are recorded and reported; reviewed the totals for obvious  errors and inconsistencies; and reviewed internal control documents,  such as a database manual and standard operating procedures. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.", "We examined the approved restoration plans (1994 restoration plan and  2014 restoration plan update for the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and the 2016  programmatic damage assessment and restoration plan for the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill) and, when available, annual reports on  restoration activities (1994 through 2018 annual reports for the Exxon  Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (Exxon Valdez Trustee Council) and  2016 and 2017 annual financial reports for the Deepwater Horizon  Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council (Deepwater  Horizon Trustee Council)). We also reviewed project reports and scientific  studies that the trustee councils funded to gain a better understanding of  the status of restoration of injured natural resources, restoration priorities,  activities, and progress made by the trustee councils. We reviewed laws  and regulations that provide the legal authority for federal agencies to  intervene and respond after an oil spill, such as the Oil Pollution Act of  1990 (OPA), the Clean Water Act, and NRDA regulations. We met with  officials from the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council to discuss the distribution  of settlement money for restoration purposes after the Exxon Valdez oil  spill, and with officials from the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council, Gulf  Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council), and the  National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to discuss the distribution of  settlement money for restoration purposes after the Deepwater Horizon  oil spill. Additionally, in May 2018, we traveled to multiple locations in the  former spill area in Alaska to observe the extent of restoration efforts and  ongoing issues. Along with researchers sent by the Exxon Valdez Trustee  Council, we excavated three pits that revealed lingering oil about 6 inches  below the surface of the beach on Eleanor Island in Prince William  Sound. These researchers told us that oil previously uncovered at this  location had been linked to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In addition to  fieldwork in Alaska, in November 2017 and February 2018, we attended  public meetings in Alabama and Louisiana to learn about restoration  plans for the Gulf States.", "To examine the status of the interagency committee\u2019s federal oil spill  research efforts and how coordination of such efforts has changed since  we last reported on it in March 2011, we requested funding data and  project information on oil spill research from all 15 member agencies of  the interagency committee. We received data from the 9 member agencies that reported funding oil spill research projects from fiscal years  2011 through 2017. These 9 agencies provided data on agency  expenditures on oil spill research and the research category of any  projects funded.  We assessed the reliability of the data by reviewing  related documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and  reviewing agency internal controls for each of the 9 member agencies  that provided us data about the steps they take to maintain this  information. We determined that in most cases the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our report. However, we chose not to provide  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) agency  expenditures for oil spill research because NOAA officials were unable to  provide reliable data on the actual amount the agency spent on such  research during the time period we requested. In addition, some agency  officials we interviewed raised the concern that their agencies do not track  oil spill research funding and therefore the information they provided on  expenditures for such research may not include all relevant efforts that  could inform oil spill prevention, preparedness, response, and restoration.", "We also interviewed officials from the 15 member agencies to learn about  each agency\u2019s oil spill research efforts and participation in and  coordination through the interagency committee, and compared their  coordination practices to one of our federal leading practices for  collaboration for interagency groups to evaluate the interagency  committee\u2019s efforts to coordinate such research. We chose to focus on  the collaboration practice pertaining to participants because it appeared  to be the most challenging for the interagency committee based on the  findings of our previous March 2011 report, the actions taken by the  interagency committee to address our recommendations from that report,  and our own findings from our research for this report. In addition, we  reviewed the 2013 interagency committee charter, the committee\u2019s most  recent biennial reports to Congress covering fiscal years 2008 through  2017, and the committee\u2019s third multiyear research and technology plan  for fiscal years 2015 through 2021; attended two committee meetings;  and reviewed minutes of eight past meetings.

We identified existing literature from 1989 (the year of the  Exxon Valdez oil spill) to March 2018 by searching various databases,  such as Scopus and ProQuest. We chose to focus on three primary  response techniques\u2014mechanical recovery, in-situ burning, and the use  of dispersants\u2014used to clean up after offshore oil spills according to  knowledgeable stakeholders and the literature we reviewed. The  database search produced over 800 results. Our subject matter expert  helped the team narrow this list to 50 results, of which we relied on 16  studies and articles that we determined were most relevant to our  research objective of determining the effectiveness of various oil spill  response techniques in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico. Some literature  was not included if it was too specific for the scope of our review.  Literature published recently, generally within the past 10 years, was  considered more relevant. We supplemented the list of studies from these  databases with literature from the Congressional Research Service, the  National Academies Press, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  NOAA, the American Academy of Microbiology, the Arctic Oil Spill  Response Joint Industry Programme, and our previous report on oil  dispersants.
