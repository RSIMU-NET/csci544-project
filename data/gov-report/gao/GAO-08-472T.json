Physician assistants may perform physical examinations, diagnose and treat  illnesses, order and interpret tests, advise patients on preventive health care, assist in  surgery, and write prescriptions. Unlike physician assistants, nurse practitioners are  licensed nurses who work with physicians and have independent practice authority in  many states. This authority allows them to perform physical examinations, diagnose and  treat acute illnesses and injuries, administer immunizations, manage chronic problems  such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and order laboratory services and x-rays with  minimal physician involvement.", "For the purposes of this testimony, we considered primary care physicians to be those  practicing in family medicine, general practice, general internal medicine, and general  pediatrics. Some physician groups, such as the American Medical Association (AMA),  consider physicians practicing in obstetrics/gynecology to also be primary care physicians.  In addition, we considered general dentists and pediatric dentists to be primary care  dentists. We defined primary care physician assistants as those practicing in family  practice, general practice, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics.

For example, they provide grants to institutions that train health  professionals; offer direct assistance to students in the form of  scholarships, loans, or repayment of educational loans; and provide  funding for health workforce analyses, such as estimates of supply and  demand. In recent years, title VII programs have focused on three specific  areas of need\u2014improving the distribution of health professionals in  underserved areas such as rural and inner-city communities, increasing  representation of minorities and individuals from disadvantaged  backgrounds in health professions, and increasing the number of primary  care providers.

Physician residents receive most  of their training in teaching hospitals, which are hospitals that operate one  or more graduate medical education programs. Completion of a physician  residency program can take from 3 to 7 years after graduation from  medical school, depending on the specialty or subspecialty chosen by the  physician. Most primary care specialties require a 3-year residency  program. In some cases, primary care physicians may choose to pursue  additional residency training and become a subspecialist\u2014such as a  pediatrician who specializes in cardiology. In this case, the physician  would no longer be considered a primary care physician, but rather, a  cardiologist.", "According to the AAPA, most physician assistant programs require  applicants to have some college education. The average physician  assistant program takes about 26 months, with classroom education  followed by clinical rotations in internal medicine, family medicine,  surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and  geriatric medicine. Physician assistants practice in primary care medicine,  including family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics  and gynecology, as well in surgical specialties.", "After completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing, a nurse may become a  nurse practitioner after completing a master\u2019s degree in nursing.

Using these factors, HRSA calculated two estimates of future workforce  supply. One projected the expected number of primary care physicians,  while the other projected the expected supply of primary care physicians  expressed in full-time equivalent (FTE) units. According to HRSA, the  latter projection, because it adjusts for physicians who work part-time, is  more accurate. The agency projected future need for primary care  professionals based largely on expected changes in U.S. demographics,  trends in health insurance coverage, and patterns of utilization. HRSA  predicted that the supply of primary care physicians will grow at about the  same rate as demand until about 2018, at which time demand will grow  faster than supply. Specifically, HRSA projected that by 2020, the  nationwide supply of primary care physicians expressed in FTEs will be  271,440, compared with a need for 337,400 primary care physicians. HRSA  notes that this projection, based on a national model, masks the  geographic variation in physician supply. For example, the agency  estimates that as many as 7,000 additional primary care physicians are  currently needed in rural and inner-city areas and does not expect that  physician supply will improve in these underserved areas.", "In a separate projection, AAFP reviewed the number of family  practitioners in the United States. AAFP\u2019s projections of future supply  were based on the number of active family practice physicians in the  workforce and the number of completed family practice residencies in  both allopathic and osteopathic medical schools. AAFP\u2019s projections of  need relied on utilization rates adjusted for mortality and socioeconomic  factors. Specifically, AAFP estimated that 139,531 family physicians would  be needed by 2020, representing about 42 family physicians per 100,000  people in the United States. To meet this physician-to-population ratio,  AAFP estimated that family practice residency programs in the aggregate  would need to expand by 822 residents per year.", "Both reports noted the difficulties inherent in making predictions about  future physician workforce supply and demand. Essentially, they noted  that projections based on historical data may not necessarily be predictive  of future trends.
