NIH has taken some steps to improve its peer review of clinical research applications. The Center for Scientific Review recently added two new peer review study sections for the review of clinical research applications--one for clinical cardiovascular science and other for clinical oncology. NIH has increased its support of general clinical research centers, as required by the act, although the program has grown more slowly than NIH's overall estimated expenditures on clinical research. NIH has established the four clinical research career enhancement award programs mandated by the act. Three of these programs have been implemented, and they support new and midcareer clinical investigators and institutional clinical research teaching programs. The fourth program is designed to support graduate training in clinical investigation. NIH has initiated a new extramural loan repayment program specifically for clinical investigators as required by the act. This program was launched in December 2001.

Clinical  research has been defined as patient-oriented research, epidemiologic and  behavioral studies, and outcomes research and health services research.  In contrast, basic biomedical research involves fundamental investigations  that do not focus directly on patients or their diseases. The National  Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal federal agency that funds clinical  research, supporting individual clinical investigators, clinical trials,  general and specialized clinical research centers, and clinical research  training. NIH\u2019s total budget grew dramatically from about $12.8 billion in  fiscal year 1997 to an estimated $23.6 billion in fiscal year 2002. NIH\u2019s 27  institutes and centers (ICs) each receive separate appropriations and  accomplish their missions through intramural research (government  scientists conducting research at NIH\u2019s own laboratories and clinics) and,  to a greater extent, through extramural research (scientists conducting  research at institutions outside of NIH). Scientists compete for funding  from NIH, and research proposals are evaluated for their eligibility for  funding by peer review study sections of primarily nonfederal scientists.", "As NIH\u2019s overall budget has grown, more attention has focused on its  support of clinical research. For many years there have been concerns that  clinical research proposals are viewed less favorably than basic research  during the peer review process at NIH and that clinical research has not  received its fair share of NIH funding. Also at issue have been the declining  numbers of physician-investigators and the challenges they face, such as  inadequate clinical research training and high debt from educational loans.  In November 2000 the Clinical Research Enhancement Act (CREA) was  enacted to address some of these concerns. The act directed NIH to  consider recommendations from earlier studies for enhancing clinical  research and to support and expand its resources for clinical research in  general and in specific ways. The act also mandated that we evaluate  NIH\u2019s implementation of its provisions. To that end, we determined  whether and how NIH has (1) increased its funding of clinical research  and expanded its clinical research activities, (2) improved its review of  clinical research proposals, (3) supported general clinical research centers  (GCRC) and expanded their activities, (4) established new clinical  research career development and training programs, and (5) implemented  a loan repayment program for extramural clinical investigators.", "To assess NIH\u2019s progress in complying with the requirements of CREA, we  reviewed NIH documents and data on clinical research expenditures, peer  review of clinical research, clinical research training and career  development award programs, and the clinical research loan repayment  program. We also interviewed officials at several offices and institutes  within NIH, including the Office of the Director, the Center for Scientific  Review (CSR), the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), and  other institutes. Finally, we interviewed and consulted with key  stakeholders, including the Association of American Medical Colleges  (AAMC), the Institute of Medicine\u2019s (IOM) Clinical Research Roundtable,  and other clinical research experts. The scope of our report was restricted  to NIH\u2019s implementation of CREA, and we did not evaluate the  effectiveness of NIH\u2019s actions in promoting clinical research. NIH took  some actions required by CREA prior to its passage. For this reason, we  looked at all relevant actions taken by NIH, not just those initiated since  November 2000. We conducted our work from December 2001 through  August 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the 1990s, a number of influential studies sponsored by NIH, IOM, and  AAMC and the American Medical Association (AMA) identified some  major problems in clinical research and highlighted NIH\u2019s role in  addressing some of these problems. First, there was a general concern  that clinical research was receiving substantially less support than basic  research at NIH, yet there was little systematic data to document how  much, in fact, NIH was spending on clinical research. In an analysis of NIH  investigator-initiated extramural grants active in 1991, an IOM committee  found that 16 percent involved human research. A few years later, a panel  appointed by the NIH director known as the \u201cNathan Panel,\u201d developed a  broad definition of clinical research (the definition NIH now uses) and,  applying this definition to all NIH competing extramural research grants in  fiscal year 1996, found that 27 percent of grants and 38 percent of dollars  were devoted to clinical research. The Nathan Panel believed that this  fraction of the extramural budget devoted to clinical research was  reasonable and should remain about the same, as efforts to increase the  NIH budget as a whole were pursued. The studies sponsored by NIH, IOM,  and AAMC/AMA recommended that NIH monitor and track its  expenditures on clinical research.", "A second concern was that clinical research proposals, especially those  from individual investigators, did not fare as well as basic research  proposals in peer review at NIH. Grant applications for clinical trials,  clinical research centers, and clinical research training are typically  reviewed by the sponsoring institute; however, the peer review of  individual investigator grant applications usually takes place centrally,  within CSR. CSR has approximately 65 study sections that review  research. A study section is a panel of experts established according to  scientific disciplines or research areas for the purpose of evaluating the  scientific and technical merit of grant applications. In 1994 an NIH- commissioned study reported that patient-oriented research applications  were less likely to receive favorable reviews in CSR than laboratory- oriented research applications when reviewed in study sections with less  than 30 percent patient-oriented research applications. However when  patient-oriented research applications were grouped in study sections with  greater than 50 percent patient-oriented research, they fared as well as  laboratory-oriented research applications. Consequently, this report  recommended that study sections reviewing patient-oriented research  should have at least 50 percent of such applications and that a means  should be developed and implemented to collect and track data  prospectively on research applications that are predominantly patient- oriented, laboratory-oriented, mixed, or clinical epidemiology and  behavioral research. Similarly, the Nathan Panel recommended that panels  that review clinical research must include experienced clinical  investigators and that at least 30 to 50 percent of the applications reviewed  by these panels must be for clinical research. The IOM committee also  recommended more oversight of study section composition, functions,  and outcomes pertaining to human research.", "A third problem identified in these studies was the adequacy of support for  the infrastructure (that is, facilities, equipment, data systems, and research  personnel) for the conduct of clinical research. Since the late 1950s, NIH  has funded GCRCs across the U.S to provide clinical research  infrastructure\u2014facilities, equipment, and personnel\u2014for NIH-funded  investigators as well as non-federally funded investigators conducting  patient-oriented research. Interdisciplinary and collaborative research is  encouraged at these centers. The Nathan Panel, the IOM committee, and  others recommended increasing financial support for GCRCs and  broadening their leadership role in clinical research and research training.", "A fourth concern was the decline in the number of physicians conducting  clinical research. According to data collected by the AMA, the number of  physicians reporting research as their primary career activity fell by 6  percent from 1980 to 1997 (from 15,377 to 14,434), while the number  reporting patient care as their primary career activity almost doubled  (376,512 to 620,472). Observers identified a variety of challenges in  pursuing a career as a clinical investigator, including the indebtedness of  medical students, the length of time a clinical scientist must train, the  culture of academic medicine, as well as the competition from other  career options. For many years NIH has supported the training of  investigators through extramural and intramural predoctoral, postdoctoral  training and career development awards. However, there was concern that  these awards were being directed toward basic research and were not  sufficiently supporting the training and development of clinical  investigators. The IOM committee, the Nathan Panel, and the AAMC/AMA  reports recommended that NIH provide substantial new support for  clinical research training, career development, and debt relief."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth in NIH\u2019s Spending on Clinical Research Has Kept Pace with Total Spending", "paragraphs": ["NIH reports that it increased its funding of clinical research and expanded  its clinical research activities in response to CREA.

NIH\u2019s estimates of clinical research  expenditures represent the best available indications of financial trends  over time, but they are not precise figures because the process of counting  clinical research dollars varies widely across ICs.

NIH\u2019s extramural clinical research dollars were  spent through a variety of funding mechanisms in fiscal year 2001. About  40 percent of the awarded dollars were grants to individual investigators,  followed by other funding mechanisms, center grants, cooperative  agreements, research program projects, and research and development  contracts (see fig. 1). Of NIH\u2019s total extramural research expenditures for  cooperative agreements and center grants, the majority of dollars were  spent on clinical research in fiscal year 2001.", "In fiscal year 2001, NIH estimated that it spent about $529 million, or   27 percent of its intramural research expenditures, on clinical research.  NIH\u2019s intramural clinical research activities include research at the  Clinical Center on NIH\u2019s Bethesda, Maryland, campus, as well as research  by individual institutes. The Clinical Center\u2019s budget represents more than  half of the intramural clinical research expenditures. The budget of the  Clinical Center increased from approximately $204 million in fiscal year  1997 to an estimated $303 million in fiscal year 2002.

The methods  NIH uses to count clinical research dollars are inconsistent across ICs,  potentially underestimating or overestimating its actual clinical research  expenditures. Since fiscal year 1997, the Office of Budget, within the Office  of the Director, has collected information from each IC on its extramural  and intramural clinical research expenditures. The ICs use the NIH  definition of clinical research (described earlier), but they count the  dollars in very different ways. The 20 ICs that fund clinical research  reported three different ways of counting clinical research dollars. First,  12 ICs count 100 percent of the grant dollars of research projects that  include any clinical research. Second, one institute, NCI, codes a research  project\u2019s \u201cpercent relevance\u201d to clinical research. Projects are coded as  100 percent, major, minor, or 0 percent clinical research. If they are  classified as \u201cmajor,\u201d they are assigned a percentage relevancy of 50  percent, and 50 percent of the dollars are counted. If they are classified as  \u201cminor,\u201d they are assigned a percentage relevancy of 5 percent, and 5  percent of the dollars are counted. Third, 7 ICs either attempt to estimate  the dollars of a research project spent on clinical research or the  percentage of a project that is clinical research and apply that percentage  to the total grant dollars.", "These different methods of counting clinical research dollars can produce  very different results. For example, given a hypothetical grant to an  investigator of $300,000 for which an IC has estimated that $50,000 of the  budget would be spent on clinical research, some ICs would report that  $300,000 was spent on clinical research; NCI could conclude that this grant  has only minor relevance to clinical research and therefore would count 5  percent, or $15,000, as clinical research dollars; the rest of the ICs would  estimate that this project is about 17 percent clinical research and  therefore count $50,000 of the grant as clinical research dollars.", "The Office of Budget said that the reason the ICs count clinical research  dollars differently is that each developed its own methods over time, and  for historical consistency, they are reluctant to change.

The ICs sponsoring the highest number of contracts are NCI,  NHLBI, and NIMH. NCRR also plans to sponsor a significant number of  loan repayment contracts.

It has  increased its financial support of clinical research, expanded its clinical  research activities, made improvements in its review of clinical research  proposals, expanded its support of GCRCs, established new clinical  research career development and training programs, and begun to  implement a new extramural clinical research loan repayment program.  Some of NIH\u2019s actions were taken prior to CREA\u2019s passage and some are  still being implemented.

NIH concurred with our recommendation and  reported that it is taking steps to implement a better, more unified system  for tracking and reporting clinical research expenditures across the ICs.  According to NIH, this new system will be implemented in fiscal year 2003.  NIH also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. In particular, NIH clarified its response to our questions  about the peer review of clinical research. NIH emphasized that it  recognizes the importance of collecting data on the grouping of clinical  research applications and reviewers. Toward that end, NIH stated that one  of the responsibilities of CSR\u2019s newly appointed Special Advisor on  Clinical Research Review will be to investigate new methods to reliably  identify and track clinical research applications and clinical research  reviewers.", "We will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the  Director of NIH, appropriate congressional committees, and others who  are interested.
