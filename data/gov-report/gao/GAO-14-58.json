For example, following Hurricane Katrina,  we reported on a number of internal control weaknesses related to  contracting issues, such as federal agencies involved in responding to the  disaster that had inadequate acquisition plans for carrying out their  assigned responsibilities, insufficient knowledge of the market or unsound  ordering practices that led to excessive or wasteful expenditures, and  insufficient staff available for monitoring and oversight. We also  identified control weaknesses related to grants management following  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, such as determining the amount of damage that was actually disaster related;  sharing project information among intergovernmental participants  during project development, and limitations in how the status of  projects is tracked; and inadequate human capital capacity, especially early on in the  recovery.", "Similarly, IGs have reported on internal control weaknesses related to  accountability over disaster assistance. For example, IGs have reported  that grantees did not complete their disaster relief projects in a timely  manner and did not ensure the use of funds for intended purposes, and  that states did not provide timely reporting on activity progress related to  grant funding as some activities were not reported on until the projects  were complete.", "When we compared the incremental risks identified by the agencies  receiving funds for Sandy disaster relief with risks identified in prior GAO,  IG, and financial statement audit reports related to grants management,  contract management, improper payments, and other internal control  weaknesses for programs receiving Sandy funding, we determined that  some of the risks in these reports were not included in the Sandy disaster  relief internal control plans. For example, one agency that reported that it  will expend its Sandy disaster relief funds through contracts did not  identify any incremental risks. Our review of prior GAO, IG, and financial  statement audit reports found significant risks related to the agency\u2019s  contract management. According to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, internal control should provide for an assessment of  the risks the agency faces from both external and internal sources.  Management needs to comprehensively identify risks and should  consider all significant interactions between the entity and other parties as  well as internal factors at both the entity-wide and activity levels.
