Electricity R&D includes such technologies as solar energy, fossil-fueled generating systems, and electric automobiles.", "The electric utility industry is being deregulated and moving toward a more competitive market. At the same time, reductions have occurred in funding from the major sources of electricity-related R&D. Consequently, you asked us to determine (1) what changes have occurred in the amount of electricity-related R&D funding and the primary reasons for these changes and (2) what has been the impact of these changes on the types of R&D being funded.

For the last 4 years, DOE has provided about $4.6 billion in funding at its national laboratories, at universities, and in co-funded collaborative research with utilities and manufacturers. Over the same period, electric utilities, primarily private and investor-owned, have spent about $2.3 billion; over the last 3 years, state programs have spent about $200 million. Manufacturers of electric utility equipment have also funded electricity-related R&D; however, current estimates of such funding are unavailable.", "As the electric power industry moves toward deregulation and increased competition, utilities face significant changes. Historically, utilities have operated as monopolies in protected geographic areas. Many of these utilities were regulated by state public utility commissions that approved the inclusion of electricity R&D expenditures in the rate base. By including these expenditures in the rate base, the utilities have been allowed to earn a fixed rate of return on these expenditures. Driven by a combination of factors, the move toward deregulation gained impetus with the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which promotes increased competition in the wholesale power market. Other factors spurring the move toward competition include large differences in electricity rates among utilities; new low-cost electricity generation technologies; and recent experiences in reduced regulation in other industries, such as telecommunications and natural gas.", "In April 1996, as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a final rule that now requires electric utilities to make their transmission lines accessible to other utilities or power producers for the transmission of wholesale power. It requires that this open access be made available at the same cost that these public utilities incur to transmit their own power. Regulatory commissions in 44 states and the District of Columbia had adopted or were evaluating deregulation alternatives as of June 30, 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electricity-Related R&D Funding Is Declining Due to Budget Reductions and Deregulation Prospects", "paragraphs": ["Electricity-related R&D funding was generally reduced in 1996 by the federal government, the electric utility industry, and most states that we reviewed. Since fiscal year 1993, DOE\u2019s electricity-related R&D budget has increased, except for fiscal year 1996 when it was reduced to near its 1993 level. Meanwhile, the electric utilities began making reductions 3 years ago. Most state programs we reviewed are also experiencing reductions. The primary reasons for the funding declines are overall reductions in federal and state funding and the increased competition expected from the deregulation of the utilities. Current data on the manufacturers\u2019 R&D spending were unavailable.", "Figure 1 shows the funding for the two largest sources of R&D for which we have data for the last 4 years. DOE\u2019s 1993 and 1996 budget amounts are similar, while the 1994 and 1995 budgets experienced increases. Meanwhile, the utilities\u2019 investments have decreased each year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s R&D Budget Reduced", "paragraphs": ["After approving increases in previous years, the Congress reduced DOE\u2019s electricity-related R&D budget by about 20 percent in fiscal year 1996 compared to 1995. The reductions occurred in electricity-related R&D activities under both of DOE\u2019s appropriations\u2014Energy and Water Development and Interior and Related Agencies. DOE\u2019s 1997 budget request for electricity-related R&D is about 14 percent higher than the 1996 appropriation. Table 1 presents the major R&D program budgets over 5 years.", "According to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees\u2019 reports on DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriations, the primary reason for the decline was to meet overall budget constraints. For example, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees\u2019 reports on Energy and Water Appropriations made repeated references to budget constraints and budget realities in their reports on DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget for energy supply R&D activities. Compared to DOE\u2019s request, the House Committee recommended a 24-percent decrease, and the Senate Committee recommended an 18-percent decrease.", "In separate reports, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees responsible for the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations recommended reducing DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriation for fossil energy R&D programs by about 10 percent below the fiscal year 1995 level and stated their intent to continue reducing this program by a similar percentage each year for the next several years. According to these reports, the reductions will permit the agency to gradually phase down to a funding level more in line with the recommendations of the legislative committee of jurisdiction in the House.", "DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1997 overall budget request for electricity-related R&D is greater than the 1996 appropriations; however, the budget request for some technologies decreased. For example, the request for the renewable energy and energy-efficiency programs is $146.4 million (or 35 percent) greater, whereas the request for the fossil energy programs is $31.8 million (or 10 percent) less. DOE\u2019s budget attributes the reductions in the fossil energy programs to congressional guidance to reduce these programs by 10 percent per year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Utilities Are Reducing R&D to Prepare for Increased Competition", "paragraphs": ["R&D spending by the nation\u2019s investor-owned utilities has declined by nearly one-third in 3 years (from 1993 to 1996) after being level in real dollars for the previous 10 years. We gathered data from 80 companies representing the 112 largest operating utilities from a total of 3,000 utilities. These 112 investor-owned utilities, which are privately owned, account for over 93 percent of all nonfederal utility R&D spending and are responsible for about three-quarters of all electricity sales. They reduced their spending for R&D from about $708 million in 1993 to about $476 million in 1996.", "In 1992, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners recommended that utilities devote 1 percent of their revenues to R&D. In 1993, 6 of the 112 investor-owned utilities met that target, but since then all 6 have substantially cut back their R&D spending. In 1994, utilities on average devoted about 0.3 percent of their revenues to R&D.", "Utility R&D managers told us that this average will most likely continue to decline. Of the 80 companies we contacted, the R&D managers of 38 companies predicted cutbacks in R&D spending after 1996, while the managers of only 2 companies predicted increases. The managers from the remaining 40 companies were either unsure, thought their expenditures would remain about the same, or did not provide the information.", "According to utility R&D managers who were asked why their budgets were being reduced, the main reason was that their companies are preparing for deregulation and competition by cutting costs wherever they can. In the past, utilities were allowed to earn a fixed rate of return on all R&D projects that the public utility commission allowed in the rate base. In a more competitive marketplace, utilities will be forced to price electricity to compete with other utilities and independent power producers. As a result, R&D managers evaluate potential R&D projects on the basis of their likelihood of providing a near-term return to the utility that will allow them to reduce electricity rates.", "Increased competition was cited as the primary reason for the biggest cutbacks to date by utilities in California, New York, and Florida. The 13 investor-owned utilities in these states have been among the leaders in R&D investments, accounting for 39 percent of the R&D funded by investor-owned utilities in 1993. But they have reduced their R&D spending by 52 percent since 1993. According to utility R&D managers in New York and California, they currently charge customers considerably more than the average price for electricity, and they are under pressure to cut costs in order to be able to compete in a deregulated market. Florida\u2019s major utilities have eliminated nearly all of their R&D funding in order to be cost-competitive with each other and with other electricity suppliers in the region.", "Other reasons given by 10 companies\u2019 R&D managers for reductions in their R&D were that no new DOE co-funded projects were being initiated and ongoing projects were either reaching completion or being cut back. These projects included coal technology development, renewable energy, and other projects for advanced electricity generation technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State R&D Programs Are Being Reduced Because of Funding Constraints", "paragraphs": ["The electricity-related R&D programs that we reviewed at the state level are also experiencing reductions. Of the 11 large programs in the nine states that we reviewed, 7 have been reduced in the past 3 years. Overall the programs have seen a 30-percent reduction in funding, from $83 million to $58 million, since 1993. Most of these programs involved energy-efficiency R&D, and some involved generation technologies of particular interest to that state, such as coal power and renewable energy.", "The state program officials attributed the declines in these programs to the decreases in major funding sources: (1) utilities\u2019 contributions; (2) oil overcharge revenues; (3) co-funding available for R&D projects from DOE, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), utilities, and industry; and (4) state appropriations. For example, the budget of the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, funded by voluntary contributions from New York utilities, was cut nearly in half, from $19 million to $10 million, between 1993 and 1996.", "The California Institute for Energy Efficiency, which has funded energy-efficiency R&D at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and various California universities, has also been affected by cost-cutting. The Institute\u2019s primary source of funding was about $4 million per year from California utilities. By late 1994, the utilities no longer provided funding.

Data from manufacturers are considered proprietary and therefore difficult for organizations that collect and analyze R&D financial information to obtain. The organizations, which include the National Science Foundation and DOE\u2019s Energy Information Administration, said that they had data on the manufacturers\u2019 energy R&D but could not isolate the electricity-related R&D spending. The most recent such information available was an EPRI study that estimated a 1988 total for all U.S. manufacturers of $200 million.", "In a restructured industry in which other companies are reducing R&D spending, manufacturers may take on the development of new products. In the absence of current data, the degree to which this is occurring, if at all, is uncertain. Utility, EPRI, and DOE officials told us that on the one hand, the manufacturers are increasingly being relied on to meet technology needs, especially by independent power producers, which are producing a growing portion of the nation\u2019s electricity but are generally not investing in R&D themselves because they operate on a thin profit margin. On the other hand, officials from these organizations told us that electricity-related manufacturers may not invest in new technology R&D for the following reasons: (1) the cutbacks in the availability of co-funding to help support projects; (2) the restructuring of the electricity industry, which has created uncertainties in the domestic market; and (3) the difficulty of competing in international markets where foreign competitors have the strong backing of their governments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Collaborative and Longer-Term Projects Are Being Reduced", "paragraphs": ["Concurrent with the declines in funding, a shift in the types of R&D being funded has also occurred, primarily resulting in a decrease in collaborative and longer-term projects. Many utilities are shifting their R&D from such projects to proprietary R&D and to projects with a short-term payback. In addition, as a result of these changes and last year\u2019s reductions in DOE\u2019s funding, advanced technology projects in the six technology areas we reviewed were often delayed, scaled back, or canceled. Given the inherent difficulties in measuring the benefits of R&D, the economic consequences of these program changes are unclear."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Utilities Are Shifting Away From Collaborative R&D", "paragraphs": ["According to many utility R&D managers, their companies have been shifting the focus of their R&D from collaborative projects benefiting all utilities, to proprietary R&D, giving their individual companies a competitive edge. R&D managers at more than half of the 80 utilities we contacted reported reducing funding for collaborative R&D. Some R&D managers said they believe that continued investment in R&D that could benefit all companies would put their company at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with other utilities and with independent power producers that are not making such investments.", "This shift is reflected in the declining support for EPRI, which is the utilities\u2019 main vehicle for collaborative R&D. According to a National Rural Electric Cooperative Association official, many of his members belong to EPRI and look to it for larger, industrywide innovations. Traditionally amounting to more that half of the utilities\u2019 R&D dollars, the utilities\u2019 contributions to EPRI over the last few years have declined faster than the utilities\u2019 R&D spending overall. Between 1994 and 1996, membership contributions to EPRI declined by nearly 30 percent, from $424 million to $300 million, and EPRI officials expect a further decline in 1997 (see fig. 3). Of the 80 utility companies we contacted, 12 dropped out of EPRI between 1994 and 1996, but most remained members and simply decreased their contributions.", "To address the changes that are occurring, EPRI has tried to encourage membership for independent power producers\u2014which an EPRI official estimates will account for more than 35 percent of future generating capacity\u2014but such efforts have been unsuccessful. In addition, EPRI plans to establish a taxable subsidiary that can participate in proprietary R&D."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Utilities Are Shifting Away From Long-Term, Advanced-Technology R&D", "paragraphs": ["According to many utility R&D managers, their companies are also shifting the focus of their R&D away from long-term, advanced-technology R&D, like the advanced gas turbine and new fuel cells, to short-term projects that will be profitable and provide a competitive edge in the near term. The R&D managers at about half of the 80 utility companies we contacted reported such a change. In fact, the R&D managers at the nation\u2019s two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, said that their advanced-technology R&D programs have been eliminated.", "R&D managers from 52 of the 80 utility companies we contacted expressed concern that if the trend in funding decreases continued, it would result in slowing technology development, sacrificing future prosperity to meet short-term goals, and failing to meet national energy goals. In addition, DOE officials said that the reductions in the renewable and fossil energy programs will delay penetration of technologies into the market and change the way that some projects are being carried out.", "With the move toward deregulation, some R&D managers said that they are more concerned with whether their companies will continue to exist in the face of widespread restructuring and mergers than with the potential long-term benefits from advanced technology that may take 8 or more years to develop and market. They also said that they view the shift to short-term R&D as part of the recasting of utility companies as businesses rather than regulated public-service providers. A 1996 DOE study found that private industry in general is shifting its R&D priorities away from the longer-term benefits of basic and applied research to an emphasis on product development and process enhancements supporting shorter-term market strategies and \u201cbottom lines.\u201d", "The R&D managers at some utilities told us that their companies are shifting from R&D activities related to long-term, advanced-technology power generation R&D because, under restructuring, they will become transmission and distribution companies and will no longer be involved in power generation. Thus, some utilities see themselves purchasing new power rather than adding generating facilities. Additional reasons for the shift mentioned by some utilities\u2019 R&D officials were that there is no immediate need for additional electricity supplies, the available gas-turbine technology is adequate as long as natural gas is plentiful and relatively inexpensive, and market uncertainties are associated with deregulation.", "EPRI\u2019s R&D programs for advanced power generation have also been affected by cutbacks in the utilities\u2019 contributions. For example, the budgets for fuel cells, coal gasification, advanced gas turbines, and wind and solar power have declined by a total of 66 percent, from $40.7 million to $13.9 million, within the past 3 years. EPRI program managers said that they no longer have funds to initiate new projects; instead, their role is increasingly one of information transfer rather than R&D funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some DOE Projects Are Being Delayed, Scaled Down, or Canceled", "paragraphs": ["The projects that we reviewed in six technologies in which DOE participated were beginning to be delayed, scaled down, or canceled as a result of funding reductions, according to DOE, state, and industry officials that we contacted. We chose to review these areas because, according to the 1995 DOE Task Force study, the projects in these areas have a high or medium long-term potential for meeting the national energy goals and because they were significantly reduced in the utilities\u2019 budgets. The technologies reviewed were fuel cells, coal gasification, advanced gas turbines, wind power, photovoltaics, and electricity storage (see app. II for details).", "The reductions in DOE\u2019s funding are delaying the development of several technologies, according to DOE officials. For example, the unavailability of DOE and EPRI co-funding is delaying the development of a fuel-cell system\u2014whose goal is the highly efficient, environmentally benign conversion of fossil fuel to electricity. Funding reductions are also delaying the development of one of DOE\u2019s fuel-cell vehicle programs and a demonstration of superconducting magnetic energy storage, whose goal is a highly efficient new technology for storing electricity.", "The funding reductions by DOE, utilities, and EPRI are resulting in the scaling down of collaborative projects with industry for the development of cost-efficient photovoltaic systems, which convert sunlight directly to electricity. Several projects are being scaled down, such as (1) a program to reduce the cost of photovoltaic manufacturing and (2) a center that aids in designing new photovoltaic applications.", "The funding reductions are also resulting in the cancellation of two programs to encourage wind-power development. A collaborative program involving DOE, utilities, and EPRI to test new wind turbines in utility settings will be terminated following the completion of the three projects currently under way. A program to support utilities\u2019 wind turbine purchases to reduce the utilities\u2019 perceived risk of introducing a new and unfamiliar technology has also been eliminated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "R&D Managers Propose Alternative Funding Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Utility R&D managers and industry, DOE, and state government officials who expressed concerns about the funding of electricity-related R&D suggested alternative funding sources.

For example, in January 1996 the California Public Utilities Commission published its deregulation proposal. It recognized that California utilities\u2019 R&D budgets have decreased significantly in the transition to a competitive market. The Commission\u2019s proposal calls for a non-bypassable surcharge to be instituted no later than January 1, 1998, on all retail electricity sales to fund public-benefit R&D and energy-efficiency activities. The surcharge would fund R&D that served a broad public interest which might otherwise be lost in the transition to a more competitive market place. The proposal calls for establishing a consortium or public authority to administer the funds but does not specify a funding level.", "However, some utility R&D managers and state and EPRI officials pointed out weaknesses in the state-by-state administration of surcharges. These officials believe that although surcharges may be suitable for programs that focus on locally available natural resources, local conditions, and partnerships with local industries, the states\u2019 administration of more broadly based programs would likely be inefficient, uncoordinated, and duplicative and not achieve the critical mass necessary for projects of nationwide scope. Also, they are concerned that if some states implemented a surcharge and others did not, the problem of \u201cfree riders\u201d would continue, where some would receive the benefits without helping to pay for the R&D, putting states that did pay at a competitive disadvantage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nationwide Wires Charge Proposal", "paragraphs": ["Some utility R&D managers and state and EPRI officials suggested that a non-bypassable national wires charge could provide an alternative funding mechanism for EPRI and longer-term collaborative R&D.

Under this proposal, a small charge would be assessed on all electricity entering the transmission grid, whether it be interstate or intrastate.", "Furthermore, the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners in November 1994 adopted a resolution recognizing the need for a system of support for public benefits, which include electricity-related R&D in the restructured electricity industry. Subsequently, an Association official told us that in commenting on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s open-access rulemaking, the Association recognized that a nationwide wires charge was one possible technique to fund public benefits.", "The Gas Research Institute, the R&D counterpart to EPRI for the natural gas industry, is funded by a somewhat similar charge on gas flowing through interstate pipelines. This pipeline charge has enabled funding for the Institute to be maintained despite reduced regulation. Recently, the Institute has encountered problems with this funding mechanism because individual pipeline companies are allowed to reduce their payments to the Institute if their rates are discounted due to competition from other pipeline companies. As a result, the Institute experienced a 21-percent shortfall in its 1996 R&D budget. In an order issued on May 3, 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved an amended R&D program for the Institute.", "Many utility R&D managers with whom we spoke, although generally reluctant to support any additional charges for electricity, said that a non-bypassable wires charge would be a more equitable way to provide funding than the current system, to which some utilities and independent power producers were not contributing.

The developers, along with EPRI, are seeking funding to scale up the technology into larger systems.", "Proton exchange membrane fuel cells operate at low temperatures and thus can be turned on and off readily, making them suitable for transportation vehicles. Several auto makers, with DOE co-funding, are investigating whether this technology can meet the cost and performance standards under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles program, an effort to spur the development of more efficient and lower emission vehicles.", "The stationary fuel cell budget for 1995 was $48.2 million, which according to DOE\u2019s program manager was more than two-thirds of total U.S. fuel cell R&D expenditures. In fiscal year 1996, the program operated at a reduced level under a continuing resolution for most of the year. The program manager expects that the Congress will reduce the budget by about $5 million per year for the next 4 years, which would reduce DOE\u2019s ability to co-fund demonstration projects. Even without these cuts, DOE lacks the funds to support the development of planar solid oxide systems unless it were to drop funding for other on-going projects, according to the program manager. EPRI is trying to get a consortium of utilities to invest in the development of a planar solid oxide system but is finding it difficult. The program manager also said that the lack of DOE or EPRI/utility support will delay efforts by the developer, a small company, to scale up its technology into a marketable system.", "DOE\u2019s transportation fuel cell budget for fiscal year 1995 was $25 million. The program manager expects the fiscal year 1996 budget to be reduced by 14 percent and expects additional reductions in 1997. For 1996, DOE eliminated programs for the transportation applications of phosphoric acid fuel cells, such as in buses and locomotives. For proton exchange membrane fuel cells, DOE reduced by 50 percent its support for General Motors\u2019 fuel cell vehicle program, which according to DOE\u2019s program manager will delay the program. DOE is maintaining its support for the Ford and Chrysler fuel cell vehicle programs, which are not as far along.", "The program manager said that further budget cuts in the transportation fuel cell program will jeopardize advanced concept research, such as work at Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop direct methanol oxidation, which could potentially eliminate the need for a heavy on-vehicle fuel reformer. He is also concerned that delays due to budget cutbacks could keep fuel cell vehicle development from meeting the time frames for selection under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles program.", "EPRI\u2019s fuel cell budget has dropped 67 percent, from $9 million to $3 million, in the past 2 years and is likely to decrease further in the future. EPRI officials are concerned that they will no longer be able to support fuel cell demonstration projects and that fewer funds will be available for exploratory research on advanced fuel cell concepts.

The West Virginia facility was designed to do R&D on advanced concepts to increase efficiency and lower costs. The Alabama facility, for which DOE provides 80 percent of the funding, was designed to test high-temperature particulate filters, but it has the potential to do some of the advanced concept R&D work planned for the West Virginia facility.", "DOE\u2019s budget for coal gasification-related R&D was reduced by 23 percent from $26.7 million in fiscal year 1995 to about $20.6 million in fiscal year 1996. To achieve this cutback, DOE has decided to eliminate the Gasification Product Improvement Facility. DOE, however, is preserving funding for the Power System Development Facility. For fiscal year 1996, DOE\u2019s funding for the project is $12 million. Also contributing funding are EPRI and the Southern Company, the host utility. DOE expects some cost sharing from filter manufacturers and developers and more participation from industry once the facility is in operation.

The EPRI program manager said that if funding keeps shrinking, EPRI may not be able to continue funding the facility. Although EPRI has supported the three demonstration projects, EPRI\u2019s continued support is jeopardized because one of the host utilities, Tampa Electric, has dropped out of EPRI and another, Cinergy, has stopped funding EPRI\u2019s advanced fossil business unit.", "The outlook for industry\u2019s potential contribution, according to EPRI and DOE officials, is mixed.

The waste heat from the gas turbine is used to generate steam, which is converted into additional electricity.", "DOE is cost-sharing with industry, developing both large and small advanced gas turbines. DOE is to fund no more than 65 percent of the $700 million, 8-year program to develop advanced turbines by the year 2000; industrial participants will contribute at least 35 percent. DOE\u2019s Fossil Energy Office is responsible for developing the large-scale turbine, while DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is responsible for the small-scale turbine for distributed, industrial, and co-generation applications. On a four-phase schedule, both programs are now in phase III, which involves full-scale component development and a steep increase in expenditures, according to DOE officials. Two manufacturers are independently developing turbine systems under each program\u2014General Electric and Westinghouse are the developers of the large turbine systems and Allison Engines and Solar Turbines are the developers of the small turbine systems.", "Meanwhile a collaborative initiative, including several utilities and EPRI, is seeking to develop a mid-sized (about 100 megawatt) advanced turbine using aeroderivative technology developed for jet aircraft, such as the wide-bodied Boeing 777. Organized in 1991 by Pacific Gas & Electric, other California utilities, and the state of California, the collaborative has been managed by EPRI and supported by the Gas Research Institute since 1994 when Pacific Gas & Electric dropped out. Now, more than 50 percent of its funding comes from overseas members, including Canadian, British, French, Danish, Dutch, and Italian power companies. Although DOE was an early participant in the collaborative, DOE officials believe that more of a market, albeit overseas, exists for the big plants and may provide benefits to the United States in terms of exports and job creation.", "The collaborative is seeking to encourage a manufacturer to develop a mid-sized system by getting potential customers to step forward and ensure a sufficient initial market. The collaborative has requested federal seed money for this marketing activity, which, if successful, would result in a largely private-sector system development effort. The collaborative has received no response from DOE or the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. If such federal funds are not forthcoming, a program official said the collaborative will try to raise the funds from other sources, such as from utilities or independent power producers.", "DOE\u2019s budget requests for big and small turbines increased from fiscal year 1995, but approval for smaller increases is expected. DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget for the big turbine project was $36.6 million. DOE requested $44 million for fiscal year 1996, but $36.7 million was approved. While the projects may be slowed somewhat as a result, they were delayed about 9 months in the solicitation process; therefore, the budget impact will likely occur in fiscal year 1997. According to the DOE program manager, General Electric is cost-sharing at 65 percent and Westinghouse at 40 percent, both above the minimum 35 percent for phase III called for in the program plan. The program manager also said that if future federal funds are not available for the program, the manufacturers will likely forgo the development of machines for the domestic market and participate with international partners in developing machines for overseas markets.", "DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget for the small turbine project was $18.8 million. DOE requested $27.5 million for fiscal year 1996, but $22.1 million was received. According to the DOE program manager, Allison Engines and its partners and subcontractors, which include EPRI and Indianapolis Power & Light, are cost-sharing 40 percent, and Solar Turbines and its partners and subcontractors, which include the California Energy Commission and the Gas Research Institute, are cost-sharing 60 percent. The DOE manager does not believe either group can afford a bigger share and that budget reductions are likely to delay by 2 years the completion of the projects.", "In the past 3 years, EPRI\u2019s budget for advanced gas turbines has been cut 67 percent, from $15 million to $5 million. As a result, EPRI has started no new innovations and is forgoing several areas of research. For example, EPRI is no longer doing any control or balance of plant R&D. According to the program manager, EPRI\u2019s ability to monitor the performance of new technology in utility settings and identify problems has been reduced, and no one is picking up the slack from the cutbacks in EPRI\u2019s program.", "The Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are continuing to be involved in turbine R&D. However, according to DOE, EPRI, and industry officials, cutbacks in these R&D programs and the shifting of funds from turbine R&D to other activities will mean that less turbine technology will flow from these programs to the U.S. turbine industry than in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wind Power R&D", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s wind program seeks to assist the wind industry in designing, developing, and testing technologically advanced wind turbines that can compete with conventional electricity generation.

While good wind resources exist in many areas of the country, over 90 percent of the usable wind resource is in the Great Plains, stretching from Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota south to Texas. Over 1,700 megawatts of wind power capacity are currently installed in the United States, mostly in California.", "DOE is providing funds for several wind power projects. Since 1992, DOE has provided funds under its near-term product development and prototype testing program to three companies to develop turbines capable of generating electricity at a cost of 5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh). Also, in 1994 DOE began co-funding R&D projects by five companies on subsystems that could be incorporated into advanced turbine systems capable of generating electricity at a cost of 4 cents per kwh from 13-mile-per-hour winds. In addition, DOE is negotiating contracts with two companies to develop advanced turbine systems over the next 3 to 5 years. Scheduled to commence in September 1996, the contracts are expected to total $33.7 million; DOE\u2019s share will be approximately $19.7 million.

The program also provides a limited market for newly designed wind turbines prior to their achieving fully commercial status and documents and communicates the project\u2019s experiences and lessons learned to interested U.S. utilities and turbine manufacturers. DOE has provided $2.75 million of the total program cost of $22.4 million. The two utility companies involved in the program (Central & SouthWest in Texas and Green Mountain Power in Vermont) are covering 50 percent and 65 percent of the cost, respectively, and EPRI is contributing the balance. The Texas project has been built and plant performance evaluation is under way. Construction of the Vermont project is scheduled for summer 1996.", "To further encourage the utilities\u2019 involvement, in 1994 DOE initiated the Wind Energy Deployment Project under which DOE would contribute up to 20 percent of the cost of constructing 25-megawatt wind powerplants.

The previous year\u2019s budget was increased from the fiscal year 1994 level of $28.6 million, primarily to fund the Wind Energy Deployment Project. As a result of the reduction in 1996, DOE canceled further funding of the project. In addition, because of DOE\u2019s, EPRI\u2019s, and utilities\u2019 budget reductions, no further funding in fiscal year 1996 was provided for the Turbine Verification Program, beyond the two projects already under way. DOE, however, is sustaining funding for the advanced turbine contracts, which DOE officials believe are of increased importance because the industry needs outside support to ride out the current domestic utility market stagnation and continue developing new technology. Because the projects require multiyear funding, however, the budget reductions in fiscal year 1997 would require cutbacks, potentially not allowing completion of the turbine development program.", "According to EPRI\u2019s program manager for wind and solar projects, the wind budget has declined from $2.3 million to $2 million since 1993. The 1996 budget will be used primarily to complete the two turbine verification projects under way.", "According to DOE and EPRI officials, the domestic market for wind turbines is currently depressed because of utilities\u2019 uncertainty about electric power market restructuring. Additionally, even though the cost of wind power is coming down, the target price for power generation has declined further due to the availability of cheap natural gas and turbines. A further setback occurred in 1995 when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nullified a California set-aside plan under which California utilities would have purchased over 1,000 megawatts of additional wind power. According to DOE, the U.S. wind industry is badly lagging in sales and behind in technology development compared to European competitors, who have expanded R&D funding for wind energy since 1985, much faster than any other renewable technology.

Hybrid vehicles use piston engines, gas turbines, or fuel cells to produce electricity that is stored and used to run the vehicle. Meanwhile, DOE\u2019s funding for the advanced battery consortium was reduced 43 percent, from $26.4 million to $15.1 million. Several utility consortium members have also dropped out or are considering dropping out because of cutbacks in their R&D programs.
