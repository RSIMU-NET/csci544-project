IRS has little documentation on its evaluation. A well-developed and documented plan can help ensure that the evaluation generates performance information needed to make effective management decisions. A sound evaluation approach should also include criteria or standards for determining pilot-program performance. However, IRS has no criteria or standards for determining where the pilot program performs adequately to be incorporated into normal IRS compliance processes. IRS officials told GAO that they plan to use research results to help formulate standards to determine pilot success but did not provide a target date when this will occur. Moreover, IRS has not completely articulated its methodology to evaluate the pilot program. IRS officials have action plans and testing sample plans for individual units. The action plans primarily contained project-management-type information such as actions or tasks to be taken by individuals, start date, completion date, and comments rather than a comprehensive description of the methodological approach for the overall pilot project. The testing sample plans were questionnaires soliciting information about compliance measures for the individual unit and the resources available for testing SRFMI data. None of the plans outline the methods, timing, or frequency of data collection. While IRS officials have begun formulating plans for developing a sampling approach and determining appropriate sample size, they encountered challenges such as delays in information-technology assistance and time limits for using taxpayer data that have impeded progress in moving forward on its evaluation methodology.

IRS\u2019s approach to implementing  the pilot is outlined in a series of briefing documents. IRS officials told us  that since the program began in 2006, IRS has:    worked with states to receive state data in a uniform record layout;    validated and perfected federal and state data matches for the nine  states in phases I and II;    distributed data matches to several business units;    conducted compliance activities and tabulated phase I activities for  two organization units\u2014ASFR and field examination; and    commissioned the Small Business/Self Employed Research (SB/SE  Research) unit to provide technical assistance in the areas of data  analysis, methodology, and project design; to provide various  tabulations of matched data and analyze the usefulness of the matches  for identifying nonfilers and underreporters; to develop appropriate  sample sizes for each compliance activity; and to conduct studies.", "Using phase I data, SB/SE Research compared preliminary results of  SRFMI data used by two units in the SB/SE Division.

The other compliance units have not reported results because  they have not begun to work with the matched data.", "IRS officials told us that early results are limited and not statistically  sound but said that these results helped them become familiar with how  the data should be filtered and with compliance results information. SB/SE  Research has provided ongoing support and consultation and has  conducted some research studies to help develop an approach for  evaluating SRFMI pilot results. For example, SB/SE Research matched  Colorado and New Jersey tax-amnesty data to compare the potential use  of resources for SRFMI cases with non-SRFMI cases and found that state  tax-amnesty files cannot be used to definitively identify federal nonfilers  or underreporters and that the data lacked fields needed to determine  filing requirements and self-employment status. However, it found that  state tax-amnesty data can be a source for potential high-income nonfiler  leads and case building, with limitations. The Colorado and New Jersey  data were not SRFMI data but were the only data available for a first test  of the SRFMI concept. A study of phase I Arkansas, Iowa, and  Massachusetts SRFMI ASFR and Field Examination cases found mixed  results. SRFMI ASFR cases most clearly were less productive than regular  cases, because both the dollars assessed per case and per hour were  substantially lower for SRFMI than non-SRFMI cases. Field Examination  SRFMI cases, on the other hand, yielded lower dollars per case but higher  dollars per hour. However, IRS officials noted that these results were very  preliminary and that several refinements are needed in their methodology  for comparing cases.

IRS\u2019s current activities have a  number of limitations.", "IRS has not defined clear, measurable objectives with specific statements  of the accomplishments necessary to successfully meet the objectives.  Clear and measurable objectives help ensure that the appropriate  evaluation data are collected and that performance can be measured  against the objectives. IRS has articulated a goal for SRFMI\u2014to help  reduce the federal tax gap by improving tax compliance. IRS outlines its  basic approach for the SRFMI pilot in a number of briefing documents  and, in its SB/SE FY 2008 and 2009 Plan, alludes to SRFMI in its  discussion of strategies to address the tax gap. In its briefing document  for the 2008 Federation of Tax Administrators conference, IRS indicates  SRFMI has potential to reduce the tax gap and improve voluntary  compliance. The slides outline objectives such as: (1) secure compliance  results to drive business decisions, (2) modify systems and compliance  activities to further automate SRFMI, and (3) reduce the tax gap by  making inroads with noncompliant business entities. These objectives are  not clear. For instance, \u201csecuring compliance results to drive business  decisions\u201d does not explain what compliance results would be used or  what business decisions the compliance results would drive. Nor are the  objectives measurable. For example, \u201creduce the tax gap by making  inroads with noncompliant business entities\u201d does not specify how much  of a compliance improvement would indicate success, or how many  business entities or what dollar amount of new assessments would  indicate that IRS is \u201cmaking inroads\u201d with noncompliant businesses. IRS  officials told us that individual IRS units using the SRFMI data will have  their own separate objectives for evaluating all data sources for their  compliance activity and that they will measure SRFMI results by the same  standards. They added that IRS is incorporating these objectives into an  overall SRFMI sampling and evaluation plan.", "IRS has no criteria or standards for determining where the pilot program  performs adequately to be incorporated into normal IRS compliance  processes. IRS officials said the agency plans to use research results to  help formulate standards but did not provide a target date when this will  occur. IRS officials provided several projects conducted by SB/SE  Research using phase I SRFMI data that will serve as the basis for  developing standards. For example, they gave us tabulations of results for  data matches using federal and Arkansas, Iowa, and Massachusetts state  data and a preliminary analysis of the usefulness of Colorado and New  Jersey tax amnesty data. Such standards are needed for IRS to determine  whether the SRFMI pilot program is effective.", "IRS has not completely articulated its methodology to evaluate the pilot  program. SRFMI methodology should include developing plans for sound  sampling methods, determining appropriate sample sizes, and comparing  the pilot results with IRS\u2019s similar ongoing compliance efforts to  determine whether SRFMI can identify cases with higher noncompliance  potential than similar ongoing cases. IRS officials provided action plans  and testing sample plans for individual units when asked about their  methodology. The action plans primarily contained project-management- type information such as actions or tasks to be taken by individuals, start  date, completion date, and problem areas rather than a comprehensive  description of the methodological approach for the overall pilot project.  The testing sample plans were questionnaires soliciting information about  compliance measures for the individual unit and the resources available  for testing SRFMI data. None of the plans they presented outline the  methods, timing, or frequency of data collection. Specifying these  elements in the plan would help ensure that adequate, accurate, and timely  data will be available to complete the evaluation. While IRS officials have  begun developing a sampling approach and determining appropriate  sample sizes, IRS officials encountered challenges that have delayed  progress. First, IRS officials told us that information technology support  for identifying cases with higher noncompliance potential than similar  ongoing cases did not occur as planned and, as a result, two compliance  activities\u2014ASFR and Field Examination\u2014performed manual workload  selection on SRFMI cases. Second, IRS is barred by the 3-year statute of  limitations from assessing tax liabilities identified by state tax data  received in the earlier phases of the pilot program. IRS submitted a  legislative proposal that would extend the 3-year limitation for  assessments based on information obtained from state and local tax data.", "IRS does not have a plan that details the type and source of data necessary  to evaluate the pilot program, methods for data collection, or the timing  and frequency of data collection.

Instead, IRS has analyzed phase I data in an ad hoc manner, using data  from the two compliance activities (i.e., ASFR and Field Examination) that  worked the available cases.

For example,  SB/SE Research was asked to conduct an analysis with available phase I  matched data using federal tax returns and Arkansas, Iowa, and  Massachusetts state tax-amnesty data to determine SRFMI\u2019s cost  effectiveness. The results of the SB/SE Research were not conclusive,  because the data they used were not a representative sample of ASFR and  Field Examination SRFMI cases. Because ASFR and Field Examination  did not have cost data, SB/SE Research could not do a cost-effectiveness  study. Instead, for ASFR, the study compared dollars assessed per case  and dollars assessed per hour worked on SRFMI cases with normal non- SRFMI cases. For Field Examination, it tracked average hours worked per  return, no-change rate, cycle time, and pick-up rate.
