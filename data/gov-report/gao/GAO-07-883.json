GAO was asked to (1) identify trends in federal resources to regions and states for enforcement between 1997 and 2006, and determine regions' and states' views on the adequacy of these resources; (2) determine EPA's progress in improving priority setting and enforcement planning with states; and (3) examine EPA's efforts to improve oversight of states' enforcement programs and identify additional actions EPA could take to ensure more consistent state performance and oversight. GAO examined information from all 10 regions and 10 authorized states, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall funding to regions and authorized states increased from 1997 through 2006, but these increases did not keep pace with inflation and the growth in enforcement responsibilities. Over the 10-year period, EPA's enforcement funding to the regions decreased 8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms. Regional officials said they reduced the number of enforcement staff by about 5 percent. EPA's grants to states to implement federal environmental programs also declined by 9 percent in inflation-adjusted terms while enforcement and other environmental program responsibilities increased. According to state officials, reductions in grant funds have limited their ability to meet EPA's requests to implement new requirements. For example, according to New York State officials responsible for the hazardous waste program, a reduction in EPA grants between 1997 and 2006 has meant a 38 percent reduction in the full-time state staff supported by federal funding for this program. However, EPA information on the workload and staffing needs of its regions and the states is incomplete, and, thus, it is not possible with existing data to determine their overall capacity to meet their enforcement responsibilities. EPA has made substantial progress in improving priority setting and enforcement planning with states through its system for setting national enforcement priorities and the EPA/state National Environmental Partnership System (NEPPS), which have fostered a more cooperative relationship. For example, on states' recommendation, OECA accepted as a priority ensuring that facilities handling hazardous substances, such as lead or mercury, have the financial resources to close their facilities, clean up contamination, and compensate communities and individuals affected by the contamination. EPA and states have also made some progress in using NEPPS for joint planning and resource allocation. State participation in the partnership grew from 6 pilot states in fiscal year 1996 to 41 states in fiscal year 2006. EPA has improved its oversight of state enforcement programs by implementing the State Review Framework (SRF) as a means to perform a consistent approach for overseeing the programs. Moreover, EPA can make additional progress by addressing weaknesses that the SRF reviews identified and by implementing other improvements to ensure oversight that is more consistent. For example, the SRF reviews show that EPA has limited ability to determine whether the states are performing timely, appropriate enforcement and whether penalties are applied to environmental violators in a fair and consistent manner within and among the states. In addition, GAO noted that EPA could make further use of the SRF to (1) determine the root causes of poorly performing programs; (2) inform the public about how well the states are implementing their enforcement responsibilities; and (3) extend the use of the SRF methodology to assess the performance of EPA's regions, which have been inconsistent in their enforcement and oversight efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in partnership with state  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in partnership with state  agencies, oversees compliance with 44 separate environmental programs.  agencies, oversees compliance with 44 separate environmental programs.

EPA- authorized states monitor the compliance of regulated facilities by  conducting inspections, performing evaluations, and reviewing records to  verify facilities\u2019 compliance with programs regulating the discharge of  pollutants into surface water or the air and the storage and disposal of  hazardous waste. States are expected to pursue enforcement actions  against those facilities found in noncompliance and to report their actions  to EPA.", "EPA administers its environmental enforcement responsibilities through  its headquarters Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance  (OECA). OECA monitors the compliance of regulated facilities, identifies  national enforcement concerns and sets priorities, and provides overall  direction on enforcement policies. While OECA headquarters occasionally  takes direct enforcement action, much of EPA\u2019s enforcement  responsibilities are carried out by its 10 regional offices. These offices are  responsible for carrying out core program activities under each of the  major federal environmental statutes, as well as significant involvement in  implementing EPA\u2019s national enforcement priorities and taking direct  enforcement action. The regions are also responsible for overseeing  authorized states\u2019 enforcement programs, implementing programs in  Indian country and states that are not authorized for particular programs.  OECA also expects regions and authorized states to establish enforcement  priorities and expectations and reach agreement on their respective roles  and responsibilities. Authorized states may also receive EPA grants to  assist in implementing and enforcing authorized programs. In fiscal year  2006, grants to states and tribes totaled $3.2 billion, or about 42 percent of  EPA\u2019s total budget.", "Over the years, states have increased their inspection and enforcement  activities. As a result, EPA regional offices are now more actively involved  in conducting oversight and providing states with guidance, training, and  technical assistance to assure consistent performance of state  enforcement programs. If EPA finds a state is not adequately  administering or enforcing authorized programs, individual environmental  statutes may authorize EPA to take certain actions, including providing  additional technical assistance, conditioning the receipt of grant funds on  compliance with EPA guidance, or withdrawing state authorization. In  addition, when EPA finds a specific state enforcement action to be  inadequate, the agency may take federal enforcement action against the  violator.", "Despite the interdependence between EPA and the states in carrying out  enforcement responsibilities, effective working relationships have  historically been difficult to establish and maintain, as we, EPA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General, the National Academy of Public Administration, and  others have reported. The following three key issues have affected EPA- state relationships:    EPA\u2019s funding allocations to the states have not fully reflected the  differences among the states\u2019 enforcement workload and their relative  ability to enforce state environmental programs consistent with federal  requirements. In this regard, EPA lacks information on the capacity of  both the states and EPA\u2019s regions to effectively carry out their  enforcement programs, because the agency has done little to assess the  overall enforcement workload of the states and regions and the number  and skills of people needed to implement enforcement tasks, duties, and  responsibilities. Furthermore, the states\u2019 capacity continues to evolve as  they assume a greater role in the day-to-day management of enforcement  activities, workload changes occur as a result of new environmental  legislation, new technologies are introduced, and state populations shift.", "Problems in EPA\u2019s enforcement planning and priority setting processes  have resulted in misunderstandings between OECA, regional offices, and  the states regarding their respective enforcement roles, responsibilities,  and priorities. States have raised concerns that EPA sometimes  \u201cmicromanages\u201d state programs without explaining its reasons for doing  so and often does not adequately consult the states before making  decisions affecting them.", "OECA has not established a consistent national strategy for overseeing  states\u2019 enforcement of EPA programs. Consequently, the regional offices  have not been consistent in how they oversee the states. Some regional  offices conducted more in-depth state reviews than others, and states in  these regions have raised concerns that their regulated facilities are held  to differing standards of compliance than facilities in states located in  other regions.", "EPA and leaders of state environmental programs have tried over the  years to establish new mechanisms to address each of these long-standing  problems in order to strengthen the EPA-state partnership. For example,  EPA has linked its budgeting and allocation process to its strategic goals  and objectives, and makes strategic decisions in developing its budget for  its enforcement workforce to reflect shifting priorities. Nonetheless,  according to OECA officials, shifts in funding and staff years made as a  result of changing priorities are generally marginal. In this regard, in July  2005 we reported that an effective workforce strategy is needed,  particularly during times of fiscal constraint, so that OECA can tailor  workforce changes to reflect actual conditions in the regions and states  and minimize potential adverse impacts on EPA\u2019s programs.", "To better clarify roles, responsibilities, and priorities between EPA and the  states, the agency established the National Environmental Performance  Partnership System (NEPPS) in 1995 to give states demonstrating strong  environmental performance greater flexibility and autonomy in planning  and operating their environmental programs. Under this system, a state  and EPA may enter into a Performance Partnership Agreement (PPA) that  identifies the state\u2019s environmental goals and priorities, and spells out how  EPA and state officials are to address them. States may also ask to  combine EPA grants into a Performance Partnership Grant (PPG), which  is intended to allow the state greater flexibility in targeting limited  resources to meet its priorities. In 2003, OECA revised its process for  setting national enforcement priorities to better consider the views of  states and regions and to more effectively target enforcement resources.  Under the new process, OECA headquarters evaluates the overall  environmental performance of individual industrial sectors, and solicits  views about those sectors from states and regions, the representatives of  the industrial sectors, and the public. OECA uses this information to  identify priorities that are best addressed through focused federal  attention. OECA issues guidance to the regions and states for  implementing the national enforcement priorities, as well as guidance for  deterring noncompliance among all regulated sectors.", "Likewise, OECA implemented a new oversight program in 2004, known as  the State Review Framework (SRF), to more uniformly and objectively  measure the performance of states\u2019 enforcement programs. Under SRF,  regions evaluate the extent to which state performance in managing three  major programs complies with specific legal requirements, policy, and  guidance, while OECA headquarters manages the overall review process.  In conducting this evaluation, the regions use 12 review elements, such as  the degree to which states complete planned inspections, accurately  identify significant violations, and take timely and appropriate  enforcement action. As of January 2007, EPA had conducted SRF reviews  in 33 states and expected to complete its assessment of the remaining  states by the end of fiscal year 2007. EPA plans to evaluate the  implementation of SRF in fiscal year 2008. Appendix II contains a detailed  description of the development of the SRF.", "In this context, you asked that we (1) identify trends in the federal  resources provided to regions and states for enforcement between 1997  and 2006, and determine regional and states\u2019 views on the adequacy of  these resources to implement their activities; (2) determine EPA\u2019s  progress in improving priority setting and enforcement planning with its  regions and authorized states; and (3) examine EPA\u2019s efforts to improve its  oversight of state\u2019s enforcement and compliance programs and identify  additional actions that could be taken to ensure more consistent state  performance and more consistent oversight of state programs.", "To address these issues, we reviewed EPA\u2019s strategic plans and national  strategy, and its policy and guidance for planning and implementing its  enforcement programs and for establishing performance partnerships with  authorized state agencies. We also examined the budgets for EPA and  OECA for fiscal years 1997 through 2006. We discussed the development  and implementation of national strategy, policy, guidance, and resource  allocation with officials of OECA, EPA\u2019s Office of Congressional and  Intergovernmental Relations, EPA\u2019s Office of Chief Financial Officer, and  officials responsible for state program oversight in each of EPA\u2019s 10  regional offices. In each region, we examined regional strategic plans,  partnership agreements with authorized states, and state oversight  reviews. We used semi-structured interviews to elicit, organize, and  evaluate narrative responses from officials at the 10 regional offices and 10  authorized state agencies. We selected one state from each region: five  states that had performance partnership agreements with EPA (Iowa,  Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, and Utah) and five that did not  (Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, New York, and West Virginia). At these state  agencies, we reviewed strategic plans and strategy, and policy and  guidance for planning and implementing enforcement programs. We were  not able to assess the workload and capacity of states to meet their  programs because, as mentioned previously, EPA does not have a system  to collect information needed for such an assessment, including consistent  and complete information from the states or regions on their workload  and the number, type, and skills of staff needed to carry out these  responsibilities.

This responsibility  has traditionally involved monitoring compliance by those in the regulated  community (such as factories or businesses that release pollutants into the  environment or use hazardous chemicals), ensuring that violations are  properly identified and reported, and ensuring that timely and appropriate  enforcement actions are taken against violators when necessary.", "Because states historically had primary responsibility for addressing  environmental pollution, including taking the lead role in enforcement  under federal environmental legislation of the 1950s and 1960s, many  states were dissatisfied with the new enforcement powers Congress  granted to EPA. Referring to his first term as EPA Administrator during  the 1970s, William Ruckelshaus described relations between EPA and state  governments as \u201cterrible,\u201d largely because EPA itself represented a  repudiation of what the state regulators had been doing. The states felt, he  believed, that in the face of very little public or political support, they had  made considerable progress and were getting no credit for it. The very  existence of EPA symbolized to state environmental agencies the lack of  appreciation the public had for their efforts and accomplishments.", "Furthermore, because EPA was now responsible for ensuring the  implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, states needed to  demonstrate to EPA that they had acquired and were maintaining  adequate authority to enforce program requirements consistent with  federal law before EPA would \u201cauthorize\u201d and continue to allow states to  assume the day-to-day administration of new environmental programs.  This federal oversight contributed to a very difficult period between EPA  and the states. The states thought EPA dictated too much and was too  intrusive.", "Difficulties in the EPA-state relationship manifested themselves from the  1970s through the 1990s and, to some degree, have continued to the  present day. In 1980, we described the failings of the EPA-state  partnership. In a 1988 comprehensive management review of EPA, we  reported that while some progress had been made in improving the  EPA/state relationship, the goal of a truly effective EPA-state partnership  remained elusive. Many state officials expressed concerns about having  limited flexibility, too much EPA control, and excessively detailed EPA  oversight.", "In 2003, OECA officials said that environmental commissioners in several  states and members of the Environmental Council of the States (ECOS)  called for OECA to develop and implement a consistent and objective  mechanism for measuring state performance. Specifically, ECOS wanted  EPA\u2019s oversight of state programs to be consistent between EPA regions  and states in the same region. ECOS also wanted EPA oversight to be  predictable, repeatable, and unbiased. In December 2003, OECA began  jointly developing the SRF with input from EPA regions, associations  representing state pollution control agencies, ECOS and state officials to  evaluate the extent to which state performance in three major programs  complies with specific legal requirements, policy and guidance. The SRF  measures state performance using 12 required elements and an optional  13th element. The elements include five categories: (1) review of state  inspection implementation; (2) review of state enforcement activity; (3)  review of state enforcement commitments; (4) review of state data  integrity; and (5) for the optional 13th element, a review of additional  programs of the state\u2019s choice to insure consideration of state activities  that support the overall evaluation. Regions prepare a draft report of the  findings and conclusions of each review, jointly discuss with the state how  major recommendations will be addressed, and provide the draft reports  to OECA headquarters. OECA reviews the draft reports and provides  comments on the regions\u2019 analyses and recommendations. A more detailed  description of the SRF is included in appendix II.", "The relationship between EPA and state environmental agencies varies  substantially from state to state and program to program. Staff in EPA\u2019s  regional offices operate programs in those states that have elected not to  seek authorization and in those states that EPA has concluded are not  prepared to manage the programs effectively. In some cases, where EPA  has denied a state with program authorization, state personnel may do  most of the work as if they had the authority to grant permits, with EPA  employees handling only the final step of formally issuing the documents.  In other states or programs, EPA may approve a \u201cpartial delegation\u201d of  authority, under which a state operates part of a program that can be  delegated and EPA operates the remainder.", "Just as EPA can authorize a state to conduct day-to-day program  management, environmental statutes may allow EPA to withdraw  authorization if a state fails to meet certain conditions, including  maintaining the capacity to effectively manage the program and adopting  and properly exercising the legal authorities to enforce program  compliance consistent with federal laws and regulations.

For example,  enforcement officials in Arizona and West Virginia told us that reductions  in section 105 grants have made it difficult to meet EPA\u2019s push for states to  identify and regulate air toxic emissions from small stationary sources,  such as dry cleaners. According to the director of West Virginia\u2019s air  quality program, while his office has identified these sources and provided  this information to Region 3 (Philadelphia), it does not have the resources  to regulate these sources.

Furthermore, while it continues to focus on EPA\u2019s national priorities for  enforcement, the state has accumulated a backlog of permits that must be  renewed. Renewing these hazardous waste permits is critical to protecting  the environment and public health because EPA and authorized states can  enforce new hazardous waste standards only when they are specified in a  permit. According to these officials, EPA has issued new standards during  the life of the old permit and these new standards are not enforceable until  the permit is renewed.", "Several states identified an emerging challenge: verifying that owners and  operators of hazardous waste facilities have the financial resources to  clean up their sites, as RCRA requires, rather than leaving site cleanup to  the taxpayer. As we reported in 2005, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General  concluded that required cleanups at some sites could exceed $50 million.  EPA made enforcement of the financial assurance requirement a national  enforcement priority in 2005. However, state officials told us, and EPA\u2019s  regional officials agreed, that they do not have the personnel with the  necessary skills to evaluate the financial assurances provided. For  example, New York State officials told us that they have only one person  trained to review the adequacy of a facility\u2019s financial assurance.", "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also expanded states\u2019 enforcement  workload by requiring, among other things, (1) EPA and any state  receiving federal funding to inspect by August 8, 2007, all regulated tanks  that were not inspected since December 22, 1998, and (2) EPA or the state  must generally inspect regulated tanks once every 3 years and complete  the first 3-year inspection cycle within 3 years of completing inspections of  underground storage tanks that had not been inspected by December 22,  1998.

To develop more collaborative  relationships among EPA\u2019s headquarters and regions, and the states,  OECA created the Planning Council in 2003 to direct OECA\u2019s strategic and  planning processes, including selecting national enforcement priorities.  The council includes both EPA headquarters and regional officials. In the  summer of 2003, OECA asked officials representing state environmental  agencies, tribal governments, and air, water, and solid waste pollution  control associations to recommend priorities for consideration as national  priorities for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. Considering these  recommendations, as well as those from EPA\u2019s media program managers,  OECA developed a list of potential national priorities that it published in  the Federal Register in December 2003. OECA asked for public comments  on candidate priorities and suggestions for new national enforcement  priorities. In January 2004, OECA hosted a meeting with headquarters and  regional officials, and representatives from 10 state environmental  agencies, four tribal governments, and three pollution control associations  to discuss and rank their choices of potential priorities. OECA then  selected the final national enforcement priorities for fiscal years 2005  through 2007 based on the following criteria:    Significant environmental benefit. In what specific areas can the federal  enforcement and compliance assurance programs make a significant  positive impact on human health and/or the environment? What are the  known or estimated public health or environmental risks?", "Noncompliance. Are there particular economic or industrial sectors,  geographic areas, or facility operations where regulated entities have  demonstrated serious patterns of noncompliance?", "EPA responsibility. What identified national problem areas or programs  are better addressed through EPA\u2019s federal capability in enforcement or  compliance assistance?", "Table 1 shows the potential national priorities, and those that were  selected.", "According to state and regional officials, OECA\u2019s approach for selecting  national priorities has fostered a more collaborative working relationship,  and they pointed to the financial assurance national priority under RCRA  as a case in point. This priority focuses on ensuring that owners and  operators of facilities handling hazardous substances, such as lead or  mercury, provide assurance that they have the financial resources  necessary to close their facilities, clean up any contamination, and  compensate communities and individuals affected by any contamination  they cause. Stakeholders\u2014EPA regions, states, pollution control  associations, and the public\u2014told OECA that financial assurance should  be a national priority. EPA and state supporting investigations confirmed  that (1) there are significant noncompliance issues relating to the financial  assurance requirements; (2) the issues are of national importance and deal  with several environmental laws and regulatory programs; and (3) areas of  noncompliance were not isolated to a specific sector, industry, or  geographic location. In selecting financial assurance as a national priority,  OECA stated that an effective national enforcement and compliance  strategy would help address many of the problems created by the  regulated facilities\u2019 failure to fulfill their financial responsibility  obligations. In this regard, EPA is providing training to state inspectors\u2014 who often do not have expertise in financial management\u2014on how to  assess the adequacy of financial documentation provided by regulated  facilities.", "While state and regional officials told us the priority setting process is  more collaborative, some state officials raised a number of issues about  how EPA considered their comments about national priorities. For  example, Massachusetts and Oregon officials told us that they did not  understand why OECA ranked some of their priorities lower than the  national priorities that were selected and would like to have feedback on  how their views were considered when selecting national enforcement  priorities. In addition, while Minnesota, Utah, and Arizona officials agree  that the planning and priority setting has improved, they would prefer  earlier involvement in the decision-making process, that is, in developing  the candidate list. On the other hand, New York and Arkansas said that  they preferred to provide input on the national enforcement priorities  through the pollution control associations and/or ECOS. They said, by  doing so, OECA will receive states\u2019 collective views on the candidate  priorities in a more representative and compelling way.", "After OECA selects the national enforcement priorities, it uses the  National Program Managers guidance to inform its stakeholders of the  national priorities and required elements of all environmental laws. The  managers establish overall national goals for their respective programs  based on a variety of factors, including underlying statutory mandates,  congressional directives, administration/administrator priorities, and their  own view of programs and policies that the programs should focus on.  EPA regions and states use this guidance to negotiate agreements based  on (1) which environmental problems will receive priority attention within  state programs, (2) what EPA\u2019s and the states\u2019 respective enforcement  roles and responsibilities will be, and (3) how the states\u2019 progress in  achieving program objectives will be assessed.

Once the funds are consolidated, they lose their  category-specific identity and can be used with greater flexibility. We  found that states that had a PPG, but not a PPA, had mixed views on  NEPPS. For example, according to the New York State Department of  Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), which currently has a  performance grant only for water programs, it experimented with a  performance agreement in the mid-1990s but dropped the endeavor  because of difficulties in drafting an agreement that combined multiple  agency divisions. NYSDEC officials said the amount of work involved  outweighed the benefits to individual programs. Furthermore, even with a  performance grant for water programs, NYSDEC officials told us, EPA still  maintains requirements for how the money is used and attempts to steer  the state toward EPA\u2019s priorities, which are not necessarily NYSDEC\u2019s  priorities. In contrast, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality,  which has a performance grant but not a performance agreement, said it  has a \u201cfantastic relationship\u201d with Region 9 that is characterized by  extensive coordination and communication.

For example, the SRF reviews found that states are not  properly documenting inspection findings or penalties, as directed by  EPA\u2019s enforcement policy and guidance. While recognizing that these  findings are useful, EPA has not developed a plan for how it will uniformly  address them in a timely manner. Nor has the agency identified the root  causes of the weaknesses, although some EPA and state officials attribute  the weaknesses to causes such as increased workloads concomitant with  budgetary reductions.

However, it also reported  that the reviews found several weaknesses in state programs that will  require focused attention to correct. EPA officials said the following four  weaknesses were the most frequently identified:    States are not adequately documenting the results of facility inspections  in order to determine the significance of violations. EPA policy states  that complete and accurate documentary evidence is needed to determine  the nature and extent of violations, particularly the presence of significant  violations, and to support timely and appropriate enforcement actions.  EPA policy also states that a quality program should maintain accurate  and up-to-date files and records, and report this information to EPA to  support effective program evaluation and priority setting. EPA and state  officials suggested that some of the causes of inadequate state  documentation and reporting of facility inspections can be traced to a lack  of staff expertise, inadequate training, increasing workload, and  reductions in staff and budgetary resources in recent years.", "States are not adequately entering significant violations noted in their  inspection reports into EPA databases. GAO, EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, and OECA have reported that the lack of complete and accurate  national enforcement data has been a long-term problem.

In addition, accurate and complete  enforcement data helps OECA more efficiently and effectively oversee  states and regions. According to EPA regional and state officials, the SRF  is helping them recognize the reasons for discrepancies between state and  EPA databases and improve the quality of data in these databases.", "States lack adequate or appropriate penalty authority or policies.", "Penalties play a key role in environmental enforcement by deterring  potential violators and ensuring that members of the regulated community  cannot gain a competitive advantage by violating enforcement regulations.  To qualify as an authorized state for administering environmental  programs, states must, among other things, acquire and maintain adequate  authority to enforce program requirements consistent with federal  requirements. For example, to obtain EPA\u2019s approval to administer the  Clean Air Act\u2019s Title V permitting requirements for major air pollution  sources, states must have, among other things, authority to recover civil  penalties and provide appropriate criminal penalties. EPA\u2019s policy  provides that all penalties should include two components. First, penalties  should include an \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d component that reflects the benefit  achieved by avoiding compliance. This component is considered important  to \u201cleveling the playing field\u201d among companies within an industry and  eliminating any economic advantage violators gain through delayed or  avoided compliance costs. The second component\u2014the \u201cgravity-based  component\u201d\u2014reflects the seriousness of the violation, the actual or  possible harm it causes, and the size of the violator.", "States are not documenting how they implement EPA\u2019s policies for  calculating and assessing penalties. According to EPA policy, states need  to maintain sufficient documentation so that the regions can evaluate (1)  the state\u2019s rationale for obtaining a penalty and (2) where appropriate, the  calculation of the economic benefit and gravity-based components. If a  state has not assessed a penalty or other appropriate sanction against a  violator, EPA may take direct enforcement action to recover a penalty.  However, regional and state offices we interviewed said applying this  policy places strains on the EPA/state working relationship because states  generally prefer that EPA not take direct enforcement action against  regulated entities in their states. For this reason, EPA generally does not  take direct enforcement action solely to recover additional penalties  unless a state penalty is determined to be grossly deficient.", "Regional and state officials said states vary as to whether their  environmental program administrators have the authority to assess  penalties. If program administrators lack this authority, they must pursue  judicial remedies through their state attorney general. Judicial actions  generally result in penalties and court orders requiring correction of the  violation. However, this route is more time-consuming and resource- intensive than having the environmental program office assess the penalty  and can significantly delay obtaining penalties and achieving a return to  compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modifications to the SRF Could Improve EPA\u2019s Enforcement Oversight Process", "paragraphs": ["The initial SRF findings provide the basis for discussions between EPA  and the states on how to address deficiencies in state compliance and  enforcement programs, many of which have been well known and long- standing.

The proposed evaluation methodology states  that EPA will address the effectiveness of implementing the SRF by  surveying the state environmental agencies that participated in the reviews  and the pollution control associations. However, this proposed evaluation  may not yield the results EPA will need to better ensure more consistent  state performance and more consistent state program oversight.

EPA could better ensure  more consistent state performance and more consistent oversight of state  enforcement programs by (1) developing and implementing corrective  actions for the major deficiencies identified through the SRF and (2)  assessing the capacity of poorly performing state programs to determine  whether they possess the staff, financial, and other resources to effectively  implement enforcement programs consistent with federal requirements.", "Region 8\u2019s experience in using the findings of its Uniform Enforcement  Oversight System may prove to be useful for OECA in addressing the  findings of the SRF on a nationwide basis. This oversight system was  designated a \u201cbest practice\u201d in the area of state agency oversight by EPA\u2019s  Office of Inspector General. The region evaluated states\u2019 enforcement  programs using uniform review criteria that had been previously agreed to  by each state agency. The region then used the evaluation findings to  develop an improvement strategy tailored to the particular weakness  identified in each state\u2019s enforcement program. In order to hold the states  accountable for correcting the weaknesses identified, Region 8 also used  the improvement strategy in arriving at annual agreements with the states.  For example, because of the findings from its oversight review of  Colorado\u2019s hazardous waste program, Region 8 officials became  concerned about the adequacy of the authorized program\u2019s ability to  protect human health and the environment or to take on new program  responsibilities. On the basis of these concerns, the region conducted an  in-depth \u201ccapability assessment\u201d of Colorado\u2019s hazardous waste program  beginning in 1998, covering items such as the state\u2019s levels of resources  and staff skills; professional development and training programs; and the  efforts to resolve legal and institutional limitations in its program. Over the  next 4 years, regional and state officials worked with state government  leaders to increase program funding, staff, and training, and to implement  new penalty policies. Region 8 also directly implemented compliance  monitoring and enforcement activities at selected Colorado hazardous  waste facilities while the state program developed and implemented its  enhanced capabilities. Region 8 conducted another capability assessment  in 2001 and concluded that the state had made the improvements  necessary to implement a fully authorized program.", "EPA could also use the SRF to inform the general public and others about  the extent to which states effectively implement environmental  enforcement programs consistent with federal requirements. EPA has not  yet determined whether or how the results of the SRF reports will be made  available to the general public, congressional committees, environmental  interest groups, state environmental organizations, local community  groups, and other interested groups and organizations. Many of these  groups have expressed deep interest in and concern over the years about  the consistency, fairness, and effectiveness of environmental enforcement.  A common criticism has been that variation in environmental compliance  and enforcement among the states has resulted in the lack of equitable  public health and environmental protection and the lack of a \u201clevel playing  field\u201d for business from one state to another. EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General also recommended that regional evaluations of state programs  should be made easily accessible to the public as an important means for  holding states accountable for their environmental performance. ECOS  and several states officials we interviewed expressed concern that public  dissemination of the SRF reports would be used inappropriately to  compare or rank state performance. However, the SRF reports have the  potential to convey useful information to both EPA managers and to the  public on the extent to which the enforcement program is being  implemented consistently and fairly nationwide.", "In addition to the usefulness of the SRF in evaluating state enforcement  programs, the SRF provides a model that OECA could use to evaluate  progress being made by EPA\u2019s regions in addressing inconsistencies in  enforcement actions and oversight.

We also met with officials from EPA Region  4, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, South Carolina  Department of Health, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection to obtain a more thorough understanding of how state agencies  work together to plan, set priorities, define roles and responsibilities, and  deploy resources for enforcement and compliance of environmental laws.", "We used a nonrandom sample of 10 states, which consisted of 1 state from  each region:    Five had a Performance Partnership Agreement (PPA) and Performance  Partnership Grant (PPG) with EPA (Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota,  Oregon, and Utah). These states incorporated an enforcement program  into their PPA, along with other essential elements that EPA and state  leaders considered important (e.g., jointly agreed priorities, defined  roles/responsibilities, and processes for resource deployment).", "Five states did not have a PPA (Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, New York, and  West Virginia), but had either a PPG or an alternative working relationship  with EPA.", "Our evaluation of 10 selected states cannot be generalized to the other  states with authorized programs. However, we met with EPA officials  representing all 10 regions, who provided their perspectives about all state  programs within their geographic region. In addition, we examined other  sources of state involvement, such as information available from ECOS  and pollution control associations (e.g., Association of State and  Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials, Association of State and  Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators, State and Territorial Air  Pollution Program Administrators, and the Association of Local Air  Pollution Control Officials, now known as the National Association of  Clean Air Agencies).", "We also limited our review to the environmental agencies within each  selected state that implement the major EPA programs (Clean Water Act,  Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act) and did not include state departments or agencies that  implemented other programs, such as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,  and Rodenticide Act.", "To determine if there were any trends in the federal resources provided to  EPA regions and states for enforcement from 1997 to 2006, and assess  EPA regional and state views on the adequacy of these resources to  implement their activities, we reviewed the budgets for EPA and the Office  of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) for fiscal years 1997  through 2006. We also reviewed our prior reports and those from the  Congressional Research Service (CRS), Congressional Budget Office  (CBO), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), EPA, and the EPA OIG,  for information on the distribution of federal resources. We met with  officials from the EPA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer and OECA,  ECOS, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and administered  structured interviews to officials in all 10 EPA regions and the selected  state in each region. In each region and state, we obtained perspectives on  the deployment of resources. However, we were not able to assess the  workload of the states and regions and their overall capability to meet  federal enforcement requirements because EPA\u2019s data collection system  does not collect sufficient information needed to make such an  assessment. In this regard, EPA lacks information on the capacity of both  the states and EPA\u2019s regions to effectively carry out their enforcement  programs, because the agency has done little to assess the overall  enforcement workload of the states and regions and the number and skills  of people needed to implement enforcement tasks, duties, and  responsibilities. Furthermore, the states\u2019 capacity continues to evolve as  they assume a greater role in the day-to-day management of enforcement  activities, workload changes occur as a result of new environmental  legislation, new technologies are introduced, and state populations shift.", "To determine EPA\u2019s progress in improving priority setting and  enforcement planning with its regions and authorized states, we reviewed  EPA\u2019s strategic plans and national strategy, its policy and guidance for  planning and implementing its enforcement programs, the process for  implementing National Environmental Performance Partnership  agreements with authorized state agencies, and Federal Register notices.  We also reviewed our prior reports and those from CRS, OMB, EPA, EPA  OIG, and NAPA for information on the planning and priority setting  process. We met with officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Congressional and  Intergovernmental Relations, OECA, ECOS, and the Natural Resources  Defense Council, and administered structured interviews to all 10 EPA  regions and the selected state in each region. In each region and state, we  examined regional and state strategic plans and state-EPA enforcement  agreements, such as memorandums of agreement, PPAs, and PPGs. At  state agencies, we also discussed the states\u2019 perspectives on how EPA  administered state-EPA agreements, regional plans, and national priorities.", "To determine EPA efforts to improve its oversight of state enforcement  and compliance programs, we reviewed EPA\u2019s policy and guidance for  overseeing state agencies. We met with officials from EPA\u2019s Office of  Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations, OECA, ECOS, and the  Natural Resources Defense Council, and administered structured  interviews to all 10 EPA regions, and the selected state in each region. In  each region, we examined strategic plans, state-EPA agreements, and 33  state oversight reviews of the SRF. At state agencies, we reviewed policy  and guidance and received perspectives on EPA\u2019s oversight process.", "We performed our work from October 2005 through July 2007, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, which  included an assessment of data reliability and internal controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Development and Implementation of the State Review Framework", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s criteria for assessing the performance of compliance assurance and  enforcement responsibilities in authorized states can be traced back to the  mid-1980s. In August 1986, the EPA Deputy Administrator issued a policy  guidance memorandum entitled \u201cRevised Policy Framework for State/EPA  Enforcement Agreements.\u201d The policy memorandum was intended to  provide a framework for gathering information and making judgments  about the effectiveness of state compliance and enforcement performance  and providing guidance on when and how EPA would become involved in  enforcement actions in authorized states. Among other things, the 1986  policy guidance discussed (1) EPA oversight criteria and the measures that  the agency would use to define good state performance, (2) oversight  procedures and protocols, and (3) criteria for direct federal intervention\u2014 factors EPA would consider before taking direct enforcement action in a  state and what states might reasonably expect of EPA in this regard.", "According to OECA officials, subsequent experience with the 1986 policy  guidance revealed several implementation shortcomings that limited  EPA\u2019s ability to adequately and consistently oversee state compliance and  enforcement programs. For example, the 1986 policy guidance did not  clearly describe how EPA would oversee state enforcement programs,  including what constituted \u201cgood program performance\u201d. Moreover, EPA  and authorized states did not agree on what uniform program information  states needed to maintain and provide to EPA for performance  measurement. This led to considerable inconsistency from region to  region in overseeing state compliance and enforcement programs.", "By 2003, OECA officials said that environmental commissioners in several  states and members of ECOS were in the forefront of the call for  developing and implementing a more uniform and systematic process for  EPA\u2019s oversight and evaluation of state compliance and enforcement  programs. Other factors also pointed to the need to develop a more  consistent method of gauging state performance. These included EPA\u2019s  OIG audits of state programs, EPA\u2019s internal assessments, and public  petitions for withdrawal of program authorizations for some state  programs. A common criticism was that variation in environmental  compliance and enforcement among the states was directly attributable to  the lack of uniform EPA oversight and performance measurement and that  the result was the lack of equitable public health and environmental  protection and lack of a level playing field for business from one state to  another.", "At an ECOS meeting in 2003, OECA officials said the Chairman of the  ECOS Compliance Committee proposed to EPA\u2019s then Deputy Assistant  Administrator for OECA a method for systematically and uniformly  assessing state performance. The assessment method, called the SRF, was  patterned after a review process originally developed by EPA\u2019s Region 8 to  assess the performance of state compliance and enforcement programs in  that region (encompassing the states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, South  Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana and 27 sovereign tribal nations). The  SRF was formally agreed to by EPA, ECOS, state media organizations, and  state environmental agency officials in December 2003.", "The 12-point evaluation model used in Region 8, called the Uniform  Enforcement Oversight System, became the basis for a review framework  for evaluating state compliance and enforcement performance. These 12  required elements for evaluation of state performance include the  following:  1.  the degree to which a state program has completed the universe of  planned inspections (addressing core requirements and federal, state  and regional priorities);  2.  the degree to which inspection reports and compliance reviews  document inspection findings, including accurate descriptions of what  was observed to sufficiently identify violations;  3.  the degree to which inspection reports are completed in a timely  manner, including timely identification of violations;  4.  the degree to which significant violations (e.g., significant  noncompliance and high priority violations) and supporting  information are accurately identified and reported to EPA national  databases in a timely manner;  5.  the degree to which state enforcement actions include required  corrective or complying actions (e.g., injunctive relief) that will return  facilities to compliance in a specific time frame;  6.  the degree to which a state takes timely and appropriate enforcement  actions, in accordance with policy relating to specific media;  7.  the degree to which a state includes both gravity and economic benefit  calculations for all penalties, appropriately using the economic benefit  calculation model (BEN) or similar state model (where in use and  consistent with national policy);  8.  the degree to which final enforcement actions collect appropriate  economic benefit and gravity penalties in accordance with applicable  penalty policies;  9.  the degree to which enforcement commitments in the PPA, PPG,  and/or other written agreements to deliver a product/project at a  specified time, if they exist, are met and any products or projects are  completed;  10. the degree to which the minimum data requirements are timely;  11. the degree to which the minimum data requirements are accurate; and  12. the degree to which the minimum data requirements are complete,  unless otherwise negotiated by the region and state or prescribed by a  national initiative.", "The SRF also includes a 13th \u201coptional\u201d element that is open for  negotiation between regions and states. EPA and ECOS encourage the use  of the 13th element to ensure the review takes a measure of the full range  of program activities and results. These components can add meaningful  input into a state\u2019s overall performance and program. Topics could include  program areas such as compliance assistance, pollution prevention,  innovation, incentive or self-disclosure programs, relationships with state  attorneys general, and outcome measures or environmental indicators that  go beyond the core program activities covered in elements 1 through 12.", "The SRF was also seen by the parties as being consistent with the  principles of the National Environmental Performance Partnership  System, which provides a mechanism for joint planning and program  management that takes advantage of the unique capabilities of each party  in addressing pressing environmental problems. Also, the SRF considers  commitments negotiated between EPA regions and states contained in  PPAs, PPGs, and/or other agreements that may differ from national policy  and guidance and evaluates state performance in terms of those  commitments. In cases where states and regions have negotiated different  state commitments (e.g., number of inspections) or other activities, states  are held accountable for those commitments, although the SRF reviewers  may provide feedback that those commitments need to be increased in the  future to fully demonstrate an adequate enforcement program.", "After a review is completed, the regions prepare a draft report of the  findings and conclusions, jointly discuss with the state how major  recommendations will be addressed, and provide the draft report to OECA  headquarters. OECA reviews the draft reports and provides comments on  the regions\u2019 analyses and recommendations. OECA expects regions to  incorporate these recommendations into the next round of negotiated  agreements, where OECA will track and manage the recommendations to  conclusion.", "Additional anticipated benefits of applying the SRF\u2019s elements in a  uniform manner included, among others, (1) more strategic resource  allocation, (2) reduction of duplicative work, (3) consistent and  predictable baseline oversight across states and regions with agreed-upon  thresholds for corrective action, (4) differential oversight of state  programs based on performance, (5) a level playing field for states in  competition for business, and (6) improved public confidence in federal  and state compliance and enforcement programs. In addition, the SRF is  viewed as providing a basis to establish a dialogue on performance that  will lead to improved program management and environmental results.", "OECA pilot-tested the SRF during fiscal year 2004 in at least one state in  each of EPA\u2019s 10 regions. The states that participated in the pilot were all  volunteers. The pilot states included Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Rhode  Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,  and South Carolina. OECA also piloted the SRF in one EPA region, Region  10 (Seattle), to test the approach on EPA\u2019s direct implementation of the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Clean Water  Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program in  Alaska. EPA used the SRF to evaluate the enforcement performance of  three media programs (both the pilot reviews and subsequent reviews):  the Clean Air Act Stationary Sources program, the Clean Water Act  NPDES program, and (RCRA) Subtitle C hazardous waste program. For  each program, the SRF defined the essential elements and then, in a  companion Framework Implementation Guide more fully defined how  each element is to be applied and measured.", "In February 2005, OECA contracted for an evaluation of the pilot review  process to determine whether the SRF provides an accurate assessment of  state compliance and enforcement activities. The evaluation sought to  obtain answers to questions, such as the following: (1) Are the 12 review  elements the right ones? (2) Are the right data metrics being used? (3)  What barriers were encountered? The evaluation also addressed such  implementation issues as whether the reviews could be streamlined and  made more efficient; what barriers were encountered in conducting the  reviews and how they could be reduced or eliminated; and the consistency  of application across the country, specifically any need for and ways to  improve consistency; problems with objectivity; and apparent gaps in  capability or expertise that need to be addressed.", "The pilots were also evaluated to determine what they indicated about the  performance of the states, whether corrective actions or differential  oversight agreements get codified in grant agreements, and the best way to  summarize and communicate the results of the review. The evaluation  used the results of the pilots as well as discussions with key stakeholders  to support recommendations aimed at helping OECA improve the SRF  before implementing it more broadly. For example, while OECA had  allowed regions considerable discretion/flexibility on procedures for file  selection, the evaluation identified a number of weaknesses in the file  selection process and highlighted potential improvements to OECA\u2019s file  selection protocol. The consultant developed an improved sampling model  that would yield representative file reviews across states and provide a  more representative picture of enforcement and compliance assurance  across states with varying levels of enforcement activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Environmental Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Ed Kratzer, Assistant Director;  Charles W.
