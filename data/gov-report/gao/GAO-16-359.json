However, the program has not yet fully implemented almost half of the recommended security controls, did not have all of the information it needed when assessing security controls, and has not addressed key vulnerabilities in a timely manner (see figure). Until NOAA addresses these weaknesses, the JPSS ground system remains at high risk of compromise.", "NOAA has made progress in assessing and mitigating a near-term satellite data gap. GAO previously reported on weaknesses in NOAA's analysis of the health of its existing satellites and its gap mitigation plan. The agency improved both its assessment and its plan; however, key weaknesses remain.

These satellites obtain environmental data that are  processed to provide graphical weather images and specialized weather  products. These satellite data are also the predominant input to numerical  weather prediction models, which are a primary tool for forecasting  weather days in advance\u2014including forecasting the path and intensity of  hurricanes. The weather products and models are used to predict the  potential impact of severe weather so that communities and emergency  managers can help prevent and mitigate its effects. Polar satellites also  provide data used to monitor environmental phenomena, such as ozone  depletion and drought conditions, as well as data sets that are used by  researchers for a variety of studies such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position relative to  the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. Currently, a NOAA/NASA satellite (called the Suomi National  Polar-orbiting Partnership, or S-NPP) and two operational DMSP  satellites are positioned so that they cross the equator in the early  morning, mid-morning, and early afternoon. In addition, the government  relies on a series of European satellites, called the Meteorological  Operational (Metop) satellites, for satellite observations in the midmorning  orbit. These polar-orbiting satellites are considered primary satellites for  providing input to weather forecasting models. In addition to these  primary satellites, NOAA, the Air Force, and a European weather satellite  organization maintain older satellites that still collect some data and are  available to provide limited backup to the operational satellites should  they degrade or fail. Figure 1 illustrates the current operational polar  satellite constellation.", "According to NOAA, 80 percent of the data assimilated into its National  Weather Service numerical weather prediction models that are used to  produce weather forecasts 3 days and beyond comes from polar-orbiting  satellites. Specifically, a single afternoon polar satellite provides NOAA 45  percent of the global coverage it needs for its numerical weather models.

NPOESS satellites were  expected to replace the POES and DMSP satellites in the morning, mid- morning, and afternoon orbits when they neared the end of their expected  life spans. To reduce the risk involved in developing new technologies  and to maintain climate data continuity, the program planned to launch a  demonstration satellite in May 2006. The first NPOESS satellite was to  be available for launch in March 2008.", "However, in the years after the program was initiated, NPOESS  encountered significant technical challenges in sensor development,  program cost growth, and schedule delays. By March 2009, agency  executives decided to use the planned demonstration satellite as an  operational satellite because the schedule delays could have led to a gap  in satellite data. Eventually, cost and schedule concerns led the White  House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy to announce in  February 2010 that NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly procure the  NPOESS satellite system; instead, each agency would plan and acquire  its own satellite system.

In fiscal year 2013, NOAA officials agreed to cap the  JPSS life-cycle cost at $12.9 billion, and to merge funding for two climate  sensors into the JPSS budget. By October 2012, NOAA also decided to  remove selected elements from the satellite program, such as the number  of ground-based receptor stations (thus affecting the time it takes for  products to reach end users) and the number of interface data processing  segments.", "The administration then directed NOAA to begin implementing additional  changes in the program\u2019s scope and objectives in order to meet the  agency\u2019s highest-priority needs for weather forecasting and reduce  estimated life-cycle costs from $12.9 billion to $11.3 billion. By April 2013,  NOAA had decided to, among other things, cancel one of two planned  free-flyer missions and transfer the remaining free-flyer mission to a new  program within NOAA called the Solar Irradiance, Data, and Rescue  mission. In addition, requirements for certain climate sensors were  moved to NASA. As we reported previously, NOAA also reduced the  estimated life-cycle cost of the program by eliminating the operational  costs for the 3 years at the end of the JPSS mission; the current life-cycle  cost estimate includes operational costs through 2025 even though the  JPSS-2 satellite is expected to be operational until 2028.

If the satellites last longer than expected,  then there could be unnecessary redundancy. For example, at the  extended useful life estimate of 10 to 11 years, JPSS-1, JPSS-2, and  JPSS-3 would still be available in 2027 when JPSS-4 completes  development. If NOAA were to delay launching JPSS-4 until it is needed,  the satellite could be in storage for 4 years. Figure 8 shows anticipated  satellite lifetimes with extended useful lives.", "Alternatively, if the early satellites do not last longer than expected, then  there is an increased potential for future gaps in polar satellite coverage,  as there will be several periods in which only one satellite is on orbit. Due  to this uncertainty, NOAA faces important decisions on timing the  development and launch of the remaining satellites in the JPSS program.", "NOAA requires cost/benefit studies for major programs to assist in  making major decisions. However, the program did not evaluate the costs  and benefits of launch scenarios based on the latest estimates of how  long the satellites would last. Such an analysis is needed to ensure robust  coverage while minimizing program costs, and could help determine the  most cost-effective launch schedule. For example, if JPSS-4 development  could be deferred, the annual cost of PFO might be decreased. A  potential cost decrease is important because, according to NOAA  documentation, the overall funding need for PFO is expected to be about  $8.2 billion, compared to about $11.3 billion for the full JPSS program  through 2025.", "Until NOAA ensures that its plans for future polar satellite development  are based on the full range of estimated lives of potential satellites, the  agency may not be making the most efficient use of the nation\u2019s sizable  investment in the polar satellite program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Facing a potential gap in weather satellite data, NOAA has made  progress in developing the JPSS-1 satellite and is on track to launch it in  March 2017. However, the agency continues to experience cost growth,  schedule delays, and technical risks on key components. In particular, a  component on the spacecraft has fallen more than 6 months behind  schedule, putting the spacecraft on the critical path leading up to the  planned launch date. Continued close management of costs, schedules,  and risks will be essential to ensuring a successful and timely launch.", "Given the increasing information security risks across the federal  government, building information security into ground systems is a critical  component of the JPSS system development. Although the JPSS  program has assessed key risks, established and evaluated security  controls, and remediated selected control weaknesses, key deficiencies  remain. Specifically, the team responsible for testing security controls did  not have all the information it needed to test the entire system. Also, while  the assessment found numerous vulnerabilities, the program has not  addressed them in a timely manner. These security shortfalls put the  program at risk of being compromised, and there have been a number of  security incidents affecting the ground system in recent years. While  NOAA\u2019s incident response group has effectively addressed security  incidents, there are discrepancies between NOAA and the JPSS program  on the status of incidents. Such discrepancies make it more difficult to  ensure that all incidents are identified, addressed, and tracked to closure.", "Until these deficiencies are addressed, the polar satellite infrastructure  will continue to be at increased risk of compromise.", "To address the risk of a near-term satellite gap and to move to a more  robust constellation of polar satellites, NOAA has assessed the health of  its operational satellites annually, established and improved its gap  mitigation plans, and is beginning to plan a new satellite program to  ensure coverage through 2038. While the JPSS program improved its  satellite assessment and gap mitigation plans, shortfalls remain, including  identifying recovery time objectives for key data products. In prior reports,  we have made recommendations to NOAA to improve its satellite  availability assessment and its gap mitigation plans. We continue to  believe that these recommendations are valid and, if fully implemented,  would improve NOAA\u2019s ability to assess and manage the risk of a gap in  satellite data. We will continue to monitor NOAA\u2019s ongoing efforts to  address our prior recommendations.", "While NOAA is planning a follow-on polar satellite program to better  ensure polar satellite coverage in the future, the agency has not  evaluated the costs and benefits of different launch scenarios based on  its updated understanding of how long its satellites might last, and  uncertainties remain in determining appropriate dates for the  development and launch of the satellites. Unless NOAA makes launch  decisions based on the most current estimates of useful life of its  satellites, the agency may not make the most effective and economical  use of the nation\u2019s sizable investment in polar satellites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of addressing risks on the JPSS satellite program,  we are making the following four recommendations to the Secretary of  Commerce.

We received written comments from the  Department of Commerce transmitting NOAA\u2019s comments, which are  reprinted in appendix IV. NOAA concurred with all four of our  recommendations and identified steps it is taking to implement them. In  its comments, NOAA wrote that it recognizes the need to close polar data  gaps and to keep pace with changes in information security requirements;  however, it noted that resource constraints and shifting priorities have  presented challenges in meeting these objectives.", "In response to our second recommendation, to schedule completion  dates for plans of actions and milestones (POA&M) to address critical and  high-risk vulnerabilities within 30 days as required by agency policy,  NOAA concurred and noted that JPSS would continue to follow agency  policy. NOAA explained that agency policy allows the authorizing official  to accept and document risks when remediation of vulnerabilities cannot  be performed as anticipated. It further noted that there are two situations  which may result in remediation taking longer than the policy requires: (1)  when applying patches to a system that must remain static while in  development and testing, and (2) when applying patches to a complex  operational system that requires analysis and testing prior to deployment  in order to protect the availability of the system. While we acknowledge  that there are valid reasons that remediating a POA&M might take longer  than the 30 days required by agency policy, the JPSS program did not  follow agency policy in that it did not schedule completion of key POA&Ms  within 30 days and did not have documentation from the authorizing  official accepting the risk of a delayed remediation schedule for critical  and high-risk vulnerabilities, as we note in this report. Moving forward,  NOAA noted that it plans to update its FIPS 200 compliance document to  include steps to obtain and document risk acceptance from the  authorizing official. We agree that updating this plan and implementing it  will help ensure that the program is better aligned with agency policy and  in a better position to remediate or accept vulnerabilities.", "In response to our fourth recommendation, to evaluate the costs and  benefits of different launch scenarios for the PFO program based on  updated satellite life expectancies, NOAA concurred and noted in its letter  that it had evaluated the costs and benefits of different launch scenarios  using the latest estimates of satellite lives as part of its budget  submission. We discussed this with program officials in April 2016.  Program officials explained that the program determined it would  minimize costs by building the satellites as soon as possible, and it would  minimize risks by planning to launch the satellites at a cadence that would  meet the program\u2019s goals for a robust polar constellation. However, the  agency did not provide sufficient supporting evidence or artifacts. Without  documentation showing specific comparisons of options with respect to  cost totals and overall risk, the assumptions NOAA used, and the  processes and time frames in which NOAA\u2019s decisions were reached, we  were not able to validate the agency\u2019s results.", "NOAA also stated in its letter that it will continue to update its analysis  based on, among other things, updated satellite life expectancies and  information gained from award of future spacecraft and instrument  contracts. Doing so would help ensure that the agency is making the most  efficient use of investments in the polar satellite program.", "NOAA also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated  into our report, as appropriate. In its technical comments, NOAA officials  referred to our finding that the satellite availability assessment is not  consistent with the estimated life dates in its flyout chart, noting that (1) its  flyout charts are not intended to depict a satellite\u2019s estimated life, and (2)  our focus on S-NPP\u2019s 50 percent likelihood of functioning in 2020 is  inappropriate because JPSS-1 will be the primary operational satellite in  2020. However, the flyout charts show \u201cplanned mission life\u201d according to  NOAA requirements. It is misleading to show a mission life extending  through late 2020 if the agency\u2019s estimate of the satellite\u2019s health puts it  at only a 50 percent likelihood of full functionality. Furthermore, while  JPSS-1 should be the primary satellite and S-NPP should be a secondary  satellite in 2020, the status of S-NPP\u2019s health would become paramount if  JPSS-1 experienced a failure on launch or on orbit.", "On March 16, 2016, an audit liaison for NASA provided an e-mail stating  that the agency would provide any input it might have to NOAA for  inclusion in NOAA\u2019s comments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of NASA, the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other interested  parties.
