Although HUD is still testing and revising PHAS, it has begun to designate certain housing authorities as troubled and to assign them to recovery centers, where they receive technical and other assistance. HUD also created the Public and Indian Housing Information Center (PIC) database to collect information on funding, compliance, and other problems that fall outside the scope of PHAS. PHAS includes four performance indicators: (1) the physical condition of the properties, (2) the financial condition of the housing authority, (3) the authority's management operations, and (4) residents' satisfaction with their living conditions. HUD develops a score for each indicator and, starting in this fiscal year, plans to use the scores for all four indicators to determine whether housing authorities are troubled. So far, HUD has used only the management operations score to designate housing authorities as troubled. The PIC risk assessment uses the total PHAS score and information about funding and compliance issues to classify troubled and nontroubled housing authorities as high, moderate, or low risk. According to HUD, the field offices focus their monitoring resources on the nontroubled high-risk authorities in an effort to correct their problems before the authorities are designated as troubled. GAO found inconsistencies between the PHAS and PIC assessment. The five public housing authorities GAO visited, which had not been designated as troubled under PHAS but had been classified as moderate to high risk under PIC, had various problems. However, even under the same authority, some developments were well or adequately maintained, while others had cosmetic, structural, or health and safety problems. HUD may provide technical assistance at a housing authority through either a field office team or a troubled agency recovery center. HUD may also impose sanctions on a housing authority or intervene in its operations to compel the authority to correct problems. For more serious, long-standing problems, HUD may put a housing authority into receivership. In some instances, HUD may enter into special agreements with housing authorities, giving them the flexibility to address unique problems. Although these options have the potential for solving problems at public housing authorities, it is still to early to evaluate their effectiveness. Moreover, in the past, the options have not always fully addressed the problems or the housing authorities have not sustained the improvements.

In response to  this law, HUD introduced the Public Housing Management Assessment  Program (PHMAP) in 1992.  Though designed to evaluate housing  authorities\u2019 performance, PHMAP was based on self-certification, and, by  1998, about two-thirds of the authorities had certified themselves as high  performers.  Furthermore, PHMAP did not provide for either an  independent physical inspection or input from the public housing residents  themselves.  An authority could be classified as a standard or a high  performer even though its residents were living in conditions that HUD  considered unacceptable.", "In 1997, as part of its 2020 Management Reform Plan, HUD instituted a new  approach for evaluating public housing authorities\u2019 overall performance  and for helping them improve their performance.  The approach includes  the following components:  PHAS is designed to obtain an independent evaluation of an authority\u2019s  overall operations, including the physical condition of its housing, the  soundness of its financial operations, the effectiveness of its  management operations, and the extent to which residents are satisfied  with their services and living conditions.", "The Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) collects and analyzes PHAS  data and provides for independent physical inspections of HUD\u2019s 14,000  public housing properties as well as for analyses of their financial  condition and surveys of residents\u2019 satisfaction.", "Two Troubled Agency Recovery Centers assist those authorities that fail  the PHAS evaluation and are designated as troubled or substandard as  well as those that voluntarily seek technical support from the centers.", "A statute requires that a housing authority be placed into receivership if  it is unable to turn around failing management and escape troubled  status within 2 years.", "HUD began collecting data for all four PHAS indicators in 1998, and for  fiscal year 1999, it computed, for each housing authority, a score for each  indicator as well as a total PHAS score.  HUD used these scores to test the  system but not to classify housing authorities\u2019 performance.  For public  housing authorities whose fiscal years ended on or after June 30, 2000,  HUD planned to implement PHAS fully; however, the Congress directed  HUD to conduct further testing and to obtain an independent evaluation of  PHAS before using its scores as a basis for taking adverse actions against  public housing authorities.  Interpreting the term \u201cadverse action\u201d to mean  the designation of a housing authority as troubled on the basis of its total  PHAS score, HUD decided to use the score for the management operations  indicator alone to classify performance for fiscal year 2000.  This decision,  in effect, perpetuated PHMAP, since the management operations indicator  served as the sole criterion for classifying performance under PHMAP.", "HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian Housing, which administers the public  housing program, uses PIC, an Internet-based information system, to  generate a risk assessment for the nation\u2019s 14,000 public housing  properties.

To date, HUD has only partially implemented PHAS, using  the score for just one indicator to designate authorities as troubled.

Our  analysis indicates that when HUD fully implements PHAS, using the scores  for all four indicators as planned, it should designate many more  authorities as troubled.  HUD is currently revising PHAS, attempting to  make it more responsive to the concerns of residents and the public  housing industry, before implementing it fully.  In addition to PHAS, HUD  uses the PIC risk assessment to classify troubled and nontroubled housing  authorities as high, moderate, or low risk and to focus its monitoring  resources primarily on the nontroubled high-risk authorities to prevent  them from being designated as troubled.  According to our analysis, 12 of  the troubled authorities were classified as low risk, and 1 of these  authorities, which was not referred to a recovery center, was scheduled to  receive only limited monitoring from the supervising field office.
