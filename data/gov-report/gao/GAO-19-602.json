The Bureau also designated an \u201carea of consideration\u201d for each  of its ACOs.

The decision to deviate from  requirements usually arose from a lack of viable options in the real-estate  market coupled with the Bureau\u2019s need to meet its time frames. According  to RCC staff, any deviations from requirements were presented at weekly  staff meetings and then subsequently approved by the Regional Director,  and in some cases such as co-location with law enforcement Bureau  Headquarters approval was needed.", "According to Bureau officials, co-location with law enforcement is  sensitive because of concerns that census data may be shared with  others.

According to officials at the regional  office, the Bureau saved time and money by using a readily available  cost-effective option by choosing Hagerstown, Maryland. The Bureau also  had to expand the area of consideration for more than 31 percent or 77 of  its 248 ACOs. According to Bureau officials, designating an area of  consideration was an iterative process based on market availability, and  having to expand the area was often necessary to secure space (see  table 1).", "In select cases, the Bureau co-located ACOs in the same building. For  example, instead of having one office in North Philadelphia and one in  South Philadelphia, Bureau officials in the Philadelphia Region Census  Center agreed to accept space in the same building located within the  boundaries of the South Philadelphia ACO. The Bureau hired staff for  each ACO from the original designated areas and kept the two offices  completely separated.

In  2010, the Bureau hired approximately 628,000 temporary workers to  conduct the address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up field  operations. Below is the recruiting and hiring timeline for the in-field  address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up operations (see fig. 3).", "According to Bureau officials, they are recruiting and hiring fewer  temporary staff in 2020 compared to 2010, in part, because automation  has made field operations more efficient. For example, there is less paper  to manage and process as daily payroll records and daily field work  assignments are electronic. As a result, productivity has increased and  mileage and labor costs have decreased because census field staff do  not meet daily with their supervisors, as was the case in 2010. Moreover,  the automation of assignment routing to housing units has optimized the  time spent by enumerators driving to housing units.

For example, according to the  Bureau, the overarching strategy for hiring enumerators is to hire people  who will work in the communities where they live. This strategy provides  the Bureau with enumerators who are familiar with the areas where they  will be working and who speak the languages of the local community. To  recruit staff, recruiting assistants are to work with local partnership staff  and use paid advertisements and earned media (e.g., publicity gained  through promotional efforts, news reports, etc.).", "The Bureau plans to also continue to use its recruiting website,  http://www.2020census.gov/jobs, which provides information about the  various positions, local pay rates, application materials, and job  qualifications.

The Bureau also had dual employment agreements with 28  federal agencies and commissions.", "For the 2010 Census, the Bureau had these agreements with a total of 81  federal agencies. To obtain waivers for individuals on public assistance,  the Bureau is partnering with the Office of Management and Budget and  working with Health and Human Services to obtain waivers for Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program recipients. The Bureau is also working with tribal governments to  acquire similar waivers.", "In addition to these previously used strategies, the Bureau is planning to  leverage technology in its recruiting strategy for 2020. This technology  includes the Bureau-developed Response Outreach Area Mapper  (ROAM) application, a publicly available online mapping tool that Bureau  staff can use to better understand the sociodemographic makeup of their  assigned areas. The Bureau plans to use ROAM to identify areas where  recruiting could be hard and to develop recruitment strategies such as  hiring staff with specific language skills.", "The new technology also includes the MOJO Recruiting Dashboard (also  referred to as MOJO Recruit), which is software for Census recruiting  personnel to plan and manage recruiting activities and track recruiting  progress. For example, MOJO Recruit includes an interactive mapping  feature which lets the Bureau plan recruiting activities and track recruiting  status for each census tract.

As of March 21, 2019,  Bureau officials told us that Bureau-wide there were 7,092 background  clearances pending, of which, 4,900 were for field positions. In response  to the backlog, Bureau leadership said it created a team to determine the  cause of the backlog and started having weekly meetings to prioritize  which job positions needed to be cleared first.", "Bureau officials stated that the delays arose, in part, because a significant  number of applicants did not completely or correctly fill out the e-QIP  form. This, they said, coupled with the increase in required pre- employment background checks, resulted in a growing backlog of  clearances for which the Bureau did not have the resources to clear. In  response, in February 2019, the Bureau began to bring on, through a  combination of new hires and reassignments, about 130 temporary staff.  New staff was assigned to either review the forms for accuracy and  completeness prior to being submitted to the CIS office, or help the CIS  offices conduct the pre-employment background checks.", "Additionally, Bureau officials told us that they meet weekly to reprioritize  job positions for the clearance process. The CIS office is to process  background checks for all Census employees requiring them, including  decennial census field staff, decennial census contractors, and staff  needed for nondecennial census surveys in headquarters and in the field.  According to Bureau officials, the decennial census takes precedence  and within the decennial census positions are also prioritized. For  example, in January 2019, the 800 recruiting assistants were given  priority and now the hiring of 1,501 partnership specialists has been given  priority.", "Bureau officials told us that in December 2018 they were processing 110  background checks a week, and have set a goal that each CIS analyst  process 25 pre-employment packages a week. There are 40 analysts on  board, giving the Bureau the ability to process 1,000 pre-employment  background check packages a week. Bureau officials also told us that  they anticipate the clearance process for the positions of enumerator/lister and census field supervisor will not experience the  same delays because these positions only require fingerprint processing,  which is quicker.", "According to Bureau officials, these results can be made available within  3 hours. Moreover, although the Bureau has taken steps to address the  backlog, the bulk of pre-employment background clearances has yet to  be processed and Bureau officials told us that they remain concerned. In  the coming months, the Bureau will need to conduct background checks  for an additional 3,991 recruiting assistants and about 10,300 office staff  for the remaining 209 offices.
