The explanatory statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2017, includes a provision for GAO to review ICE's methodologies for determining detention resource requirements. This report examines (1) how ICE formulates its budget request for detention resources, (2) how ICE develops bed rates and determines ADP for use in its budget process, and (3) to what extent ICE's methods for estimating detention costs follow best practices.

For example, in its fiscal year 2015 budget request, ICE made an error that resulted in an underestimation of $129 million for immigration detention expenses. While ICE officials stated their budget documents undergo multiple reviews to ensure accuracy, ICE was not able to provide documentation of such reviews. Without a documented review process for reviewing the accuracy of its budget request, ICE is not positioned to ensure the credibility of its budget requests.", "ICE has models to project the adult bed rate and ADP for purposes of determining its budget requests. However, ICE consistently underestimated the actual bed rate due to inaccuracies in the model, and it is unclear if the ADP used in the budget justification is based on statistical analysis. GAO identified factors in ICE's bed rate model\u2014such as how it accounts for inflation and double counts certain costs\u2014that may lead to its inaccurate bed rate projections. For example, in fiscal year 2016, ICE's projections underestimated the actual bed rate by $5.42 per day. For illustrative purposes, underestimating the bed rate by $5 per day, assuming an ADP of 34,000, yields a more than $62 million underestimation in the detention budget request. By assessing its methodology and addressing identified inaccuracies, ICE could ensure a more accurate estimate of its actual bed rate cost. Additionally, ICE reported that the ADP projections in its CBJs are based on policy decisions that account, for example, for anticipated policies that could affect the number of ICE's detainees. While ICE's projected ADP may account for policy decisions, documenting the methodology and rationale by which it determined the projected ADP would help demonstrate how the number was determined and that it was based on sound assumptions.", "ICE's methods for estimating detention costs do not fully meet the four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, as outlined in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . For example, while ICE's fiscal year 2018 detention cost estimate substantially met the comprehensive characteristic, it partially met the well-documented and accurate characteristics, and minimally met the credible characteristic.

(See  sidebar for more information.) We found that ICE has improved its  process for collecting this information from its financial management   system since 2014, when we previously reported that limitations in its  data system required ICE personnel to manually enter codes to  categorize relevant data. In fiscal year 2014, ICE introduced a new  financial coding process that allows staff to pull costs\u2014the obligations  and expenditures\u2014directly from its financial management system.

According to ICE, the average of the year-over-year  percentage change serves as its inflation rate and more accurately  reflects the annual escalation of its detention costs. Given that ICE must  determine the projected bed rate almost two years into the future, ICE  applies its inflation rate twice to the current costs.", "Although the formula outlined in figure 4 summarizes ICE\u2019s adult bed rate  methodology, ICE\u2019s guidance notes that situations may occur in which it  is advisable to adjust national bed rate projections to account for new  trends or other changes. For example, in response to concerns from  Congress about ICE\u2019s application of indirect costs, and the opportunity to  revise the fiscal year 2017 bed rate, ICE officials told us they changed  some of the methodology for the projected 2017 and 2018 bed rates.", "Although ICE\u2019s bed rate model is based on historical costs, from fiscal  year 2014 through fiscal year 2017 ICE\u2019s adult bed rate projections  underestimated the actual bed rate.

For illustrative purposes, underestimating the bed rate by $5 per day,  assuming an ADP of 34,000, yields a more than $62 million  underestimation in the detention budget request.", "The bed rate model assumes that operations in the immigration detention  system will continue without drastic changes and that past trends will  continue since it bases its projections on historical costs. According to  ICE officials, the bed rate model cannot anticipate a need to increase the  capacity of the entire system, or anticipate a policy decision to close or  continue operation of a facility. Either of these situations may cause the  bed rate to change.", "Although certain situations may lead to unanticipated changes in the bed  rate, we identified a number of factors in ICE\u2019s current bed rate model  that have led to inaccuracies, including using incorrect inflation factors  and mixing costs for family and adult facilities.", "ICE calculates the projected bed rate by using its own inflation rate based  on the escalation of detention costs instead of a standard inflation rate  provided by OMB or DHS, but did not provide documentation of its  rationale. As described previously, ICE\u2019s inflation factor is based on an  average of the year-over-year changes in costs since fiscal year 2009.  OMB guidance states that it will provide agencies with economic  assumptions to be used for budget requests, including inflation rates, and  that agencies can consider price changes, such as bed/guard costs, as a  factor in developing estimates. ICE officials told us that historical costs  more accurately reflect potential increases, but did not provide us with  documentation to support that rationale. According to ICE officials, by  accepting the inflation factor used in ICE\u2019s budget request, OMB has  given tacit, if not direct, approval for its usage.", "Based on our review of ICE\u2019s adult bed rate projections, historical costs  may not be the best method for predicting future costs and assumes that  past trends will continue, including negative inflation rates. Because the  bed rate model accounts for changes on a per person basis, negative  inflation factors could be due to decreasing costs or an increasing  detainee population, both of which may change in the following year. For  example, ICE\u2019s fiscal year 2018 bed rate model incorporates a negative  inflation factor for health care costs even though in its budget justification  ICE attributes part of the bed rate increase over the prior year to rising  health care costs. Relying on historical costs may lead to inaccuracies if a  deflationary trend does not continue as the model assumes.", "In our examination of the bed rate model, we also found that ICE did not  calculate the percentage change correctly. Year-over-year percentage  change compares the difference in costs in percentage terms and can be  calculated by dividing the difference in costs by the starting costs. Instead  of following this formula, ICE\u2019s bed rate model calculated the actual  monetary difference between the two years and represented it as a  percentage change. For example, from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year  2010, the bed/guard rate increased from $77.50 to $81.59. Whereas the  percentage change in the rate is 5.28 percent, ICE calculated the  percentage change by subtracting one rate from the other ($4.09) and  adding a percent sign (4.09%), thereby treating the dollar difference as a  percentage change. (See table 1.)", "ICE officials stated that they decided to use the actual monetary  difference as a way to account for inflation for the fiscal year 2018 adult  bed rate. However, using the actual monetary difference in costs does not  provide a percentage of change. It misrepresents a difference in price as  a percentage. Further, we found that because ICE did not appropriately  calculate the percentage change for each year, the average of year-over- year changes, which ICE uses as its inflation factor, is not correct. For  example, ICE\u2019s inflation factor for the bed/guard rate is 2.74 percent,  while the appropriate calculation is 3.28 percent. (See table 1.) (See  Appendix I for more information and calculations.)", "In addition, when calculating the fiscal year 2018 projected bed rate,  rather than following formulas contained in the bed rate model, ICE  manually entered a different inflation factor for two cost categories\u2014other  direct costs and service-wide costs\u2014instead of relying on the historical  data. ICE added together the inflation factors indicated by the model for  other direct costs and service-wide costs and then applied the combined  inflation factor to both categories. By combining and manually entering  the factors, ICE mistakenly introduced an additional error. Officials did  not provide an explanation or documentation of why they manually  entered these numbers or combined the two inflation factors except to  state that it stemmed from the Congressional request to separate the  costs.", "ICE\u2019s adult bed rate model includes information for family facilities, even  though family facilities are budgeted separately and in a different manner  from adult facilities. For its adult facilities, ICE contracts with the individual  facilities to provide beds and the cost is dependent on the number of  adults detained. ICE\u2019s family detention facilities, however, are operated  by local governments or private companies and are funded through fixed  price contracts that are not dependent on the number of people detained.  (See sidebar for more information.)", "While ICE budgeted $291.4 million for its family facilities in fiscal year  2018, our analysis showed that ICE also included the population in its  family facilities in the calculations of the adult bed rate. For example, in  fiscal year 2018, ICE divided the obligations and expenditures for health  care, other direct costs, and service-wide costs across the entire detainee  population of adults and families, resulting in an adult bed rate that was  lower than if the costs were divided by the adult population alone. Using  this underestimated bed rate has resulted in a lower cost estimate than  what ICE may need to sustain its adult population.", "Additionally, ICE double-counted some costs by budgeting for family  facilities in both the adult bed rate and the total cost for family facilities.  Specifically, we found that ICE included \u201cother direct costs\u201d associated  with its family facilities when calculating its adult bed rate. Given that ICE  already budgeted for these family facilities\u2019 costs as a line item within its  budget for family facilities, calculating the adult bed rate in this way  double-counts the costs for family facilities in the budget.

Additionally,  while the appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 included a proviso that  ICE\u2019s funding support at least 34,000 detention beds during the fiscal  year, ICE included a lower number of detention beds (30,539) in its 2015  budget request.", "According to ICE officials, the ADP figures used in its budget requests are  initially projected by ERO, but may be changed by ICE leadership, DHS  leadership, or OMB. Officials said the final ADP figure is based on policy  decisions that account for factors that could affect the detainee  population\u2014for example, delays in immigration courts or the number of  asylum officers on staff. According to officials, ICE prepares the budget  request two years in advance of the year of execution with the best  knowledge they have available at that time, including ADP projections.  Officials stated that ADP is difficult to estimate given the unpredictable  nature of events such as natural disasters, gang activity, or political  upheaval in another part of the world, which may lead to an unanticipated  increase in migration. Additionally, officials told us that various policy  developments across the administration, DHS, or other agencies may  affect immigration trends or enforcement. ICE officials also stated that  because immigration detention facilities may receive detainees from other  parts of the immigration system, ADP can be affected by actions taken by  other actors involved in immigration enforcement, such as the Executive  Office for Immigration Review, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Such events could include, for  example, delays in immigration court cases or an increase in the number  of asylum cases, which could increase ADP.", "When asked to provide documentation for the fiscal year 2018 ADP  projection of 51,379, ICE provided us a document containing tables and  justification that explained the factors that impact ADP, but did not provide  us the calculations or methodology used to arrive at the projected ADP.  While the ADP used in its budget requests may be developed based on  policy decisions, documenting the calculations and rationale by which the  figure was developed would help to demonstrate how the number was  determined and that it was based on sound decisions.", "Although ICE officials stated that ADP is difficult to forecast, the agency  has developed a statistical model that may help predict the ADP. ERO\u2019s  Law Enforcement Systems and  Analysis (LESA) Office has developed a  statistical model that uses population data directly pulled from ICE\u2019s  Enforcement Information Database to forecast the ADP in upcoming  years. (See sidebar for more information.) ERO began using the model  in 2014, and according to officials, ICE currently uses it to estimate how  much funding the agency will need for detention costs for the remainder  of the fiscal year. The model describes historical trends, seasonal  fluctuations, and random movement in the ADP, and then uses these  historical patterns to make forecasts. Based on our evaluation, we found  that this type of model was a reasonable method to forecast ADP, and  that LESA\u2019s particular modeling choices were generally consistent with  accepted statistical practices and appropriate for the data and application.", "Using LESA\u2019s model, ICE can produce a range of ADP forecasts under  different scenarios, as well as confidence intervals for any particular  forecast. Confidence intervals indicate the level of certainty around the  model\u2019s forecast, depending on how wide the range is for the ADP  forecast. Confidence in the model\u2019s forecasts decreases when the ADP  range is smaller and when forecasting for later time periods. Because the  model relies on historical data in making ADP forecasts, LESA is able to  incorporate separate analysis of external or unexpected events to help  inform the effects of similar events on ADP in the future. For example,  according to ICE officials, LESA can conduct ad hoc analysis outside of  the model of how potential policy decisions, such as a change in the  number of field officers, may affect future ADP, if a similar event occurred  in the past. Although new policies, processes, or political or economic  events may cause the dynamics of ICE\u2019s detainee population to change  in ways that historical data would not predict, incorporating this type of  model into ICE\u2019s process to project ADP could potentially help provide  useful and accurate forecasts in instances where ICE does have relevant  historical data. ICE officials stated that ICE has used the LESA model in  the past to inform the budget during the year of execution, but has only  recently used it to provide confidence intervals for the ADP inputs into the  budget projections when revising the projected fiscal year 2017 bed rate.", "According to GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, having a  realistic estimate of projected costs facilitates effective resource  allocation. In addition, federal standards for internal control state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives, and  as part of those control activities, management should clearly document  significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily  available for examination. Without documenting the methodology or  rationale behind the ADP numbers ICE uses to develop its budget  request for immigration detention, Congress and other stakeholders do  not have clear visibility into the number upon which ICE is basing its  budget request. Additionally, by considering how or whether the LESA  model could be incorporated into ICE\u2019s process for projecting ADP, ICE  could leverage an existing model and identify potential improvements in  the accuracy of its ADP projections based on historical data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ICE Does Not Fully Meet GAO Best Practices For Estimating Detention Costs", "paragraphs": ["ICE\u2019s cost estimate for immigration detention resources does not fully  meet best practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide. As described earlier, the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate  are comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. As noted in  table 2, ICE\u2019s cost estimate for fiscal year 2018 substantially met the  comprehensive characteristic, partially met the well documented and  accurate characteristics, and minimally met the credible characteristic. By  not sufficiently meeting the best practices in all of the characteristics, the  cost estimate for the immigration detention cannot be considered reliable.", "Based on our analysis, ICE substantially met the comprehensive  characteristic by including all costs, but has double-counted certain costs,  as described earlier, and has not clearly documented all ground rules and  assumptions. Based on our analysis, ICE\u2019s cost estimate appears to  include all government and contractor labor costs as well as material,  equipment, facilities, and services to fund immigration detention,  accounting for both the salary and expenses categories of the budget.  ICE also adheres to DHS\u2019s Common Appropriations Structure, and  follows the OMB Object Class structure for planning and tracking costs at  a more granular level. Officials stated that they use past execution  reports, historical data, and spend plans to help inform the necessary  distribution of funding for immigration detention by project and object  code.", "While ICE accounted for all costs, ICE did not directly address how the  agency prevents omissions or double-counting in its cost estimate, and  double-counted costs by including other direct costs for family facilities  when estimating the cost to house adult detainees. Additionally, ICE did  not identify ground rules and assumptions influencing the estimate.  Officials said that several documents list ground rules and assumptions;  however, the ground rules cited are very broad or have not been followed.  For example, ICE guidance states that ICE shall fund sufficient detention  beds to support current enforcement and removal priorities and  mandatory detention requirements, but it does not provide a basis for  determining a sufficient number of detention beds. Another important  factor in determining the bed/guard rate for adult beds is tier utilization.  Tier utilization refers to the use of bed space in detention centers. For  example, at a given detention center, ICE may pay a lower rate if it  houses more detainees. When determining the bed rate based on tier  utilization, ICE did not provide documentation of the ground rules or  assumptions behind the tier utilization percentage used to calculate the  fiscal year 2018 bed rate. Finally, as noted earlier in this report, ICE has  not documented its rationale for not following DHS or OMB guidance for  applying inflation rates to the estimate.", "According to GAO\u2019s guide, given that cost estimates are based on limited  information, defining ground rules and assumptions is important because  they help identify the risks associated with these assumptions, including  how changes in the assumptions could influence cost. Without clear  documentation and rationale behind ground rules and assumptions, the  estimate will not be able to be reconstructed when the budget staff and  information used to develop the estimate are no longer available.", "Based on our analysis, ICE partially met the well documented  characteristic by showing that its cost estimate had been reviewed by  management and providing documentation that described its  methodology in general. However, ICE did not show the formulas used to  develop the cost estimate in sufficient detail to enable an outside party to  fully follow its calculations or to re-create the fiscal year 2018 bed rate.  Although the agency provided the bed rate model and showed what  numbers were used as inputs into the model to project the fiscal year  2018 bed rate, it did not provide documentation that described the  formulas used to calculate the projected bed rate. During our review of  the bed rate model, we had to reconstruct the calculations step-by-step to  identify the formulas and variables used to create the fiscal year 2018 bed  rate.", "Additionally, ICE officials provided conflicting explanations regarding how  they applied inflation to develop the projected fiscal year 2018 adult bed  rate. In one instance, ICE officials said that they applied a 2.66 percent  inflation factor to develop the fiscal year 2017 adult bed rate and then  calculated and applied a cost adjustment to add more than 8,800 new  beds, to produce the fiscal year 2018 bed rate. In another instance, ICE  officials stated that the inflation factor was adjusted to 3.73 percent  overall to develop the fiscal year 2017 bed rate and then they applied the  cost adjustment to develop the fiscal year 2018 projected bed rate. These  two explanations also differ from how the bed rate model applies inflation  as described earlier in this report. ICE also did not document how the cost  adjustment was calculated or the actual costs that the adjustment is  based upon.", "When asked about documentation, ICE officials stated that the budget  justification was not the appropriate document to cite detailed  methodologies, but did not provide any additional supporting  documentation. Documentation is essential for validating a cost estimate,  including demonstrating that it is a reliable estimate of future costs.  Consistent with GAO\u2019s guide, without a well documented cost estimate,  ICE is not positioned to present the estimate\u2019s validity or answer  questions about its basis. According to GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, estimates that lack sufficient documentation are not  useful for updates or information sharing and can hinder understanding  and proper use.", "Based on our analysis, ICE partially met the accurate characteristic by  basing the cost estimate on historical cost data and tracking the  differences between the projected and actual bed rate and ADP. ICE  officials stated that they utilized historical cost data for bed/guard contract  costs, health care costs, overhead expenses, detainee wages and  supplies, and detainee headcount and capacity utilization, among other  categories to estimate detention costs. However, ICE did not provide  evidence that it analyzes the reasons behind the variances between the  cost estimate and actual numbers for each year, and as mentioned  previously, we identified issues with the inflation rates used to project the  bed rate and the inclusion of family facilities in the adult bed rate.", "While ICE tracks differences between the projected bed rate used in the  cost estimate and the actual numbers for each fiscal year, officials did not  provide evidence that they analyze the reasons for these variances nor  that they use this information to reassess its assumptions or models and  improve them. ICE officials said that variances between the projected and  actual bed rates are documented in a quarterly report that is publicly  available. While these reports track the bed rate in the execution year,  they do not demonstrate that ICE tracks explanations for variances  between that bed rate and the original cost estimate figures presented in  the budget request. ICE provided a document that showed the bed rate  projection and the year-end result for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 and  quarter-end results for fiscal year 2017, but the document did not explain  most of the changes from the projected and actual numbers. ICE officials  also said that they conduct ad hoc analyses to identify and communicate  sources of variance, but did not provide any related documentation.", "Without a comparison and analysis of the reasons behind the differences  between the actual figures and the original estimates, ICE is not  positioned to assess the quality of its projections and use that information  to improve cost estimates. Tracking the forecast rate against the actual  rate and tracking budget justification assumptions against actual  conditions could offer insight into the quality of the forecasts, according to  GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide.", "Based on our analysis, ICE minimally met the credible characteristic, and  in particular did not conduct sensitivity or risk and uncertainty analyses to  capture the cumulative effects if variables change. ICE also did not  conduct any cross checks on the major cost elements using alternate  methods to estimate cost. A sensitivity analysis reveals how a change in  a single assumption, or variable, affects the cost estimate. A risk and  uncertainty analysis would provide ICE a clear level of confidence about  the estimate. ICE did not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis for either  the fiscal year 2018 cost estimate or the fiscal year 2018 bed rate model.  Additionally, ICE\u2019s description of the LESA model to project ADP  discussed forecast confidence levels, but ICE did not quantify the  uncertainty around the ADP projection of 51,379 detainees used in the  fiscal year 2018 budget justification. ICE also did not discuss the range of  potential costs due to uncertainty in the ADP and bed rate projections.  Having a range of costs around a point estimate is useful to decision  makers because it conveys the level of confidence in achieving the most  likely cost.", "Additionally, ICE did not provide any documentation showing that major  cost elements were cross checked using a different method for  calculating the cost estimate to see if results were similar. According to  GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide, one way to reinforce the credibility of the  cost estimate is to determine whether applying a different method  produces similar results. If so, then confidence in the estimate increases,  leading to greater credibility. ICE officials stated that internal and external  auditors vetted the bed rate model and determined it to be credible, but  this does not constitute an estimate cross check and using an alternate  cost estimating method to cross check its estimate would provide greater  assurance of its credibility. As noted previously, we found ICE\u2019s bed rate  model underestimated the actual bed rates over several years.", "Unless all characteristics are met or substantially met, the cost estimate  cannot be considered reliable. Additionally, a poor cost estimate can  negatively affect a program by eventually requiring a transfer or  reprogramming of funds. In recent years, ICE has consistently transferred  and reprogrammed millions of dollars of funds to account for budgeting  too little or too much for immigration detention costs.
