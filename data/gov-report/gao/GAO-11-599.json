Questions have been raised as to whether the federal National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), which is based on voluntary state reports to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), fully captures the number or circumstances of child fatalities from maltreatment. GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which HHS collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment, (2) the challenges states face in collecting and reporting this information to HHS, and (3) the assistance HHS provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child maltreatment fatalities. GAO analyzed 2009 NCANDS data--the latest data available--conducted a nationwide Web-based survey of state child welfare administrators, visited three states, interviewed HHS and other officials, and reviewed research and relevant federal laws and regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["More children have likely died from maltreatment than are counted in NCANDS, and HHS does not take full advantage of available information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment deaths. NCANDS estimated that 1,770 children in the United States died from maltreatment in fiscal year 2009. According to GAO's survey, nearly half of states included data only from child welfare agencies in reporting child maltreatment fatalities to NCANDS, yet not all children who die from maltreatment have had contact with these agencies, possibly leading to incomplete counts. HHS also collects but does not report some information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment fatalities that could be useful for prevention, such as perpetrators' previous maltreatment of children. The National Center for Child Death Review (NCCDR), a nongovernmental organization funded by HHS, collects more detailed data on circumstances from 39 states, but these data on child maltreatment deaths have not yet been synthesized or published. States face numerous challenges in collecting child maltreatment fatality data and reporting to NCANDS. At the local level, lack of evidence and inconsistent interpretations of maltreatment challenge investigators--such as law enforcement, medical examiners, and child welfare officials--in determining whether a child's death was caused by maltreatment. Without medical evidence, it can be difficult to determine that a child's death was caused by abuse or neglect, such as in cases of shaken baby syndrome, when external injuries may not be readily visible. At the state level, limited coordination among jurisdictions and state agencies, in part due to confidentiality or privacy constraints, poses challenges for reporting data to NCANDS. HHS provides assistance to help states report child maltreatment fatalities, although states would like additional help. For example, HHS hosts an annual NCANDS technical assistance conference, provides individual state assistance, and, through NCCDR, has developed resources to help states collect information on child deaths. However, there has been limited collaboration between HHS and NCCDR on child maltreatment fatality information or prevention strategies to date. State officials indicated a need for additional information on how to coordinate across state agencies to collect more complete information on child maltreatment fatalities. States are also increasingly interested in collecting and using information on near fatalities from maltreatment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of HHS take steps to further strengthen data quality, expand available information on child fatalities, improve information sharing, and estimate the costs and benefits of collecting national data on near fatalities.

Infants  and toddlers are the most vulnerable to such abuse and neglect.  According to estimates by the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data  System (NCANDS), 1,770 children in the United States died from physical  abuse or other forms of maltreatment in fiscal year 2009. Some experts  believe that more children have died from maltreatment than are captured  in these estimates. Additionally, experts expressed concern that national  data on these deaths may be problematic for understanding the issue  because of inconsistencies and limitations in the data collected and  reported to NCANDS by states. In addition, many more children are  severely harmed and may nearly die from maltreatment, but NCANDS  does not collect data specifically on near fatalities. Collecting complete  and consistent information is important for understanding the magnitude  of the problem and for targeting efforts to help prevent future child deaths  and near deaths from maltreatment.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the principal  federal agency that provides oversight of state child welfare systems,  which are intended, in part, to protect children who have been maltreated  and help prevent maltreatment. To better understand the scope of child  maltreatment, including child fatalities, and inform efforts to address and  prevent it, the 1988 amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act (CAPTA) required HHS to establish a national data  collection and analysis program for child maltreatment data. HHS  responded to this mandate by establishing and maintaining NCANDS,  which is a voluntary data-reporting system. Since at least 2000, states  have increasingly provided data on children who were maltreated to HHS  for NCANDS. From these data, HHS publishes a yearly Child  Maltreatment report. The most recent report, for fiscal year 2009,  presents national data about child abuse and neglect known to child  welfare agencies in the United States. As of fiscal year 2009, all states  reported at least some data on child maltreatment to NCANDS.", "To obtain more information about the quality of national data on child  fatalities and near fatalities from maltreatment, the Chairman, House  Ways and Means Committee, asked us to examine (1) the extent to which  HHS collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities  from maltreatment, (2) the challenges states face in collecting and  reporting information on child fatalities from maltreatment to HHS, and (3)  the assistance HHS provides to states in collecting and reporting data on  child fatalities from maltreatment.", "We used multiple methodologies to address these three objectives. For  the first objective, we reviewed published research on the number of child  fatalities and systematically assessed the adequacy of each study\u2019s  research methodology. We analyzed fiscal year 2009 NCANDS data  provided to HHS by states and additional data on child maltreatment  fatalities collected from states by a nongovernmental organization funded  by HHS, the National Center for Child Death Review. We confirmed the  reliability of these data for our purposes. We also interviewed HHS  officials responsible for NCANDS child maltreatment data, child welfare  practitioners, and other experts. We conducted a nationwide Web-based  survey of state child welfare administrators in 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and Puerto Rico between October and December 2010. We  received survey responses from all states, although not all states  responded to every question. To address the second objective, we  conducted site visits to California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to obtain a  more in-depth understanding of states\u2019 child fatality data issues in  addition to drawing upon the state survey. To address the third objective,  we interviewed HHS NCANDS officials and other experts, analyzed  survey results on states\u2019 perspectives on additional NCANDS assistance  needed from HHS, and reviewed HHS technical assistance and other  documents relevant to child maltreatment fatalities and near fatalities. We  also reviewed CAPTA and implementing regulations and federal guidance  on collecting and reporting maltreatment data, as well as other related  laws, including pertinent state laws.

Major causes  of death among children include conditions originating in the perinatal  period, accidents (such as motor vehicle traffic accidents and drowning),  congenital anomalies, homicide, and cancer. Of all children who died in  fiscal year 2009, NCANDS estimates that 1,770 children died from  various types of maltreatment. (See fig. 1.) Moreover, 81 percent of  children who died from maltreatment were 3 years old or younger, and  more than half were infants 1 year or younger.", "According to NCANDS, the estimated number of child maltreatment  fatalities has increased nationally over the past 5 years, from 1,450 in  fiscal year 2005 to 1,770 in fiscal year 2009. HHS reported that states  believe this increase may be due, in part, to new state legislation, new  procedures, and improved state reporting practices.", "Protecting children from maltreatment is primarily the responsibility of  child welfare programs administered at the state and local levels. In all  states, child protective services (CPS) are part of the child welfare  system. CPS generally screens and responds to suspected child  maltreatment reported to it by mandatory reporters\u2014including police  officers, doctors, teachers, and other professionals\u2014as well as by  neighbors and family members. In fiscal year 2009, professionals initiated  58 percent of all reports of suspected maltreatment to CPS. CPS  investigators determine whether such reports are considered  maltreatment under state laws or policies. CPS also typically determines  whether interventions\u2014such as placement with a foster family\u2014are in the  best interest of the child. When CPS determines that a child\u2019s death is  from maltreatment, CPS documents the case. The state\u2019s child welfare  department reports it to NCANDS. (See fig. 2.)", "At the federal level, most of the $8.4 billion in federal assistance  dedicated to child welfare purposes ($7.2 billion) in fiscal year 2010  supports state child welfare programs, including foster care, adoption  assistance, and child protection. HHS oversees funding provided to states  that support child welfare programs, and provides technical assistance  and training to states on a variety of child welfare issues. HHS has a  technical assistance contract specific to NCANDS and also provides  technical assistance on NCANDS and other data issues through its  National Resource Centers (NRC).", "CAPTA is the key federal legislation focused on preventing and  responding to child maltreatment. Reauthorized in 2010, CAPTA provides  supports for, among other things, data collection activities and technical  assistance on child maltreatment. It also authorizes federal funding to  states for grants to support prevention, investigation, and treatment of  child maltreatment. In fiscal year 2010, funding for CAPTA programs  totaled about $97 million, of which $26.5 million was for basic state grants  to improve CPS. These grants are distributed to states by formula, and  may be used to improve CPS investigations, caseworker training, and  prevention programs. All states in fiscal year 2010 received CAPTA basic  state grants. To receive this grant, states are required to have an  approved state plan that outlines the activities that the state intends to  implement. It must include, for example, provisions or procedures for  receiving and responding to allegations of child abuse or neglect and for  ensuring children\u2019s safety. For grant purposes, child abuse and neglect is  defined as \u201cat a minimum, any recent act or failure to act on the part of a  parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional  harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which  presents an imminent risk of serious harm.\u201d", "Each state receiving a basic grant is also required to establish and  support citizen review panels to evaluate the effectiveness of CPS  policies, procedures, and practices, and, according to the National Center  for Child Death Review, 14 states in 2003 reported that their child death  review teams serve a dual function as CAPTA citizen review panels for  child fatalities. The citizen review panels must be composed of volunteers  who are \u201cbroadly representative\u201d of the community, including members  with expertise in the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect,  and may include members of foster care review boards or child death  review teams.

According to  our survey, child welfare officials in 28 states thought that the official  number of child maltreatment fatalities in their state was probably or  possibly an undercount. Child welfare experts and HHS officials we spoke  with also thought that national estimates did not reflect the full extent of  children\u2019s deaths from maltreatment and that undercounting was an issue  with child fatalities. Acknowledging the limitations of NCANDS data on  child maltreatment fatalities, HHS\u2019s Child Maltreatment 2009 report states  that NCANDS fatality data are only a proportion of all child fatalities  caused by maltreatment. These data are based on reports provided to  NCANDS by CPS agencies within state child welfare departments.", "A major reason for the likely undercounting of child maltreatment fatalities  is that nearly half of states report to NCANDS data only on children  already known to CPS agencies\u2014yet not all children who die from  maltreatment were previously brought to the attention of CPS. Some  children may not have been previously maltreated, or their earlier  maltreatment may not have been noticed or reported to CPS agencies.  Child deaths from maltreatment are recorded in many state and local data  sources, such as death certificates from state vital statistics offices and  medical examiner or coroner\u2019s offices, CPS records, and state and local  child death review team records (see fig. 3), and in Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reports at the federal level.", "Because of this, HHS also attempts to capture the fatalities of maltreated  children who were not previously known to state CPS agencies.  Specifically, HHS instructs states on how to report data from non-CPS  agencies and encourages states to obtain information on child  maltreatment fatalities from other state agencies. However, in  responding to our survey, 24 states reported that their 2009 NCANDS  data did not include child fatality information from any non-CPS sources.  More specifically, for example, 43 states responded that their NCANDS  data did not include child fatality data from the vital statistics department.  (See fig. 4.) Since NCANDS is a voluntary data-reporting system, state  CPS agencies cannot be required to obtain information from other state  agencies, according to HHS officials.", "Synthesizing information about child fatalities from multiple sources can  produce a more comprehensive picture of the extent of child deaths than  sole reliance on CPS data. In our review of research assessing whether  the number of child fatalities from maltreatment was accurate, we found  that key sources of information undercounted child deaths, sometimes by  significant amounts. For example, a peer-reviewed study of fatal child  maltreatment in three states found that state child welfare records  undercount child fatalities from maltreatment by from 55 percent to 76  percent. The data sources analyzed in this study were death certificates,  state child welfare agency records, state child death review team data,  and law enforcement reports to the FBI Uniform Crime Report system.  The study found that each data source reviewed undercounted the total  number of child maltreatment fatalities. However, more than 90 percent of  the child fatality cases could be identified by linking any two of the data  sources, demonstrating the value of using multiple existing data sources  to determine the extent of child fatalities from maltreatment. The study  also found that the multidisciplinary child death review team process may  be the most promising approach to identifying deaths from maltreatment if  there is a standardized data collection and reporting system in place.", "Using a different methodology, HHS\u2019s most recent National Incidence  Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS-4)\u2014issued in January 2010\u2014 estimated 2,400 child deaths from maltreatment in the study year  spanning portions of 2005 and 2006. The NIS is a congressionally  mandated, periodic effort of HHS to estimate the incidence of child abuse  and neglect in the United States. Unlike NCANDS, which relies primarily  on CPS data reported by states, the NIS-4 relies on multiple sources of  child death information. The NIS-4 used a nationally representative  sample of 122 counties to create national estimates of the incidence,  severity, and demographic distribution of child maltreatment, including  fatalities from maltreatment. The NIS-4 uses two standardized research  definitions of maltreatment in developing its findings. In each county,  NIS-4 collected CPS data as well as reports of child maltreatment cases  that came to the attention of community professionals in the county  sheriff\u2019s office; the county departments of juvenile probation, health, and  public housing; municipal police departments; hospitals; public schools;  day care centers; shelters; and voluntary social services and mental  health agencies.", "Furthermore, several factors complicate the ability to obtain  comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment. As a  result, it can be difficult to compare child fatality data across states or  over time.", "Inconsistent definitions of maltreatment: Although CAPTA  legislation establishes a minimum standard for the definition of child  abuse and neglect, states generally develop their own variations of  these definitions. Consequently, child maltreatment data at the  national level can reflect an underlying inconsistency across individual  states. For example, some states add medical neglect to the CAPTA  definition and define the concept differently. (See table 1.)", "Some experts we interviewed said that definitions need to be  standardized nationally to improve the quality of NCANDS data.  When states submit data to NCANDS, HHS requires them to align  state definitions of child maltreatment with elements of the NCANDS  definitions, using a data-mapping process. HHS officials told us this  mapping process helps create more consistent data within NCANDS.  However, the mapping process may not fully address underlying state  differences in determining whether a child\u2019s death was regarded as a  maltreatment death. HHS officials told us they considered definitional  variations less important as a factor affecting NCANDS data quality  than the difficulty in obtaining agreement among various local and  state investigators\u2014such as law enforcement and medical  personnel\u2014that maltreatment was the cause of a child\u2019s death.  \uf0b7  Differing legal standards for substantiating maltreatment:  Because states have different legal standards for substantiating  maltreatment, it is difficult to compare data across states. The  substantiation process generally requires child welfare caseworkers to  decide whether an allegation of maltreatment, or the risk of  maltreatment, meets the criteria established by state law or policy. In  a Congressional Research Service (CRS) analysis, state standards  for substantiating child maltreatment were categorized into three  groups, ranging from least to most rigorous. CRS found that states  with stricter standards for substantiating maltreatment have the lowest  rates of child maltreatment. (See table 2.) \uf0b7  Missing data: Some states do not report any information on child  fatalities in certain years (e.g., Alaska, Massachusetts, and North  Carolina for fiscal year 2009). Additionally, some states do not report  particular data elements. For example, in fiscal year 2009, 13 states  did not report information on children who died who, within the past 5  years, had been in foster care and had been reunited with their  families; 7 states did not report the relationship of the perpetrator to  the child who died; and 6 states did not report the race or ethnicity of  the child who died. In responding to our survey, states provided a  range of explanations for missing data in their NCANDS submissions.  For example, according to state child welfare officials, key reasons for  their not reporting some data were that other state entities, not child  welfare, collected the information; state data systems did not collect  those data; and delays occurred in data collection that affected  reporting. \uf0b7  Lack of death date: NCANDS does not ask states to identify the date  of a child\u2019s death, and establishing maltreatment as the cause of a  child\u2019s death can take many months, particularly when a criminal  proceeding is involved. As a result, child deaths reported to NCANDS  may have, in fact, occurred earlier than the year in which they are  reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Collects but Does Not Report Some Useful Information on the Circumstances Surrounding Child Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["NCANDS collects more data on the circumstances surrounding child  fatalities than are reflected in HHS\u2019s annual Child Maltreatment report\u2014 information that could be useful for prevention. NCANDS collects  information from state CPS agencies about the demographics of children  who died, such as their age and race; the report of maltreatment and the  CPS agencies\u2019 response and investigation; the perpetrator; services  provided to the family; and risk factors associated with the child and with  the caretaker. It also collects information on broad categories of  maltreatment\u2014such as neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse,  psychological maltreatment, and medical neglect\u2014although it does not  collect more detailed information on how a child dies, such as from a  bathtub incident or swimming pool drowning resulting from a parent\u2019s  neglect. However, HHS does not report some information it collects on  the circumstances surrounding child fatalities. For example, when we  analyzed unpublished fiscal year 2009 state data reported to NCANDS on  children\u2019s deaths from maltreatment, we found the following:  \uf0b7  Types of abuse: Rates of physical abuse were slightly higher among  older children who died from maltreatment (ages 8 to 18), while  neglect rates were slightly higher among younger children who died  from maltreatment (ages 7 and younger). \uf0b7  Child welfare history: At least 14 percent of children who died from  maltreatment had a previous substantiated or indicated incident of  child maltreatment. \uf0b7  Sixteen percent of perpetrators of fatal child maltreatment were  previously involved in an incident of child maltreatment that was  either substantiated or indicated by CPS. \uf0b7  Among parents who were perpetrators, about 60 percent were  female. Of unmarried partners who were perpetrators, 90 percent  were male. \uf0b7  Child\u2019s risk factors: Two percent of maltreated children who died  had a disability such as a developmental disability, an intellectual  disability, or a visual or hearing impairment.", "According to experts, detailed information on the circumstances  surrounding child fatalities can provide a more comprehensive  understanding of the issue of fatal child maltreatment, such as revealing  patterns that could aid prevention efforts.", "In addition to what is known nationally through NCANDS data, extensive  information on the circumstances surrounding children\u2019s deaths from  maltreatment is collected by the Child Death Review Case Reporting  System (CDR Reporting System), operated by the nongovernmental  National Center for Child Death Review (NCCDR). NCCDR serves as a  resource center for state and local multidisciplinary teams that review  cases of child deaths for the purpose of improving case identification,  investigations, services, follow-up, and prevention. Nearly all states  have child death review teams comprising CPS workers, prosecutors, law  enforcement, coroners or medical examiners, public heath care providers,  and others. While data received from NCCDR are more detailed in each  case, the data are less comprehensive than those reported to NCANDS,  according to HHS. Local review teams do not review all cases of possible  death due to maltreatment but rather vary in their roles and scope from  locality to locality. NCCDR is funded largely by the Maternal and Child  Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA).", "Begun in 2005, NCCDR\u2019s Web-based CDR Reporting System is  potentially a rich source of multistate data on child fatalities from all  causes, including child maltreatment. As of June 1, 2011, 39 states had  data use agreements with NCCDR, according to NCCDR officials.  NCCDR\u2019s goal is to eventually have all state child death review teams  provide information on child fatalities to the data system, according to  these officials. NCCDR takes a public health approach to child death  review, with a focus on improving investigations and identifying modifiable  risk factors and strategies for preventing similar future deaths. According  to NCCDR, most states using the system analyze their data and publish  annual reports. Although NCCDR conducts in-house analyses for federal  partner organizations, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, according to NCCDR officials, or of sudden cardiac  deaths for a hospital, CDR data on child maltreatment deaths have not  yet been synthesized or published, according to the NCCDR director.  (The sidebar describes the CDR data-reporting form.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Local Investigative Challenges and Limited Coordination Hinder States\u2019 Efforts to Collect Child Maltreatment Fatality Data and Report to NCANDS", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Investigative Difficulties Can Hamper Local Data Collection Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Challenges faced by local investigators, such as law enforcement  officials, medical examiners, and CPS staff, in determining whether a  child\u2019s death was caused by maltreatment make it difficult for states to  collect complete data on child maltreatment fatalities. These investigative  challenges include lack of definitive medical evidence, limited resources  for testing, differing expertise and training, and inconsistent  interpretations and application of maltreatment definitions.  \uf0b7  Lack of definitive medical evidence: Without definitive medical  evidence, it can be difficult to determine that a child\u2019s death was  caused by abuse or neglect. According to our survey, 43 states  indicated that medical issues were a challenge in determining child  maltreatment. (See fig. 5.) For example, investigators we spoke with  in California said that determining the cause of death in cases such as  sudden unexplained infant death is challenging because the child may  have been intentionally suffocated but external injuries are not readily  visible. Similarly, a medical examiner we interviewed in Michigan said  that it is a challenge to appropriately determine the cause of death for  babies who may have been shaken to death or suffocated.   According to experts we spoke with, a lack of evidence also makes it  difficult to determine whether a death was caused by neglect. Medical  neglect is a type of maltreatment caused by failure of the caregiver to  provide for the appropriate health care of the child despite having the  resources\u2014financial or otherwise\u2014to do so. Medical neglect often  results from inattentiveness to a chronic illness or missing follow-up  medical appointments, according to a physician from the American  Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect.  For example, one expert told us that a medically fragile premature  infant who is discharged from the hospital but not brought back in for  a follow-up examination and later dies could be considered to have  died from medical neglect. Experts from the American Bar  Association\u2019s (ABA) Center on Children and the Law said neglect  deaths are often categorized incorrectly, which may contribute to the  problem of undercounting deaths from neglect. County officials we  spoke with in Michigan added it is very difficult to determine medical  neglect as the cause of death because the death can appear to have  been from \u201cnatural\u201d causes. \uf0b7  Limited resources for testing: Another challenge in determining  whether maltreatment was the cause of death is resource constraints  that can limit the ability to conduct autopsies and medical tests.  According to experts we spoke with from AAP, an autopsy provides  much information on the factors contributing to a child\u2019s death\u2014such  as infection, trauma, or congenital heart disease\u2014that cannot be  determined based on visual inspection. These experts indicated that  financial constraints of local and state governments are the primary  reason autopsies are not conducted more regularly. In Pennsylvania,  a county coroner told us that even though autopsies can help clarify  the cause and circumstances of a death, coroners have to make  difficult choices in deciding when to order autopsies since they are  expensive and there is limited funding to cover them. According to a  2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences, insufficient funding  for testing influences cause-of-death determinations. A law  enforcement official we spoke with in Michigan noted that only 6 of his  20 requests for DNA testing were granted because of recent state  cutbacks affecting crime laboratories. In our survey, 36 states  identified limited resources as a challenge to identifying and  investigating maltreatment deaths. (See fig. 5.) \uf0b7  Differing expertise and training: Differing levels of investigator  expertise\u2014particularly among those charged with determining the  cause and manner of death\u2014also present challenges to states in  collecting child maltreatment fatality data. The National Academy of  Sciences notes that the skill and training of coroners and medical  examiners vary greatly. For example, in some counties, medical  examiners\u2014who are physicians and typically receive death  investigation training\u2014are charged with determining the cause and  manner of death, including identifying maltreatment, while other  counties rely on a coroner\u2014who may or may not be a physician or  have had any medical training\u2014to make these determinations. A  medical examiner and a coroner we spoke with in California noted  that because of differing expertise and training, forensic pathologists  and medical examiners might categorize sudden infant deaths  differently. In 1996, CDC developed a protocol for sudden infant  deaths in an effort to standardize reporting these deaths (see  sidebar). While training can enhance skills for conducting  maltreatment investigations, 35 states identified limited investigator  training as a challenge in our survey. (See fig. 5.) County officials in  the three states we visited also told us that a lack of funding  contributes to limited training opportunities. However, training  opportunities were available in the states we visited. For example,  state officials in California told us that all CPS staff are trained to  recognize and report child abuse. County officials also said coroners  in the state receive annual training that includes case presentations  by investigators and forensic pathologists, which often include child  deaths.", "Inconsistent interpretations and application of maltreatment  definitions. Differing interpretations and application of maltreatment  definitions by investigators can lead to inconsistent determinations of  cause of death. Law enforcement officials we spoke with in California  noted that law enforcement officials and coroners sometimes disagree  on the manner or cause of death, for example, when the death is  suspected to be from natural causes but there is some indication of  abuse or neglect. In our survey, 29 states indicated that the level of  agreement among responsible entities\u2014such as law enforcement  officials, medical examiners or coroners, and CPS\u2014about how to  interpret and apply state definitions of child abuse or neglect was a  challenge for collecting information on child maltreatment fatalities.  (See fig. 5.) These entities may use their own definitions and have  different goals. For example, county officials in Michigan told us that  law enforcement investigates for the purpose of determining probable  cause for prosecution, while CPS investigates to determine if there is  a preponderance of evidence for maltreatment. AAP experts stated  that certain injuries\u2014such as abusive head trauma\u2014are often  incorrectly categorized on child death certificates as natural or  accidental when the real cause of death is abuse-related. It is also  difficult to distinguish at autopsy between sudden infant death  syndrome (SIDS) and accidental or deliberate suffocation with a soft  object, according to the AAP.", "In our survey, 33 states indicated that variations across counties and  other jurisdictions in identifying cause of death pose a challenge for  collecting fatality information. For example, child death review team  officials in Pennsylvania noted significant variability across counties in  identifying child maltreatment deaths from head trauma. Similarly,  state officials in California noted that some counties interpret co- sleeping deaths as maltreatment, while other counties do not, which  creates inconsistencies in the numbers of child maltreatment deaths  at the state level. Officials we interviewed in Michigan told us that  when an external agency cross-checked its 2005 CPS data with  medical records for 186 cases, the analysis indicated that 37 child  deaths labeled as natural, accidental, or undetermined should have  been documented as maltreatment. This variability across counties  can result in greater data inconsistencies in states where the child  welfare agency is county-administered with state supervision, as  opposed to a state-administered system, according to national child  welfare advocates. While 11 states indicated in our survey that their  child welfare program was county- or locally administered, some of  these states have large child populations, including California, New  York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Coordination and Data Access Issues Pose Reporting Challenges", "paragraphs": ["State child welfare officials indicated experiencing challenges  coordinating among geographic jurisdictions within the state and across  state lines.

State officials we interviewed in  Michigan also indicated that counties face challenges obtaining medical  records and death certificates from jurisdictions in another state when  children are taken across state borders to the nearest trauma center in  the interest of providing immediate care.", "States also indicated that limited coordination with other state agencies\u2014 particularly obtaining records from the health department\u2014can challenge  their ability to report information on child maltreatment fatalities to  NCANDS. According to our survey, 32 states faced challenges  coordinating among state agencies. Twenty-four states indicated that  agencies involved in collecting information on child maltreatment fatalities  do not generally or easily share information, and 23 states cited  confidentiality or privacy issues related to child maltreatment as a  challenge. (See fig. 6.) For example, child welfare officials in California  told us their department had restricted data sharing with the department  of public health after a security breach, and had only recently renewed its  data-sharing agreement. Michigan officials specifically identified  confidentiality and privacy restrictions as a challenge to obtaining child  maltreatment fatality data because stakeholder agencies, such as the  health department, are sometimes unsure what, if any, information they  can share with child welfare. Furthermore, state officials in Pennsylvania  told us that state and county child welfare officials are concerned about  their limited access to records from drug and alcohol programs\u2014which  can include cases involving parents of a child who died\u2014held by another  state agency. California has coordinated across multiple agencies in an  effort to produce a more accurate estimate of child maltreatment fatalities  (see sidebar).", "States indicated that several issues related to their data systems\u2014 especially those affecting electronic capabilities\u2014have affected the  completeness of child maltreatment fatality data they report to NCANDS.  For example, although Pennsylvania collects certain CAPTA data  elements, the state is unable to aggregate and report to NCANDS some  of the information received from counties because this information is not  recorded electronically, according to state officials. The inability to link  different agencies\u2019 data systems with each other was also cited as a  reporting challenge by 28 states. (See fig. 7.) States also experienced  challenges reporting to NCANDS when they were either converting from  one data system to another or updating their current system. According to  our survey, 9 states were challenged by piloting or implementing a new  child welfare information system, and the Child Maltreatment 2009 report  shows that multiple states had incomplete or incomparable data because  of system conversions. For example, Michigan was unable to submit data  on child fatalities to NCANDS for fiscal year 2008, according to a state  official, because of data errors associated with conversion to a new data  system. In addition, 27 states responding to our survey reported that data  entry errors posed a challenge for reporting child maltreatment fatality  data to NCANDS. (See fig. 7.)", "To help mitigate these and other challenges, states are implementing  quality controls on the child maltreatment fatality data they submit to  NCANDS. According to our survey, 34 of the 50 states responding to this  question indicated that their child welfare department had a quality control  process\u2014aside from HHS\u2019s Enhanced Validation and Analysis  Application (EVAA), which assesses the quality of state data\u2014to improve  the accuracy of child maltreatment fatality data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Provides Assistance to States in Reporting on Child Maltreatment Fatalities, but States Would Like Additional Help", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HHS Provides Technical Assistance to States in Reporting Data on Child Maltreatment", "paragraphs": ["HHS provides assistance to states in several ways to help them report  information on child maltreatment to NCANDS.

There is also an NCANDS State Advisory  Group that worked closely with the technical team to design and  implement NCANDS and now continues to meet annually to review and  update NCANDS collection and reporting processes. According to HHS,  this 20-member group helps ensure that enhancements to NCANDS  accurately reflect states\u2019 experiences collecting data. The NCANDS  technical team also hosts the NCANDS Annual State Technical  Assistance Meeting, a key means of assistance to states in which HHS  officials provide NCANDS training and updates and states share  questions and information. In 2010, child welfare representatives from 38  states participated in this 3-day meeting, which included workshops on  data validation, error reporting, and methods for improving the quality of  data provided to NCANDS. In our survey, 36 state officials reported that  these annual NCANDS meetings were moderately helpful to very helpful.  The NCANDS technical team has also developed Web-based resources  with information and guidance to states on NCANDS data reporting,  available through the NCANDS Web portal.

NCCDR serves as a resource for state or local child death  review teams. NCCDR helps states share information by publishing their  child death review teams\u2019 contact information, data, and annual reports  on its Web site. In addition, NCCDR has developed a Web site designed  to help child death review teams expand their prevention efforts. It offers  best practices for preventing the leading causes of injury and death  among children, including child abuse. The site contains links to  resources, partners, and a number of injury prevention strategies  including public education; legislation and policy changes; and  modifications to products, physical environments, and social  environments that have been rated according to their evidence-based  effectiveness.", "Although NCCDR regularly collaborates with federal organizations to  analyze child fatality data and develop strategies to prevent child deaths,  there has been little routine information sharing between NCCDR and  NCANDS on child maltreatment fatalities. Federal organizations such as  CDC, the Department of Defense, and the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration have collaborated with NCCDR to analyze  information and expertise about child death reviews and develop  prevention strategies, according to NCCDR officials. For example, in  2003, CDC developed an initiative to improve data collected on sudden  unexplained infant deaths (SUID) and develop prevention strategies by  monitoring trends and identifying risk factors. CDC partnered with  NCCDR to develop the SUID Case Registry Pilot Study, which utilized an  updated version of NCCDR\u2019s Web-based data collection system. Officials  from NCCDR and the Children\u2019s Bureau, under HHS\u2019s Administration for  Children and Families (ACF), meet periodically in workgroups, and  officials from the Children\u2019s Bureau told us that they refer states with  questions about child death reviews to NCCDR for assistance. In 2010,  officials from NCCDR and the ACF Commissioner met to explore ways to  enhance federal responses to child abuse deaths, and the ACF  Commissioner told us that they are moving forward to fund a child fatality  review conference and begin an initiative to examine evidence-based  practices for preventing child abuse deaths.

For example, several states  mentioned that assistance with multidisciplinary coordination could help  them overcome difficulties such as obtaining death certificates from  medical examiners\u2019 or coroner\u2019s offices. HHS recognizes that collecting  maltreatment fatality data from multiple sources results in more complete  data, so the agency encourages states to coordinate with other  organizations, such as medical examiners and departments of health.  HHS officials stated that this is often a topic of discussion at the NCANDS  annual meeting. However, HHS officials also noted that the agency  cannot require states to use additional data sources, and states are not  required to disclose whether they consulted with additional sources to  collect data.", "Although the federal government does not currently collect data on  children who nearly die from maltreatment, states reported wanting  assistance to collect and use this information. CAPTA defines a near  fatality as \u201can act that, as certified by a physician, places the child in  serious or critical condition.\u201d HHS officials believe that such cases are  most likely reported generally under maltreatment, but are not specifically  identified as near fatalities because NCANDS does not have a data field  identifying the case as a near fatality. HHS officials said it would be  difficult to operationalize a national definition. To add a near-fatality data  element to NCANDS, HHS would need to coordinate with the State  Advisory Group and obtain approval from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB). However, the entire NCANDS data form will need to be  reapproved in 2012, and HHS officials stated that at that time all  NCANDS data elements will be reexamined. In commenting on a draft of  this report, HHS stated that it had initiated consultations with the states on  how to best address data collection on near fatalities of children and that  HHS is considering adding a field to identify these specific cases.", "States are increasingly interested in collecting and using information on  near fatalities, according to HHS officials, and some states have already  begun this effort. Collecting data on maltreatment near fatalities was a  topic of discussion at the 2010 NCANDS Annual State Technical  Assistance Meeting. Additionally, the NCANDS Listserv was recently  used by two state officials to survey other states about how they review  and define near-fatality cases of maltreatment. Currently, states\u2019 definition  of a near fatality varies (see fig. 8), and to establish a near-fatality data  element in NCANDS, states may need to reexamine their existing  definitions. According to our survey results, 32 states have a state law,  statute, or policy that defines a near fatality, and 19 states already collect  data on the number of child near fatalities from maltreatment. In addition,  some states obtain information on the circumstances of child  maltreatment near fatalities, such as the child\u2019s age and ethnicity, the  child\u2019s relationship to the perpetrator, and whether the child was receiving  foster care or family preservation services.", "States predominantly use child maltreatment fatality and near-fatality data  to develop strategies for preventing these occurrences, and state officials  told us they would like more assistance to use this information for  prevention. States reported in our survey that child maltreatment fatality  data are often used to inform prevention strategies, make state-level child  welfare policy changes, and allocate funding or other resources for  prevention activities. In addition, states reported using the information  they collect on child maltreatment near fatalities to inform or implement  strategies for preventing maltreatment fatalities and to allocate funding or  other resources for prevention activities.

At the state level,  obtaining comprehensive data on child maltreatment fatalities is very  challenging and requires information sharing among state and local  agencies\u2014each with its own policies, types and levels of expertise, and  concerns. Yet such cooperative efforts are a work in progress, and  assistance from HHS to help states collect and report more  comprehensive child fatality data is important. At the federal level, to the  extent that HHS collects but does not publish information on child  maltreatment fatalities, or does not routinely share information on child  fatality data analyses, opportunities may be lost to identify effective  means of preventing child maltreatment deaths in the future. Finally,  without national data on children\u2019s near fatalities from maltreatment, we  are unable to have a clear picture of the extent of near fatalities and the  risk factors associated with such maltreatment, making it difficult to  develop prevention strategies.

Expand, as appropriate, the type and amount of information HHS  makes public on the circumstances surrounding child fatalities from  maltreatment. 3.  Use stronger mechanisms to routinely share analyses and expertise  with its partners on the circumstances of child maltreatment deaths,  including insights that could be used for developing prevention  strategies. 4.

While we  recognize that HHS has some activities under way pertinent to issues  raised in our report, more can be done to address these issues, such as  by using stronger mechanisms to routinely share information and  expertise on child fatalities from maltreatment. For example, although  HHS cites the Federal Inter-agency Work Group on Child Abuse and  Neglect as a mechanism already in place for sharing information, HHS  officials previously told us that this workgroup has not often discussed  child fatalities from maltreatment. Since having mechanisms is a starting  point for information sharing, we clarified our recommendation to  emphasize the importance of putting such means to routine use.

For  the most part, these observations would apply to any survey in which the  respondent is answering the survey questions as a representative of an  organization rather than as an individual. We took several precautions to  minimize these limitations. For example, before activating the survey, we  confirmed that the state officials listed were correct for completing the  survey; obtained comments on the survey draft from three experts, in  addition to conducting pretests with state officials; and provided  respondents ample time for consultation with other state officials as  needed.
