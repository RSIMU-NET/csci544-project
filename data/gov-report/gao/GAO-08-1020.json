Of the 5 processes and their 38 associated key practices, SSA is executing 31 practices. However, the agency's investment board, which should provide executive oversight of investments, is not adequately monitoring the performance of IT projects. (2) SSA has made progress in establishing the key practices for managing investments as a portfolio--it is executing 18 out of 27 key practices. The agency has made important progress in defining and creating the investment portfolio, but it has not developed enterprisewide portfolio selection criteria. The agency also has not established procedures for evaluating the portfolio, and its postimplementation reviews do not determine whether projects meet the agency's strategic goals. (3) SSA is not applying its investment management process to a major portion of its IT budget. Specifically, IT products and services acquired with its acquisition budget ($610 million of the $1 billion IT budget for fiscal year 2008) are not managed by the board as investments. SSA's executive-level review board is not responsible for overseeing the acquisition budget. Consequently, executive management has limited insight into investments acquired with these funds, and the agency has limited ability to ensure that the budget is spent in the most efficient and effective manner. Until it establishes oversight of all investments and fully defines policies and procedures for overseeing both individual projects and an agencywide portfolio, SSA risks not being able to select and control these investments consistently and completely, thus increasing the chance that investments will not meet mission needs in the most cost-effective and efficient manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration (SSA) manages and funds a variety of  information technology (IT) initiatives ranging from those supporting the  processing and payment of disability and supplemental security income  benefits to those that facilitate the calculation and withholding of  Medicare premiums.

This stage also involves developing the  capability to control projects so that they finish predictably within  established cost and schedule expectations and developing the capability  to identify potential exposures to risk and put in place strategies to  mitigate that risk. It also involves instituting an IT investment board,  which includes defining its membership, guidance policies, operations,  roles, responsibilities, and authorities.

Managing IT  investments as a portfolio also enables an organization to determine its  priorities and make decisions about which projects to fund and continue  to fund based on analyses of the relative organizational value and risks of  all projects, including projects that are proposed, under development, and  in operations. Although investments may initially be organized into  separate portfolios\u2014based on, for example, business lines or life-cycle  stages\u2014and managed by subordinate investment boards, they should  ultimately be aggregated into this enterprise-level portfolio.", "According to the ITIM, Stage 3 maturity includes (1) defining the portfolio,  (2) creating the portfolio criteria, (3) evaluating the portfolio, and (4)  conducting postimplementation reviews. Table 9 summarizes the purpose  of each critical process in Stage 3.", "Within these 4 critical processes are 27 key practices associated with  portfolio-level management. For the work year budget managed by its  investment review board, SSA has executed 18 of the 27 key practices.  SSA has executed all of the key practices for creating the portfolio and  most of those for defining the criteria and conducting postimplementation  reviews. However, the agency has not executed nine key practices,  including establishing enterprisewide selection criteria and managing all  of its investments as an enterprisewide portfolio. SSA has implemented  postrelease reviews of its investments, but does not include evaluations of  quantitative data and analyses, such as the investments\u2019 contributions  toward achieving both the strategy and the objectives of the organization\u2019s  IT strategic plan.", "Table 10 summarizes the status of SSA\u2019s Stage 3 critical processes and key  practices.", "Developing an IT investment portfolio involves defining appropriate  investment cost, benefit, schedule, and risk criteria to ensure that the  organization\u2019s strategic goals, objectives, and mission will be satisfied by  the selected investments. Portfolio selection criteria reflect the strategic  and enterprisewide focus of the organization and build on the criteria that  are used to select individual projects. When IT projects are not considered  in the context of a portfolio, criteria based on narrow, lower-level  requirements may dominate enterprisewide selection criteria.", "SSA is executing five of seven key practices associated with defining the  portfolio criteria, including assigning responsibility to the ITAB for  developing and modifying portfolio guidance and providing thresholds for  selecting investments to the portfolio teams. According to SSA officials,  the agency also has adequate resources for portfolio selection activities,  including people and tools. Further, project management personnel are  aware of the portfolio selection criteria.", "However, SSA is not executing two key practices. The agency has not fully  documented policies and procedures, such as key procedures for creating  and modifying IT portfolio selection criteria. Further, the investment  board approved the core criteria for selection, but it has delegated the  weighting of core criteria to the portfolio teams. This delegated approach  conflicts with the need articulated in the ITIM framework to manage  investments in a strategic, enterprisewide manner so that the investments  address not only the objectives of individual programs, or lines of  business, but also the impact that projects have on one another and the IT  portfolio\u2019s overall benefit to the organization. Lacking complete  enterprisewide portfolio criteria, SSA risks optimizing individual business  processes while producing stovepiped systems, as well as not maximizing  overall benefits to the agency.", "Table 11 shows the status for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for defining the portfolio criteria and summarizes the  evidence that supports these ratings.", "At ITIM Stage 3, organizations create a portfolio of IT investments to  ensure that (1) they are analyzed according to the organization\u2019s portfolio  selection criteria and (2) an optimal investment portfolio with manageable  risks and returns is selected and funded. According to ITIM, creating the  portfolio requires organizations to, among other things, document policies  and procedures for analyzing, selecting, and maintaining the portfolio;  provide adequate resources, including people, funding, and tools for  creating the portfolio; and capture the information used to select, control,  and evaluate the portfolio and maintain it for future reference. In creating  the portfolio, the investment board should also (1) examine the mix of  new and ongoing investments and their respective data and analyses and  select investments for funding and (2) approve or modify the performance  expectations for the IT investments they have selected. (The complete list  of key practices is provided in table 12.)", "SSA is executing the seven key practices associated with creating the  portfolio. For example, according to SSA officials, the agency has  adequate resources for selecting the portfolio, including the ITAB  executives, other supporting staff, and a system that tracks proposal  information. The ITAB also considers a list of proposed IT investments  and assigns IT staffing resources to the investment portfolios.", "Table 12 shows the status for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for creating the portfolio and summarizes the evidence  that supports these ratings.", "This critical process builds upon the Stage 2 critical process related to  providing investment oversight by adding the elements of portfolio  performance to an organization\u2019s investment control capacity. Compared  to less mature organizations, Stage 3 organizations will have the  foundation they need to control the risks faced by each investment and to  deliver benefits that are linked to mission performance. In addition, a  Stage 3 organization will have the benefit of good performance data  generated by Stage 2 processes. Expanding this focus to the entire  portfolio provides the organization with longer-term assurances that the IT  investment portfolio will deliver mission value at acceptable cost.", "SSA has executed two of the seven key practices associated with this  process: ensuring adequate resources, including staff and tools for  reviewing the investment portfolio, and ensuring that the ITAB is familiar  with the process for evaluating and improving investments. The remaining  five key practices were not executed, partly because SSA has delegated  portfolio management and partly because it is not executing the Stage 2  prerequisite critical process, providing investment oversight, which  collects information on projects. As we have discussed, the ITAB does not  receive information on nonperforming projects, because performance  monitoring has been delegated to the Deputy Commissioner, Systems. SSA  officials agreed that they were not evaluating the portfolio as a whole.  Until SSA executes all the key practices associated with this critical  process, senior executives will not have the information they need to  determine whether the investments they have selected are delivering  mission value at the expected cost and risk.", "Table 13 shows the status for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for evaluating the portfolio and summarizes the evidence  that supports these ratings.", "The purpose of a postimplementation review is to evaluate an investment  after it has completed development in order to validate whether the  estimated return on investment was actually achieved. Specifically, the  review is conducted to (1) examine differences between estimated and  actual investment costs and benefits and possible ramifications for  unplanned funding needs in the future and (2) extract \u201clessons learned\u201d  about the investment selection and control processes that can be used as  the basis for management improvements. Postimplementation reviews  should also be conducted for investment projects that were terminated  before completion to readily identify potential management and process  improvements.", "SSA has executed four of the six key practices associated with this  process: policies and procedures are defined, adequate resources are  provided, individuals assigned to conduct postimplementation reviews are  familiar with the processes, and projects for which reviews will be  conducted are identified.", "The remaining two key practices were not executed: quantitative  investment data are not collected and analyzed and lessons learned are not  conducted on investment processes for selection, control, and evaluation.  Without analyzing quantitative data on benefits achieved, SSA cannot  determine whether the project has delivered anticipated benefits. Further,  without knowledge of what benefits are actually achieved from projects,  the portfolio cannot be evaluated, and Stage 4 and 5 practices cannot be  carried out effectively. Also, without developing lessons learned from  postimplementation reviews to improve the CPIC\u2019s select, control, and  evaluate phases, the agency will be unable to use the reviews to improve  its investment management processes.", "Table 14 shows the status for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for conducting postimplementation reviews and  summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than Half of SSA\u2019s IT Budget Is Not Subject to Its Current Investment Management Process", "paragraphs": ["Even though SSA is executing most Stage 2 and Stage 3 key practices for  the work year budget managed by its investment board, IT products and  services acquired with the acquisition budget ($610 million in acquisitions  in fiscal year 2008\u201458 percent of the IT budget) are not managed as  investments under SSA\u2019s CPIC process, and are not reviewed by the ITAB.  These products and services include, among other things, engineering  support services, network infrastructure, mainframe capacity  infrastructure, hardware maintenance, software maintenance, local  telecom services, telephone systems maintenance, and an agencywide  support service contract.", "These acquisition budget expenditures are under the overall direction of  the Deputy Commissioner, Systems and are determined by funding  requests from the business units and subsequent negotiations. Each  deputy commissioner and the associate commissioners who report to the  Deputy Commissioner, Systems, submit requests for funds based on the  unit\u2019s acquisition needs. These requests are analyzed by the Deputy  Commissioner, Systems staff, requests are reconciled with the available  resources, a budget is developed, and the CIO reviews and signs it.", "Although this process involves a large budget and important assets, it is  not subject to the CPIC select, control, and evaluate phases. For example,  acquisitions of IT products and services are not selected by a board in a  disciplined fashion, such as using the agency\u2019s CPIC select and control  procedures, but instead are largely selected by one individual\u2014\u2013the  Deputy Commissioner, Systems. While the ITAB is provided a list of  proposed projects for the Agency IT Plan, the list does not include the  acquisition budget expenses associated with projects. However, the  investment board does receive a report summarizing the total amount of  the funds expended.", "Agency officials gave several reasons why the acquisition budget is not  managed by the investment board. Specifically, in SSA\u2019s view, just as the  other deputy commissioners have discretion to manage funding allocated  to their portfolios, the Deputy Commissioner, Systems should have the  same discretion to allocate funding in the infrastructure portfolio. Further,  the officials stated that many items included in this budget are very  technical and might not be well understood by senior business  management; thus, review at this level is not thought to be effective. In  addition, officials said that many items in the acquisition budget (such as  telephones) are not optional, but necessary to keep the agency running,  and thus do not require a decision process.", "Given the large amount of funds involved, senior management  involvement and oversight are essential to ensure effective management of  and full accountability for acquisitions of IT products and services.

However, weaknesses remain. For example, although the agency has  established an investment board as the decision-making body that defines  and implements the investment governance process, key policies and  procedures for the investment management process are not fully defined,  and the investment board does not provide oversight of underperforming  investments. Moreover, the agency does not track corrective actions for its  underperforming projects. SSA has also taken the important step of  creating an investment portfolio. However, it has not fully established the  policies and procedures essential to managing the portfolio, such as for  reviewing, evaluating, and improving the performance of the portfolio.  Further, the agency\u2019s postimplementation reviews do not evaluate whether  the expected benefits were achieved or identified lessons learned for  improving the investment management processes.", "Moreover, the agency\u2019s IT acquisition budget, used to acquire IT-related  products and services, is not allocated or overseen by the investment  board and is not managed using investment governance processes.
