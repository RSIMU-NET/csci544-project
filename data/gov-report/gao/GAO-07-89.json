Customs and Border Protection runs two of the four multi-agency operations centers--the National Targeting Center and the Air and Marine Operations Center. The former monitors the international movement of potential terrorists and produces reports on suspect individuals; the latter maintains situational awareness of the nation's airspace, general aviation, and sea-lanes and produces reports on suspicious private air and marine craft. The Transportation Security Administration's operations center monitors passengers on commercial flights; works to mitigate the vulnerabilities of commercial airports, rail stations, and pipelines, the National Capital Region, and critical infrastructure across the nation; and produces reports on these topics. DHS's Operations Directorate runs the National Operations Center Interagency Watch and works to enhance efficiency and collaboration among DHS components. This operations center has a more strategic mission in that it uses information gathered by the other operations centers to provide overall national situational awareness, and it prepares security briefs for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Opportunities exist to enhance collaboration among 24/7/365 multi-agency operations centers. While DHS has leveraged resources by having staff from multiple agencies work together, the centers lack joint strategies for collaboration and staffing needs assessments, and they have not established a definition of watchstander roles for all agencies at each center. The centers also lack standards and procedures for using DHS's primary information sharing network; mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; and reinforced accountability through agency plans and reports. GAO's previous work has shown that such practices are effective in enhancing and sustaining collaboration among federal agencies. The establishment of DHS's Operations Directorate in 2005 provides a means to promote implementation of more collaborative practices at the centers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) with the primary mission of preventing terrorist  attacks against the United States. To accomplish this mission, DHS must  be aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities faced by the nation,  including terrorist threats to our transportation infrastructure (such as  rail, aviation, and shipping); terrorists entering our country through land,  air, and sea ports; and terrorists operating within our borders. Because  terrorists do not operate on a 9-to-5 schedule, DHS and some of its  operational components (six DHS agencies and DHS\u2019s Operations  Directorate) have established information gathering and/or analysis  centers that conduct activities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a  year. Staff at these operations centers conduct monitoring and  surveillance activities to help detect, deter, and prevent terrorist acts by  providing real-time situational awareness to a variety of federal, state, and  local governments and private-sector entities.

Further, a  definition of the watchstander role and responsibilities is important for  supporting agency officials who must make staffing decisions about  assigning qualified and knowledgeable personnel to the centers. Finally,  internal controls standards require that management and employees  establish a positive control environment as a foundation for strong  organizational internal controls.

In  responding to a draft of this report, DHS cited a number of efforts that the  new directorate plans to take to fulfill this leadership role.  Among other  things, DHS said it plans to conduct an independent study, initiated in  September 2006, to leverage technical and analytical expertise to support  expanding the capabilities of the Operations Directorate.  In addition, DHS  said it plans to move elements of the National Operations Center to the  Transportation Security Operations Center in 2007 and, ultimately to  colocate the DHS headquarters and all the DHS component headquarters  along with their respective staffs and operations centers at one location.

Nonetheless, further  departmental focus on the key practices we have identified could enhance  collaboration among the component agencies. For example, at the time of  our review, the directorate had not taken steps to gather information on  the resources available at each center. The director\u2019s office did not have  ready access to information such as centers\u2019 budgets or other financial  information needed for reporting across the components, the number of  staff employed at the multi-agency centers, or the number and type of  operations centers managed by the various components. After being  directed to the components for budget and staffing information, we found  that the managing components of the multi-agency operations centers also  did not have ready access to up-to-date information on the number of staff  the centers employed. Such information could be useful to the  directorate\u2019s efforts to develop a national command and coordination  capability and further enhance collaboration among the components with  multi-agency operations centers.

Having staff from multiple  agencies work together is a way of leveraging resources, one key practice  for enhancing collaboration. However, those resources may not be used to  their full potential if other steps to enhance collaboration are not taken,  and the Operations Directorate could provide guidance to help ensure that  the sponsors of the operations centers take the appropriate steps. There  are multi-agency operations centers that lack common goals and joint  strategies; clearly defined roles and responsibilities; compatible standards,  policies, and procedures for information networking; consistent staffing  assessments; prepared mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on the  results of collaborative efforts; and reinforced agency accountability  through agency plans and reports.
