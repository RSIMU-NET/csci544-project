About eight percent of all DC participants, or 3.1 million people, were likely direct beneficiaries of a simultaneous increase in all the statutory contribution limits GAO analyzed. Higher earners were more likely than low and moderate earners, and men were more likely than women, to benefit directly from such an increase; this was also true of increases in each of the separate dollar limits on contributions. About 721,000 DC participants, or 11 percent of eligible DC participants, were likely to benefit from a so-called \"catch-up\" provision allowing persons aged 50 or older to make additional contributions to DC plans.

The purpose of these pension tax preferences is to raise private savings for workers\u2019 retirement. Greater private savings for retirement can enhance income security in retirement by supplementing Social Security benefits as well as reduce the need for public assistance. Pension tax preferences are structured to strike a balance between providing incentives for employers to start and maintain voluntary, tax-qualified pension plans and ensuring that participants receive an equitable share of the tax-subsidized benefits. The Internal Revenue Code places limits on the amounts that workers and employers can contribute to tax-deferred retirement plans. These limits exist to prevent partial public subsidies of excessively large retirement benefits through tax preferences.", "Proposals intended to expand pension coverage and promote pension savings have recently received much attention. In the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, for example, Congress raised statutory limits on tax-deferred pension contributions and benefits and made other changes to the law governing qualified pension plans. Some assert that increasing these limits will enhance employer incentives to start new plans and improve existing plan coverage, especially for employees of small businesses. Others contend that these measures will primarily benefit higher paid individuals and may not improve pension coverage for low- or moderate-income workers. In this report, we consider increases in limits on contributions to defined contribution (DC) plans,the type of pension plan that covers most pension participants. You asked us to describe: (1) the extent to which workers participate in all pension plans, the extent to which workers participate in DC plans, and the earnings and genders of these DC participants; (2) the number, earnings, and genders of DC participants likely to benefit directly from an increase in limits on contributions to qualified DC plans; and (3) the number, earnings, and genders of DC participants likely to benefit directly from allowing participants aged 50 or older in certain DC plans to make \u201ccatch- up\u201d contributions in excess of other statutory limits.", "To address your questions, we used the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to estimate the number, percentage, earnings, and genders of all workers who participated in pension plans and, separately, in DC plans. We also used the 1998 SCF to estimate the number, percentage, earnings, and genders of certain DC participants (referred to below as likely direct beneficiaries) who may benefit from the increases in statutory limits on contributions to qualified DC plans we analyzed. We analyzed increases in contribution limits in isolation from any other enacted or proposed statutory changes and did not analyze the specific contribution limit increases in any specific enacted or proposed legislation. We defined likely direct beneficiaries of an increase in DC plan contribution limits as employed DC participants whose employer and/or employee contributions were equal to or above the contribution limits we analyzed. (Individuals can make contributions in excess of the specified limits, but these additional contributions do not receive favorable tax treatment.)", "In addition to analyzing SCF data, we analyzed a small sample of plan- specific data and obtained analyses conducted by the Department of the Treasury and by a large financial services firm. We also interviewed federal agency officials, pension experts, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations to obtain their views on the effects of raising various contribution limits. We conducted our work between January and August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Total retirement income comes from Social Security, pensions, personal savings and other assets, and postretirement earnings. Depending on the individual, an adequate retirement income may be achieved with different combinations of these sources. For example, Social Security provides near-universal coverage and provides proportionally larger benefits for lower earning participants. That is, Social Security replaces a higher percentage of preretirement income for lower earning workers than for higher earners. In contrast, the U.S. employer-sponsored pension system is voluntary and tax-subsidized and provides proportionally larger benefits for higher earning participants. To the extent that it is deemed desirable that the total percentage of preretirement income replaced by Social Security and employer-sponsored pensions together is reasonably constant, private pensions would tend to play a larger role in the retirement income of higher earning workers.", "The two types of employer-sponsored pension plans are defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC). DB plans promise to provide a level of retirement income that is generally based on salary and years of service. The employer, as the plan sponsor, is responsible for funding the promised benefit, investing and managing the plan assets, and bearing the investment risk. Under DC plans, employees have individual accounts to which employers, employees, or both make periodic contributions. DC plan benefits are based on the contributions to and investment returns on the individual accounts. The employee bears the investment risk. In some types of DC plans, including 401(k), 403(b), 457, and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plans, employees may choose to make tax-deferred contributions instead of receiving the same amount as taxable salary.", "A fundamental requirement for tax-qualified pension plans of taxable private employers is that contributions or benefits be apportioned in a nondiscriminatory manner between a top group of highly paid employees and owner-employees and workers outside the top group. There are standard plan designs that allow employers to comply with this requirement. Alternatively, employers can develop a custom-tailored plan design and apply general testing methods (as required by law) to a plan\u2019s apportionment of contributions or benefit accruals each year. These methods for custom-tailored plan designs are complex, but they generally require the employer to provide both coverage and contributions (or benefits) for workers outside the top group at rates that do not differ too greatly from the rates at which the employer provides coverage and contributions (or benefits) for members of the top group.", "Tax-deferred contributions to defined contribution plans by employers and employees are constrained by legal limits. The purpose of these limits is to prevent tax preferences from being used to subsidize excessively large pension benefits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 imposed dollar and percentage-of-compensation limitations on combined employer and employee tax-deferred contributions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a dollar limitation (i.e., a maximum dollar contribution) on employees\u2019 tax-deferred contributions to DC plans. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 increases all three of these limits beginning in 2002; the scheduled increases are to be fully implemented by 2006. The same law also allows a so-called \u201ccatch- up\u201d provision, where persons aged 50 or older are permitted to make additional tax-deferred contributions, in excess of other applicable statutory limits, to 401(k) and similar DC plans. Such a provision permits older workers to make larger contributions and may help those who had not previously been able to save sufficiently to \u201ccatch up\u201d to more adequate levels of retirement savings. (See table 1 for a summary of these limits.)", "Tax-deferred pension contributions may also be limited by the application of other statutory limits that we do not analyze in this report because of data limitations. In addition to the legal limits, some plans set their own limits on contributions. In DC plans with plan-specific contribution limits, tax-deferred contributions are limited to the statutory limit or the plan- specific limit, whichever is smaller. Employers set plan-specific limits, in part, to ensure that the plans they sponsor pass statutory and regulatory requirements such as the requirement that contributions or benefits not be skewed too heavily in favor of highly paid employees or owner-employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Majority of Pension Participants Had Low or Moderate Earnings, but More Than Half of Low and Moderate Earners in the Workforce Did Not Participate in a Pension Plan", "paragraphs": ["About 51 million workers, or 47 percent of all workers, participated in a pension plan in 1998.

We defined likely direct beneficiaries in this manner because participants with contributions at the current statutory limits (or their employers) are in a position to increase their contributions if the limits are raised. This definition does not imply that all likely direct beneficiaries (or their employers) will actually increase their contributions if the limits are raised, only that they are in a position to do so.", "On the other hand, it is not likely that participants with contributions below the current statutory limits would respond to an increase in the statutory limits by contributing more than the current limits. We included participants with contributions above the statutory limits in our definition of likely direct beneficiaries because the SCF does not distinguish between tax-deferred and nontax-deferred contributions or between qualified and nonqualified plans. Therefore, we were unable to identify DC participants whose tax-deferred contributions were exactly equal to the statutory limits. The general patterns described in the report were not sensitive to several alternative definitions of likely direct beneficiaries. In analyzing the option of allowing workers aged 50 or older to make extra contributions to DC plans, we limited our analysis to eligible DC participants. We defined eligible DC participants as workers aged 50 or older who contributed to 401(k) and similar DC plans. The SCF enabled us approximately to identify participants in plans of this general type, but did not enable us to distinguish between particular types of plans within this category, such as 401(k), 403(b), 457, and SIMPLE plans. year to express earnings as an annual amount. Our analyses excluded individuals whose earnings could not be expressed as an annual amount. For all analyses except that of allowing older workers to make extra contributions, we used four earnings categories: under $40,000 per year, $40,000-$74,999 per year, $75,000-$149,999 per year, and $150,000 per year or more. We chose the $40,000 cutoff because $40,000 was slightly higher than the $36,000 median annual earnings of all pension participants in 1998. We chose the $75,000 cutoff because 90 percent of all pension participants earned less than $75,000 per year in 1998. We chose the $150,000 cutoff because more than 95 percent of all pension participants earned less than $150,000 per year in 1998. For the analysis of allowing older workers to make extra contributions, we used two earnings categories (under $75,000 per year and $75,000 per year or more) because the use of four categories did not produce statistically reliable results in this analysis.", "We used the same dollar cutoffs for household income as for earnings.

Individuals we did not classify as likely to benefit directly from increased contribution limits may benefit in future years if they are able to contribute at higher levels. Our single-year analysis did not permit us to estimate how many workers would likely benefit directly from higher contribution limits at any point in their working life. Similarly, because we did not have data on earnings or income for more than 1 year, we were unable to classify individuals by their lifetime earnings or income.", "We conducted our analyses of the effects of increasing DC plan contribution limits with the individual, rather than the household, as our primary unit of analysis. Conducting an analysis based exclusively on household-level data could yield different results. For example, some households may include two DC participants, in which one is contributing or receiving contributions at one or more of the limits we analyzed, while the other has room under these limits for additional contributions. At the individual level, the contributor constrained by the limit would be included as a likely direct beneficiary, while the spousal participant not contributing at the limit would not be included. From a household-level perspective, such a household might or might not be classified as benefiting directly from one or more of the limit increases we analyzed. Depending on how such households would be classified, the results could differ from an individual-level analysis.
