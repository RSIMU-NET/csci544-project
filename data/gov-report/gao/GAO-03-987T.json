After formatting, these data are  called raw data records. The centers further process these raw data  records into data sets, called sensor data records and temperature data  records. These data records are then used to derive weather products  called environmental data records (EDR). EDRs range from atmospheric  products detailing cloud coverage, temperature, humidity, and ozone  distribution; to land surface products showing snow cover, vegetation, and  land use; to ocean products depicting sea surface temperatures, sea ice,  and wave height; to characterizations of the space environment.  Combinations of these data records (raw, sensor, temperature, and  environmental data records) are also used to derive more sophisticated  products, including outputs from numerical weather models and  assessments of climate trends. Figure 3 is a simplified depiction of the  various stages of data processing.", "EDRs can be either images or quantitative data products. Image EDRs  provide graphical depictions of the weather and are used to observe  meteorological and oceanographic phenomena to track operationally  significant events (such as tropical storms, volcanic ash, and icebergs),  and to provide quality assurance for weather prediction models.", "The following figures demonstrate polar-orbiting satellite images.

As a result of this  assessment, the program office determined that three elements had high  risk components: the interface data processing segment, the space  segment, and the overall system integration. Specifically, the interface data  processing segment and overall system integration were assessed as high  risk in all three areas (technical, cost, and schedule), whereas the space  segment was assessed to be high risk in the technical and cost areas, and  moderate risk in the schedule area. The launch segment and the command,  control, and communications segment were determined to present low or  moderate risks.

One risk  reduction initiative specifically targeted the space segment risks by  initiating the development of key sensor technologies in advance of the  satellite system itself. Because environmental sensors have historically  taken 8 years to develop, the program office began developing six of the  eight sensors with more advanced technologies early. In the late 1990s, the  program office awarded contracts for the development, analysis,  simulation, and prototype fabrication of five of these sensors.

If the NPOESS  satellites were not needed to back up the final predecessor satellites, their  anticipated launch dates would have been April 2009 and June 2011,  respectively.", "However, a DOD program official reported that between 2001 and 2002,  the agency experienced delays in launching a DMSP satellite, causing  delays in the expected launch dates of another DMSP satellite. In late 2002,  DOD shifted the expected launch date for the final DMSP satellite from  2009 to 2010. As a result, DOD reduced funding for NPOESS by about $65  million between fiscal years 2004 and 2007. According to NPOESS  program officials, because NOAA is required to provide no more funding  than DOD does, this change triggered a corresponding reduction in  funding by NOAA for those years. As a result of the reduced funding,  program office officials were forced to make difficult decisions about what  to focus on first. The program office decided to keep NPP as close to its  original schedule as possible because of its importance to the eventual  NPOESS development, and to shift some of the NPOESS deliverables to  later years. This shift will affect the NPOESS deployment schedule.  Table 4 compares the program office\u2019s current estimates for key  milestones, given current funding levels.", "As a result of the changes in funding between 2003 and 2007, project office  officials estimate that the first NPOESS satellite will be available for  launch 21 months after it is needed to back up the final POES satellite.  This means that should the final POES launch fail in March 2008, there  would be no backup satellite ready for launch. Unless the existing  operational satellite is able to continue operations beyond its expected  lifespan, there could be a gap in satellite coverage. Figure 12 depicts the  schedule delay.", "We have reported on concerns about gaps in satellite coverage in the past.  In the early 1990s, the development of the second generation of NOAA\u2019s  geostationary satellites experienced severe technical problems, cost  overruns, and schedule delays, resulting in a 5-year schedule slip in the  launch of the first satellite; this schedule slip left NOAA in danger of  temporarily losing geostationary satellite data coverage\u2014although no gap  in coverage actually occurred. In 2000, we reported that geostationary  satellite data coverage was again at risk because of a delay in a satellite  launch due to a problem with the engine of its launch vehicle. At that  time, existing satellites were able to maintain coverage until the new  satellite was launched over a year later\u2014although one satellite had  exceeded its expected lifespan and was using several backup systems in  cases where primary systems had failed.

The cost estimates for all four critical sensors (the  ones that are to support the most critical NPOESS EDRs) have increased,  due in part to including items that were not included in the original  estimates, and in part to addressing technical issues. These increases  range from approximately $60 million to $200 million.

Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to provide an overview of our nation\u2019s current polar- orbiting weather satellite program and the planned National Polar-orbiting  Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program and to  identify key risks to the successful and timely deployment of NPOESS.", "To provide an overview of the nation\u2019s current and future polar-orbiting  weather satellite system programs, we relied on prior GAO reviews of the  satellite programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). We  reviewed documents from NOAA, DOD, and the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA) that describe the purpose and origin of the  polar satellite program and the status of the NPOESS program. We also  interviewed Integrated Program Office and NASA officials to determine  the program\u2019s background, status, and plans.", "To identify key risks to the successful and timely deployment of NPOESS,  we assessed the NPOESS acquisition status and program risk reduction  efforts to understand how the program office plans to manage the  acquisition and mitigate the risks to successful NPOESS implementation.  We reviewed descriptions of the NPOESS sensors and interviewed  officials at the Integrated Program Office, NASA, and DOD to determine  the status of key sensors, program segments, and risk reduction activities.  We also reviewed documents and interviewed program office officials on  plans to address NPOESS challenges.", "NOAA, DOD, and NASA officials generally agreed with the facts as  presented in this statement and provided some technical corrections,  which we have incorporated. We performed our work at the NPOESS  Integrated Program Office, NASA headquarters, and DOD offices, all  located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Our work was  performed between April and July 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
