Medicaid was established in 1965 to provide health care coverage to low-income adults and children. Medicaid expenditures for health services to 22.3 million children totaled $32.4 billion in 1998. Congress established SCHIP in 1997 to provide health care coverage to children living in poor families whose incomes exceed the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. SCHIP expenditures for health services to nearly 2 million children totaled $2 billion in 1999. In implementing SCHIP, states could opt to expand their Medicaid programs or establish a separate child health program distinct from Medicaid that uses specified public or private insurance plans offering a minimum benefit package. Thirty-five states have chosen SCHIP approaches that are, to varying degrees, separate from their Medicaid programs. Because eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP can vary with a child's age, children may, at different ages, need to move from one program to the other. Access to care, therefore, is affected by the extent to which health plans and providers are available and participate in Medicaid and SCHIP. Differences in Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment requirements--particularly application requirements and eligibility determination practices--can affect beneficiaries' ability to obtain and keep coverage. To help simplify the process for applicants, eight of the 10 states GAO reviewed used joint applications that had similar--but not always identical--requirements for Medicaid and SCHIP applicants. When application requirements differed, Medicaid applicants had to provide additional information or documentation, such as proof of income or assets, or participate in interviews. Differences in the health plans and providers that participate in Medicaid and SCHIP, as well as differences in the payments they receive, have implications for beneficiaries' access to care. In the 10 states GAO reviewed, SCHIP often required enrollees to join a managed care plan and sometimes did not offer a choice of plans, while Medicaid offered families a choice of two or more plans or of care on a fee-for-service basis, including primary care case management. However, such choices did not necessarily give beneficiaries greater access to providers because plan choices may be limited to several smaller plans and may exclude larger plans with more extensive networks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["States provide health care coverage to low-income uninsured children  largely through two federal-state programs\u2014Medicaid and the State  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).

The Congress established  SCHIP in 1997 to provide health care coverage to children living in low- income families whose incomes exceed the eligibility requirements for  Medicaid; in 1999, SCHIP expenditures for health services to nearly 2  million children totaled $2 billion. In implementing SCHIP, states could  choose to expand their Medicaid programs, thus affording SCHIP-eligible  children the same benefits and services that the state Medicaid program  provides.  Alternatively, states could construct a separate child health  program distinct from Medicaid that uses specified public or private  insurance plans offering a minimum benefit package.  Thirty-five states  have chosen SCHIP approaches that are, to varying degrees, separate from  their Medicaid programs.", "In April 2000, we reported to you that Medicaid and SCHIP programs in 10  states that have separate SCHIP programs have differences in the way the  programs enroll children and in the scope of benefits they offer.  In  particular, we noted that 5 of the 10 states had more requirements for  Medicaid than for SCHIP, which increased the burden for families applying  for Medicaid.  For example, Alabama Medicaid required applicants to  submit proof of income (such as pay stubs), while Alabama SCHIP allowed  applicants to self-report their income without documentation.  Because  eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP can vary with a child\u2019s age, children may,  at different ages, need to move from one program to the other.  Therefore,  coordination between Medicaid and SCHIP\u2014which is required under the  SCHIP statute\u2014can be critical to ensuring that children are promptly  enrolled in the appropriate program so they have access to necessary  health care.  Access to care, however, is also affected by the extent to  which health plans and providers are available and participate in Medicaid  and SCHIP.  Because of your concern that differences between the  programs may limit children\u2019s access to care, you asked us to analyze, for  selected states\u2019 Medicaid and SCHIP programs, differences in (1) states\u2019  enrollment requirements, particularly application requirements and  eligibility determination practices, and (2) health plan and provider  participation and program payments to plans and providers.  With regard to  both objectives, you also asked that we examine the implications that these  differences might have for children\u2019s access to care.", "To address differences in states\u2019 enrollment requirements, we analyzed the  application requirements for Medicaid and SCHIP for 10 states with SCHIP  separate child health programs.  These 10 states were Alabama, California,  Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Michigan, New York, North Carolina,  Pennsylvania, and Utah.  We chose states with programs that had a mixture  of administrative structures, ranging from SCHIP programs that were  administered by the states\u2019 Medicaid program to those that were operated  separately.  In addition, we selected states whose SCHIP programs had  been in operation since January 1999 and that represented a range of  geographic locations.  We selected 4 of the 10 states for site visits  (California, Colorado, Michigan, and New York), based in part on the  number of enrollees in both programs and variation in administrative  structure.  In our site visits, we obtained supporting data on Medicaid and  SCHIP application and eligibility determination practices and interviewed  representatives of programs, including state, county, and private sector  officials, as well as health plan officials, child health advocates, and  representatives of provider organizations.  We reviewed with these groups  the steps necessary for beneficiaries to obtain, maintain, and renew their  eligibility.  To obtain broader information about health plan and provider  participation in the two programs, we interviewed Medicaid and SCHIP  officials in the 10 states.  We also collected and analyzed information and  data on payments in the four states we visited.  In conducting our payment  analysis, we focused on comparing the two programs\u2019 (1) physician fees for  primary care services and (2) plan capitation rates, which are paid to health plans prospectively on a per-member-per-month (PMPM) basis.  Finally, we  conducted interviews with officials from the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS), formerly called the Health Care Financing Administration  (HCFA), which has oversight responsibilities for both programs, and the  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which shares  oversight responsibilities for SCHIP with CMS.  We performed our work  from June 2000 through July 2001 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.  (See app. I for details on our scope and  methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For over 35 years, Medicaid has operated as a joint federal-state  entitlement program to finance health care coverage for certain categories  of low-income individuals.  Medicaid eligibility is based in part on a family\u2019s  income in relation to the federal poverty level.  Federal law requires states  to extend Medicaid eligibility to children aged 5 and under if their family  income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level and to  children aged 6 to 16 in families with incomes at or below the federal poverty level.  At their discretion, most states have set income eligibility  thresholds that expand their Medicaid programs beyond the minimum  federal statutory levels.", "For most populations, state Medicaid programs must offer certain benefits,  such as physician services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and  nursing facility and home health services.  In addition to the benefits that  are federally mandated, states may offer optional services, such as dental,  physical and occupational therapy, prescription drugs, and case  management services.  For most children, states must provide Early and  Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services.  These  services are intended to provide comprehensive, periodic evaluations of  health and developmental history, as well as vision, hearing, and dental  screening services, to most Medicaid-eligible children.  States are required  to cover any service or item that is necessary to correct or ameliorate a  condition detected through an EPSDT screening, regardless of whether the  service is otherwise covered under a state\u2019s Medicaid program.", "Across the nation, 48 states and the District of Columbia have Medicaid  managed care programs, which require approval from CMS.  These  managed care programs can be targeted to specific geographic areas within  a state or can be statewide.  As of June 2000, 36 states and the District of  Columbia had Medicaid mandatory managed care programs.  In such  programs, certain beneficiaries may choose between at least two capitated  managed care plans, and states pay prospectively for each enrolled  beneficiary on a PMPM basis.  As a part of their managed care programs,  states can provide beneficiaries a FFS based alternative, such as primary  care case management (PCCM).  Under PCCM, primary care providers are  paid a nominal fee to manage the care of beneficiaries, and all services  received are paid on a FFS basis.  The remaining 12 states have managed care programs that are voluntary for beneficiaries, including a FFS-based  alternative (such as PCCM), or both.", "The Congress created SCHIP in 1997 as a means of providing health  benefits coverage to children living in families whose incomes exceed the  eligibility limits for Medicaid.  Although SCHIP is generally targeted to  families with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level,  each state may set its own income eligibility limits, within certain  guidelines.  Using the flexibility built into the statute, states\u2019 upper income  eligibility for SCHIP ranged from 133 percent to 350 percent of the federal  poverty level for separate SCHIP programs as of October 2000.  States  have three options in designing SCHIP: they may expand their Medicaid  programs, develop a separate child health program that functions  independently of the Medicaid program, or do a combination of both.   Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have created Medicaid  expansion programs, 16 states have separate child health programs, and 19  states have a combination Medicaid expansion and separate child health  component.  (See app. II for a summary of states\u2019 SCHIP design choices and  app. III for states\u2019 income eligibility levels in SCHIP and Medicaid.)", "While Medicaid expansion programs under SCHIP must use Medicaid\u2019s  enrollment structures, benefit packages, and provider networks, SCHIP  separate child health programs may depart from Medicaid requirements,  particularly with regard to benefits and the plans, providers, and delivery  systems available to enrollees.  SCHIP separate child health programs  generally cover basic benefits, such as physician services, inpatient and  outpatient hospital services, and laboratory and radiological services, and  may provide other benefits at the state\u2019s discretion, such as prescription  drugs and hearing, mental health, dental, and vision services.  In contrast to  Medicaid, SCHIP does not require that beneficiaries have freedom to  choose among providers or plans, and permits states to implement  mandatory managed care; thus, states may place SCHIP enrollees in a  single managed care plan without an alternative.", "Medicaid and SCHIP separate child health programs may differ in other  respects, particularly in terms of their application requirements, eligibility  determination processes, cost-sharing requirements, and periods of  eligibility.  Some of these differences are based in federal statute, while  others are the result of federal regulations.  For example, federal law has  been interpreted to require that public employees determine Medicaid  eligibility, while SCHIP contains no such requirement; consequently,  states are currently permitted to use private contractors to determine  SCHIP eligibility.  Also, while federal Medicaid regulations generally do not  permit cost-sharing for children, the SCHIP statute allows states to require  beneficiary cost-sharing, which some states have implemented as a way to  mirror private insurance and encourage appropriate use of services.  (See  table 1.)", "Medicaid and SCHIP also differ in terms of the proportion of their program  expenditures that come from federal funds and in whether eligible  individuals are considered entitled to the program benefits and services.  State expenditures for Medicaid are matched by the federal government  using a formula that results in federal shares ranging from 50 to 77 percent  of expenditures, depending on a state\u2019s per capita income in relationship to  the national average.  The national average federal share of Medicaid  expenditures is about 57 percent.  The SCHIP statute provides for an  \u201cenhanced\u201d federal matching rate, with each states\u2019 SCHIP rate exceeding  its Medicaid rate.  Federal shares of SCHIP expenditures range from 65 to  84 percent with the national average federal share equaling about 72 percent.   In the Medicaid program, all eligible individuals are entitled to  program benefits.  No overall federal budget limit exists for the Medicaid  program.  In contrast, for SCHIP, federal matching for each state is limited.   The Congress appropriated $40 billion over 10 years (from fiscal year 1998  to 2007), with a specified amount allocated annually to each of the 50  states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories.  States\u2019 choices to operate a Medicaid expansion or separate child health  program determine whether eligible individuals are entitled to receive the  benefits and services offered. States opting for a Medicaid expansion under  SCHIP must provide Medicaid benefits to all eligible children.  The state  must continue to serve those children even if its allocated federal funds are  exhausted. In contrast, SCHIP separate child health programs are not  entitlements to coverage or services; once federal funds are exhausted,  states have the option to discontinue providing services or cover the  services with other funds.", "Both statutory and regulatory requirements for coordination between  Medicaid and SCHIP exist at the federal level.  The SCHIP statute requires  the program to coordinate with Medicaid, including first screening SCHIP  applicants for Medicaid eligibility.   On the basis of this initial screen,  applications (which in most states are the joint Medicaid/SCHIP  applications) are directed to either Medicaid or SCHIP, where each  program is responsible for final eligibility determination and enrollment.  (See fig. 1.)   In addition, as of August 24, 2001, SCHIP regulations also  require that state Medicaid agencies adopt a process that facilitates  enrollment in a state child health program when a child is determined  ineligible for Medicaid.", "In part because Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility represent a continuum of  income levels, coordination between the programs is important.  Several  states have found that many families applying for SCHIP actually have  incomes that qualify them for Medicaid.  In addition, families may need to  apply to both Medicaid and SCHIP to obtain health care coverage for all of  their children because Medicaid eligibility standards can vary according to  the age of the child.  Table 2 illustrates for two states (Florida and  Vermont), how income eligibility can\u2014but does not always\u2014vary by age.   (App. III shows the eligibility standards for SCHIP and Medicaid in the 35  states with SCHIP separate child health programs.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Similarities Often Exist, Enrollment Differences Can Affect Ability to Obtain and Keep Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Differences in Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment requirements\u2014particularly  application requirements and eligibility determination practices\u2014can  affect beneficiaries\u2019 ability to obtain and keep coverage.

When application requirements differed,  Medicaid applicants had to provide additional information or  documentation. The extent and effectiveness of coordination between the  programs affected applicants\u2019 ability to obtain coverage because joint  applications often were transferred between the Medicaid and SCHIP  offices to ensure that applicants were enrolled in the appropriate program.   Poor coordination meant that applications that were transferred or  incomplete risked being delayed or denied. In two of the four states we  reviewed, Medicaid applications generally took more time to process.   However, different processing times could not be attributed solely to lack  of coordination efforts because other factors may affect processing times  as well.  Once enrolled, Medicaid and SCHIP families faced different  requirements for maintaining coverage, such as a more complex  redetermination process for Medicaid, and premium and annual fee  requirements in SCHIP."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Joint Applications Had Similar, but Not Always Identical, Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Joint Medicaid/SCHIP applications are used widely\u201431 of the 35 states  with SCHIP separate child health programs (including 8 of the 10 states we  reviewed) have them.  In most states, joint applications are the primary  method for applying for SCHIP; however, families applying for Medicaid  and other public programs may be required to use a separate, different  application form.  Joint application forms have helped simplify  application and eligibility determination for both programs.  When an  applicant is found ineligible for one program, the joint form can minimize  or eliminate the follow-up needed to determine eligibility for the other  program.  While the 10 states we reviewed generally had similar  information and documentation requirements for both programs, some  differences remained with regard to income deductions, asset information,  and interview requirements.", "With regard to income reporting, 9 of the 10 states we reviewed established  identical requirements for both Medicaid and SCHIP.  Some of the 10 states  in our sample have taken other steps to make application requirements  consistent between the programs.  For example, most of the states we  reviewed did not ask for information about assets or require the applicant  to complete an interview.  California eliminated its former requirement for  an in-person interview as part of the Medicaid application process and  allowed Medicaid applications to be mailed in like SCHIP applications.  (See table 3.)", "Documenting income and income-related information has been cited as a  barrier to program eligibility\u2014but also as a means of ensuring that only  eligible individuals are enrolled in the appropriate program.  In particular,  the need to offer documentation, such as pay stubs or proof of child care  expenses, can be problematic for families.  For instance, families that do  not receive regular paychecks can have difficulty showing several months  of pay stubs.  Similarly, child care expenses can be difficult to document,  particularly if an individual pays cash or with a money order. Seven of the  10 states we reviewed were consistent in requiring applicants to document  their income for both programs.  However, individuals in four states could  report income deduction information for both programs, such as child  support or day care expenses, without supplying proof.  Only one state  required both Medicaid and SCHIP applicants to document income  deductions, while three states required documentation for Medicaid  applicants but not for SCHIP.", "Of the 10 states we reviewed, 2 states\u2014Florida and Michigan\u2014had no  income documentation requirements for Medicaid or SCHIP.   For example,  Medicaid and SCHIP officials in Michigan told us that they eliminated  documentation requirements because they were a barrier to application  and enrollment.  Before the state eliminated the documentation  requirements, Michigan officials reported that 75 percent of the  applications received were incomplete because individuals failed to  provide adequate documentation. Michigan eliminated income  documentation for both programs and, as a result, the proportion of  incomplete applications received for both programs dropped to below 20  percent.", "While application requirements for both Medicaid and SCHIP in the 10  states we reviewed were generally similar, they were not always identical.  Where differences existed, Medicaid required more information or  documentation, particularly with regard to income deductions, assets, or  the need to participate in an in-person interview.  For example, Colorado  required applicants to report income deductions and assets for Medicaid  but not for SCHIP, and New York required in-person interviews and proof of  income deductions for Medicaid applicants but not for SCHIP. (See table 3.)   New York\u2019s Medicaid interview requirement was part of its facilitated  enrollment strategy intended to assist applicants in completing the  enrollment process.  This strategy uses community-based organizations  (such as hospitals, clinics, schools, and libraries) as sites where such  interviews can be conducted.  SCHIP applicants can also use the facilitated  enrollment process for assistance in applying for the program, but they are  not subject to the in-person interview requirement.", "The states we visited had various strategies for addressing the differences  between Medicaid and SCHIP requirements on their joint applications.  In  California, application questions that were Medicaid-specific\u2014such as the  need for a Social Security number\u2014were clearly marked as not required  for a SCHIP applicant. Colorado joint applications, on the other hand,  asked for information without differentiating between items required by  one program versus another.  For example, its joint application asked for  information about assets, although this was only required for Medicaid, to  lessen the need for additional information if an applicant appeared  Medicaid-eligible.  Both policies have implications for applicants\u2014either  the applicant submits information that may not be necessary or risks  having to provide additional information later, which could prolong the  approval process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delayed or Denied Coverage Often Linked to Coordination and Processing Issues", "paragraphs": ["Delayed or denied coverage often was associated with a lack of  coordination between the programs and other processing issues.  In  particular, delays or denials were at risk when Medicaid and SCHIP  applications were transferred between programs, or when applications  were deemed incomplete.  The amount of risk depended on how closely the  programs coordinated.  Generally, states that had identical Medicaid and  SCHIP application requirements and that maintained geographically close  or colocated eligibility determination offices for both programs, reduced  the risk of delayed or denied coverage.  However, different application  requirements for Medicaid and SCHIP, as well as poor coordination  between the programs could delay coverage for families.  In two of the four  states we visited where we could obtain comparable data, processing  Medicaid applications took longer than for SCHIP; however, longer  processing times could be due to a variety of factors besides differences in  application requirements and insufficient coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Application Transfers Between Programs Increased the Need for Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Increased coordination between Medicaid and SCHIP was important in  part because joint applications were often transferred between programs.   Application and eligibility determination processes for Medicaid and  SCHIP include an initial eligibility screen for Medicaid and a final eligibility  determination in the appropriate program.  Across the four states we  visited, the initial eligibility screening generally took place when an  applicant submitted a joint application to a SCHIP processing location.   SCHIP eligibility determination officials were responsible for performing  the initial screen; applications deemed potentially Medicaid-eligible were  typically sent to the Medicaid office in the county where the applicant  resided, while those deemed potentially SCHIP-eligible remained at the  SCHIP office for final eligibility determination.", "In the four states we visited, the proportion of joint applications  transferred between the programs was substantial.  For example, Michigan  officials reported that one-half of the applications submitted to SCHIP were  determined to be potentially Medicaid-eligible and were forwarded to  Medicaid, and California SCHIP officials estimated that about 30 percent of  the applications received by mail were eligible for Medicaid and thus  required transfer.  Applications could also flow in the opposite direction.   For example, SCHIP application processing sites for Colorado and  Michigan each reported that about 20 percent of their applications were  transferred from county offices that determine Medicaid eligibility to the  SCHIP processing location.  Colorado officials estimated that, although  average times were not available, such transfers could take anywhere from  2 weeks to 6 months.", "Application transfers took less time if the program offices were  geographically close or colocated.  For example, Michigan established a  state-operated Medicaid eligibility determination office in the same  building as the SCHIP enrollment contractor responsible for processing  joint applications.  At this SCHIP processing center, joint applications that  appeared Medicaid eligible were to be transferred immediately to this  Medicaid office instead of being sent to various county Medicaid offices for  eligibility determination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Application Requirements Increased the Risk of Incomplete Applications", "paragraphs": ["When joint applications ask for different information for Medicaid and  SCHIP, applications transferred between programs can be considered  incomplete, which will delay processing until the needed information is  supplied.  For instance, if required Medicaid information, such as a Social  Security number, is missing from a joint application, Medicaid processing  can be delayed because the application is incomplete.  When applications  were incomplete for these or other reasons, it increased the likelihood of  follow-up and often prolonged the completion of the eligibility  determination process.  For example, community assistance workers in  California told us that families who were required to supply additional  information or documentation did not always return to complete the  application process, and many applications were ultimately denied because  they remained incomplete.  California officials noted that it is unknown  whether these families were deterred by the requirements or they did not  follow through because they believed they were not eligible for the  program.", "While incomplete information on applications resulted in some denials,  states varied in the extent to which they could provide data on denials.    For example, California and Colorado were able to provide data on SCHIP  denials that resulted from incomplete information. California indicated that  27 percent of applications received are denied; of these, almost half were  denied because of incomplete information.  In 2000, Colorado reported that  31 percent of all applications received were denied because they were  incomplete.  Beginning January 2001, however, the state changed its  application, which an official told us reduced the percentage of denials due  to incomplete applications to about 24 percent.   In contrast, Michigan  indicated that less than 3 percent of applications were denied for  incomplete information.  A Michigan official attributed this low denial rate  to the state\u2019s policy to minimize the amount of required documentation for  both Medicaid and SCHIP, which has reduced the number of applications  that are incomplete and require follow-up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Program Coordination Helped Avoid Delays", "paragraphs": ["Officials gave us examples of poor coordination between the programs that  resulted in delayed coverage or inconvenience to families.  In California,  application assistants reported that SCHIP coverage could be denied if the  family had not been promptly taken off Medicaid\u2019s rolls after becoming  ineligible.  For example, when a Medicaid family\u2019s income rose enough to  make the family ineligible for Medicaid but eligible for SCHIP, as long as  the family was still recorded as enrolled in Medicaid, its SCHIP application  would be denied.  Other difficulties could occur if program eligibility  information was not provided to the family.  For example, some Colorado  families that were denied Medicaid were not informed that their  applications had been sent to SCHIP and only discovered they were eligible  for SCHIP when they received a notice that SCHIP premiums were due.", "Michigan has made efforts to improve coordination between the programs  by avoiding repeated transfers of the same application that occurred when  Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility workers disagreed on an applicant\u2019s  eligibility.  To address this, the state developed a policy in which Medicaid  and SCHIP eligibility workers accept each other\u2019s calculations for purposes  of determining program eligibility.  To ensure that only eligible individuals  are enrolled in the appropriate program, the state checks applications for  calculation errors.

In these two states, Medicaid application and eligibility  determination processing generally took longer than SCHIP.  For example,  Colorado reported statewide average processing times that were longer for  Medicaid (38 days) than for SCHIP (14 days for a completed application  and 30 days for those requiring follow-up).  Michigan reported that average  processing times were 19 days for Medicaid and 8 days for SCHIP. While  differences in processing times could be affected by poor coordination,  other factors can contribute to Medicaid\u2019s longer average processing times.

Presumptive eligibility allows a  child to receive coverage immediately while eligibility determination is in  process. Nationally, however, few states have opted for presumptive  eligibility in their Medicaid and SCHIP programs. As of July 2000, five  states had adopted and implemented presumptive eligibility in their  Medicaid programs\u2014Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New  Jersey, and New Mexico, while three states\u2014Massachusetts, New Jersey,  and New York\u2014had adopted and implemented presumptive eligibility for  SCHIP.

In  contrast, SCHIP children risked losing coverage for their families\u2019 failure to  pay required premiums or enrollment fees, while Medicaid generally did  not have such cost-sharing requirements.", "The four states we visited generally required redetermination of eligibility  after 12 months for both programs.  To maintain coverage during the  eligibility period, two states\u2014Michigan and Colorado\u2014required Medicaid  families to report any significant changes, such as income or family status,  and the families could lose coverage if changes made them ineligible.  In  contrast, SCHIP families in these two states had \u201ccontinuous eligibility,\u201d  meaning they remained covered for the full 12 months regardless of  changes in income or family status.  New York did the opposite: Medicaid  families had continuous eligibility, while SCHIP families did not.", "At the end of the coverage period, the programs redetermine enrollees\u2019  eligibility for coverage.  Medicaid families in California, Michigan, and New  York faced a more complex redetermination process than SCHIP families.   For example, to begin Medicaid redetermination, Michigan mailed families  a new Medicaid application, but it was a 10-page form, not the 4-page joint  application.  In contrast, the state\u2019s SCHIP beneficiaries were mailed a  summary of the information on their last application and asked to update  information that had changed.  In New York, families completed   redetermination forms for both Medicaid and SCHIP, but Medicaid again  required an in-person interview.  In contrast, Medicaid redetermination in  Colorado may be less burdensome than SCHIP redetermination, depending  on the information the state is able to collect before contacting the family.   The state first searches other program files, such as Food Stamps and  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), to determine whether it  already has the necessary application information.  If the state does not  find the information with this process, it sends families a redetermination  form that essentially has the same information requirements as the joint  application.  For SCHIP redetermination, families must submit another  joint application.", "While Medicaid, under federal law, generally does not allow premiums or  fees for children under age 18, the SCHIP legislation permits states to  require limited cost-sharing.

In the 10  states we reviewed, SCHIP often required enrollees to join a managed care  plan and sometimes did not provide a choice of plans.  In contrast,  Medicaid beneficiaries had a choice of at least two capitated plans in  locations offering managed care or could receive care on a FFS basis,  including through PCCM.  However, having such choices did not  necessarily mean greater access to providers.  For example, FFS options do  not necessarily provide greater access to physicians than managed care  plans do, since physicians may choose to limit participation or not  participate in Medicaid.  Similarly, one program may have a number of  smaller plans, while larger plans with more extensive provider networks  may not participate in the program.  Payment disparities between Medicaid  and SCHIP also had the potential to affect access to care.  In two states  where comparable data were available, Medicaid FFS payments to  physicians for children\u2019s preventive services were lower than the rates  physicians were paid for the same services in SCHIP. We also compared  Medicaid and SCHIP physician fees with those of Medicare and found  Medicaid fees consistently lower in all four states, while our comparison of  SCHIP and Medicare fees showed a less consistent relationship.   Comparisons of capitation rates were difficult because of differences in the  benefits included within these rates.  In one state with comparable benefits  covered by the capitation rate, SCHIP paid more than Medicaid.  In the  remaining three states, capitation rate comparisons were not feasible  because of differences in the benefits or populations covered, or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Offered Families More Choice Between FFS and Managed Care Plans", "paragraphs": ["In terms of the broad choices available\u2014obtaining health care through FFS  or enrollment in a managed care plan\u2014families with children in Medicaid  generally had more choice than SCHIP families.  In the 10 states we  reviewed, Medicaid generally offered families a choice of receiving services  on a FFS basis; selecting between a capitated managed care plan and FFS,  including PCCM; or choosing from at least two capitated plans.  Across the  nine states with capitated managed care, enrollment of Medicaid  beneficiaries in capitated plans ranged from 4 percent to 75 percent.  In  contrast, virtually all children enrolled in SCHIP in 8 of the 10 states were  enrolled in capitated managed care plans; the remaining two states offered  only FFS care.  (See table 5.)", "Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 choices within a state depended on where they  lived.  The Medicaid programs in seven states\u2014California, Colorado,  Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah\u2014mandated  that certain Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in capitated health plans, but  the extensiveness of mandatory enrollment within a state varied greatly.   In certain areas of these states, enrollment in a capitated Medicaid plan  was mandatory for most children:  in 22 of 58 counties in California,  in urban areas of Colorado,  in 73 of 83 counties in Michigan,   in 16 of 57 counties in New York and in parts of New York City,   in one county in North Carolina,  in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas of Pennsylvania, and   in 4 urban counties in Utah.", "While enrollment was mandatory in these locations, Medicaid beneficiaries  could still choose among two or more capitated plans.  For example  Medicaid beneficiaries could choose among 9 capitated plans in Wayne  County, Michigan, and among 13 to16 plans in New York City, depending on  the area in which they live.", "SCHIP beneficiaries generally had less choice between managed care plans  and FFS than Medicaid beneficiaries, and these choices also depended on  where the beneficiaries  lived.  Four of the states we reviewed with  capitated managed care plans in SCHIP\u2014Colorado, Florida, New York, and  Pennsylvania\u2014had geographic regions in which the SCHIP program  offered a single managed care plan and no FFS option. In addition, SCHIP  children throughout Kansas were enrolled in the single available plan in  their area and did not have a FFS option, while Medicaid children were  enrolled in either a PCCM or a capitated plan.  While SCHIP children did  not always have a choice of FFS, this did not mean that choices were  necessarily limited.  For example, California SCHIP officials noted that in  the five counties with the largest enrollment (over 60 percent of the SCHIP  enrollment statewide), SCHIP beneficiaries have between 7 and 9 health  plan choices.

Several  states, such as Colorado, Kansas, New York, and Utah, reported that  generally the same health plans participated in both programs, but in  Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, there was limited overlap between  the health plans participating in Medicaid and those participating in SCHIP.  (See table 6.)  This difference was especially pronounced in Michigan,  where 80 percent of SCHIP beneficiaries were enrolled in a single capitated  plan that did not participate in Medicaid and that contracted with over 95  percent of the physicians in the state.  Michigan officials told us that in one  quarter, 27 percent of children that reapplied for SCHIP were eligible for  Medicaid; to the extent that these children were enrolled in the plan that  did not participate in Medicaid, the transfer to Medicaid would require that  they select a new health plan.", "When plans do not participate in both programs, continuity-of-care  problems can arise as beneficiaries shift between programs because of  changes in family income or children\u2019s ages.  For example, because  Medicaid eligibility changes with a child\u2019s age in all 10 of the states we  reviewed, a child may have to move from Medicaid to SCHIP at certain ages  even when family income remains constant. (See app. III.)  Losing  eligibility in one program and becoming eligible for the other can therefore  mean joining a new plan and possibly seeing a new physician. In addition, a  family with more than one child could have children enrolled in each  program, so having the same providers in both programs would make  obtaining health care easier for the family as a whole.", "To facilitate continuity of care, a few states reported taking action to  ensure that plans and physicians participated in both Medicaid and SCHIP.   For example, in 1998, New York began requiring that new plans participate  in both programs and that existing plans serve both Medicaid and SCHIP in  any new service areas.  Similarly, Colorado required managed care plans  contracting with SCHIP to be willing to contract with Medicaid, and it has  allowed only one exception to this requirement.  Colorado state officials  reported that they also intend to request that health plans submit Medicaid  and SCHIP physician networks for review so that the state can  independently determine the degree of participation in both programs.  The  remaining six states we reviewed with Medicaid and SCHIP capitated  programs did not require health plans to participate in both programs.   However, officials in one of the six states\u2014Kansas\u2014said that in the future  they intend to require plans\u2019 participation in both Medicaid and SCHIP.", "Neither requiring health plan participation in both programs nor having  FFS options can guarantee, however, that the two programs will have the  same physicians, since physicians may choose not to participate in one or  the other program or plans may establish different physician networks for  each program.  Medicaid and SCHIP officials in the 10 states seldom were  able to report whether physicians participated in both programs\u2014and the  extent of their participation.  A few states-such as Michigan and New York  noted that their state insurance departments were responsible for  reviewing network adequacy.  In most cases, however, states did not have  the data needed to compare physician participation in both Medicaid and  SCHIP, particularly where a significant portion of care was provided by  capitated plans. Colorado officials noted that provider data systems in  Medicaid and SCHIP were not comparable and that comparisons also  would be difficult because provider participation changes frequently within  and between networks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payment Rates Can Affect Physician Participation and, Ultimately, Access to Care", "paragraphs": ["Payment rates\u2014whether they are physician fees or capitation rates to  health plans\u2014can affect the degree to which physicians and health plans  participate in Medicaid and SCHIP, and thereby affect beneficiaries\u2019  choices and access to care.  The relative fees paid by different insurers\u2014 Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, and private health plans\u2014can also affect  providers\u2019 willingness to participate.  Nationally, low Medicaid physician  fees and physician participation have been long-standing areas of concern.  In a recent national survey, pediatricians cited low fees as one of the most  important factors in their decision to limit participation in Medicaid.  In  three of the four states we visited\u2014California, Colorado, and Michigan\u2014 the percentage of pediatricians accepting Medicaid patients was below the  national average of 67 percent.  Some plans and physicians have  demonstrated their dissatisfaction with Medicaid\u2019s fees by taking legal  action.  In New York, for example, two provider groups recently initiated  lawsuits that resulted in increases in Medicaid dental fees, and physician  fees for office visits were increased from $7 to $30.  In both cases, these  were the first Medicaid fee increases in more than 30 years.", "Across the four states we visited, Medicaid fees were consistently lower  than Medicare fees for the same preventive services for children, while  SCHIP and Medicare fees had a less consistent relationship in the two  states where comparable data were available.  Medicaid fees ranged from  29 percent to 61 percent of what Medicare would pay for selected  preventive medical services for children.  SCHIP fees as a percentage of  Medicare fees varied, with two large health plans in California paying 44 to  72 percent of what Medicare would pay and one large health plan in  Michigan paying 103 to 124 percent of what Medicare would pay.

Capitation rates can be difficult to compare,  however, because the PMPM rates do not always encompass the same  benefits.  In Michigan, Medicaid capitation rates were lower than SCHIP  rates by $26 PMPM, even though the two programs contracted for  essentially the same services.  In California, differences in benefits and in  the populations included in the rates complicated rate comparisons.  Medicaid\u2019s capitation rate included both adults and children, while SCHIP\u2019s  rate was limited to children.

Well-coordinated programs,  however, can minimize the effect of such differences and facilitate  enrollment and continuity of care for children.", "Differences in provider participation and in the relative payment rates also  have implications for children's access to health care.  Few states,  however, could assess the degree to which the same physicians were  available to both Medicaid and SCHIP children.  Since physicians decide  whether to participate in Medicaid and SCHIP partly on the basis of the  payment rates, lower Medicaid payments relative to other payers continue  to be a source of concern, although some states have recently increased  Medicaid provider payments.  While comparing payment rates in a  managed care environment is often complicated by differences in covered  benefits, differential rates between the two programs can affect plans\u2019 and  physicians\u2019 willingness to participate and, in turn, beneficiaries\u2019 access to  care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and State Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Secretary of Health and Human Services an opportunity to  comment on a draft of this report.

The report notes throughout that our findings on  enrollment policies and provider participation were based on the  experience of 10 states and that our comparisons of payment rates were  limited to 4 states.  Our intent was not to generalize nationwide, but to  illustrate how selected states are addressing challenges that other states  might also face in administering their Medicaid and SCHIP programs.", "HHS noted that the influence of relative reimbursement levels on physician  and dentist participation in the Medicaid program is an important policy  consideration. It expressed concern, however, about comparing Medicare  physician fees to Medicaid fees for selected pediatric preventive medical  services because of differences in the populations eligible for these  programs.  We made this comparison for several reasons.  First, while  Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for the elderly  and persons with disabilities, its fee schedule includes fees for pediatric  medical services.  Second, both public and private health care insurers  often base their payments to physicians on the Medicare fee schedule.  For  example, in California, Medicare payment levels were used as a benchmark  for revisions to the Medicaid fee schedule in August 2000. Finally,  research on Medicaid payment frequently considers Medicare fee  schedules as a point of comparison for Medicaid rates.

We visited four states, and we analyzed  data from states\u2019 programs as well as federal Medicaid and SCHIP program  reports and documents.  Because states\u2019 Medicaid programs varied  considerably, data collected from states did not always represent the same  time frames.  We asked states to provide their latest available data, which  ranged from 1999 to the summer of 2001.  In addition, we reviewed  published studies and reports on application and eligibility determination  practices, plan and physician participation, and provider payment issues in  Medicaid and SCHIP.  We also relied on information from our previous  work.", "To analyze the extent of programmatic differences for the two reporting  objectives, we selected 10 states that had SCHIP programs with separate  child health programs. These states were Alabama, California, Colorado,  Florida, Kansas, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and  Utah.  With one exception, these were the same states included in our  previous Medicaid and SCHIP comparison report.  In selecting these  states, we considered attributes of SCHIP separate child health programs,  such as administrative structure and the method of providing services (fee- for-service (FFS) or managed care) compared to Medicaid programs in  each state.  We also selected states whose SCHIP programs had been in  operation since January 1999 and represented a range of geographic  locations.  We made site visits to four of these states (California, Colorado,  Michigan, and New York) to probe certain issues more deeply and obtain  the multiple perspectives needed.  We selected these four states primarily  because of their geographic distribution, the varying sizes of their Medicaid  and SCHIP enrollments, and their different program administration  structures.  For example, the Medicaid program in California operates at  the county level, while SCHIP operates statewide; in contrast, Michigan  operates both Medicaid and SCHIP out of the same state agency.", "During the four site visits, we interviewed representatives of programs\u2014 including state, county, and private sector officials\u2014as well as a wide range  of groups, including   state Medicaid and SCHIP directors and their staffs;   managed care plan officials;   local organizations responsible for assisting families with applications;  contractors and other staff responsible for determining eligibility and  for enrolling children in Medicaid and SCHIP;  physician organizations, such as local chapter officials of the American  Academy of Pediatrics; and   child health advocacy organizations.", "We also obtained documentation and data from states on application and  eligibility determination, plan participation, and plan and physician  payments.", "To compare application requirements and eligibility determination  practices under Medicaid and SCHIP, we analyzed application requirements  from the 10 states.

The distribution of such  population groups and the benefits offered also can differ between  Medicaid and SCHIP.  Because of this, comparing programs\u2019 capitation  rates to health plans required analyzing any existing differences between  Medicaid and SCHIP rates based on a program\u2019s enrollment by age, risk  groups, and benefits; where possible, we made adjustments to address the  differences we identified.", "In general, to compare capitation rates, we first excluded SSI children from  Medicaid\u2019s enrollment figures and calculated or obtained weighted average  capitation rates for non-SSI children to make the Medicaid rates more  comparable to SCHIP.  While this approach made the Medicaid and SCHIP  populations more similar, the number of beneficiaries in each age group  varied by program.  To adjust for these differences, we used the SCHIP  program\u2019s enrollment distribution by age in each state and applied  weighted average Medicaid capitation rates, thus calculating a population- adjusted PMPM Medicaid rate that was more comparable to SCHIP.  By age- adjusting the two populations, we arrived at more comparable price-to- price evaluations of Medicaid and SCHIP capitation rates.", "For example, in Colorado, infants (aged 0 to 1) made up 8,236 (15 percent),  of all children in Medicaid, while infants composed 633, or 3 percent, of all  children in SCHIP.  Capitation rates differ by age groupings\u2014with infant  rates higher than rates for older children under both programs.  For  example, the weighted average Medicaid rate for infants in Colorado was  $300 PMPM, while the weighted average rate for ages 1 to 18 was $47  PMPM.  Given these differences, the weighted average monthly capitation  rate for a program enrolling many infants\u2014such as Medicaid\u2014reflects the  higher costs of these beneficiaries.  This rate is not comparable to the  weighted average rate for a program with fewer infants.  To adjust for these  differences in populations, we used SCHIP\u2019s enrollment distribution by age  in Colorado and applied Colorado\u2019s Medicaid rates to the SCHIP enrollment  distribution in order to calculate a population-adjusted PMPM rate.  This  gave us comparable price-to-price evaluations of Medicaid and SCHIP  capitation rates in Colorado of $54 PMPM in Medicaid and $70 PMPM in  SCHIP.
