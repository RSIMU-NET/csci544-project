In September 2005, heads of UN member states approved a resolution that called for a series of reforms to strengthen the organization. As the largest financial contributor to the UN, the United States has a strong interest in the progress of UN reform initiatives. GAO was asked to (1) identify and track the status of UN management reforms in five key areas and (2) identify factors that may affect the implementation of these reform initiatives. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents proposing UN management reform and interviewed U.S. and UN officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most of the UN management reforms in the five areas GAO examined--management operations of the Secretariat, oversight, ethical conduct, review of programs and activities, and human rights--are either awaiting General Assembly review or have been recently approved. In addition, many proposed or approved reforms do not have an implementation plan that establishes time frames and cost estimates. First, in July 2006, the General Assembly approved proposals to improve the management operations of the Secretariat, such as upgrading information technology systems and giving the Secretary-General some flexibility in spending authority. In addition, in fall 2006, the General Assembly will review other proposals, such as procurement and human resource reforms. Second, implementation of proposals to improve the UN's oversight capabilities, such as strengthening the capacity of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and establishing the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, are pending General Assembly review in fall 2006. Third, the UN established an ethics office with temporary staff in January 2006 that has developed an internal timetable for implementing key initiatives. However, it is too early to determine whether the office will be able to fully carry out its mandate. Fourth, UN member states agreed to complete a review of UN programs and activities in 2006, but progress has been slow and the results and time line for completion remain uncertain. Fifth, the General Assembly created a new Human Rights Council in April 2006, but significant concerns remain about the council's structure. GAO identified several factors that may affect the UN's ability to fully implement management reforms. First, although all UN member states agree that UN management reforms are needed, disagreements about the overall implications of the reforms could significantly affect their progress. Most member states are concerned that some of the reforms could increase the authority of the Secretariat at the expense of the General Assembly, thus decreasing their influence over UN operations. Member states also disagree on some of the specifics of the reforms in areas such as the review of programs and activities and the role of the Deputy Secretary-General. Second, the general absence of an implementation plan for each reform that establishes time frames and cost estimates could affect the UN's ability to implement the reform initiatives. Without establishing deadlines or determining cost estimates, it is difficult to hold managers accountable for completing reform efforts and ensure that financing will be available when needed. Third, administrative guidance, such as staff regulations and rules that implement General Assembly resolutions, could complicate the process of implementing certain human resource reform proposals. For example, according to the Secretary-General, the General Assembly established a number of conditions for outsourcing that severely restrict the circumstances under which it can be contemplated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations (UN) has undertaken various reform efforts since its  creation in 1945.

In February 2004, we reported that those  reforms were progressing but that only about 50 percent were in place.  Despite the UN\u2019s efforts to improve its management processes, several  independent reports, such as the 2005 Independent Inquiry Committee\u2019s  investigation of the UN\u2019s Oil for Food program and the Gingrich-Mitchell  task force review in June 2005, found that inefficient UN management  operations persist. These reports highlighted the immediate need for  management reform given the growth in complexity and significance of  UN worldwide operations.

We reviewed reports and bulletins  published by the UN General Assembly and Secretariat, relevant UN  resolutions, and related budget documents. The majority of the cost  estimates for the proposed reform initiatives are preliminary, and detailed  cost estimates are being developed; therefore, we did not analyze the  assumptions underlying these estimates to determine whether they are  reasonable and reliable. We met with officials from the General Assembly  Office of the President, the Office of the Deputy Secretary-General, the  Departments of Management and Policy and Planning, the Office of  Program Planning and Budget, and the Office of Internal Oversight  Services (OIOS). We also met with representatives from several member  states. We discussed the status of UN management reforms with officials  from the Department of State in Washington, D.C. and New York City.

As one of the 192 member states, the United  States played a significant role in promoting UN reform, calling for  financial and administrative changes. The United States, through the  Department of State and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, continues  to take measures to advance reform of UN management processes.", "In 1997 and 2002, the Secretary-General proposed two separate sets of  management reform initiatives in the areas of human resources, budgeting,  and human rights. In July 1997, the Secretary-General proposed a broad  reform program to transform the UN into an efficient organization focused  on achieving results as it carried out its mandates. Although the Secretary- General does not have direct authority over specialized agencies and many  funds and programs, the reforms at the Secretariat were intended to serve  as a model for UN-wide reforms. In May 2000, we reported that while the  Secretary-General had substantially reorganized the Secretariat\u2019s  leadership and structure, he had not yet completed reforms in human  resource management and planning and budgeting. In September 2002, to  encourage the full implementation of the 1997 reforms, the Secretary- General released a second set of reform initiatives with 36 reform actions,  some expanding on previous reform initiatives introduced in 1997 and  others reflecting new priorities for the organization. In February 2004, we  reported that 60 percent of the 88 reform initiatives in the 1997 agenda and  38 percent of the 66 initiatives in the 2002 agenda were in place.", "In 2004-2005, a series of UN and expert task force reports recommended  the need for comprehensive reform of UN management and the UN human  rights apparatus. These studies included a 2004 report of a high-level panel  convened by the Secretary-General to recommend ways to strengthen the  UN, a March 2005 Secretary-General report to the General Assembly, a  June 2005 report by a task force mandated by the U.S. Congress to  recommend how to improve the effectiveness of the organization, as well  as several reports of the Independent Inquiry Committee established to  investigate the Oil for Food Program.", "In September 2005, world leaders gathered at the UN World Summit in  New York City to discuss global issues such as UN reform, development,  and human rights, as well as actions needed in each of these areas. The  outcome document from the World Summit, endorsed by all members of  the UN, outlines broad UN reform efforts in areas such as oversight and  accountability, and human rights. The document also called for the  Secretary-General to submit proposals for implementing reforms to  improve the management functions of the Secretariat.", "In April 2006, we reported on weaknesses in the UN\u2019s internal oversight  unit and procurement system, both of which have been identified as  important areas for reform. In the internal oversight area, we found that  UN funding arrangements adversely affect OIOS\u2019s budgetary independence  and compromise the office\u2019s ability to audit high-risk areas. For example,  OIOS depends on the resources of the funds, programs, and other entities  it audits, and the managers of these programs can deny OIOS permission  to perform work or not pay OIOS for services. In the procurement area, we  found that UN procurement resources are vulnerable to fraud, waste, and  abuse because of weaknesses affecting the control environment. For  example, the UN has not established a single organizational entity or  mechanism capable of effectively and comprehensively managing  procurement. In addition, the UN has not demonstrated a commitment to  improving the professionalism of its procurement staff in the form of  training, a career development path, or other key human capital practices  critical to attracting, developing, and retaining a qualified professional  workforce.", "The management reform decision-making process at the UN involves  multiple entities. Member states or the Secretary-General can introduce  management reform initiatives at the UN. The Secretary-General can  implement certain management improvements that are within his  authority. In addition, the Secretary-General submits proposals to the  General Assembly.  In these cases, the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), a subsidiary organ of  the General Assembly, reviews the proposal. The ACABQ then advises and  reports to the Administrative and Budgetary Committee (the Fifth  Committee), the General Assembly\u2019s committee for administrative and  budgetary matters that is composed of all 192 member states. The Fifth  Committee holds discussions on the proposals and makes its  recommendation to the General Assembly. The General Assembly makes  the final decision.

The vote signified the breakdown of the policy of making  decisions by consensus, a practice used for 20 years. Further, the United  States expressed concern that the G-77\u2019s proposal was a way to scale back  the reforms proposed in the Secretary-General\u2019s March 2006 report.

In July 2006, member states approved a resolution  that, according to UN officials and member state representatives, was a  positive step toward addressing several management reform initiatives.  The status of several reforms to improve the management operations of  the Secretariat is as follows:    Since the Secretary-General has limited authority to shift resources  between programs without the approval of the member states, the  Secretary-General in his March 2006 report noted that more flexibility in  this area could enable the Secretariat to respond more effectively to the  changing needs of the organization. In July 2006, the General Assembly  gave the Secretary-General, on an experimental basis, limited discretion  over budgetary commitments up to $20 million per biennium. The impact  of this reform will be reviewed in 2009.", "According to the Secretary-General, the UN has outdated and fragmented  information technology systems that have limited capacity for processing  and sharing data. Moreover, at least six departments have disparate  information technology units with no integrating mechanism in place. The  Secretary-General\u2019s March 2006 report recommended the creation of a  chief information technology officer position to oversee the creation and  implementation of an information management strategy for the  Secretariat. In July 2006, the General Assembly agreed to create the  position of a chief information technology officer and upgrade certain  elements of the UN\u2019s computer systems. In addition, the Secretary- General\u2019s information technology detailed report did not include a  comprehensive implementation plan for this proposal.

However, the report does not specify milestones that need to be  completed during the 18 months. The General Assembly is expected to  discuss this report in fall 2006. In the meantime, in July 2006, the General  Assembly authorized funding of approximately $700,000, which UN  officials plan to use for six new temporary procurement positions for 6  months. However, according to a senior U.S. official, these temporary  posts are not sufficient to address weaknesses in the procurement system,  and qualified procurement officers are not likely to accept temporary jobs.

In December 2005, the General Assembly  approved the creation of the committee and requested an external  evaluation of the proposed terms of reference.

In addition, the evaluation  recommended that the committee be responsible for presenting the budget  for OIOS to the Fifth Committee, thereby relieving the ACABQ of its  advisory role in this regard.", "The July 2006 external evaluation included a detailed review of OIOS that  found that OIOS is not able to function effectively under its current  mandate and made 23 recommendations in nine areas to strengthen its  capacity. The external review stated that OIOS\u2019s current structure is  impeding its independence and reducing its effectiveness. It also stated  that OIOS should focus on internal auditing and recommended shifting  several OIOS functions, such as investigations, to departments in the  Secretariat. However, various UN and U.S. officials stated that a shift of  functions such as that proposed in the external review could significantly  diminish the UN\u2019s oversight functions and the independence of its  investigations. For example, these officials said that moving investigations  to the Secretariat could create a potential conflict of interest. However,  according to UN Secretariat officials, the Secretariat has a positive view of  the results of the independent external review and supports most of the  recommendations, and not all UN Secretariat officials view the proposed  recommendation as a way to diminish the UN\u2019s oversight functions or the  independence of its investigations.

Since January 2006, the office\u2019s six interim staff  members have developed and implemented activities associated with the  ethics office\u2019s four areas of responsibility: (1) administering the UN\u2019s  financial disclosure program, (2) implementing the new UN whistleblower  protection policy, (3) providing guidance to staff on ethics issues, and (4)  developing ethics standards and training. For example, the interim staff  members have undertaken preliminary reviews of claims of retaliation for  whistleblowing and have collected financial disclosure forms from UN  managers. As the office is new and in the process of hiring permanent  staff, it is too early to determine whether the office will be able to fully  carry out its mandate. See figure 3 for key dates associated with the  establishment of the ethics office.", "Before creating the ethics office, the UN Secretariat did not have a way to  coordinate ethics-related initiatives within the organization and to ensure  that all staff are aware of and updated on ethics issues. The 2005 outcome  document specifically requested that the Secretary-General develop a  detailed proposal for an independent ethics office. The Secretary-General  developed and submitted this proposal in November 2005, and the General  Assembly approved it in December 2005. The ethics office began operating  in January 2006 as an independent entity reporting directly to the  Secretary-General and by March 2006 it was staffed with one director, four  staff members, and a consultant, all temporarily assigned to the office.  These staff have been establishing and documenting the procedures the  office follows in carrying out its duties. The UN is in the process of hiring  permanent staff to replace the interim staff. The office has four main areas  of responsibility and has made some progress in fulfilling each as follows:    The ethics office is responsible for administering the UN\u2019s financial  disclosure program to ensure that staff comply with applicable conflict of  interest rules and standards of conduct. Designated UN staff\u2014 those at  and above the director level and all staff carrying out procurement and  investment functions\u2014are required to file an annual confidential  statement of their financial interests. This policy applies to about 1,800 UN  staff and as of July 31, 2006, the ethics office had received 90 percent of  their financial disclosure statements. The ethics office is currently  reviewing bids from contractors to carry out the review and audit of these  forms. The Secretariat recommended that the review be conducted by  independent financial experts, as is the practice at the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), to safeguard the confidentiality of  senior officials\u2019 private financial information. The ethics office will keep  these financial disclosure forms confidential, but a report by a panel of  experts reviewing the UN\u2019s internal justice system recommended that the  office maintain the forms in a public register.", "The ethics office is implementing the UN\u2019s new whistleblower protection  policy, which took effect in January 2006. When a staff member contacts  the ethics office with a complaint that he or she has been retaliated against  for reporting misconduct, the office conducts a preliminary review to  determine if the case should move forward for formal investigation by  OIOS. The ethics office staff review the evidence presented by the  claimant, interview the party accused of retaliation, and talk to other staff  involved. If the ethics office determines that the case is an interpersonal  problem within a particular office, rather than a case of retaliation for  whistleblowing, it advises the staff member concerned of the existence of  the Office of the Ombudsman and other informal conflict resolution  mechanisms within the organization. If a case of retaliation is established  after investigation by OIOS, the ethics office takes into account any  recommendations made by OIOS and recommends appropriate measures  aimed at correcting the negative consequences suffered as a result of the  retaliatory action. As of July 31, 2006, the office had received 45  complaints of retaliation for reporting misconduct, one of which they  submitted for further investigation. Ethics office staff told us that they  track all whistleblowing complaints that are brought to their attention,  including those referred to other offices. Staff also said that the time they  spend on each case of whistleblower retaliation varies from several hours  to more than 45 days.", "As part of its regular duties, the ethics office provides confidential  guidance to staff on ethics issues. To fulfill this responsibility, the ethics  office operates an ethics helpline to answer questions from and provide  advice to UN staff. UN staff have used the helpline to make whistleblower  retaliation complaints. Staff can also contact the office in person, by mail  or e-mail, or by fax.", "The ethics office is responsible for developing ethics standards and  content for training, which all UN staff will be expected to take annually,  and it is working to provide clear guidance to staff on ethics regulations,  rules, and standards. The Office of Human Resources Management, in  consultation with the ethics office staff, has developed a half-day ethics  workshop for all staff and has worked to ensure that ethics issues are  incorporated into courses on other topics, such as procurement. The  ethics office has developed an intranet site for UN staff that provides  general information about the office as well as UN ethics issues and  standards.", "While the interim staff in the ethics office have been undertaking activities  consistent with their responsibilities, questions have been raised about the  capacity of this office to fulfill its mandate. One nongovernmental  organization said the UN\u2019s whistleblower protection policy created a new  benchmark for such policies in other intergovernmental organizations,  such as the World Bank and IMF. However, it questioned the UN\u2019s  implementation of the policy, citing the low number of staff in the ethics  office and the amount of time it is taking to conduct preliminary reviews  of whistleblower retaliation cases. In addition, in a report endorsed by a  UN staff union, a commission of experts criticized the UN\u2019s  implementation of the whistleblower protection policy and made several  recommendations that, if adopted, would change the responsibilities and  structure of the ethics office. The U.S. Permanent Representative to the  UN has also cited the UN staff union\u2019s concerns about the capacity of the  ethics office to fulfill its responsibilities.", "The appropriate number of staff assigned to the ethics office has been in  question since the office\u2019s inception. The Secretariat originally requested  funding for 16 staff positions for the ethics office, including liaison posts in  UN offices in Vienna, Nairobi, and Geneva, to provide the office with  greater proximity to the two-thirds of UN employees located in field  offices around the world. However, the General Assembly, following the  recommendation of the ACABQ, approved funding for only six positions,  with no posts in the field. The ACABQ reported that the office could  operate with fewer staff than requested, given the office\u2019s uncertain  workload at its inception, and that its workload would be reduced after  the initial work of developing standards and training was complete. The  Special Advisor to the Secretary-General for the ethics office, who is  overseeing the new office, stated that the number of staff assigned to the  office is currently appropriate. The interim staff said that the office needs  more resources, particularly additional staff, given its number of  responsibilities and activities. A representative from a nongovernmental  organization with expertise in whistleblower protection also stated that  the ethics office has too few resources to carry out its duties. In addition,  the panel of experts commissioned by a UN staff union to review the UN\u2019s  internal justice system stated that it is critical that the ethics office be  given adequate resources, including representation in the UN\u2019s regional  offices, to fulfill its responsibilities.

The UN does not have a  system for regularly evaluating the effectiveness of its mandates, which  make up its main body of work. The General Assembly, Economic and  Social Council, and the Security Council each adopt new mandates every  year on many of the same issues, which can lead to interrelated and  overlapping mandates.

Member states did not establish milestones for this review, but said it  should be completed by 2006. In March 2006, the Secretary-General issued  a report that provided a framework for conducting this review, including a  recommendation to conduct the review in two phases, and compiled an  electronic inventory of about 9,000 total mandates, over 6,900 of which are  older than 5 years, originating from the three principal UN organs\u2014the  General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the Security  Council. The General Assembly, which has responsibility for about 80  percent of the mandates, began discussions on the mandate review  process in November 2005 and started substantive discussions on specific  mandates in April 2006. The Security Council and Economic and Social  Council began their respective reviews in May 2006. During these  discussions, countries and groups of countries made proposals on the  process for the review and on how to handle specific mandates. For  example, one country proposed that the mandate review process involve  roundtable discussions and informal debates. Another proposal, with  regard to a specific mandate, was to consolidate the Secretariat\u2019s working  papers on individual and small island territories. During the discussions,  some countries requested more information from the Secretariat on  certain mandates, such as how one mandate might be duplicative of  another, or which UN departments or entities are involved in  implementing each mandate.", "Throughout the review process, member states have disagreed about  which mandates to include in the review and what to do with any savings  generated by the potential elimination or consolidation of mandates,  which has led to slow and limited progress. Members of the G-77 contend  that the scope of the review should include only those mandates older  than 5 years that have not been renewed since they were adopted. This  represents about 626 mandates, or 7 percent of the total number of  mandates (see fig. 5). The United States and other developed countries,  including Japan, Australia, Canada, and the European Union, argue that  the review should include all mandates older than 5 years, whether or not  they have been renewed. Using these criteria, the review would include an  additional 6,347 mandates.", "The G-77 established several criteria under which it would consider  reviewing mandates that are older than 5 years: (1) member states must  first agree that any savings derived from the mandate review will be  reinvested in the areas from which they were derived, or in UN activities in  the development area and (2) all politically sensitive mandates must be  excluded from the review process. The United States has stated that a  decision about the use of cost savings from the mandate review should be  made once the review is complete. In addition, the United States maintains  that no mandates older than 5 years, including those that are controversial,  should be excluded from the review.", "Despite disagreement on which General Assembly mandates to review,  member states decided in June 2006 to move forward with the first phase,  which consists of reviewing 399 mandates that are older than 5 years and  have not been renewed within the last 5 years.

Mandates in phase one include completed projects, such as a 1965  resolution requesting that the Secretary-General convene a conference on  the World Food Program. Although most of the mandates in this category  do not require any further action or resources from the UN, member states  could only agree to set aside 74 of them, which they classified as  completed, meaning they have been acted upon and completely  implemented and do not require further action at this time. Additionally,  they decided that 33 mandates are not applicable to the review.

The proposal  suggests that member states reallocate within the UN budget any savings  from mandate review according to normal budgetary procedures and that  they reinvest any savings from development activities into other  development activities. In addition, the proposal recommends that  member states agree to address politically sensitive mandates carefully  and take into account the positions of member states concerned.

UN member states generally agreed  that the Commission on Human Rights should be improved as it was no  longer seen as a credible institution for protecting human rights, due to a  number of weaknesses. For example, according to human rights  organizations, countries known to be human rights violators were  consistently selected for membership to the commission and used their  membership to protect themselves against criticism of their human rights  records. Furthermore, the commission did not criticize the actions of  several countries that were found to be abusers of human rights, including  Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Zimbabwe. As a result, the member states agreed  at the 2005 World Summit to create a new Human Rights Council that  would improve upon these deficiencies. UN member states voted to  establish the council in March 2006 and elected members in May 2006.  (See fig. 6 for key dates for the Human Rights Council.)", "In establishing the new Human Rights Council, UN member states aimed  to address some of the deficiencies in the 53-member Commission on  Human Rights. The 47 members of the new council must be elected  individually to the body by a majority of UN members. Previously,  candidates were grouped into slates of countries representing regions, and  members would vote on the entire slate rather than for an individual  country on the slate. The United States sought a significantly smaller body  and advocated that to gain membership on the council, members should  be elected by the higher standard of a two-thirds majority, rather than an  absolute majority, to make it more difficult for repressive countries that  have not demonstrated a commitment to human rights to gain seats on the  council. Members can now be suspended from the council by a two-thirds  majority vote if they are found to have committed gross violations of  human rights. When voting for candidates to the council, UN member  states are instructed to take into account each country\u2019s human rights  record, a measure that was not called for when voting for candidates to  the commission. The United States wanted to automatically exclude from  council membership any country under Security Council sanctions, but  that provision was not included in the final design of the body. When  elections to the council were held in May 2006, several countries with  questionable human rights records were elected, including China, Russia,  and Cuba. However, other countries that previously served on the  commission and have questionable human rights records did not even run  for election, including Zimbabwe, Sudan, and North Korea. In addition,  Iran campaigned for a seat on the Council but did not win.", "The Human Rights Council will also operate differently from the  commission. The council will meet more frequently and can more readily  call special sessions to address emerging human rights situations than  could the commission. The council will meet at least three times a year for  a total of 10 weeks, while the commission met once a year for a total of 6  weeks. Furthermore, the council is required to periodically review the  human rights records of all UN member states, a procedure the  commission lacked. Members of the council will be the first to undergo  these reviews and will be required to cooperate with investigators. The  council is currently developing the procedures it will follow when  conducting the reviews. Finally, member states made the council a  subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, elevating it from the  commission\u2019s status as part of the Economic and Social Council.", "While the United States voted against the creation of the new Human  Rights Council, stating that it did not sufficiently improve upon the former  commission, many nongovernmental organizations and other UN members  have stated that the council is better equipped than the commission was to  address urgent, serious, and long-running human rights situations around  the world. Of the UN member states participating in the vote on the  creation of the council, 170 voted in favor, while 4 voted against. The  United States did not run for election to the body but has agreed to  provide funding for it. Representatives from one group of member states  said that they were disappointed the United States did not run for election  because it was important to have the United States on the council from its  inception, to show support for the new body. The council meets in Geneva  and met for the first time in June 2006 and a second time in September  2006. It plans to meet again in November 2006.

Further, according to several UN and  member state officials, most developed countries view management  reform as a way to increase organizational effectiveness, whereas the G-77  countries perceive that developed countries view certain reform  initiatives, such as mandate review, as cost-cutting exercises. Moreover,  UN officials and member state representatives told us that a disagreement  over a 6-month spending cap served to unify the G-77 countries and  weaken the cohesion between developed countries. According to UN and  member state representatives, the budget cap initially served to focus  attention on the need to make progress on the reform initiatives. However,  according to member state representatives, the spending cap made it more  difficult to reach consensus on management reforms. On June 30, 2006, the  General Assembly decided to lift the spending cap.

Member states disagree on some of the specifics of the  reforms in areas such as the review of programs and activities and the  details for creating the Human Rights Council, as discussed earlier, as well  as the role of the Deputy Secretary-General. For example, two  independent studies recommended the creation of a chief operating officer  position and the Secretary-General\u2019s March 2006 report recommended that  the Deputy Secretary-General assume formal authority and accountability  for the management and overall direction of the Secretariat\u2019s operations.  However, the spokesperson for the G-77 countries has stated in the Fifth  Committee and in the General Assembly that, according to the UN charter,  the Secretary-General is the UN\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer and thus  responsible for the organization\u2019s management. In May 2006, the General  Assembly passed a resolution that noted that the function of the post of  Deputy Secretary-General should not diminish the role or responsibilities  of the Secretary-General.  The resolution further noted that the overall  responsibility for management of the Organization rests with the  Secretary-General.

However, many UN  proposals we reviewed that are related to management reform do not  include specific time frames. For example, although a senior U.S. official  said that the July 2006 resolution is a positive step toward implementation  of certain reforms, he noted that the section on oversight does not provide  concrete actions.  In addition, the resolution does not include specific time  frames for implementing a fully operational ethics office or the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee. Without establishing deadlines, it  is difficult to hold managers accountable for completing reform efforts.  Moreover, without comprehensive implementation plans, the total  budgetary implications of the reform efforts are not clear.", "The UN has not developed or refined cost estimates for many of the  initiatives, including improving certain field staff benefits and conditions  to mirror those of headquarters staff; increasing investments in human  resource development; introducing a new information communications  technology system; and approving a staff buyout program. However, the  Secretary-General has developed preliminary cost estimates for three key  initiatives that alone could cost over $500 million\u2014the proposed new  information communications technology system ($120 million over several  years), a one-time staff buyout ($50 to $100 million), and efforts to  improve field staff benefits ($280 million annually). Moreover, the UN  Secretariat said that these estimates will require further assessments  before reliable estimates and a plan of action can be determined. Without  determining cost estimates, it is difficult to ensure that financing will be  available when needed.", "Likewise, the UN has not yet developed savings estimates because certain  initiatives will require further assessment and then approval by the  General Assembly. The Secretary-General anticipates that the costs for the  reforms could be offset by savings from efforts such as relocation and  outsourcing and the long-term benefits of a more efficiently run  organization. However, the UN has not yet produced any concrete savings  estimates, and efforts to produce savings have faced significant  challenges. For instance, the Secretary-General said that the cost could be  partially offset by savings in procurement reform. However, UN officials  said that the UN Secretariat has not yet developed firm procurement  savings estimates. In addition, proposals to streamline the way in which  the organization delivers its services, which may result in savings, have  experienced resistance from member states and staff members. In May  2006, the G-77 did not authorize the Secretary-General to conduct a cost- benefit analysis of his proposal to relocate translation, editing, and  document production services. Public documents do not specify the  G-77\u2019s reason for not allowing a cost-benefit analysis to be undertaken.  Further, the outsourcing of internal printing and publishing processes  could generate savings but, according to UN officials, it could also face  challenges from member states and staff to implement.", "To develop or refine cost and savings estimates, the Secretariat is  conducting cost-benefit analyses and assessments in areas such as the  proposed new information communications technology system,  outsourcing and relocation, staff buyout, and public access to UN  information.

However, some of the cost-benefit analyses and assessments  will not be available until March 2007 for member states to consider, and  these will have a bearing on the overall reform package and, ultimately,  the total cost of the reform. To date, the additional cost to member states  to implement certain management reform initiatives has been about $40  million, which primarily reflects start-up costs for efforts such as the  adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards, the new  ethics office, additional costs for the new Human Rights Council, and an  increase to the working capital fund (see table 2).

According to the Secretary-General, the existing human  resources management framework was designed for a stable, largely  headquarters-based environment, and currently more than half of the UN\u2019s  30,000 staff members are serving in the field. The Secretary-General also  said that the Secretariat\u2019s increasingly complex mandates require a new  skills profile that will enable it to respond in an integrated way to new  needs in diverse areas such as peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance.  In addition, salaries and other human resource costs comprise almost 80  percent of the UN regular budget. As such, UN officials state that it would  be impossible to achieve meaningful management reform without  reforming human resources. The Secretary-General has proposed several  human resource reforms, such as a staff buyout, replacing permanent  contracts with open-ended appointments, better integration of staff  worldwide, and outsourcing. However, administrative guidance may  complicate the process of implementing some initiatives, such as:  In September 2005, member states agreed to consider a proposal from the  Secretary-General for a one-time staff buyout. According to the Secretary- General, to target staff for buyout the UN Secretariat must analyze and  determine the skills needed in the organization, taking into account  proposed reform efforts such as relocation of work, outsourcing, and  mandate review. Staff performing administrative functions that are  targeted for outsourcing may be offered a buyout if their skills are no  longer needed by the UN. The Secretary-General must also conduct  consultations with UN staff representatives. UN officials said that it may  be difficult for the Secretary-General, staff representatives, and member  states to agree on the skills required to realign staff with the UN\u2019s  priorities. In addition, some of the cost-benefit analyses for the relocation  and outsourcing initiatives will not be completed until March 2007.", "The UN Secretariat is developing a more integrated approach for staff to  serve worldwide.

According to the  Secretary-General, staff are not sufficiently mobile, and their movement is  hampered by multiple and restrictive mandates.", "The Secretary-General proposed the integration of field and headquarters  staff into one global Secretariat with competitive conditions of service.  This would include changing the staff rules to create one staff contract to  mirror that of headquarters staff. Based on a study prepared in January  2006 by the International Civil Service Commission for the General  Assembly, this proposed integration raises a number of complicated  policy questions that will need to be addressed, including long-term  contractual obligations, cost implications related to differences in the  compensation packages, distortion of geographical distribution and  gender balance, and complications for merit-based, transparent, and open  selection procedures.", "Further, according to UN officials, proposals to reconsider a change in the  way the UN delivers its services by relocating and outsourcing certain  headquarters functions may meet with resistance from some member  states and staff as jobs may be lost. According to the Secretary-General,  the General Assembly established a number of conditions for outsourcing  that severely restrict the circumstances under which it can be  contemplated.
