This report reviews (1) the number and ownership of various media outlets; (2) the level of minority- and women-owned broadcast outlets; (3) the influence of economic, legal and regulatory, and technological factors on the number and ownership of media outlets; and (4) stakeholders' opinions on modifying certain media ownership laws and regulations. GAO conducted case studies of 16 randomly sampled markets, stratified by population. GAO also interviewed officials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Department of Commerce, trade associations, and the industry. Finally, GAO reviewed FCC's forms, processes, and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The numbers of media outlets and owners of media outlets generally increase with the size of the market; markets with large populations have more television and radio stations and newspapers than less populated markets. Additionally, diverse markets have more outlets operating in languages other than English, contributing to a greater number of outlets. Some companies participate in operating agreements wherein two or more media outlets might, for example, share content. As such, these agreements may suggest that the number of independently owned media outlets might not always be a good indicator of how many independently produced local news and other programs are available in a market. Finally, the Internet is expanding access to media content and competition. On a biennial basis, FCC collects data on the gender, race, and ethnicity of broadcast owners to, according to FCC, position itself and the Congress to assess the need for, and success of, programs to foster minority and women ownership. However, these data suffer from three weaknesses: (1) exemptions from filing for certain types of broadcast stations, (2) inadequate data quality procedures, and (3) problems with data storage and retrieval. These weaknesses limit the benefits of this data collection effort. While reliable government data are lacking, available evidence suggests that ownership of broadcast outlets by minorities and women is limited. Several barriers contribute to the limited levels of ownership by these groups, including a lack of easy access to sufficient capital. A variety of economic, legal and regulatory, and technological factors influence media ownership. Two economic factors--high fixed costs and the size of the market--appear to influence the number of media outlets in a market, the incentive to consolidate, and the prevalence of operating agreements. By limiting the number and types of media outlets that a company can own, various laws and regulations affect the ownership of media outlets. Technological factors, such as the emergence of the Internet, have facilitated entry for new companies, thereby increasing the amount of content and competition. Stakeholders expressed varied opinions on modifications to media ownership rules. Most business stakeholders expressing an opinion on various media ownership rules were more likely to report that the rules should be relaxed or repealed. In contrast, nonbusiness stakeholders who expressed an opinion on the rules were more likely to report that the rules should be left in place or strengthened. Both business and nonbusiness stakeholders who expressed an opinion on a previously repealed tax certificate program supported either reinstating or expanding the program to encourage the sale of broadcast outlets to minorities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The media play an important role in educating and entertaining the public  and fostering an informed citizenry.

Whereas most citizens were formerly limited to a newspaper or  newspapers in their local area, citizens today with an Internet connection  can read publications from around the world.", "Given the vital role of the media in American life, the ownership of media  outlets has been a long-standing concern of the Congress. The Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) regulates many aspects of the media  industry, including radio and television stations and cable and satellite  service. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), the Congress  required that FCC periodically review its broadcast ownership rules. In  2003, FCC released an order that altered its existing broadcast ownership  rules. This order generated significant public debate, and more than  500,000 comments were filed with FCC. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Third Circuit affirmed some of FCC\u2019s rule changes while remanding others  for further justification or modification. In response to the court\u2019s  decision and the congressional mandate for periodic review of its rules,  FCC opened another proceeding to assess its broadcast ownership rules.  This proceeding also attracted significant attention from both the public  and the Congress, with concerns arising about the level of consolidation in  the media industry. On February 4, 2008, FCC released a rule concluding  its latest review of the broadcast ownership rules.", "While today\u2019s media environment provides the public with numerous  programming choices from across the country, media outlets in local  markets remain a concern for policymakers. With cable and satellite  service, the public can receive programming from nationwide outlets, such  as CNN and FOX News, and television stations in adjacent markets.  However, media outlets located in a market are more likely to provide  local news, public affairs, and political programming addressing the needs  of residents in that market, such as coverage of local political campaigns,  compared to nationwide and adjacent-market outlets. Reflecting the  importance of local media outlets, localism is one of FCC\u2019s three policy  goals for media ownership, along with competition and diversity.", "You asked us to examine the current status of media ownership.

See appendix III for a complete list of individuals and  organizations that we interviewed. To assess the number and ownership of  media outlets, we conducted case studies in 16 Nielsen Designated Market  Areas (DMA). To select the 16 case study markets, we used a stratified  random sample methodology: we (1) randomly selected 4 case study  markets from each of 3 market strata (large, medium, and small), (2)  selected the 3 largest markets as a separate stratum, and (3) judgmentally  selected 1 market from the medium-size category to test our data  collection and structured interview methodology. The 16 markets that we  analyzed include approximately 20 percent of all television households in  the United States. In each case study market, we identified the number of  television and radio stations, newspapers (daily and weekly), and cable  and satellite television operators present in the central city of the DMA.

FCC noted  that it was appropriate to develop \u201cprecise information on minority and  female ownership of mass media facilities\u201d and \u201cannual information on the  state and progress of minority and female ownership,\u201d thereby positioning  \u201cboth Congress and the Commission to assess the need for, and success of,  programs to foster opportunities for minorities and females to own  broadcast facilities.\u201d FCC began collecting these data in 1999.", "The Form 323 is the only mechanism through which FCC collects  information on the gender, race, and ethnicity of broadcast owners. FCC  requires all commercial AM and FM radio stations and television stations  to report the gender, race, and ethnicity of each owner with an attributable  interest on the Form 323. Owners and licensees must file the Form 323  every 2 years, whenever there is a transfer of control or assignment, or  after the grant of a construction permit for a new commercial broadcast  station.", "As FCC\u2019s only information source on owners\u2019 gender, race, and ethnicity,  the Form 323 data potentially could be used to determine and periodically  report on the level of minority and women broadcast ownership. However,  we identified several weaknesses that limit the usefulness of the Form 323  data.", "Filing exemptions. Sole proprietors, partnerships, and noncommercial  stations are not required to file the Form 323. Since the data from Form  323 do not include stations owned by sole proprietors, partnerships, or  noncommercial stations, it is not possible to use the Form 323 data to  identify either the full universe of broadcast stations owned by minorities  and women or the number of minority and women owners. FCC also does  not require the filing of the Form 323 for low-power stations.", "Data quality procedures. According to FCC officials, FCC does not  verify or periodically review the gender, race, and ethnicity data submitted  on the Form 323. According to these officials, a staff person from FCC\u2019s  Video Division reviews submitted Form 323s and this staff person focuses  on ensuring compliance with the commission\u2019s multiple ownership and  citizen ownership rules. These officials told us that station owners were  responsible for determining the accuracy of their Form 323 submissions.  Should an error be found by the owner, FCC requires the owner to submit  an additional Form 323.", "Data storage and retrieval. Companies must file the Form 323  electronically. However, FCC allows owners to provide attachments with  their electronic filing of the Form 323. These attachments may include the  gender, race, and ethnicity data. Since these data are not entered into the  database, the data are unavailable for electronic query. Of further concern,  the database retains all submitted Form 323s, even forms that contain  incorrect information and have since been updated with a corrected Form  323. Thus, any aggregation or summary of the Form 323 records through  electronic query is unreliable according to FCC officials.", "FCC has taken some steps to address concerns with the Form 323 data,  but overall some weaknesses remain. According to FCC officials, FCC  added an amendment process to the Form 323 interface, thereby allowing  owners to modify information on a previously submitted Form 323. FCC  also put in place edit checks that preclude owners from skipping  questions, including questions on the owners\u2019 gender, race, and ethnicity.

According to the industry stakeholders and experts we  interviewed, the level of ownership by minorities and women is limited.  Recent studies generally support this conclusion. Three reports  commissioned by FCC as part of its broadcast ownership proceeding  found relatively limited levels of ownership of television and radio stations  by minorities and women. Further, in a 2006 report, Free Press found that  for full-power television stations, women and minority ownership was  about 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Specifically, the report noted  that women owned a majority stake in 67 of 1,349 full-power commercial  television stations and minorities owned 44 stations, 9 of which were  owned by one company. In another report, Free Press estimated that  women owned approximately 629 of 10,506 (or 6 percent) of full-power  radio stations and minorities owned 812 stations (or 8 percent) of full- power radio stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minorities and Women Encounter a Variety of Barriers to Ownership of Broadcast Outlets", "paragraphs": ["According to prior government reports and industry stakeholders and  experts we interviewed, three factors help explain the relatively small  percentages of minority and women broadcast owners.", "Scale of ownership. In 2000, FCC and the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA) released separate reports  suggesting that the current scale of ownership had been detrimental for  minority and women ownership of broadcast outlets. In 2000, FCC  commissioned a report that found industry deregulation in 1996 and the  resulting consolidation had produced significant barriers to new entry and  to the viability of small, minority- and women-owned companies. The  report cited inflated station prices and disparate advertising revenues.  NTIA\u2019s report included similar observations about the impact of  consolidation on station prices and advertising revenue.", "Industry representatives and experts we interviewed also identified the  scale of ownership as a barrier for minorities and women. Thirty-six of 56  interviewees who mentioned barriers to ownership reported that the  consolidation of broadcast ownership had been detrimental for minority  and women ownership. According to these industry representatives and  experts, the scale of current ownership mattered in several important  ways. First, few stations are made available for purchase, limiting  opportunities for the entry of new owners, such as minorities and women.  Second, incumbent owners may prefer to trade stations with other  incumbent owners rather than sell stations. Given the limited ownership  by minorities and women today, trading does little to expand their  ownership. Third, when stations become available for sale, investors and  other financing entities prefer multiple station purchases rather than  single station purchases in order to capture economies of scale. Like  trading, such transactions favor incumbent companies that are well- established over new entrants such as minorities and women. Lastly, the  scale of the industry affects the viability of current and prospective  minority and women owners, since these owners must often compete with  large conglomerate owners with sizable market share and greater  resources.", "Access to capital. Both FCC\u2019s and NTIA\u2019s reports on minority and  women ownership also included discussion and findings on the role of  capital and the lack thereof for minorities and women. According to FCC\u2019s  commissioned report, access to capital was the barrier most often cited by  study participants. The report found that banks often repeatedly rejected  minority broadcast owners as applicants for a variety of reasons, ranging  from racial discrimination to a lack of familiarity with the industry on the  part of the bank. Similarly, NTIA\u2019s report noted the importance of access  to capital and described public and private sources of financing for  minorities and women. The report concluded that despite these sources,  access to capital continued to be a key concern.", "Industry stakeholders and experts we interviewed also mentioned the  importance of access to capital and financing and the challenge it presents  to minority and women ownership. Thirty-five of 56 interviewees reported  that a lack of access to capital impeded greater entry by minorities and  women into the broadcast industry. In particular, these industry  representatives and experts described two ways in which the barrier  posed by a lack capital is compounded by the nature of station sales and  FCC rules. First, since stations generally do not advertise their properties  for sale, individuals and companies looking to purchase a station must  have cash on hand. Prospective buyers cannot wait for an announced sale  and then acquire financing. This is a challenge for minority and women  broadcasters, who often lack information on upcoming station sales and  generally have fewer financial resources. Second, sellers are deterred from  working with buyers who lack capital since any equity remaining in the  station would be considered attributable interest under FCC\u2019s rules.  Retaining attributable interest in one property could make it difficult for  these owners to buy different properties in the same market, due to FCC\u2019s  local ownership limits. Consequently, sellers would forgo working with  prospective buyers who lack readily available capital rather than assume  any risk to potential future acquisitions.", "Repeal of the tax certificate program. From 1978 to 1995, FCC  operated a tax certificate program under section 1071 of the Internal  Revenue Code that provided for the seller of a broadcast station to defer  capital gains taxes on the sale if the station was sold to a minority-owned  company. In 1995, the Congress repealed this program. During this period,  FCC issued a total of 328 tax certificates for use in broadcast station  transactions (285 for radio station sales and 43 for television station sales).  Both FCC\u2019s and NTIA\u2019s reports on minority and women ownership cited  the importance of the tax certificate as an incentive for incumbent  broadcast owners to advertise and work with prospective minority buyers.  FCC\u2019s commissioned report described the tax certificate program as the  \u201csingle most effective program in lowering market entry barriers and  providing opportunities for minorities to acquire broadcast licenses in the  secondary market.\u201d NTIA\u2019s report also found that the program fostered  minority ownership. Many experts we interviewed also agreed that this  program was important for promoting minority ownership. Twenty-five of  56 stakeholders we interviewed said that the elimination of the tax  certificate program was a factor in the current limited level of minority- owned broadcast stations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Variety of Economic, Legal and Regulatory, and Technical Factors Influence Media Ownership", "paragraphs": ["Economic factors\u2014including high fixed costs and the size of the market\u2014 influence the number of media outlets available in markets, the presence  of operating agreements between outlets, and incentives for firms to  consolidate their operations.

Fixed costs refer to those costs that do not change with the  number of units produced or sold. Fifty-two of 102 stakeholders we  interviewed mentioned that high fixed costs are a factor influencing media  ownership, and the academic literature also highlighted the importance of  fixed costs. For example, in broadcast network television, two  stakeholders reported that the fixed costs of producing 1 hour of  programming range from $3 million to $5 million\u2014regardless of how many  viewers the programming attracts. Similarly for newspapers, the costs of  purchasing a printing press and producing and editing news stories are not  very sensitive to the number of copies a newspaper produces or sells.  Stakeholders also reported high fixed costs for radio and television  stations, cable television, and DBS.", "The size of the local market also is an important economic factor  influencing the number and ownership of media outlets, since market size  broadly determines an outlet\u2019s potential for generating advertising  revenues. For example, several stakeholders reported that although the  costs of operating television and radio stations are similar regardless of  market size, smaller markets have smaller audiences and fewer local  advertisers for station operators to pursue. Accordingly, stakeholders  reported that owners are less likely to sell stations in large markets than in  smaller markets. According to data from Bear, Stearns and Company, Inc.,  4 of the 137 television station transactions announced in the first two  quarters of 2007 involved stations broadcasting in the top three markets.  Conversely, stakeholders representing a large radio group owner and a  national television broadcaster both reported that their companies are  currently selling stations in smaller markets.", "Both high fixed costs and market size have implications for the number of  outlets in a given market, the presence of operating agreements between  outlets, and incentives for firms to consolidate their operations in local  and national markets.", "Number of outlets. Market size and fixed costs influence the number of  outlets in a market. The size of the market broadly determines the  advertising revenues available to outlets in the market. In addition, costs  in the media industry do not vary considerably between large and small  markets. Therefore, large markets can generally support more outlets than  small markets. Twenty-six interviewed stakeholders mentioned that the  size of the market influences the number of outlets available, and 10  stakeholders reported that markets with larger populations and  advertising revenues can support more media outlets and owners than  smaller markets. For example, in New York\u2014the largest market\u2014we  identified 21 television stations and 15 separate owners for those stations.  In contrast, in Harrisonburg, Virginia\u2014the smallest market in our review\u2014 we identified only 2 broadcast television stations and 2 separate owners,  one of which was a public television station. Similarly, in the newspaper  industry, several stakeholders reported that most newspaper markets can  support only one daily newspaper because of high fixed costs in the  industry. Accordingly, 9 of the 16 markets we evaluated had one daily  newspaper, and 4 markets supported two newspapers.", "Operating agreements. The size of a local market and high fixed costs  produce incentives for media outlets to enter into operating agreements  with other local outlets. Specifically, we found that outlet owners in  markets with smaller advertising revenues have incentives to enter into  operating agreements with other outlets to spread fixed costs across  multiple outlets to maximize their profitability. Thirty interviewed  stakeholders reported that the size of the market can influence the need  for such operating agreements. In our case study analyses, we identified 9  operating agreements between 17 television stations in 5 markets.  We  found these arrangements in a variety of markets, but not in the top three  markets. It appears that medium-size markets are better suited to these  arrangements than small markets because they offer a larger pool of  potential outlet partners than would be available in smaller markets.  Furthermore, two stakeholders reported that these agreements may  increase the number of outlets available in a market by helping weaker  stations remain in operation and by bringing new broadcasting networks  into a market.", "Local and national consolidation. The combination of high fixed costs  and market size also encourages media consolidation both within local  markets and nationwide. Because competition for advertising revenues  among radio and television broadcast stations occurs at the local level,  nine stakeholders representing television, radio, and newspaper  companies reported that their industries have incentives to consolidate  operations across multiple outlets to reduce their fixed costs and claim a  larger share of available advertising revenues. For example, six  stakeholders reported that owning multiple stations in a local market  allows a single owner to program its stations with diverse formats to reach  a larger share of local listeners and provide multiple channels for  advertisers. Media firms likewise have incentives to seek economies of  scale and consolidate their operations nationally. For example,  stakeholders reported that the cable industry has consolidated in recent  years to cluster local systems into wider regional networks to reach larger  audiences and serve a wider range of advertisers. Stakeholders also  reported that serving a wider network of subscribers gives cable operators  greater leverage in negotiating agreements to carry programming  produced by broadcast and cable television networks.

Several stakeholders reported that the local television ownership limit\u2014 which permits ownership of two television stations in larger markets\u2014 allows over-the-air television stations to better compete with other media  outlets, including cable television and DBS providers, which have  significantly more channels and air time to sell advertising. Several other  stakeholders reported that this rule would be more beneficial if it were  permitted in smaller markets to preserve struggling outlets, rather than in  large markets where advertising revenues are greater.

On the other hand, three  companies owning both newspapers and television stations in the same  market reported that cross-ownership offers synergies such as improved  sharing of resources and information between outlets.

We stratified the DMAs by size and  randomly selected four large, four medium-size, and four small markets for  the case study analysis. We defined large markets as those with 500,000 to  3 million households; medium-size markets as those with 150,000 to  499,999 households; and small markets as those with fewer than 150,000  households. In addition to the 12 random selections, we selected the top  three markets (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago) as a separate take-all  stratum and selected Tucson as a test market in which to count outlets  because of its large Hispanic population.", "Within each market, we counted the number of television stations, radio  stations, newspapers, and multichannel video programming distributors  (MVPD) and the owners of these outlets. We considered outlets available  to residents in the largest city to avoid counting multiple outlets not  present throughout the market; outlets not counted primarily consist of  weekly suburban newspapers not published in the largest city.

This provided an accurate count of group ownership, as well as  identified any multiple station ownership within a single market.", "Radio stations. We first determined the largest city located within each  television market. Some selected case study markets had multiple core  cities; we used Miami for the Miami/Fort Lauderdale DMA, Scranton for  the Wilkes Barre/Scranton DMA, Florence for the Myrtle Beach/Florence  DMA, and Cedar Rapids for the Cedar Rapids/Waterloo/Iowa City/Dubuque  DMA. We used FCC data to determine the number of full-power  commercial and noncommercial radio stations located within close  listening distance of the city. Due to its large geographic area and sparse  population, we identified the four most populous counties in the  Sherman/Ada DMA and determined the number of radio stations located  within 20 miles of the largest town in each county. We adopted this  approach because the market is too small to have an Arbitron radio  market. The Sherman/Ada market also is located between the Oklahoma  City and Dallas/Fort Worth markets, so we used an atlas to ensure that the  radio stations located within 20 miles of Ada, Oklahoma, and Sherman,  Texas, both located on the geographical edge of the DMA, were physically  located inside the Sherman/Ada DMA.", "Our methodology produced counts of radio stations that may not match  the actual number of full-power radio stations located in a DMA for one or  both of the following reasons. First, the DMA may contain more than one  Arbitron radio market, such as in the Cedar Rapids/Waterloo/Iowa  City/Dubuque DMA and we counted radio stations from only one radio  market. Second, the DMA is geographically large and the number of full- power commercial and noncommercial radio stations located within close  listening distance of the core city does not capture all of the radio stations.", "Newspapers.

In addition to cable companies, we included both direct broadcast  satellite companies (DirecTV and EchoStar). The minimum MVPD count a  market could have with this methodology is three.

Additionally, we interviewed FCC officials responsible for collecting the  Commission\u2019s data on broadcast ownership about the completeness and  quality of the information in their databases.
