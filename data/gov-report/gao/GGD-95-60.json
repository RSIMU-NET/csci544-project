The law also prohibits issuing the credit guarantees for foreign aid, foreign policy, or debt-rescheduling purposes.", "More than $16 billion in export credit guarantees were provided by the GSM-102/103 programs during fiscal years (FY) 1990 through 1992. The former Soviet Union (FSU) and two of its successor states, Russia and Ukraine, received 43 percent of the guarantees that were made available in fiscal year 1992. During fiscal year 1991 and fiscal year 1992, the FSU obtained more GSM credit guarantees than any other country in the world.", "In deciding whether to extend GSM export credit guarantees to any country, USDA considers the prospects for developing and maintaining U.S. markets in that country, on the basis of our review of USDA documents and interviews with agency officials. Before providing guarantees, USDA also assesses the country\u2019s overall creditworthiness. Creditworthiness, in the context of this report, concerns a country\u2019s ability and willingness to service or make timely payments on its current and future foreign debt obligations.", "Assessing the creditworthiness of nations generally involves a technical analysis of economic and financial indicators of the risk of nonpayment due to insufficient foreign currency and the likelihood that political or other nonfinancial events may disrupt payments. Some of the factors that affect creditworthiness are a country\u2019s level of indebtedness relative to its economic and financial resources, the ability of the country\u2019s government to effectively manage the domestic economy, and the general economic and political situation in the country. Creditworthiness also involves temporal considerations. For example, some debtors may be judged not creditworthy over the short run due to a lack of readily available foreign exchange but may be considered capable of servicing their debts if additional time is allowed for them to organize and marshal their resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GSM Export Credit Guarantee Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Agriculture\u2019s GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs are aimed at facilitating the export of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries and middle-income countries with hard currency shortages. They are intended to help importing nations make a transition from concessional financing to cash purchases, as well as to maintain import levels during periods of financial difficulties.", "Under the two programs, the U.S. government agrees to pay U.S. exporters or their assignees\u2014U.S. banks or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks\u2014in the event that a foreign buyer defaults on its loan obligation. By reducing the risk involved in selling U.S. agricultural products, USDA encourages exporters to explore new foreign market opportunities.", "The USDA\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which administers the GSM programs, attempts to share some of the credit risk with the exporter or the exporter\u2019s assignee (a bank or other financial institution). It does so usually by guaranteeing 98 percent of the value of the sale plus a portion of the interest payable. The exporter or the exporter\u2019s assignee is at risk for 2 percent of the principal and a portion of the interest payable. However, CCC has flexibility to adjust the amount of guarantee coverage it provides. USDA considers the GSM programs to be fully \u201ccommercial\u201d in that they assist sales that are made by the private sector, and the interest rates are at \u201cprevailing market levels.\u201d However, there is an important element of concessionality in the programs because recipient countries could not make the purchases without credit and loan guarantees. Furthermore, if the countries were able to obtain financing on commercial markets, they would have to pay a premium above the rates that they obtain from the GSM programs, since a U.S. government guarantee reduces the risk to the lender."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Debt-Servicing Requirements and Possible Budgetary Impacts", "paragraphs": ["Section 202(f) of the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from issuing export credit guarantees in connection with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such a sale. The provision was established in response to a situation that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990 when creditworthiness considerations were minimized for foreign policy objectives in order to provide Iraq with GSM export credit guarantees. Following the allied response to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Iraq defaulted on outstanding guaranteed GSM loans. As of August 17, 1994, CCC had received claims from 10 banks regarding Iraq\u2019s defaults. These claims totaled about $2.2 billion, and CCC had paid claims to nine of these banks, totaling $1.7 billion.", "Section 202 (f) requires USDA to determine whether a country is capable of servicing the debt that would result from providing export credit guarantees for agricultural commodities. If a determination is negative, the provision prohibits USDA from making credit guarantees available to that country. USDA advised us that before making any loan guarantee commitments, it assesses the creditworthiness of intended recipients of guaranteed sales and uses the information in deciding whether to provide guarantees to specific countries.", "In contrast to a direct loan, a credit guarantee does not involve dollar outlays to either the lender or the borrower when the loan is made. Nonetheless, budgetary outlays are required for loan guarantees when defaults occur and claims are made. To better account for the costs of federal credit programs, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 required, beginning with fiscal year 1992, that the President\u2019s budget reflect the costs of the loan guarantee programs. To this end, new loan guarantee commitments can be undertaken only if appropriations of budget authority are made to cover their costs, including estimated payments by the government to cover defaults and delinquencies.", "The act exempted all then-existing CCC credit guarantee programs from the appropriations requirement. However, CCC advised us that it is establishing what it calls an \u201callowance reserve\u201d to cover its estimate of possible defaults on GSM loans. As of June 30, 1992, CCC had approximately $9.04 billion outstanding in GSM-102 and 103 guarantees on loan principal and $4.51 billion in accounts receivable from loan guarantee payouts on delinquent GSM-102 and 103 guaranteed loans.

Principal recipients of guarantees were often countries that had significant foreign policy relationships with the United States. However, the 1990 Farm Bill stipulated that GSM export credit guarantees could not be used for foreign aid, foreign policy, or debt-rescheduling purposes. So, for example, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines under the debt-servicing requirement that a country cannot adequately service the debt that would arise from receiving agricultural export credit guarantees, no credits are to be extended\u2014even if the president believes that such an extension would be in the national interest.", "Despite the problems that arose from the Iraqi loan guarantees, as cited earlier, many Members of Congress have expressed the view that GSM credit guarantee decisions should take account of foreign policy and national interest considerations. For example, in May 1991 the Senate approved a nonbinding resolution (S. Res. 117) recommending that the administration extend another $1.5 billion in agricultural credit guarantees to the Soviet Union\u2014assuming the administration found the country could service the debt\u2014if certain foreign policy objectives would also be realized.", "In 1991, attempts were made to provide more flexibility in granting export credit guarantees; amendments to the 1990 Farm Bill were proposed that would have allowed the president to provide guarantees when he believes they are in the national interest, regardless of the debt-servicing requirement and foreign aid/policy restrictions. However, these amendments were subsequently withdrawn. Similarly, the administration\u2019s 1992 bill for authorizing assistance to the former Soviet republicsincluded a provision allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to take into account major economic reforms underway in those states in making a determination about the ability of the states to repay debt associated with GSM sales. However, this provision was struck from the bill that Congress passed in October 1992.", "USDA officials told us that although the 1990 Farm Bill prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from issuing export credit guarantees for foreign aid or foreign policy purposes, the law does not mean that such assistance cannot simultaneously serve foreign policy objectives. They noted that during congressional hearings held in late 1991 and in related briefings provided by USDA to congressional staff, the principal congressional focus with regard to agricultural credit guarantees was on keeping U.S. food moving to the FSU rather than on the risks associated with providing the guarantees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSM-102 and GSM-103 Sales by Country and Commodity, 1990 Through 1992", "paragraphs": ["Table 1.1 provides information on GSM program sales by country for fiscal years 1990, 1991, and 1992.

Access to sufficient hard currency is seen as the key to whether a country is capable of servicing debt (principal and interest payments). TEID notes that external debt can be serviced through revenues derived from a country\u2019s current account, from foreign exchange received from debt and investment inflows, or from a drawdown of a country\u2019s existing stock of foreign exchange reserves. Important factors that affect a country\u2019s ability to service its debts, TEID says, include the status of the current account balance; the volume of trade; the variability in current receipts; the size of international reserves; the country\u2019s access to capital account inflows, either from net direct investment, foreign borrowing, or foreign aid; and the country\u2019s ability to reduce its imports of goods and services.", "TEID\u2019s approach also includes a review of the general economic and political situation of countries. If a country\u2019s economy is in a steep decline, its ability to earn foreign exchange from exports may be severely impaired. If the political system is unstable or if a country is subject to external threats to its sovereignty, concerns may arise about the country\u2019s willingness or ability to meet its future debt obligations.", "The 1990 Farm Bill provision restricting when GSM-102 credit guarantees can be extended does not include a general creditworthiness standard. Rather, it requires that the Secretary of Agriculture determine whether a prospective borrowing country is capable of adequately servicing the debt associated with a specific, proposed GSM-102 sale to that country before issuing a credit guarantee. However, if a country is experiencing problems in servicing its debts or is likely to in the near future, any particular debt obligation (including a GSM loan), in our view, could result in default.", "A country with low creditworthiness may be able to adequately service the debt associated with a particular GSM-102 sale if the country is willing to assign a priority to repayment of that debt (i.e., to not treat other creditors equally). In fact, USDA officials told us that the U.S. decision to extend substantial export credit guarantees to the FSU during 1991 was partly based on the assumption that the Soviet government would give preferential treatment to GSM-102 debt. U.S. officials reasoned that food was a high-priority item. Without adequate supplies of food, political stability could be threatened. Moreover, Soviet and, subsequently, Russian leaders knew that if they fell into arrears on payments for GSM-102 guaranteed sales, the GSM-102 program would be suspended. Thus, they had an incentive to keep current on GSM-102 debt repayments if they wanted to secure future GSM credit guarantees.", "However, even if a borrowing country is willing to give preferential treatment to particular debts, creditor nations must pay close attention to its creditworthiness more generally. For example, if a prospective borrower country has low creditworthiness and its problems worsen, it may find it necessary to reschedule its debts. Under the normal rules of international debt restructuring, all official creditors (i.e., creditor country governments) are to be treated equally. Therefore, particular debts should not receive preferential treatment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exposure Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["In addition to evaluating the creditworthiness of potential GSM credit guarantees, TEID establishes annual and total risk exposure guidelines to provide USDA with a yardstick for limiting its risk exposure in specific countries.

USDA considers not only the risk of providing loan guarantees but also the potential for expanding or maintaining U.S. markets overseas. A Reconciliation Committee, consisting of representatives from TEID and several other USDA offices, meets and discusses both the risk of lending to a foreign country and the prospects for developing and maintaining U.S. markets in that country. A recommendation is developed in committee.

The successor states are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.(See fig. 1.1 for a map showing the location of the states).", "We analyzed the creditworthiness of the FSU and its 15 successor states from a variety of perspectives, including debt burden, gross financial requirements, liquidity, secondary market valuations of FSU debt, and country risk analyses. In addition, we (1) considered the general economic and political environment in the FSU and its successor states; (2) reviewed how the Soviet debt crisis developed and the relationship between debt problems, on the one hand, and economic reform and creditworthiness on the other; (3) examined how USDA assessments of creditworthiness and market considerations affected USDA\u2019s decisions on providing the FSU/successor states with credit guarantees; and (4) estimated the exposure of the GSM-102 portfolio to default by the FSU and its successor states.", "To assess the creditworthiness of the FSU and its successor states, we (1) analyzed their debt burden and liquidity situations, using historical and forecast data; (2) considered the importance of arrears, debt relief, and International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangements as measures of creditworthiness; (3) applied USDA/TEID criteria for measuring the relative creditworthiness of countries to the successor states; (4) reviewed secondary market prices of FSU loans and bonds; and (5) analyzed several country risk ratings of the creditworthiness of the FSU and its successor states, including preparing a composite rating for each of the states.", "To examine the role of U.S. agricultural exports to the FSU and its successor states and the use of GSM-102 credit guarantees to promote such trade, we analyzed USDA data and related information on U.S. agricultural exports generally and GSM export credit guarantees more specifically. To assess the development of the Soviet debt crisis, we reviewed information on debt-servicing problems and efforts by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations and international institutions to provide financial assistance to help alleviate those problems. In reviewing the economic and political situation in the FSU and its successor states, we examined data and information on economic conditions and political events during recent years and considered the views of a number of experts and U.S. government agencies. To assess the exposure of the GSM-102 portfolio to default by the FSU and its successor states, we analyzed GSM-102 data on outstanding principal owed by all GSM-102 recipients, including weighting the data according to country risk evaluations of the creditworthiness of the recipients. In addition, we used data on secondary market prices of FSU loans and country risk ratings to estimate the risk of default on external debt of the successor states. The secondary market expresses the value of a country\u2019s loan as a percentage of its face value. The extent to which a loan\u2019s value is discounted in the secondary market indicates how the financial market assesses the risk of default. We estimated the default risk by subtracting a country\u2019s secondary market price from $1 and dividing the result by 100. A similar technique was used for country risk ratings.", "In conducting our review, we interviewed representatives of the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, State, and the Treasury.

However, owing to its increasing financial difficulties (see ch. 3), in the latter part of 1990 the Soviets sought export credits to finance their imports of commodities and food products. The United States responded positively. Between December 1990 and September 30, 1993, the United States offered to provide up to $5.97 billion in GSM-102 export credit guarantees to the FSU and those successor states that qualified for the program.

Its imports averaged just under $20 billion per year, about half of which was for grains and sugar. The need for extensive imports continued following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.", "We found that extensive food imports were necessary because the states had been unable to efficiently harvest, store, process, and distribute much of what was grown. Difficulties associated with each of these steps of the food production system combined to create huge losses due to spoilage after crops were initially produced. For example, approximately 25 to 30 percent of grain and 30 to 50 percent of potatoes and vegetables produced in the FSU and its successor states were lost annually because of these problems. Moreover, in absolute terms, aggregate annual grain loss of the successor states (excluding the Baltic states) was, on average, about 30 million to 40 million metric tons (mmt), which was roughly equal to the size of their aggregate annual grain imports.", "After 1985, the Soviet Union announced a series of initiatives to reform agriculture, ranging from making changes in land ownership laws to paying farmers hard currency for high-quality crops sold to the state in excess of original state-contracted amounts. However, for a variety of reasons, these initiatives did not produce substantive results. By 1991, the availability of basic food staples, such as potatoes, meat, and bread, was far worse than before agricultural reforms were initiated. As discussed in our 1993 report, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, agricultural reforms in the successor states proceeded slowly, with varied progress among the states. Reforms considered or undertaken in these states included the liberalizing of food prices; restructuring of state and collective farms; and privatizing of food production, wholesale and retail trade, processing, storage, and transport. However, agricultural reform has been slow, in part because successor state governments fear that rapid reform might lead to significant production shortfalls and unemployment. In turn, such disruptions could cause food shortages and discontent that would threaten the political and social stability needed by these governments to proceed with reforms.

In hearings held in May 1991, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Affairs and Commodity Programs indicated to a congressional committee that under the 1985 Farm Bill it was quite possible to consider the creditworthiness of a country suspect but still proceed with a full GSM program for the country because market development considerations outweighed the financial risk. However, he said, USDA believed that such an approach was no longer possible and that as a result, USDA\u2019s flexibility in operating the credit guarantee programs had been considerably limited.

The debate focused on (1) whether the Soviet Union was creditworthy, (2) what factors should be considered in assessing a country\u2019s ability to repay GSM debt, (3) whether credit guarantees should be provided or denied to the Soviet Union because of foreign policy considerations, and (4) what the impact on the United States and U.S. farmers would be if guarantees were not provided and sales not made. On May 15, 1991, the Senate approved (by a vote of 70 to 28) a nonbinding resolution (S.

However, because several of the successor states (particularly Russia and Ukraine) wanted separate programs, USDA indicated that the guarantees would henceforth be made on a bilateral basis. Of the $1.1 billion announced at that time, USDA said that $600 million was being designated for Russia. The remaining $500 million would be available for Ukraine and the other states provided they met GSM-102 program qualifications. Only Ukraine received any of this commitment\u2014$109 million.

Humanitarian assistance could address, and in many cases has addressed, these problems. USDA also said that it would not characterize 1990 as a time of food shortages.

The first estimate, which was made in conjunction with a proposed GSM-102 package in the spring of 1991, indicated that if CCC did not provide $1.5 billion in additional export credit guarantees to the FSU between January and July 1, 1991 ($1 billion in guarantees had already been extended between January and March 1991), CCC domestic support payments for wheat, corn, and soybeans could increase between $360 million and $755 million. The higher estimate was arrived at by assuming 100-percent program additionality\u2014that is, that alternative export markets would not exist for GSM-102 guaranteed exports to the FSU.", "Thus, commodities not sold to the FSU would have to be sold in the U.S. market or added to unsold carryover stocks. For the lower estimate, USDA made two different key assumptions. The first assumption was that 25 percent of the commodities could be exported to other countries. The second assumption was that $100 million of the guarantees for the FSU would be used for high-value products for which USDA does not provide deficiency payments or nonrecourse loans. Therefore, this $100 million in GSM-102 guarantees would have no impact on the costs of USDA\u2019s domestic commodity support programs. Both of USDA\u2019s estimates deducted the expected cost of EEP bonus payments provided for wheat exports under the proposed GSM sales.", "USDA\u2019s second estimate, made in February 1993, assessed changes in support costs for commodity programs if the United States did not export a projected 6 million tons of corn and 6 million tons of wheat to the FSU during 1993 and 1994. According to this estimate, support payments for corn would increase by $499 million and wheat payments by $685 million. Soybean costs were not included in the estimate. The estimate assumed that none of the corn and wheat would be sold into alternative export markets (i.e., 100-percent program additionality). Expected EEP bonus payments, however, were not netted out.", "The USDA estimates of increased commodity support costs depend importantly on the assumption that alternative markets would not be generally available if the commodities were not exported to the FSU. USDA did not give us the basis for this assumption. If the commodities in question were exported to other nations, USDA\u2019s estimates of farm price changes and program savings would be less than it estimated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Questions About an Assumption of 100-Percent Program Additionality", "paragraphs": ["For a variety of reasons, USDA\u2019s assumption about 100-percent additionality is debatable: (1) special features of the GSM-102 program that were made available to the FSU and its successor states could have been attractive if offered to other importing nations; (2) competitor exporting nations may have displaced U.S. exports in other markets; and (3) CCC program costs depend on commodity farm prices that, in turn, are the result of many factors that influence global supply and demand conditions.", "As previously noted, countries that participate in the GSM-102 program are able to obtain better interest rates on their credit than would be the case in commercial markets, as they are in effect using the repayment guarantee of the U.S. government to obtain the credit. In addition, most of the guarantees to the FSU and its successor states in fiscal year 1991 and fiscal year 1992 included coverage for 100 percent of the value of the commodities (rather than 98 percent, which is typical for the GSM-102 program). The 100-percent guarantee should also lower borrowing costs to prospective buyers. Also, the GSM-102 program for the FSU and its successor states included guarantees for freight costs. In fiscal years 1991 and 1992, freight coverage equaled nearly $443 million, or about 10 percent of the value of all GSM-102 credit guarantees offered the FSU and its successor states. The coverage of freight costs meant that each dollar of GSM-102 commitment to the FSU and its successor states supported only 90 cents\u2019 worth of commodity exports. Also, EEP bonus payments to the importing countries for selected commodities lowered the cost of importing these commodities, which in turn should have resulted in additional exports. Total EEP bonus payments for GSM-102 exports to the FSU and the successor states in 1991 and 1992 were about $579 million.", "We estimated that the combination of freight cost financing and EEP bonus payments alone made the additionality attributable to the GSM program for the FSU and its successor states in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 equal at most to about 77 percent. We believe that if USDA had offered GSM-102 credit guarantees to other potential buyers with similar generous terms, it is possible that the United States could have found alternative export markets for at least some of the GSM sales that were made to the FSU and its successor states.", "The behavior of competitor exporters is also relevant to the question of program additionality. For example, if exporters from other nations responded to the GSM-102 guarantees that were made available to the FSU and its successor states by offering similar incentives to non-FSU importers, the exporters may have displaced potential U.S. exports to these other markets. Displaced U.S. exports would have reduced additionality resulting from increased exports to the FSU and its successor states. Alternatively, if the United States did not provide the guarantees to the FSU and its successor states but other exporter nations did, global commodity prices would presumably be about the same. As a result, there would be little or no reduction in USDA commodity support payments to farmers.", "Actual support cost is also affected by commodity prices. Commodity prices are the result of many factors that influence global supply of and demand for commodities. These include, among others, the overall economic performance of the United States, as well as the global economy; the weather and growing conditions for crops in the United States and competitor nations; purchasing decisions in importing countries; the prices of competing commodities; and the production and consumption subsidies of the United States and its competitors. These factors could cause commodity prices to reach levels that would reduce or eliminate the need for additional commodity support payments to U.S. farmers\u2014even if the United States did not export to the FSU and its successor states. However, the complexity and variety of factors that could influence commodity prices make the isolation of the effect of a single factor difficult.", "Without explicit and detailed investigation of the behavior of exporters and importers and specification of other macroeconomic and microeconomic variables, discerning the additionality of the GSM-102 program is difficult. In the absence of reliable data on the additionality of GSM-102 exports, we believe that estimated savings in commodity support programs associated with extending GSM-102 export credit guarantees to the FSU and its successor states should consider a range of additionality levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USDA provided more than $5 billion in export credit guarantees to the FSU and its successor states in 1991-92. It did so when its own assessments indicated that these were high-risk countries from a creditworthiness perspective. According to documents of USDA\u2019s Reconciliation Committee, which makes recommendations concerning whether to provide credit guarantees to specific countries and, if so, in what amounts, the committee saw a need to balance debt-servicing considerations against the need to maintain and expand overseas markets. On two occasions when the committee was unable to reach a consensus, the Chairman made recommendations that he believed balanced financial risk and market development considerations. Since the 1990 Farm Bill does not specify criteria to be used in assessing debt-servicing ability, USDA has considerable discretion and, thus, can provide large amounts of credit guarantees to high-risk countries, increasing the risk of defaults on GSM-102 loans.", "Between November 1992 and the end of September 1993, Russia defaulted on more than $1.1 billion in GSM-102 loans made to the FSU and Russia. Under a September 30, 1993, agreement, the United States agreed to reschedule about $1.1 billion in GSM-102 debt, provided that Russia repaid $444 million of arrears (as of the end of 1993). Russia did repay the arrears on schedule. However, in January 1994, Russia again fell into default on GSM-102 loans. Between February and early June 1994, the United States agreed to reschedule approximately $882 million in additional payments due to CCC and U.S. banks under the GSM-102 program. Following the June 1994 rescheduling, there was approximately $2.9 billion in outstanding GSM-102 principal still owed by Russia on GSM-102 credit-guaranteed loans.", "According to USDA estimates, export credit guarantees provided to the FSU and its successor states resulted in higher commodity prices and, in turn, lower costs for U.S. commodity support programs. Proponents of the credit guarantees assert that the reduced program costs help offset the risk of default on guaranteed debt. However, the estimated savings in commodity support costs depended importantly on an assumption that alternative markets would not be generally available if the commodities were not exported to the FSU. We disagree with analyses that assume only 100-percent additionality, and we believe that any estimated savings in commodity support programs should consider a range of additionality levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Debt Situation of the FSU and Its Successor States", "paragraphs": ["During the latter part of the 1980s, a serious debt situation arose in the Soviet Union.

The debt crisis was temporarily eased in November 1991, when official western creditors agreed to a 1-year deferral of principal payments on pre-1991 debt.

They encouraged the new states to undertake substantial economic reforms designed to stabilize their economies. Doing so could lead to substantial new financial assistance from abroad and help the new states to improve their creditworthiness. Specifically, the G-7 nations said they would support a $24-billion financial assistance package for Russia, contingent on Russian progress in stabilizing and reforming its economy. However, Russia did not stabilize its economy, and the FSU debt arrears situation worsened. In April 1993, Russia\u2019s official creditors (i.e., creditor country governments) found it necessary to reschedule a significant amount of Russian and FSU debts due in 1993. At the same time, the G-7 promised a new package of economic support for Russia.

During 1989 and 1990, a growing debt burden, debt-servicing problems, and increasing world concern about a collapsing Soviet economy and political disintegration began to affect the country\u2019s access to the commercial financial market. According to the World Bank, the surge of imports caused a severe liquidity crisis, leading to a buildup of arrears to western banks and suppliers. The liquidity crunch was exacerbated, in part, because the government had extended authority to Soviet enterprises to negotiate overseas business.", "According to a World Bank analysis, the Soviet Union was $4.5 billion in arrears at the end of 1990 (see table 3.1). In an earlier analysis, the bank estimated that about 10 percent of year-end 1990 arrears was guaranteed debt to official creditors, 30 percent unguaranteed debt to commercial banks, and 60 percent debt to others (mainly suppliers). As arrears accumulated, commercial banks reduced and then stopped new lending. The Soviet Union was faced with large net repayment obligations, which it financed to a great extent out of its deposits in western banks. As a result, these liquid reserves fell sharply, from $14.6 billion in December 1989, to $8.6 billion in December 1990, and to $6.4 billion by March 1991. At the end of 1991, estimated reserves were only about $5.1 billion, which represented less than 2.5 months\u2019 coverage of import costs. According to one source, a 3- to 6-month coverage is generally considered adequate.", "Gold reserves, the other major component of the FSU\u2019s international reserves, were apparently either drawn down to very low levels or already at low levels.

He added that only 240 tons of reserves were left (valued at less than $3 billion). In May 1992, the U.S. Minister Counsellor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. embassy in Moscow told us that Russia had only 220 metric tons of gold. He said these amounts were minimal reserves.

As a result, it said, all countries in transition still face a daunting agenda of structural reform, which is crucial to the medium-term prospects for economic growth. A priority for the FSU countries (except the Baltics) is the elimination of the system of state orders, bilateral trading arrangements, barter agreements, and export controls and tariffs.

Several ethnically based groups have declared themselves sovereign entities and are practically self-governing. These include the Chechen and Tuva Republics and Tatarstan. One concern is whether some of the larger ethnically based groups will be content to remain a part of the Russian Federation or will prefer to seek full independence. Russia\u2019s integrity and viability could be threatened if certain groups seek to leave the country. A related concern is that conflict between minorities could become violent and challenge the Russian government\u2019s ability to maintain order. As discussed in appendix I, Chechens declared independence in 1991, but Russia did not recognize Chechnya\u2019s claim to independence. In late 1994, the Russian government sent large military and police forces into Chechnya to disarm the Chechens and restore Russia\u2019s authority. Chechens fought back fiercely.

During that year, the Russian President governed largely by use of special emergency powers that allowed him to enact changes by executive decree. However, his government found it increasingly difficult to implement its program because of the rise of a powerful industrial lobby that established considerable influence with the Russian parliament. The lobby included large enterprise managers, trade union leaders, and other conservatives who wanted to roll back the government\u2019s economic reform program. The program threatened to restrict the lobby\u2019s powerful role in the Russian economy by decentralizing economic decision-making and holding firms accountable for their actions. During 1992 the lobby demanded and received hundreds of billions of rubles worth of easy credits. It was aided by the Russian central bank, which controlled the printing of money and was responsible to the parliament rather than to the President. The bank\u2019s policy of printing rubles and making large credits available to state-owned industry and farms undermined the government\u2019s monetary and credit policy, threatening hyperinflation. As a result, the budget deficit became much larger than planned, and high inflation rates continued unabated.", "Toward the end of 1992, a full-blown constitutional crisis developed. In November 1992, the President told the British Parliament that a cabal of militant nationalists and former Communist officials were plotting to overthrow him and sweep aside the economic and political reforms that his government had pursued. The President vowed to do whatever was necessary to prevent their success. In December, Russia\u2019s supreme legislative body, the Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, convened. As the Congress got underway, estimates indicated that only a minority of its members was committed to the government\u2019s reform program; a larger minority was opposed. A crisis occurred when the Congress voted to not approve making the Acting Prime Minister, Yegor Gaidar, Prime Minister. He had spearheaded the government\u2019s radical economic reform program. Following his rejection, the President declared that it had become impossible to work with the Congress. He called for a national referendum, to be held in January 1993, in which the public would be asked to choose between the Congress\u2019 or the President\u2019s ideas for leading Russia out of its economic and political crisis. The President said he would resign if he did not win the vote. The proposal was threatening to members of the Congress, since their terms were not due to expire until 1995 and a vote against the Congress could lead to early elections.", "The crisis was temporarily defused in mid-December 1992 when the President and the parliament agreed instead to hold a referendum in April 1993 to approve the basic principles for a new constitution, such as whether Russia should have a presidential or parliamentary system of government. However, in January the parliament began to try to back away from holding a referendum. In February the President and the parliament explored possible compromise power-sharing formulas that would allow them to postpone or call off the planned April referendum. At issue, in part, were concerns that a referendum would contribute to separatist tendencies in Russia\u2019s regions and to political and economic instability more generally. In March the Congress met in emergency session to decide whether to pursue a referendum or approve a power-sharing arrangement between the parliament and the presidency. Instead, the Congress chose to cancel the referendum and reduce the President\u2019s powers. It gave itself authority to suspend the President\u2019s decrees, made it easier to remove him from office for unconstitutional conduct, and indicated it would act to further reduce the President\u2019s powers and dismantle many of his reforms.", "In a televised address to the nation on March 20, 1993, President Yeltsin announced he was assuming temporary special powers to rule by decree and indicated he intended to hold a referendum on a new constitution and to secure a vote of public confidence in his leadership. Such measures were necessary, he said, to prevent restoration of Communist power. President Yeltsin also said that he had ordered the Prime Minister to speed up the economic reform process, including introduction of private land ownership, and to assume control over Russia\u2019s central bank. A few days later, Russia\u2019s constitutional court ruled that the President had violated the constitution by assuming special powers (even though the court had not yet received a copy of a presidential decree ordering an assumption of special powers). On March 23, the speaker of the parliament called for President Yeltsin\u2019s impeachment.", "This crisis eased somewhat when the President\u2019s decrees were published, since they backed away from the assumption of special powers. Even so, on March 28, 1993, nearly 60 percent of the members of the Russian Congress voted to impeach the President. However, the vote fell short of a required two-thirds majority. (Only a quarter of the legislators opposed the proposal to oust the President.) The Congress also rejected a proposal that called for elections for both the President and the parliament in November 1993. The Congress then passed a resolution calling for a referendum on April 25, with four questions to be put to the voters. They were whether the voters (1) had confidence in the President, (2) approved of the social and economic policies conducted by the President and the government since 1992, (3) considered it necessary to hold early elections for the presidency, and (4) considered it necessary to hold early elections for the Congress. The Congress did not approve questioning, as had been agreed upon in December 1992, the electorate on the basic principles for a new constitution.", "The Congress stipulated that a majority of the electorate would have to approve any question put to the voters before a decision would be accepted. The standard exceeded the normal condition for referendums that 50 percent of the electorate simply vote. The higher standard was considered difficult to achieve, given an apathetic electorate. However, on April 21, 1993, Russia\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that the President need secure only a majority of votes by those actually voting on the issues of (1) confidence in the President and (2) approval of the President\u2019s socio-economic policy.", "In the April 25 referendum, a majority of those voting expressed confidence in the President, his handling of the economy, and early elections for the legislature. Nearly a majority (49.5 percent) voted for early presidential elections. However, the referendum did not bring an end to political gridlock or the constitutional crisis that had gripped Russia for many months. Less than a majority of the total electorate voted for early elections to the legislature and the presidency; consequently, early elections were not mandatory. Although there was a large voter turnout, key opponents of the President sought to discredit the election results before the vote counting had been completed and warned that the President might resort to unconstitutional measures to further his objectives.", "Between then and September 1993, relations between President Yeltsin and the parliament deteriorated further. As a result, on September 21 the President announced that he was disbanding the parliament and decreed that elections for a new legislature would be held in December. The lower tier of the parliament responded by voting in favor of impeaching the President and declaring Vice President Alexander Rutskoi as Acting President. The latter said he was nullifying Yeltsin\u2019s decree and named new ministers of defense, interior, and security. However, Yeltsin won support from the existing defense, interior, and security ministries.", "On September 28 and 29, the Interior Ministry sealed off the White House (the building that housed the Russian parliament) with armored personnel carriers and barbed wire and ordered remaining armed parliamentary deputies to surrender their arms and leave the building. On October 3, thousands of anti-Yeltsin demonstrators overran police forces surrounding the parliament and seized control of several key facilities. There were many casualties, and the government launched a counteroffensive. The rebellion collapsed on October 4 when army troops subdued the opposition, including using armed force to retake the White House. Rutskoi and other hardliners were arrested.", "Following the collapse, President Yeltsin, in a televised address to the nation, warned that conditions in the nation remained dangerously unstable and said that quick action was needed to eliminate the remnants of the old system and put a new democratic structure in place. To this end, he called for (1) a new constitution, (2) elections for a new parliament in December and possibly for new local legislatures as well, and (3) unswerving commitment to continuing economic reform.", "Elections were held in mid-December 1993 but yielded mixed results. Voters did approve a new constitution for Russia, but progovernment parties fared poorly in the parliamentary elections. Hardline opposition parties won more than 40 percent of the popular vote and elected more deputies than those elected by the reformist parties. Ultranationalists, Communists, and their allies won the upper hand in the Duma, the more powerful legislative chamber. The significant representation that they achieved reflected widespread economic distress and increased opposition to President Yeltsin\u2019s policies. Nonetheless, during the first half of 1994, Russian political developments were surprisingly favorable, according to PlanEcon, as the new parliament demonstrated greater professionalism and the President, Prime Minister, and parliament achieved more stability in their interactions with one another.

For example, owing to armed conflict and civil strife, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Tajikistan have not even been able to achieve political stability. As a result, according to PlanEcon, none of the countries seems close to establishing the political stability necessary to promote economic recovery and attract foreign investment.", "In Belarus, there was little political change until recently. According to PlanEcon, since January 1994, the chief of state resigned under allegations of corruption, the parliament adopted a new constitution, and the country elected a new president.

However, he has been discouraged by corruption and resistance to reform and recently indicated that the people are not yet prepared for democracy. In Kazakhstan, the other successor state in Central Asia, policies have largely been decreed by its executive branch, headed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. A new constitution was adopted in January 1993 that provided for a strong president (elected for 5 years), a legislature, and a quasi-independent judiciary. The country held its first parliamentary elections in March 1994, with the President\u2019s political supporters securing a large majority. However, according to PlanEcon, both the candidate selection process and voting were not fair.", "In Ukraine, the first post-independence parliamentary elections were held in March and April 1994. Ukraine also elected its second post-independence president in July.

Also at issue is whether the political boundaries that resulted from the breakup of the Soviet empire will survive.

In support of this conclusion, it noted the following developments. During 1993, Russia muscled three recalcitrant countries into joining or promising to become full members of the CIS. Georgia had resisted membership since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but in 1993 the Georgian President asked for military assistance to prevent the overthrow of his government; simultaneously, he brought Georgia into the CIS. Azerbaijan, faced with a series of military defeats by the Armenians, turned to Russia for military support and, in exchange, began to participate more actively in the CIS. Moldova\u2019s parliament had not ratified an agreement to participate in the CIS until Russia pressured it to do so in the fall of 1993. In addition, PlanEcon said, Tajikistan and Belarus have abandoned some of the normal attributes of sovereignty for closer integration with Russia. Tajikistan\u2019s ruling group lost the initial rounds of a civil war and needed Russian assistance to reestablish control. The current government relies on Russian economic and security assistance to stay in power and has agreed to follow Russian security and economic policies. Belarus has said it will subordinate its economic, foreign, and security policies to Russia. According to PlanEcon, Kazakhstan and Ukraine are major question marks; if they relinquish the same powers as Belarus, Russia will have reestablished the heart of the former Soviet Union.", "Some observers believe the successor states lack the necessary political and economic preconditions for undertaking large and instant reforms. For example, Peter Reddaway, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., has concluded that Russia\u2019s deeply Sovietized political culture is highly unsuited to free markets, entrepreneurism, privatization, and the rule of law and will remain so for a decade or two, even with sustained western assistance. According to Reddaway, Russians have reached the limits of their stoicism after the demoralizing traumas of loss of empire, ideology, and familiar institutions, and with severely diminished real incomes.", "Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser to President Carter, has also indicated that the former Soviet republics enjoy little prospect of a successful transition to market-based democracies in the foreseeable future. According to him, the more realistic scenarios for the future of the FSU include (1) continued fragmentation of Russia itself\u2014splitting perhaps into two or three states, with Moslem Central Asia going its own way; (2) emergence of an inward-oriented and rather authoritarian but modernizing Russian national state; or (3) establishment of an authoritarian and nationalist Russian state that seeks to recreate its imperial status. Brzezinski also said that the reforms demanded by the IMF and the West as part of the privatization process would force the post-Communist countries to accept prolonged, massive, and painful unemployment. This situation, he said, is politically and morally unacceptable; rather, the West should, at a minimum, help create some temporary safety nets for the victims of the transition process.", "In June 1992, the CIA said that it expected the reform process to continue in Russia and elsewhere but believed the process would be contentious and marked by recurring crisis. The CIA said the process would probably last a decade\u2014during which the downside risks would be enormous and the range of possible outcomes wide, including extended political deadlock and instability so serious that it could derail reform in both the economic and political spheres. In early 1993, the CIA reported that there were reasonable prospects that Russia would continue its positive internal transformation and integration into the western system of values, but inevitably with continued great travail. Moreover, it said, there remains the possibility that Russia could revert to dictatorship or disintegrate into chaos, with immediate disastrous consequences for the world.", "In January 1994, the U.S. Ambassador responsible for coordinating U.S. assistance to the NIS advised Congress that a titanic struggle was underway in Russia over the future of the country. He said the struggle involved a long-term process that could take a generation or more to resolve. In March 1994, the Secretary of Defense said the struggle could lead to a fully democratic and market-oriented Russia, which he characterized as the best possible outcome imaginable or, in the worst case, an authoritarian, militaristic, imperialistic nation hostile to the West.

This situation would reduce their debt burden but increase Russia\u2019s. Most of the new states have experienced severe liquidity problems. Russia\u2019s serious and growing arrears in debt payments, its inability to meet current and future debt payments, and its need to reschedule its debts demonstrate weighty creditworthiness problems.

In addition, several major, private-sector assessments of country risk have rated Russia and all other successor states as high-risk or low on creditworthiness. The lack of creditworthiness of the successor states exposes the GSM-102 program to a high level of risk. For example, GSM-102 credit guarantees on the outstanding principal for the FSU and to Russia and Ukraine equaled about 44 percent of the GSM-102 portfolio.

These uncertainties include the form and pace of economic restructuring that will be attempted, the amount of external assistance they might receive, and the extent to which they will cooperate with each other. In addition, official statistics of the FSU and the new states are difficult to obtain and do not adequately capture the growing nonstate sector.

For example, for a 3-year GSM-102 loan with semiannual principal payments, CCC charges a fee of 55.6 cents per $100, or 0.56 percent of the covered amount. For 3-year loans with annual principal payments, the fee is 66.3 cents per $100.

For example, in the case of repayment over 3 years, a country rated in the lowest risk category is charged a fee of 75 cents per $100, whereas a country in the highest risk category is charged a fee of $5.70 per $100 of coverage.

This restriction was initially enacted in 1985 following proposed administration legislation to charge a 5-percent user fee for exports backed with credit guarantees. Some Members of Congress were concerned that such a fee would adversely affect the competitiveness of GSM-102 exports. Under the 1-percent restriction, CCC would be considerably limited in the size of the fee that it could charge to take account of country risk should it decide to do so. For example, as previously noted, CCC charges 0.56 percent for a loan payable in 3 years and with principal payments due annually. The most it could increase the fee would be 0.44 percent.

In addition, secondary market valuations of FSU debt and country risk ratings point to poor creditworthiness.", "The large amount of GSM-102 export credit guarantees already provided to the FSU and its successor states, along with their low creditworthiness, means that the GSM-102 portfolio is exposed to a high level of risk that could result in additional, substantial costs to U.S. taxpayers. As earlier discussed, in September 1993 and June 1994 the United States rescheduled large amounts of GSM-102 debt. Providing the successor states with more guarantees at this time would add to the already high exposure of the GSM-102 portfolio to further defaults. Since the GSM-102 program provides financing with terms up to only 3 years, additional guarantees for the successor states would add to the difficult liquidity problems that they are expected to experience over the next several years.

However, GSM-103 is not an appropriate program to use if the successor states are uncreditworthy and is questionable if they are high risk, since longer repayment terms may also increase risk.

For example, FSU agricultural imports were down considerably in 1993 and, according to USDA, there generally is not a food shortage problem in the area.According to USDA, economic reforms have begun to have some positive effects, and as they take further hold, the successor states are not likely to continue importing at their former high levels. At the same time, credits and credit guarantees have unintentionally impeded the reform process by increasing the successor states\u2019 external debt burden and perpetuating state control of agricultural distribution.", "According to USDA, the successor states\u2019 demand for agricultural imports diminished by 27 percent in 1993 compared to 1992 levels. In commenting on a draft of this report, USDA said that Russian agricultural imports are down sharply largely due to a reduction in demand, particularly of grain, which makes up the bulk of imports. The drop in FSU agricultural imports is expected to continue and, according to USDA, is a sign that economic reforms are working, at least to some degree. USDA noted that high levels of Soviet agricultural imports in the 1980s were used to prop up an overexpanded and inefficient livestock sector. Declines in that sector have freed up domestic grain supplies (production of which has remained steady with the exception of 1991\u2019s drought-affected crop) and lowered the FSU demand for imports. In addition, USDA said, price liberalization in several republics has led to lower waste, increased incentives, and more rational use of inputs.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, USDA indicated that food assistance has adversely affected reform in the FSU. USDA said that although widespread dislocation in the FSU food supply never occurred, the West continued to provide assistance (credits and food aid) to the FSU, which accepted it to the likely detriment of economic reforms (increased debt and continued state control of agricultural marketing).", "According to a USDA analysis, the high level of FSU grain imports in recent years\u2014sustained by credits, credit guarantees, and food donations\u2014allowed FSU authorities to delay increases in farm prices and to maintain the centralized grain distribution and marketing system to a large degree. For example, the average price of wheat imported by the FSU in 1992-93 was $125 a ton (excluding freight), while Russian farmers received less than $40 a ton. The state provided massive subsidies that lowered the price of the imported grain relative to domestic farm prices. Thus, instead of paying Russian farmers higher prices, which would have improved farm incomes, increased farm sales, and reduced waste, the state chose instead to purchase large amounts of foreign grain. When commercial financing was no longer available, the state requested concessional loans and donations to help maintain these imports. Obtaining imports on concessional terms, which meant deferring immediate repayment, was easier for state planners than allowing market forces to set domestic grain prices. The commercial credits and credit guarantees also adversely affected the reform process, because scarce hard currency needed to support domestic reform was instead required to service the increased external debt.", "According to the USDA analysis, fewer credits and credit guarantees are likely to be provided in the future because of increased western concerns about FSU creditworthiness, particularly Russia\u2019s, and expectations of decreased FSU demand for imports.

However, under the 1990 Farm Bill, CCC is currently restricted from charging an origination fee for any GSM-102 credit guarantee in excess of an amount equal to 1 percent of the amount of credit extended under the transaction.

According to a World Bank 1992 study, the total volume of secondary market trading rose from an estimated $4 billion in 1985 to $100 billion in 1990. The bank noted that as a result of improved market efficiencies, secondary market prices were increasingly used as indicators of a country\u2019s creditworthiness and as benchmarks in debt reductions/restructuring packages. According to more recent studies, secondary market trading increased enormously in 1992 and 1993, reaching volumes of $773.7 billion and $1.9 trillion, respectively. As concerns FSU or Russian paper, it has become one of the more popularly traded assets in the secondary market. According to the Emerging Markets Traders Association, Russian debt ranked eighth on trading volume out of 42 countries for which the group reported data for 1993. Trading volume in Russian debt increased more than 35-fold\u2014from $678 million in 1992 to $24.7 billion in 1993.", "Although we feel confident about our use of secondary market data to estimate expected losses on the value of outstanding GSM-102 loans to the FSU, we developed a second method for estimating such losses after receiving USDA\u2019s comments on our draft report. As discussed in chapter 5, we used Euromoney country risk ratings to estimate the risk of default and, in turn, the expected cost of GSM-102 loans to the FSU and Russia as of June 1994. The results were very similar to the results obtained from our use of the secondary market prices and, thus, increase our confidence in the secondary market method.", "As noted previously, USDA also commented that the attributes of secondary market debt may be materially different from the GSM debt. USDA did not cite any examples of how the debt might be materially different or explain how such differences might affect the use of secondary market prices to reflect the risk of default on GSM-102 loans. GSM debt is different in the sense that the U.S. government guarantees most, if not all, of the principal in the event that the borrower defaults on its loans. Since lending banks are guaranteed that USDA will repay at least 98 percent of defaulted GSM-102 loans, lenders to Russia would presumably have little reason to trade the debt on the secondary market when Russia defaults on such debt.

(USDA also said that each program was driven by market development objectives.) However, in May 1994 USDA officials advised us that the office responsible for preparing creditworthy assessments had rated Ukraine as not creditworthy during the previous year and still considered Ukraine as uncreditworthy. Thus, USDA had made credit guarantees available to Ukraine in fiscal year 1994 even though its own analysis indicated the country was uncreditworthy.", "In addition to Ukraine, other successor states identified by USDA as still not creditworthy in May 1994 were Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Thus, USDA classified 9 of the 15 successor states as not creditworthy. Creditworthy successor states at that time, according to USDA, included the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) as well as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.", "Creditworthiness evaluations involve a multidimensional analysis of a variety of factors and some subjective judgment. As a result, evaluations by different parties may not always fully agree. This is best evidenced in chapter 5, where we compare the country risk evaluations of three different private rating services (see table 5.8). Consequently, it is not necessarily surprising that USDA did not agree with the conclusion in our draft report that all of the successor states were not creditworthy. After considering USDA\u2019s comment, we decided to restate our conclusion as follows: Most, if not all, FSU successor states are not creditworthy and all should be considered at least high risk from a creditworthiness perspective.", "We believe our restated conclusion is well supported by the information and analyses presented in the report, especially by the material presented in chapters 4 and 5. The most recent summary information in support of our restated conclusion is found in tables 5.10 and table 5.11. As table 5.10 shows, in March 1994 both Euromoney and Institutional Investor rated nearly all of the FSU successor states among the bottom one-third of all the countries they rated on creditworthiness, and most of the rated successor states were in the bottom quartile. As table 5.11 shows, Euromoney\u2019s actual risk ratings for the 15 successor states for March 1994 imply risks of default ranging between about 66 percent (Latvia) to about 82 percent (Armenia).

For example, if one assumes that in the absence of the GSM-102 credit guaranteed exports to the FSU and its successor states alternative export markets would not exist, this is characterized as 100-percent program additionality. If one assumes that 75 percent of the commodities could be exported to other countries, the program additionality would be only 25 percent.", "In chapter 2, we raised questions about USDA\u2019s approach, which largely relied on an assumption of 100-percent additionality. We expressed the view that analyses should consider a range of additionality levels. In commenting on our draft report, USDA provided mixed views on this issue. On the one hand, USDA agreed that one should consider a range of additionalities. In fact, USDA cited a third estimate, provided to the Secretary of Agriculture in February 1993, in which two levels of additionality were assumed for $2 billion in credits to the FSU\u201450-percent additionality and 100-percent additionality. According to USDA, the estimate indicated deficiency payment savings of $0.7 billion to $1.4 billion. However, USDA further assumed a loan concessionality of 60 percent, or $1.2 billion, to cover loan defaults, freight costs, EEP bonus payments, and other unspecified factors. USDA estimated that the net budget costs of $2 billion in credits (after subtracting estimated deficiency payment savings from the loan concessionality cost) would vary between a cost of $500 million to a savings of $200 million. Although USDA\u2019s comments cited a third estimate that included a 50-percent additionality case, USDA went on to say that an assumption of 100-percent additionality with regard to the FSU and its successor states seemed reasonable. In support of the latter view, USDA said it is likely that without the GSM-102 coverage the FSU would not have been able to purchase substantial quantities of U.S. commodities. This is illustrated, USDA said, by the sharp decline in U.S. exports to the FSU after it was suspended from the program. In addition, USDA said there were few alternative opportunities for the use of the credit guarantees in other countries.", "In chapter 2, we questioned USDA\u2019s assumption that alternative export markets would not be available on the grounds that special features of the GSM-102 program made available to the FSU and its successor states should be attractive if offered to other importing nations. One special feature we noted was USDA coverage of 100 percent of the value of the commodities. However, in commenting on our draft report, USDA indicated that it does not like and would be unlikely to provide 100-percent coverage. In addition, USDA said, our analysis presumes there are creditworthy countries in the world marketplace that are interested in participating in a large-scale GSM-102 program. According to USDA, during fiscal years 1991 and 1992 principal markets not targeted for the GSM-102 program included China, Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Japan. With the exception of China and Japan, USDA said, there were few alternative markets that could exert the same amount of influence on U.S. domestic prices as that exerted by the FSU market; and both China and Japan purchased heavily from the United States during the time period without credit guarantees.", "We do not believe that 100-percent additionality is the most reasonable assumption. As discussed in chapter 2, we estimated that the combination of freight cost financing and EEP bonus payments, alone, made the additionality attributable to the GSM program for the FSU and its successor states in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 equal at most to about 77 percent. In addition, the issue of what assumed additionality level is most appropriate does not depend simply on whether the FSU could have purchased the U.S. commodities without the GSM-102 guarantees. If the United States had not provided the guarantees, other exporting countries might have provided credits or credit guarantees to assist the FSU. Doing so could have reduced those countries\u2019 exports to third countries, enabling the United States to increase its exports to the latter. Even if the United States had not provided the guarantees and other countries had not provided additional guarantees, it is not obvious that the 100-percent additionality case should be applied. A decline in sales to the FSU would tend to lead to reduced prices on world markets, which, in turn, could result in increased demand.", "We have not advocated providing 100-percent loan guarantee coverage. However, we believe that if one wants to consider to what extent credit guarantees to the FSU and its successor states increased U.S. exports, a fair comparison should consider what would have happened if comparable terms had been offered to other countries. We are not aware of any single country with a market comparable to that of the FSU that would have been interested in GSM-102 credit guarantees. However, it is possible that a number of countries with smaller markets might have been interested in credit guarantees or additional guarantees if the terms were comparable to those extended to the FSU. Any guarantees or increase in guarantees provided to other countries would, of course, further detract from the realism of a 100-percent additionality assumption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views on Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["USDA did not express any view regarding our suggestions in chapter 5 on how Congress could reduce future exposure of the GSM-102 portfolio to default.
