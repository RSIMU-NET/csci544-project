This data was contained in program documents such  as a defense acquisition executive summary report and acquisition  program baseline document. We also compared the latest estimates of  technical performance capabilities contained in program briefings to the  original goals. To assess progress toward meeting the delivery schedule,  we reviewed monthly schedule updates and compared them to the  original and current delivery schedule plans. We also tracked Boeing\u2019s  planned and actual flight test activities and examined the risks to test  completion. We reviewed the 2017 Annual Report of the Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation. As part of our overall review, we  examined Defense Contract Management Agency quarterly assessments  of the KC-46 program and attended monthly meetings between the  program office and Boeing to obtain additional insight on program  progress. We visited two Boeing production facilities in Everett,  Washington. Finally, we interviewed officials from the Air Force\u2019s KC-46  program office, other defense offices, the 412th test wing, the Federal  Aviation Administration (which is responsible for certifying the design of  the KC-46), and Boeing on progress made in 2017.

The boom is a rigid,  telescoping tube that an operator on the tanker aircraft extends and  inserts into a receptacle on the aircraft being refueled. See figure 1 for an  example of boom refueling.", "The hose and drogue system is comprised of a long, flexible refueling  hose and a parachute-like metal basket that provides stability. Drogue  refueling is available via the centerline drogue system in the middle of the  aircraft, or via wing aerial refueling pods located on each wing. The pods  are used for simultaneous refueling of two aircraft.", "To develop a KC-46 tanker, Boeing modified a commercial 767 aircraft in  two phases. In the first phase, Boeing modified the design of the 767 with  a cargo door and an advanced flight deck display borrowed from its 787  aircraft and is calling this modified version the 767-2C. The 767-2C is built  on Boeing\u2019s existing production line. In the second phase, the 767-2C  was militarized and brought to a KC-46 configuration in a separate Boeing  facility. See figure 2 for a depiction of the conversion of the 767 aircraft  into the KC-46 tanker with the boom deployed and the flight certifications  needed at each stage.", "The Federal Aviation Administration has previously certified the  airworthiness of Boeing\u2019s 767 commercial passenger airplane (referred to  as a type certificate) and in December 2017, awarded the amended type  certificate for the 767-2C aircraft to Boeing. It is also responsible for  certifying the design of the KC-46 with a supplemental type certificate.  The Air Force is then responsible for certifying the airworthiness of the  KC-46 with a military certification, as well as certifying the KC-46 and  various receiver aircraft, such as F-16 fighters and C-17 cargo planes, for  refueling operations. Boeing must complete developmental testing to  support these certifications as well as to demonstrate that contract  specifications have been met. After the first 4 KC-46 aircraft are  delivered, the Air Force will complete operational testing to determine the  KC-46\u2019s operational effectiveness and operational suitability for combat.", "Boeing was awarded a fixed-price-incentive (firm target) contract for KC- 46 development, which includes the design, manufacture, and delivery of  four test aircraft. Barring any changes, the contract specifies a ceiling  price of $4.9 billion for Boeing to develop the first 4 aircraft, at which point  Boeing must assume responsibility for all additional costs. The contract  includes options to manufacture the remaining 175 aircraft with firm-fixed- price contract options for the first 2 production lots, and options with not- to-exceed fixed prices for production lots 3 through 13. For purposes of  this report, a production lot refers to a set number of aircraft that must be  built and delivered in a given time frame and procured with a specific year  of funding. For example, the first production lot includes 7 aircraft  procured with fiscal year 2015 funding that are to be built and then  delivered to the Air Force starting in 2018. The original contract also  required Boeing to deliver 18 fully capable aircraft by August 2017.", "The Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics approved  the KC-46 program to enter low-rate initial production in August 2016.  Since then, the Air Force has exercised options for the first 3 production  lots for 34 aircraft totaling about $4.9 billion. Previously we reported that  in January 2017, Boeing and the program office updated the schedule to  reflect a 14-month delivery delay due to problems Boeing experienced  wiring the aircraft, design issues discovered with fuel system  components, a fuel contamination event, and test delays (see figure 3).", "As we reported, instead of meeting the original August 2017 date, the  updated schedule shows Boeing would deliver the first 18 aircraft with  booms and centerline drogue systems between September 2017 and  February 2018.

Program officials said the initial cost  estimate included a large amount of funding for possible requirements  changes, based on the Air Force\u2019s experience with prior major acquisition  programs.

For  example, the aircraft is expected to be ready for operational use when  required at least 89 percent of the time and, once it is deployed for an  aerial refueling mission, be able to complete that mission 92 percent of  the time. In addition, the aircraft is now using less than 1,557 gallons of  fuel per flight hour, its fuel usage rate target. The program also closely  tracks the actual weight of the aircraft because weight has a direct effect  on the amount of fuel that can be carried. As of January 2018, program  officials told us that there are approximately 176 pounds of margin to the  operational empty weight target of 204,000 pounds. When we met with  them in December 2017, Boeing officials told us they do not expect the  aircraft to exceed the target weight. Appendix I provides a description of  each of the performance capabilities.", "In some cases, the program will be tracking progress towards achieving  performance capabilities while the aircraft is in operation. For example,  the program set a reliability growth goal of 2.83 flight hours between  unscheduled maintenance events due to equipment failure by the time  the aircraft reaches 50,000 flight hours. As of November 2017, the  program had completed about 2,159 flight hours, achieving 1.8 hours at  that time. Program officials believe that the reliability will improve as  additional flight hours are completed and as unreliable parts are identified  and replaced.", "The 2017 Annual Report by the Office of the Director of Operational Test  and Evaluation included a recommendation that the Air Force re-test the  KC-46 in an operationally representative condition to demonstrate that  aerial refueling systems could perform their required missions following  an electromagnetic pulse event. This type of testing is related to the  aircraft\u2019s survivability performance goal, meaning the aircraft should be  capable of operating in a hostile environment, including after a nuclear  incident that delivers an electromagnetic pulse. The report stated that the  program powered down or removed critical mission systems during this  testing and that therefore, the KC-46\u2019s capability to deliver fuel during or  immediately following an electromagnetic pulse was not fully tested.

In many of  those instances, the aerial refueling operators were unaware that those  contacts had occurred. Boom nozzle contact outside the receptacle can  damage antennae or other nearby structures. It is especially problematic  for low-observable receiver aircraft, such as the F-22 fighter, because it  can damage radar-absorbing coatings. Program officials said that Boeing  is currently developing a software fix for the remote vision system that  would provide aerial refueling operators better visibility for refueling  operations to help avoid unintended boom contacts with receiver aircraft.

These  key risks and efforts to address them are discussed below.", "Test aircraft configuration: Boeing needs to update test aircraft to the  correct configuration before it can complete different types of testing  that remain. For example, according to program officials, Boeing  needs to ensure that test aircraft have up-to-date and approved  wiring, software versions, and aircraft parts prior to Federal Aviation  Administration testing for the supplemental type certificate and Air  Force testing for the required military certificate. At a more basic level,  Boeing also needs to finalize the design of the wing aerial refueling  pods to start developmental testing on that subsystem. According to  Boeing officials, the company and its wing aerial refueling pod  supplier had underestimated the level of design drawing details the  Federal Aviation Administration needed to review to certify that the  parts conformed to the approved design. Over the past 4 years, this  supplier has been negotiating with several key sub-tier suppliers for  the necessary documentation and has obtained most of it. Boeing has  co-located some of its employees with the supplier to provide  technical support to complete the remaining documentation for  certification. Boeing and the program office disagree on how long it  will take to reach that certification milestone. Boeing projects it will  have conformed wing aerial refueling pods to test in March 2018 and  program officials said there is risk to that time frame.", "Flight test pace: Boeing plans to complete about 6,550 remaining  developmental flight test points by the end of June 2018 at a pace that  is nearly double its current average. For example, some test points  involve a KC-46 and receiver aircraft maintaining a specific airspeed  and altitude during refueling. On average, from February 2016  through January 2018, Boeing has completed about 689 test points  per month. It would need to almost double this pace to about 1,310  test points and sustain that pace for a 5-month period to complete  testing by June. Based on the average number of tests points that  Boeing has completed per month, as shown in figure 5, we project  Boeing would finish the remaining test points about 5 months later  than expected in early November 2018. We also project that delivery  of 18 fully capable aircraft would occur around May 2019, assuming  the same 5.5 month delivery time frame included in the updated  schedule.", "Boeing recognizes that achieving its planned flight test pace is one of  the most significant program risks and has taken several actions to  address this risk. For example, last year, Boeing moved from a \u201ctest  once\u201d approach\u2014where testing would begin once a series of tests  was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and Department  of Defense\u2014towards a more incremental testing approach where a  smaller set of tests could be conducted as soon as they are approved  by a single entity. Program officials pointed out that, where possible,  Boeing is still using a single test point to satisfy more than one  requirement from both regulators. As of January 2018, Boeing also  identified about 440 test points that could be eliminated because,  according to program officials, data collected in other tests may  provide sufficient knowledge to cover the eliminated test points.  Boeing has also consolidated a large percentage of qualification  testing resources at a single location to improve efficiency.", "Test planning: According to program officials, Boeing\u2019s test plans do  not fully account for the time needed to complete receiver aircraft  certification testing. Program officials, government test officials, and  Boeing officials said that tests for certifying F-16 fighters, C-17 cargo  planes, and other aircraft to receive fuel from a KC-46 will take  between 3 and 5 weeks to complete for each aircraft. This is longer  than the 1 week for each aircraft that is currently included in Boeing\u2019s  test plan, according to company officials. Boeing officials said the  company intends to update the test schedule in Spring 2018 to reflect  more time to complete receiver aircraft certifications. Boeing has not  yet quantified how much time will be added to the test schedule for  these certifications or determined whether it will affect the overall  delivery schedule. According to program officials, Boeing is required  to have 8 receiver aircraft certified by the first KC-46 delivery. These  officials stated that to avoid the risk of further delivery delays, the Air  Force is discussing the possibility of reducing the number of receiver  aircraft certifications needed if some, but not all, receiver aircraft are  certified prior to first KC-46 delivery. This would allow the warfighter to  start using KC-46 aircraft sooner rather than wait for all 8 receiver  aircraft to be certified. Air Force officials still maintain, however, that 8  receiver certifications are required prior to operational testing, which is  slated to begin in October 2018 and last for about 7 months.", "Retrofitting already produced aircraft: Based on the updated schedule,  Boeing will be producing 49 aircraft, or about 27 percent of the total  aircraft the Air Force plans to buy, before developmental testing is  complete. Originally, the Air Force planned to buy 19 aircraft or about  11 percent of the total number concurrent with developmental testing.  In general, DOD tries to limit the amount of concurrency because  testing can reveal design or performance problems that need to be  fixed, which could lead to costly retrofits or schedule delays. For  example, Boeing already needs to retrofit 18 aircraft it has produced  with an updated wiring design and 6 aircraft with new flooring and  tires. The Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  allowed 27 percent concurrency on this program to avoid a break in  production. Cost risk to the government is low because the KC-46  development contract specifies that Boeing must correct any  deficiencies and bring development and production aircraft to the final  configuration at no additional cost to the government. However, there  could be schedule delays if continued testing reveals problems that  need to be corrected on aircraft already built. As of January 2018,  Boeing estimates KC-46 development will cost about $5.9 billion or  about $1 billion over the contract ceiling price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "KC-46 Development Problems Have Resulted in Less Refueling Capacity Than Currently Anticipated", "paragraphs": ["KC-46 development problems have resulted in delivery delays and kept  the Air Force from achieving a higher level of refueling capacity it  expected to achieve by this time.

Since no KC-46  aircraft have been delivered, the Air Force has had to use KC-135 and  KC-10 aircraft at a higher rate than expected. Air Force officials  negotiated non-monetary considerations from Boeing to offset the lost  military tanker capacity associated with the delay, such as obtaining  additional training at no cost to the government for KC-46 pilots and  maintenance personnel and support for the aircrew training system.  According to program officials, Boeing has already provided almost all of  these considerations even though the contract modification that includes  them has not yet been signed by Boeing.", "According to Air Mobility Command officials, if there are delivery delays  past October 2018, the Air Force would need to keep some KC-135  aircraft operational longer than planned.
