In the request for comments on the implementing regulations, GSA stated that it expected OGE to review agency implementation of section 302 in connection with its ongoing reviews of agency ethics programs.", "GSA promulgated interim regulations in 41 C.F.R. 304 to implement section 302. These regulations, which have been in effect from March 8, 1991, through the present, include a definition of what constitutes conditions for accepting travel reimbursements, a description of payment methods, and a requirement that all instances of nonfederally reimbursed travel in excess of $250 be reported semiannually to OGE. Initially, these reports were to include the name and position of the employee, nature of the event, dates of travel, and amount of payment. However, GSA amended its regulations effective December 9, 1992, by adding a few additional requirements, including a provision that reports to OGE should also contain the dates of the events and itemized expenses. Commerce and FTC have established regulations that require adherence to GSA\u2019s regulations.", "Private companies, universities, and other organizations often want federal employees with expertise in such areas as weather forecasting and antitrust and trade regulations to participate in meetings and other events. When these employees receive offers of reimbursed travel, subsistence, or related expenses for a trip to such an event, the employees are supposed to prepare a travel order to obtain approval for the trip and a form requesting approval to accept the offer of reimbursement. At Commerce and FTC, the forms requesting approval for reimbursement, referred to as request forms, require the inclusion of details concerning the trip. These details include the name of the source offering reimbursements, dates and nature of the event, and types and amounts of expenses that will be reimbursed. This information is to be used by the employees\u2019 supervisors and other higher level reviewing officials. If a trip meets the applicable GSA regulations for authorizing travel on a reimbursable basis, a travel order can be approved. At Commerce, all travel reimbursement offers made to the Secretary of Commerce are reviewed by the Department\u2019s Office of General Counsel, while reimbursement offers made to other Commerce employees are reviewed in their respective offices. At FTC, travel reimbursement offers made to any employee are reviewed by FTC\u2019s Office of General Counsel.", "During the period of March 8, 1991, when GSA\u2019s interim regulations became effective, through September 30, 1993, Commerce had 3,104 nonfederally reimbursed trips, or an average of 1,242 trips per fiscal year. We sampled 160 of these trips and found that the average amount of reimbursed expenses was $1,100 per trip. Reimbursements varied from covering all of the trip\u2019s expenses to some portion, such as airfare or lodging. During the period of October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993, FTC had 59 nonfederally reimbursed trips. The average amount of reimbursed expenses for FTC employees was $677 per trip.

First, because of the Subcommittee\u2019s interest in travel by high-level officials, we reviewed available documentation for a sample of 60 of the 112 trips reported during the period from March 8, 1991, through September 30, 1993, by these officials. We defined \u201chigh level\u201d as those officials in the Office of the Secretary or the highest level official in all other Commerce offices. We compared these documents, including travel requests, orders, vouchers, and receipts, to the regulations in effect at the time the trips were taken and reported. Second, we reviewed similar information for a sample of 100 of the 2,992 trips reported during the same period by Commerce employees who were not high-level officials. We limited our review to the travel reimbursed on or after March 8, 1991, because the GSA interim regulations implementing Section 302 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 took effect at that time. We included travel reported through September 30, 1993, since these were the latest trips identified in OGE\u2019s reports when we began our review.", "As agreed with the Subcommittee, we also reviewed how the procedures governing reimbursed travel were administered within Commerce\u2019s Office of the Secretary and at the three offices with most of the reimbursed travel during the period. Collectively, the International Trade Administration (ITA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) accounted for about 79 percent of Commerce\u2019s trips. We did this work to better understand the procedures and policies in place for administering reimbursed travel at individual offices.", "The Subcommittee selected FTC for review in part because it had a centralized system for reviewing travel requests as compared to Commerce\u2019s decentralized system. Because the decision to include FTC was made during the latter part of our review, we limited our review to all FTC employee trips that were reimbursed during fiscal year 1993 to ensure records would be readily available.", "We performed this review at Commerce, ITA, and FTC headquarters in Washington, D.C.; NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, MD; and NIST headquarters in Gaithersburg, MD.", "We obtained comments from Commerce and FTC that are discussed on page 11 and presented in appendixes II and III.

The most common of these instances was that Commerce sometimes approved employees\u2019 travel orders without first reviewing travel requests to obtain all of the necessary information about the trip to be taken. Although less frequent, we also identified certain deficiencies in how Commerce reported these reimbursements to OGE and in how internal controls governing reimbursed travel were applied. While no individual reporting deficiency occurred consistently, a number of the reports had at least one type of deficiency.

Moreover, there is less risk that an employee will receive an improper payment on behalf of the agency if advance approval is required.", "Our review showed that travel orders indicating the existence of reimbursed travel were almost always approved before the beginning of the trip. However, our samples of 60 high-level officials and 100 other employees identified a total of 36 trips, 13 and 23, respectively, where the travel order was approved without first reviewing a travel request form. Nine of these 36 trips in the samples were in the National Weather Service in NOAA. Weather Service officials told us that they (1) require the employee to include a statement identifying the expenses that will be reimbursed by the nonfederal source on the travel order and (2) allow the employee to complete the travel request form after the trip is complete. The problem with such an approach is that there is no assurance that all of the information necessary to assess conflict-of-interest situations is submitted with the travel order. It should be noted that three of the Weather Service\u2019s nine travel orders did not contain such important information as the identity of the reimbursing organization and/or the amount and type of expenses to be paid.

The regulations also require that the expenses reported must be the actual amount paid by check or the value of in-kind services, other than for meals.", "While Commerce\u2019s Office of General Counsel, which is responsible for providing the semiannual reports of reimbursed travel to OGE, has several procedures in place to ensure that all reimbursed travel is reported to OGE, we identified some deficiencies in the reported information. Specifically, we found 27 deficiencies that were contained in 23 of the 160 trips in our sample. These deficiencies are shown in table 1.", "An official in Commerce\u2019s Office of General Counsel said that many of the deficiencies were due to the December 9, 1992, change in GSA\u2019s regulations, which is discussed on pages 2 and 3 of this report. In corroboration of this point, we found that all 12 of the deficiencies involving the dates of events and itemized expenses did occur shortly after the regulations were changed.

In 11 of the 160 trips (9 in the all-employee sample and 2 in the high-level officials\u2019 sample) the reported amounts differed from the amounts recorded in the receipts. The reported amount was less than the receipts in five instances, ranging in difference from $7 to $523. In the other six instances, the reported amount exceeded the receipts by $12 to $350. Four of the nine instances of differing amounts in the all-employee sample occurred in ITA. The ITA Director of the Office of Organization and Management Support commented on these four trips. For the trip that resulted in the largest variance, she said that it was possible the employee reported the government rate for the airfare rather than the actual amount paid. She also said that the other three instances, none of which was greater than $15, could have been attributed to math errors.", "It should be noted that we could not always determine whether the actual costs of the trips were reported in Commerce\u2019s semiannual reports because receipts are not required for expenses paid in-kind.
