The congressional defense committees recognize that these activity groups need some carryover to ensure smooth work flow from one fiscal year to the next. However, the committees have previously raised concern that the amount of carryover may be more than is needed. GAO was asked to determine (1) if the military services' carryover calculations were in compliance with DOD's new carryover policy and (2) if customers were submitting orders to working capital fund activities late in the fiscal year and, if so, the effect this practice has had on carryover."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The military services have not consistently implemented DOD's revised policy in calculating carryover. Instead, the military services used different methodologies for calculating the reported actual amount of carryover and the allowable amount of carryover since DOD changed its carryover policy in December 2002. The military services did not consistently calculate the allowable amount of carryover that was reported in their fiscal year 2004, 2005, and 2006 budgets because they used different outlay rates for the same appropriation. The Air Force did not follow DOD's regulation on calculating carryover for its depot maintenance activity group, which affected the amount of allowable carryover and actual carryover by tens of millions of dollars and whether the actual carryover exceeded the allowable amount as reported in the fiscal year 2004, 2005, and 2006 budgets. The Army depot maintenance and ordnance activity groups' actual carryover was understated in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 because carryover associated with prior year orders was not included. While the Navy generally followed DOD's policy for calculating carryover, the Navy consolidated the reporting of carryover information for research and development activities. The Navy budgets no longer provide information to show if any of the five research and development subactivity groups individually exceeded the carryover ceiling as the Navy budgets did prior to the change in the carryover policy. As a result, carryover data provided to decision makers who review and use the data for budgeting are erroneous and not comparable across the three military services. For example, the Air Force reported to Congress that the actual fiscal year 2002 carryover for depot maintenance was $87 million less than the ceiling. If the Air Force followed DOD's policy, GAO's calculations show its carryover would have exceeded the ceiling by $216 million. Carryover is greatly affected by orders accepted by working capital fund activities late in the fiscal year that generally cannot be completed by fiscal year end, and in some cases cannot even be started prior to the end of the fiscal year. GAO's analysis of 68 fiscal year-end orders identified four key factors contributing to orders generally being issued by customers late in the fiscal year and being accepted by the working capital fund activities during the last month of the fiscal year. These reasons included (1) funds provided to the customer late in the fiscal year to finance existing requirements, (2) new work requirements identified at year end, (3) problems encountered in processing orders, and (4) work scheduled at year end. GAO's analysis showed that over half of the orders reviewed were not completed at the end of the next fiscal year, generating a second year of carryover on the same order. As a result, some orders may not have been the most effective use of DOD resources at that time and may not have complied with all of the order acceptance provisions cited in the DOD Financial Management Regulation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) fiscal year 2006 budget  estimates, working capital fund activity groups (depot maintenance,  ordnance, and research and development) will have about $6.3 billion of  funded work that will be carried over from fiscal year 2006 into fiscal year  2007. The congressional defense committees recognize that these activity  groups need some carryover to ensure a smooth flow of work during the  transition from one fiscal year to the next. However, past congressional  defense committee reports raised concerns that the level of carryover may  be more than is needed. Excessive amounts of carryover financed with  customer appropriations are subject to reductions by DOD and the  congressional defense committees during the budget review process. To  the extent that carryover is too high, Congress may redirect the funds  gained from such reductions to other priority initiatives. For example,  Congress reduced the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2003 Operation and Maintenance  appropriation by $48 million due to excessive carryover.", "In May 2001, we reported that DOD did not have a sound analytical basis  for its 3-month carryover standard which it established in 1996. Based on  our recommendation, in December 2002 DOD revised its carryover policy  to eliminate the 3-month across-the-board standard for allowable  carryover. Under the new policy, the allowable amount of carryover is to be  based on the outlay rate of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the  work. This means that in determining allowable carryover, the first year  outlay rate is used for new orders received in the current year (first year of  the work order). However, during our review of Army depot maintenance  operations, we reported in June 2005 that the Army encountered several  problems implementing DOD\u2019s new policy on calculating actual carryover  as well as the allowable amount of carryover. In that report, we also  determined that activities exceeded the carryover ceiling because they  received and accepted orders late in the fiscal year.", "As requested and agreed to with your office, the objectives of this  assignment were to determine (1) if the military services\u2019 carryover  calculations were in compliance with DOD\u2019s new carryover policy and   (2) if customers were submitting orders to working capital fund activities  late in the fiscal year and, if so, the effect that this practice has had on  carryover. Our review was performed from July 2005 through March 2006  in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.  The carryover information in this report is budget data obtained from  official Army, Navy, and Air Force budget documents. To assess the  reliability of the data, we (1) reviewed and analyzed the factors used in  calculating carryover and (2) interviewed officials knowledgeable about  the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes in this report. Further details on our scope and methodology can  be found in appendix I.

A working capital fund  is intended to (1) generate sufficient resources to cover the full costs of its  operations and (2) operate on a break-even basis over time\u2014that is, neither  make a gain nor incur a loss. Customers use appropriated funds, primarily  Operation and Maintenance appropriations, to finance orders placed with  the working capital fund. DOD estimates that in fiscal year 2006, the  Defense Working Capital Fund\u2014which consists of the Army, Navy, Air  Force, Defense-wide, and Defense Commissary Agency working capital  funds\u2014will have revenue of about $105 billion.", "The Defense Working Capital Fund finances the operations of three  fundamentally different types of support organizations: (1) stock fund  activities, which provide spare parts and other items to military units and  other customers; (2) industrial activities, which provide depot  maintenance, research and development, ordnance, and other services to  their customers; and (3) other service activities, which provide various  services such as accounting (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) and  computer services (Defense Information Systems Agency).

Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not completed, as well as requested  work that has not yet commenced. Some carryover is necessary at fiscal  year end if working capital funds are to operate efficiently and effectively.  For example, if customers do not receive new appropriations at the  beginning of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary to ensure that the  working capital fund activities have enough work to ensure a smooth  transition between fiscal years. Too little carryover could result in some  personnel not having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year.  On the other hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group  receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the  work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent years. By minimizing  the amount of carryover, DOD can use its resources in the most effective  manner and minimize the \u201cbanking\u201d of funds for work and programs to be  performed in subsequent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Revised Its Carryover Policy", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, DOD established a 3-month carryover standard for all working  capital fund activities except for the contract portion of the Air Force depot  maintenance activity group.

According to  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials, DOD  provided verbal guidance concerning its new carryover policy for working  capital fund activities in December 2002. Subsequently, DOD included its  revised carryover policy in its DOD Financial Management Regulation  7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, dated June 2004, which eliminated the 3- month standard for allowable carryover. Under the new policy, the  allowable amount of carryover is to be based on the outlay rate of the  customers\u2019 appropriations financing the work. This meant that in  determining allowable carryover, the first year outlay rate would be used  for new orders received in the current year (first year of the work order).", "According to the DOD regulation, this new metric allows for an analytical- based approach that holds working capital fund activities to the same  standard as general fund execution and allows for more meaningful budget  execution analysis.", "Further, based on our work on Army depot maintenance operations, we  recommended in our June 2005 report that DOD clarify its written  guidance for calculating the actual amount of carryover as well as the  allowable amount of carryover.

The outlay rate tables came from two  sources\u2014the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller),  Revolving Funds Directorate, and the Financial Summary Tables  published by Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller),  Directorate for Program and Financial Control. Because the outlay rates in  these documents sometimes differ, this could affect whether an activity  group exceeded the carryover ceiling or not. Under the new carryover  policy, the allowable amount of carryover is to be based on the outlay rates  of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the work. In implementing this  policy, it is important for the services to use the same outlay rate tables so  that their calculations on the allowable amount of carryover are consistent.  However, when DOD changed the carryover policy in December 2002, DOD  did not instruct the services, in writing, on which outlay rate tables should  be used to calculate the allowable amount of carryover. Table 1 shows  which outlay rate source each of the military services used.", "Table 2 shows the differences between the outlay rates for selected  appropriations in the tables provided by the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) and the DOD Financial Summary Tables that  were used to calculate the allowable amount of carryover, which is  included in the fiscal year 2005 budget. Some of the differences are large  while others are small. These outlay rates, along with the amount of  appropriations financing orders, are used to determine the allowable  carryover (ceiling). Because the dollar amount of appropriations financing  orders is sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars, even a small rate  difference could result in significantly more or less allowable carryover.  For example, the Navy estimated that the naval aviation depots would  receive $694 million for new Operation and Maintenance, Navy orders in  fiscal year 2005. Using the outlay rate provided in the DOD Financial  Summary Tables, the Navy would be allowed to carry over about $146  million. In contrast, using the outlay rate table provided by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Navy would be allowed to  carry over $180 million\u2014about a $34 million difference for just this one  appropriation financing orders received by the naval aviation depots.", "In addition to using different outlay rate tables, there appeared to be  uncertainties regarding which year\u2019s outlay rates to use. For the fiscal year  2006 budget, the Army and Navy used the DOD Financial Summary Tables  to determine the appropriation outlay rates used in calculating the  allowable amount of carryover. These tables contain different  appropriation outlay rates for each fiscal year. Military service officials  stated that DOD had not provided any written guidance on whether the  services should use the fiscal year 2004 or 2005 outlay rates or both when  determining the allowable amount of carryover in preparing the fiscal year  2006 budget. An excerpt of the outlay rates from the DOD Financial  Summary Tables dated February 2004 follows.", "The Navy used the fiscal year 2005 outlay rates for calculating the  allowable amount of carryover for fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007\u2014 the fiscal years that are included in the fiscal year 2006 budget. The Army  used the same document but instead used the fiscal year 2004 outlay rates  for calculating the allowable carryover for fiscal year 2004. The Army used  the fiscal year 2005 rates for calculating the allowable carryover for fiscal  years 2005, 2006, and 2007. While this might appear to be a small matter  because the rates are generally the same or almost the same from one fiscal  year to the next, using the different rates (2004 versus 2005) for calculating  the allowable carryover for the Army industrial operations activity group in  fiscal year 2004 results in a different outcome. Based on its calculations,  the Army reported that its actual carryover was $141 million below the  ceiling for fiscal year 2004. However, using the fiscal year 2005 rates (the  rates that the Navy used) would show the Army exceeded the ceiling by  about $275 million\u2014a swing of $416 million. This difference is attributable  to the outlay rate for the Operation and Maintenance, Army appropriation  being 52.03 percent for fiscal year 2004 but 68.8 percent for fiscal year 2005.  According to Army officials, the outlay rate varied significantly for these 2  fiscal years because of the supplemental appropriations received during  fiscal year 2004.", "Based on our work involving the Army depot maintenance activity group,  we recommended in our June 2005 report that DOD clarify its written  guidance for calculating the actual amount of carryover as well as the  allowable amount of carryover. DOD concurred with our recommendations  and on June 29, 2005, DOD issued clarifying guidance on carryover.  Among  other things, the guidance specified that (1) the allowable amount of  carryover is to be calculated based on current year customer orders  received and the first year outlay rates for the appropriations financing  those orders for all activity groups except shipyards and (2) the outlay  rates are to be based on historic outlay rates in the DOD Financial  Summary Tables.

In  responding to our discussions, DOD took two actions. First, DOD included  carryover guidance in its January 17, 2006, memorandum on the fiscal year  2007 budget justification book material for Congress. This guidance  specifies that the services are to use the fiscal year 2006 DOD Financial  Summary Tables to calculate carryover. The guidance further specifies that  the services must use the rates in the DOD Financial Summary Tables  unless a waiver is approved in writing by the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller), Director for Revolving Funds. Second, in  February 2006, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  provided additional guidance to the services for the fiscal year 2007 budget  specifying that the (1) fiscal year 2005 outlay rates in the DOD Financial  Summary Tables will be used for calculating the allowable amount of  carryover for fiscal year 2005 and (2) fiscal year 2006 outlay rates in the  DOD Financial Summary Tables will be used for calculating the allowable  amount of carryover for fiscal years 2006 and 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Did Not Calculate Actual Carryover and Allowable Carryover Correctly", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing the Air Force carryover figures shown in the fiscal year 2004,  2005, and 2006 budgets to Congress, we found a number of problems with  how the Air Force calculated the reported actual as well as the allowable  amount of carryover for the depot maintenance activity group.

However, even  though the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  provided updated outlay rates for the next fiscal year, the Air Force did  not use the updated outlay rates when calculating its allowable  carryover in the fiscal year 2005 budget. Instead, the Air Force  continued to use the fiscal year 2001 outlay rates. Moreover, the Air  Force continued to use the fiscal year 2001 outlay rates to calculate the  allowable carryover in the fiscal year 2006 budget instead of using the  updated outlay rates published by DOD.", "The Air Force used all orders received (both prior year and current year  orders) in calculating the allowable amount of carryover in the fiscal  year 2004, 2005, and 2006 budgets.

In discussing the outlay rate difference with the Air Force, officials  stated that they used the 61 percent figure because the rate was more  consistent with the actual outlay rate of the Air Force working capital fund  supply account. However, the Air Force could not provide us with  documentation supporting how they arrived at the 61 percent figure. On  February 7, 2006, the Air Force requested from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) that it be allowed to use the 61 percent  figure in developing the carryover ceilings contained in the fiscal year 2007  budget.

Our  analysis of the Navy budgets submitted to Congress shows that the naval  aviation depots have consistently exceeded the carryover ceilings as shown  in table 6. According to Navy budget documents and officials, the reasons  why the actual reported carryover exceeded the ceiling for the aviation  depots were (1) the lack of material to repair the components being fixed;  (2) the increased deterioration of components, leading to longer repair  cycles; and (3) the large dollar amount of orders financed with  supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2003.", "While the budgets show that the Navy research and development activity  group did not exceed the ceiling for any of the 4 years, the budgets no  longer provide information that shows if any of the five subactivity groups  individually exceeded the carryover ceiling, as the Navy budgets did prior  to the change in the carryover policy in December 2002. Prior to the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) changing its carryover  policy in December 2002, the Navy Working Capital Fund budget provided  carryover information, such as the dollar amount of carryover and the  number of months of carryover for each of the subactivity groups. An  analysis of the budget documents would show if any of the subactivity  groups exceeded the 3-month carryover standard. After DOD changed the  carryover policy in December 2002, the Navy changed the level of reporting  carryover information to be at the aggregate level and no longer provided  carryover information at the subactivity group level. Our analysis of Navy  reports showed that the Naval Air Warfare Center exceeded the ceiling for  fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center  exceeded the ceiling for fiscal year 2002, as shown in table 7.", "According to the Navy, there are two reasons why carryover should be  reported at the activity group level and not at the subactivity group level.  First, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) required  the research and development activities to use a higher outlay rate for  orders financed with procurement appropriations than the official  published procurement outlay rates. Using a higher procurement outlay  rate for calculating the carryover ceiling lowers the amount of allowable  carryover. Because of this higher rate, a Navy official stated that the  carryover should be reported at the aggregate level since subactivity  groups reporting under the ceiling will offset those subactivity groups  reporting over the ceiling. Second, the new methodology did not allow the  exclusion of intrafund orders from the carryover calculation. These are  orders placed by one research and development activity with another  research and development activity. Since intrafund orders were no longer  allowed to be excluded from the carryover calculation, this resulted in the  double counting of actual carryover associated with these intrafund orders.  Because the above two reasons reduce the carryover ceiling and increase  the actual amount of carryover, the Navy reports the carryover information  at the activity group level.", "However, we believe that the carryover associated with the research and  development activity group should be reported at the subactivity group  level for several reasons. First, according to the fiscal year 2007 budget, the  research and development activity group is the largest Navy activity  group\u2014it received about $10 billion of new orders and carried over about  $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2005. By comparison, for fiscal year 2005, the  Navy shipyards received about $1.8 billion of new orders and carried over  about $636 million, and the aviation depots also received about $1.8 billion  and carried over about $470 million. Further, the dollar amount of new  orders received by three research and development subactivity groups  (Naval Surface Warfare Center--$3.4 billion, Naval Air Warfare Center--$2.7  billion, and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Centers--$2.2 billion)  exceeded the amount of new orders received by the shipyards and aviation  depots for fiscal year 2005. Because of the dollar magnitude of research  and development subactivity groups, we believe carryover reporting at the  subactivity group level is needed for Congress and DOD to maintain  oversight.", "Second, concerning the Navy\u2019s comment on using a higher outlay rate for  calculating the carryover ceiling, we agree with the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) that the Navy should use a higher rate.  We also believe that the Navy should report carryover information at the  subactivity group level from a disclosure standpoint. Otherwise, subactivity  groups reporting under the ceiling will offset those subactivity groups  reporting over the ceiling and this information would not be available in the  budgets to Congress. In the December 2002 management initiative  decision, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) stated  that research and development activities could achieve better results than  the established outlay rates for orders financed with procurement  appropriations because of the type of work performed by these activities.  DOD further stated that 45 percent of the fiscal year 2002 carryover was  linked to contractual efforts and 55 percent supported in-house  requirements. DOD concluded that carryover linked to contractual  obligations would disburse at the procurement appropriations rate.  However, the amount supporting the in-house requirements would disburse  at a higher rate because such requirements tend to be funded on an  annualized basis. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) requested that the Navy examine the nature and scope of the  procurement-funded work and report its recommendations by February 15,  2003, to the Comptroller. At the time DOD issued the management initiative  decision in December 2002, the Navy reported carryover information to  Congress at the subactivity group level. The Navy determined, based on  work performed by one Warfare Center, that the outlay rate for Navy  procurement appropriations should be 40 percent, which is higher than the  actual outlay rate for these appropriations. However, the December 2002  management initiative decision did not discuss the Navy changing its level  of reporting carryover information from the subactivity group level to the  aggregate level.", "Third, concerning the Navy\u2019s comments on intrafund orders, the Navy is  correct in that the amount of actual carryover will be double counted.  However, the effect of this is negated since the amount of allowable  carryover is also double counted since both of these activities will include  the intrafund order as a new order and include the new order in their  calculations for determining the allowable amount of carryover.  Furthermore, in May 2001 we reported that the Navy was not following  DOD\u2019s guidance on calculating carryover on intrafund orders. Specifically,  Navy working capital fund activities reduced carryover for orders received  from other working capital fund activities. However, Navy working capital  fund activities categorized orders they sent to other working capital fund  activities as contractual obligations and used these obligations to reduce  reported year-end carryover. As a result, not only did the Navy eliminate the  double counting of such orders, it eliminated all these orders from its  calculations, thus understating the equivalent number of months of  carryover work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Carryover Increased Due to Military Services Placing Orders Late in the Fiscal Year", "paragraphs": ["Carryover is greatly affected by orders accepted late in the fiscal year that  generally cannot be completed, and in some cases cannot even be started,  prior to the end of the fiscal year. As a result, almost all orders accepted  late in the fiscal year increase the amount of carryover. We analyzed 68  orders accepted in September 2003 and September 2004 by certain activity  groups for the three military services. Our analysis identified four key  factors contributing to orders generally being issued by customers late in  the fiscal year and being accepted by the working capital fund activities  during the last month of the fiscal year. These reasons included (1) funds  provided to customers late in the fiscal year to finance existing  requirements, (2) new work requirements identified at year end,   (3) problems encountered in processing orders, and (4) work scheduled at  year end. Further, our analysis showed that 39 of the 68 orders\u2014over half  of the orders reviewed\u2014were not complete at the end of the next fiscal  year, generating a second year of carryover. In addition to increasing  carryover amounts, orders accepted by working capital fund activities late  in the fiscal year, in which these activities do not perform the work until  well into the next fiscal year or even subsequent years, may not (1) be the  most effective use of DOD resources at that time and (2) have complied  with all of the order acceptance provisions cited in the DOD Financial  Management Regulation.

DOD customers stated that it  is common for the military services to provide funds to them late in the  fiscal year after the military services review their programs to identify  funds that will not be obligated by year end. When these funds are  identified, the military services realign the funds to programs that can use  them. These funds are then used to finance orders placed with working  capital fund activities at year end. Further, in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the  military services received supplemental appropriations from Congress to  fund ongoing military operations. Some of these funds were distributed to  DOD customers late in the fiscal year to finance repairs on DOD assets. The  following examples illustrate situations when funds were provided to  customers late in the fiscal year.", "On September 4, 2003, the Ogden Air Logistics Center accepted an order  from the Air Force Ground Theater Air Control System program office  totaling about $4.8 million financed with operation and maintenance  funds that would have expired on September 30, 2003. This order  provided for Ground Theater Air Control System hardware and software  upgrades. According to program office officials, the Air Combat  Command traditionally funds about 60 to 70 percent of its total software  development requirements annually. However in August 2003, the  Command provided the program office with funding to cover 100  percent of its fiscal year 2003 software requirements. Thus, the program  office applied the funds to its next highest priority workload and issued  the $4.8 million order.", "On September 27 and 29, 2003, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Center in San Diego accepted two orders from the U.S. Pacific Fleet  totaling approximately $4.15 million financed with operation and  maintenance funds that would have expired on September 30, 2003.  These two orders were to provide the technical and engineering support  for the relocation of a Sea-Based Battle Laboratory from the USS  Coronado to a new ashore headquarters activity. The Pacific Fleet  identified this requirement in early fiscal year 2003; however, funds were  not made available until the end of the fiscal year, when additional funds  were identified from other programs.", "On September 26, 2003, the Red River Army Depot accepted an order  from the Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command totaling  $17.9 million financed with operation and maintenance funds that would  have expired on September 30, 2003. The order was for the repair and  upgrade of 41 Bradley Fighting Vehicles needed to support the war  effort in Iraq and Afghanistan. These vehicles were to be prepositioned  in the theater of operation. According to a Tank-automotive and  Armaments Command official, the order was issued late in fiscal year  2003 because the Army Materiel Command did not provide them with  funding until September 2003. An Army Materiel Command official  noted that the effort was funded by a supplemental appropriation used  to support war operations.", "The second most significant factor that contributed to the year-end orders  we reviewed\u201417 of the 68 orders (25 percent)\u2014was the identification of  new requirements at year end. Some examples of DOD customers  identifying requirements at year end include (1) a Navy aviation depot in  performing scheduled maintenance identified damage to aircraft beyond  what was originally included in its statement of work, (2) an Army depot  identified inspection requirements at year end to keep ammunition storage  inspections current and to satisfy requisitions to support the soldiers in the  field, (3) Navy aircraft repair requirements were moved from fiscal year  2004 to fiscal year 2003 to meet an earlier deployment schedule, (4) the  Army identified new requirements at year end for repair of Army assets  necessary to support ongoing military operations, and (5) the Navy  identified the need for additional capabilities for several aircraft and also  needed to perform emergency repairs on one of its aircraft carriers. Two  examples of some of the reasons for new requirements being identified at  year end follow.", "On September 27 and 30, 2004, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Center in Charleston accepted an order and an amendment from the  Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, totaling $425,000  financed with operation and maintenance funds that would have  expired on September 30, 2004. A fleet official stated that it had received  a casualty report from the USS Harry S. Truman on September 24, 2004,  indicating repairs needed to be made to the ship\u2019s announcing system.  An activity official stated that the order was accepted regardless of  carryover concerns due to the urgency associated with a casualty  report. Additionally, a fleet official noted that the time to complete the  needed repairs was limited due to the ship\u2019s impending deployment.", "On September 8, 2004, the Army Rock Island Arsenal accepted an order  from the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command totaling about $1.4  million financed with operation and maintenance funds that would have  expired on September 30, 2004. The order was for the reconditioning of  chemical biological protective shelters. The shelters mount on high-  mobility, multipurpose wheeled vehicles and provide an  environmentally controlled work area that filters out nuclear, biological,  and chemical agents. According to a logistics manager, in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2004 the Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command identified 11 shelters that needed reconditioning and issued  an order to the Army Rock Island Arsenal for the work.", "Further, we found 12 of the 68 orders (18 percent) were accepted by  working capital fund activities in the last month of the fiscal year due to  problems encountered with processing the orders. These problems  included (1) delays in processing forms through different activities and  multiple nonintegrated systems, (2) data input errors that were not  corrected until September, and (3) difficulties encountered in processing  documents and related funding from non-DOD customers to working  capital fund activities. Two examples follow.", "In July 2003, the Air National Guard Headquarters prepared  documentation that directed the Pennsylvania Air National Guard to  send its ground mobile navigation radar to the Tobyhanna Army Depot  to repair damage sustained by the radar system from multiple lightening  strikes and power surges and to overhaul the system. The order was not  accepted by the depot until September 26, 2003, about 3 months later.  The delay in acceptance of the order was due to (1) the normal time  required to process forms through six different activities using  nonintegrated systems, (2) paperwork processing delays due to missing  information, (3) confusion on how to process the workload in a new  Army system implemented in July 2003, and (4) errors made in entering  data into the Army system.", "Due to delays in correcting input errors on an order, the Warner Robins  Air Logistics Center did not accept a $2.8 million order from the F-15  program office, financed with operation and maintenance funds, until  September 17, 2004.

The assets are scheduled for maintenance  based on routine cycles, such as numbers of years since the last depot  maintenance was performed. The services include funding requirements  for these repairs in their annual budget submissions.

The order was for the scheduled maintenance of  the 39th Air National Guard KC-135E aircraft in fiscal year 2003. During  fiscal year 2001, the Air National Guard determined that 39 KC-135E  aircraft required maintenance in fiscal year 2003 in accordance with  their 5-year maintenance schedule. In fiscal year 2001, the Air National  Guard began planning and budgeting for the maintenance of these  aircraft. The 39th aircraft arrived at the air logistics center in mid- September 2003 as planned.

As we  reported in June 2005, two reasons generally caused work to carryover  into a second fiscal year. First, the depots received orders late in the fiscal  year and were unable to complete the effort by year end, as discussed in  the previous section; and second, some depots were unable to obtain the  materials/parts needed in a timely manner to complete the work. In  addition to these reasons, we found that some working capital fund  activities were unable to complete work within 1 year because of delays  caused by backlogged or other higher priority work and broken or unsafe  repair equipment. These factors have resulted in orders being carried over  for more than 1 fiscal year and increased the carryover balances for  subsequent years. As a result, these orders may not have been the most  effective use of DOD resources at that time and may not have complied  with all of the order acceptance provisions cited in the DOD Financial  Management Regulation.", "The DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 11A,  Chapters 2 and 3, prescribes regulations governing the use of orders placed  with working capital fund activities. When a working capital fund activity  accepts an order, the customer\u2019s funds financing the order are obligated.  The DOD regulation identifies a number of requirements before a working  capital fund activity accepts an order. For example, work to be performed  under the order shall be expected to begin within a reasonable time after  the order is accepted by the performing DOD activity. As a minimum  requirement, it should be documented that when an order is accepted, the  work is expected to (1) begin without delay (usually within 90 days) and   (2) be completed within the normal production period for the specific work  ordered. Further, the regulation states that no project order shall be issued  if commencement of work is contingent upon the occurrence of a future  event. Our review of 68 orders accepted by the working capital fund  activities at year end determined that work on some of these orders did not  begin within 90 days or was not completed within the normal production  period for the work being performed. The following examples illustrate  orders that were accepted by working capital fund activities at year end  and (1) may not be the most effective use of DOD resources at that time  and (2) may not have complied with all of the provisions contained in this  regulation.", "On September 25, 2003, the Crane Army Ammunition Activity accepted  an order totaling $1,885,000 that was financed with operation and  maintenance funds for X-ray work to determine the safety and usability  of 200,000 rounds of 40-millimeter high-explosive ammunition. However,  due to problems with the X-ray inspection machine, the activity had to  suspend work on the ammunition until the inspection machine was  qualified as safe to use. According to the program engineer, work was  delayed because imaging panels in the inspection machine were burning  up and had to be replaced. Compounding this problem was a delay in  the approval process for the safe operation of the machine. As a result,  very little work was completed on this order over 3 fiscal years.
