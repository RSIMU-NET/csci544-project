November 2012 marks the 10-year anniversary of MTSA, which required a wide range of security improvements. DHS is the lead federal department responsible for implementing MTSA and it relies on its component agencies, such as the Coast Guard and CBP, to help implement the act. The Coast Guard is responsible for U.S. maritime security interests and CBP is responsible for screening arriving vessel crew and cargo. This testimony summarizes GAO's work on implementation of MTSA requirements over the last decade and addresses (1) progress the federal government has made in improving maritime security and (2) key challenges that DHS and its component agencies have encountered in implementing maritime security-related programs. GAO was unable to identify all related federal spending, but estimated funding for certain programs. For example, from 2004 through May 2012, CBP obligated over $390 million to fund its program to partner with companies to review the security of their supply chains. This statement is based on GAO products issued from August 2002 through July 2012, as well as updates on the status of recommendations made and budget data obtained in August 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's work has shown that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through its component agencies, particularly the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), have made substantial progress in implementing various programs that, collectively, have improved maritime security. In general, GAO's work on maritime security programs falls under four areas: (1) security planning, (2) port facility and vessel security, (3) maritime domain awareness and information sharing, and (4) international supply chain security. DHS has, among other things, developed various maritime security programs and strategies and has implemented and exercised security plans. For example, the Coast Guard has developed Area Maritime Security Plans around the country to identify and coordinate Coast Guard procedures related to prevention, protection, and security response at domestic ports. In addition, to enhance the security of U.S. ports, the Coast Guard has implemented programs to conduct annual inspections of port facilities. To enhance the security of vessels, both CBP and the Coast Guard receive and screen advance information on commercial vessels and their crews before they arrive at U.S. ports and prepare risk assessments based on this information. Further, DHS and its component agencies have increased maritime domain awareness and have taken steps to better share information by improving risk management and implementing a vessel tracking system, among other things. For example, in July 2011, CBP developed the Small Vessel Reporting System to better track small boats arriving from foreign locations and deployed this system to eight field locations. DHS and its component agencies have also taken actions to improve international supply chain security, including developing new technologies to detect contraband, implementing programs to inspect U.S.-bound cargo at foreign ports, and establishing partnerships with the trade industry community and foreign governments.", "Although DHS and its components have made substantial progress, they have encountered challenges in implementing initiatives and programs to enhance maritime security since the enactment of the Maritime Security Transportation Act (MTSA) in 2002 in the areas of: (1) program management and implementation; (2) partnerships and collaboration; (3) resources, funding, and sustainability; and (4) performance measures. For example, CBP designed and implemented an initiative that placed CBP staff at foreign seaports to work with host nation customs officials to identify high-risk, U.S.-bound container cargo, but CBP initially did not have a strategic or workforce plan to guide its efforts. Further, the Coast Guard faced collaboration challenges when developing and implementing its information management system for enhancing information sharing with key federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies because it did not systematically solicit input from these stakeholders. Budget and funding decisions have also affected the implementation of maritime security programs. For example, Coast Guard data indicate that some of its units are not able to meet self-imposed standards related to certain security activities--including boarding and escorting vessels. In addition, DHS has experienced challenges in developing effective performance measures for assessing the progress of its maritime security programs. For example, the Coast Guard developed a performance measure to assess its performance in reducing maritime risk, but has faced challenges using this measure to inform decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations to DHS in prior reports and testimonies to strengthen its maritime security programs.

For example, we were not able to determine obligations for many of the  MTSA-related Coast Guard programs\u2014such as port security exercises\u2014 because they are funded at the account level (i.e., operating expenses)  rather than as specific line items. However, we were able to estimate  obligations or expenditures in some instances. For example, from fiscal  years 2004 through May 2012, CBP obligated over $390 million for a  voluntary program that enables CBP officials to work in partnership with  private companies to review and validate companies\u2019 practices for  securing their international supply chains.", "In addition to the statement, appendix I summarizes select programs and  activities that have been implemented since November 2002 to address  maritime security and the associated expenditures, where information  was available.

For example, the President and the Secretaries of Homeland  Security, Defense, and State approved the National Strategy for  Maritime Security and its supporting plans in 2005. The strategy has  eight supporting plans that are intended to address the specific  threats and challenges of the maritime environment, such as maritime  commerce security. We reported in June 2008 that these plans were  generally well developed and, collectively, included desirable  characteristics, such as (1) purpose, scope, and methodology; (2)  problem definition and risk assessment; (3) organizational roles,  responsibilities, and coordination; and (4) integration and  implementation. Including these characteristics in the strategy and its  supporting plans can help the federal government enhance maritime  security. For example, better problem definition and risk assessment  provide greater latitude to responsible parties for developing  approaches that are tailored to the needs of their specific regions or  sectors. In addition, in April 2008 DHS released its Small Vessel  Security Strategy, which identified the gravest risk scenarios involving  the use of small vessels for launching terrorist attacks, as well as  specific goals where efforts can achieve the greatest risk reduction  across the maritime domain.", "Developing port-level security plans: The Coast Guard has  developed Area Maritime Security Plans (AMSP) around the country  to enhance the security of domestic ports. AMSPs, which are  developed by the Coast Guard with input from applicable  governmental and private entities, serve as the primary means to  identify and coordinate Coast Guard procedures related to prevention,  protection, and security response. Implementing regulations for MTSA  specified that these plans include, among other things, (1) operational  and physical security measures that can be intensified if security  threats warrant it; (2) procedures for responding to security threats,  including provisions for maintaining operations at domestic ports; and  (3) procedures to facilitate the recovery of the maritime transportation  system after a security incident. We reported in October 2007 that to  assist domestic ports in implementing the AMSPs, the Coast Guard  provided a common template that specified the responsibilities of port  stakeholders. Further, the Coast Guard has established Area  Maritime Security Committees\u2014forums that involve federal and  nonfederal officials who identify and address risks in a port\u2014to,  among other things, provide advice to the Coast Guard for developing  the associated AMSPs. These plans provide a framework for  communication and coordination among port stakeholders and law  enforcement officials and identify and reduce vulnerabilities to security  threats throughout the port area.", "Exercising security plans: DHS has taken a number of steps to  exercise its security plans. The Coast Guard and the Area Maritime  Security Committee are required to conduct or participate in exercises  to test the effectiveness of AMSPs at least once each calendar year,  with no more than 18 months between exercises. These exercises  are designed to continually improve preparedness by validating  information and procedures in the AMSPs, identifying strengths and  weaknesses, and practicing command and control within an incident  command/unified command framework. To aid in this effort, the Coast  Guard initiated the Area Maritime Security Training and Exercise  Program in October 2005. This program is designed to involve all port  stakeholders in the implementation of the AMSPs. Our prior work has  shown that the Coast Guard has exercised these plans and that, since  development of the AMSPs, all Area Maritime Security Committees  have participated in a port security exercise. Lessons learned from  the exercises are incorporated into plans, which Coast Guard officials  said lead to planning process improvements and better plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Port Facility and Vessel Security", "paragraphs": ["In addition to developing security plans, DHS has taken a number of  actions to identify and address the risks to port facilities and vessels by  conducting facility inspections and screening and boarding vessels,  among other things.", "Requiring facility security plans and conducting inspections: To  enhance the security of port facilities, the Coast Guard has  implemented programs to require port facility security plans and to  conduct annual inspections of the facilities. Owners and operators of  certain maritime facilities are required to conduct assessments of  security vulnerabilities, develop security plans to mitigate these  vulnerabilities, and implement measures called for in their security  plans. Coast Guard guidance calls for at least one announced and  one unannounced inspection each year to ensure that security plans  are being followed. We reported in February 2008, on the basis of  these inspections, the Coast Guard had identified and corrected port  facility deficiencies. For example, the Coast Guard identified  deficiencies in about one-third of the port facilities inspected from  2004 through 2006, with deficiencies concentrated in certain  categories, such as failing to follow facility security plans for port  access control. In addition to inspecting port facilities, the Coast  Guard also conducts inspections at offshore facilities, such as oil rigs.  Requiring the development of these security plans and inspecting  facilities to correct deficiencies helps the Coast Guard mitigate  vulnerabilities that could be exploited by those with the intent to kill  people, cause environmental damage, or disrupt transportation  systems and the economy.", "Issuing facility access cards: DHS and its component agencies  have made less progress in controlling access to secure areas of port  facilities and vessels. To control access to these areas, DHS was  required by MTSA to, among other things, issue a transportation  worker identification credential that uses biometrics, such as  fingerprints. TSA had already initiated a program to create an  identification credential that could be used by workers in all modes of  transportation when MTSA was enacted. This program, called the  Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program, is  designed to collect personal and biometric information to validate  workers\u2019 identities and to conduct background checks on  transportation workers to ensure they do not pose a threat to security.  We reported in November 2009 that TSA, the Coast Guard, and the  maritime industry took a number of steps to enroll 1,121,461 workers  in the TWIC program, or over 93 percent of the estimated 1.2 million  potential users, by the April 15, 2009, national compliance deadline.  However, as discussed later in this statement, internal control  weaknesses governing the enrollment, background check process,  and use of these credentials potentially limit the program\u2019s ability to  provide reasonable assurance that access to secure areas of MTSA- regulated facilities is restricted to qualified individuals.", "Administering the Port Security Grant Program: DHS has taken  steps to improve the security of port facilities by administering the Port  Security Grant Program. To help defray some of the costs of  implementing security at ports around the United States, this program  was established in January 2002 when TSA was appropriated $93.3  million to award grants to critical national seaports. MTSA codified  the program when it was enacted in November 2002. The Port  Security Grant Program awards funds to states, localities, and private  port operators to strengthen the nation\u2019s ports against risks  associated with potential terrorist attacks. We reported in November  2011 that, for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, allocations of these funds  were based on DHS\u2019s risk model and implementation decisions, and  were made largely in accordance with risk. For example, we found  that allocations of funds to port areas were highly positively correlated  to port risk, as calculated by DHS\u2019s risk model.", "Reviewing vessel plans and conducting inspections: To enhance  vessel security, the Coast Guard has taken steps to help vessel  owners and operators develop security plans and the Coast Guard  regularly inspects these vessels for compliance with the plans. MTSA  requires certain vessel owners and operators to develop security  plans, and the Coast Guard is to approve these plans.  Vessel  security plans are to designate security officers; include information  on procedures for establishing and maintaining physical security,  passenger and cargo security, and personnel security; describe  training and drills, and identify the availability of appropriate security  measures necessary to deter transportation security incidents, among  other things. The Coast Guard took several steps to help vessel  owners and operators understand and comply with these  requirements. In particular, the Coast Guard (1) issued updated  guidance and established a \u201chelp desk\u201d to provide stakeholders with a  single point of contact, both through the Internet and over the  telephone; (2) hired contractors to provide expertise in reviewing  vessel security plans; and (3) conducts regular inspections of vessels.  For example, we reported in December 2010 that, according to Coast  Guard officials, the Coast Guard is to inspect ferries four times per  year. The annual security inspection, which may be combined with a  safety inspection and typically occurs when the ferry is out of service,  and the quarterly inspections, which are shorter in duration, and  generally take place while the ferry remains in service.

Among the risk factors considered in assessing each vessel and crew  member are whether the vessel operator has had past instances of  invalid or incorrect crew manifest lists, whether the vessel has a  history of seafarers unlawfully landing in the United States, or whether  the vessel is making its first arrival at a U.S. seaport within the past  year. The Coast Guard may also conduct armed security boardings of  arriving commercial vessels based on various factors, including the  intelligence it received to examine crew passports and visas, among  other things, to ensure the submitted crew lists are accurate.", "Conducting vessel escorts and boardings: The Coast Guard  escorts and boards certain vessels to help ensure their security. The  Coast Guard escorts a certain percentage of high capacity passenger  vessels\u2014cruise ships, ferries, and excursion vessels\u2014to protect  against an external threat, such as a waterborne improvised explosive  device. The Coast Guard has provided escorts for cruise ships to help  prevent waterside attacks and has also provided a security presence  on passenger ferries during their transit.

We reported in  November 2011 that MSRAM provides the Coast Guard with a  standardized way of assessing risk to maritime infrastructure, such as  chemical facilities, oil refineries, and ferry and cruise ship terminals,  among others. Coast Guard units throughout the country use this  model to improve maritime domain awareness and better assess  security risks to key maritime infrastructure.", "Establishing Area Maritime Security Committees: To facilitate  information sharing with port partners and in response to MTSA,Coast Guard has established Area Maritime Security Committees.  These committees are typically composed of members from federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies; maritime industry and  labor organizations; and other port stakeholders that may be affected  by security policies.

These interagency operations  centers are designed to, among other things, improve maritime  domain awareness and the sharing of information among port  partners. In October 2007, we reported that the Coast Guard was  piloting various aspects of future interagency operations centers at its  35 existing command centers and working with multiple interagency  partners to further their development. We further reported in  February 2012 that DHS had also begun to support efforts to increase  port partner participation and further interagency operations center  implementation, such as facilitating the review of an interagency  operations center management directive. However, as discussed  later in this statement, despite the DHS assistance, the Coast Guard  has experienced coordination challenges that have limited  implementation of interagency operations centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Supply Chain Security", "paragraphs": ["DHS and its component agencies have implemented a number of  programs and activities intended to improve the security of the  international supply chain, including: enhancing cargo screening and  inspections, deploying new cargo screening technologies to better detect  contraband, implementing programs to inspect U.S.-bound cargo at  foreign ports, partnering with the trade industry, and engaging with  international partners.", "Enhancing cargo screening and inspections: DHS has  implemented several programs to enhance the screening of cargo  containers in advance of their arrival in the United States. In  particular, DHS developed a system for screening incoming cargo,  called the Automated Targeting System. The Automated Targeting  System is a computerized system that assesses information on each  cargo shipment that is to arrive in the United States to assign a risk  score. CBP officers then use this risk score, along with other  information, such as the shipment\u2019s contents, to determine which  shipments to examine. In February 2003, CBP began enforcing new  regulations about cargo manifests\u2014called the 24 hour rule\u2014that  requires the submission of complete and accurate manifest  information 24 hours before a container is loaded onto a U.S.-bound  vessel at a foreign port. To enhance CBP\u2019s ability to target high-risk  shipments, the SAFE Port Act required CBP to collect additional  information related to the movement of cargo to better identify high- risk cargo for inspection. In response to this requirement, in 2009,  CBP implemented the Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier  Requirements, collectively known as the 10+2 rule. The cargo  information required by the 10+2 rule comprises 10 data elements  from importers, such as country of origin, and 2 data elements from  vessel carriers, such as the position of each container transported on  a vessel (or stow plan), that are to be provided to CBP in advance of  arrival of a shipment at a U.S. port. These additional data elements  can enhance maritime security. For example, during our review of  CBP\u2019s supply chain security efforts in 2010, CBP officials stated that  access to vessel stow plans has enhanced their ability to identify  containers that are not correctly listed on manifests that could  potentially pose a security risk in that no information is known about  their origin or contents.", "Deploying technologies: DHS technological improvements have  been focused on developing and deploying equipment to scan cargo  containers for nuclear materials and other contraband to better secure  the supply chain.

CBP launched CSI in January 2002 and the  initiative involves partnerships between CBP and foreign customs  agencies in select countries to allow for the targeting and examination  of U.S.-bound cargo containers before they reach U.S. ports. As part  of this initiative, CBP officers use intelligence and automated risk  assessment information to identify those U.S.-bound cargo shipments  at risk of containing weapons of mass destruction or other terrorist  contraband. We reported in January 2008 that through CSI, CBP has  placed staff at 58 foreign seaports that, collectively, account for about  86 percent of the container shipments to the United States.  According to CBP officials, the overseas presence of CBP officials  has led to more effective information sharing between CBP and host  government officials regarding targeting of U.S.-bound shipments.", "Partnering with the trade industry: CBP efforts to improve supply  chain security include partnering with members of the trade industry.  In an effort to strike a balance between the need to secure the  international supply chain while also facilitating the flow of legitimate  commerce, CBP developed and administers the Customs-Trade  Partnership Against Terrorism program. The program is voluntary and  enables CBP officials to work in partnership with private companies to  review the security of their international supply chains and improve  the security of their shipments to the United States. For example,  participating companies develop security measures and agree to  allow CBP to verify, among other things, that their security measures  (1) meet or exceed CBP\u2019s minimum security requirements and (2) are  actually in place and effective. In return for their participation,  members receive benefits, such as a reduced number of inspections  or shorter wait times for their cargo shipments. CBP initiated the  Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program in November  2001, and as of November 2010, the most recent date for which we  had data, CBP had awarded initial certification\u2014or acceptance of the  company\u2019s agreement to voluntarily participate in the program\u2014to  over 10,000 companies.

For example, CBP quickly designed  and rolled out CSI in January 2002. However, as we reported in July  2003, CBP initially did not have a strategic plan or workforce plan for  this security program, which are essential to long-term success and  accountability. As a result, CBP subsequently had to take actions to  address these risks by, for example, developing CSI goals. The  Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program experienced  similar problems. For example, when the program was first  implemented, CBP lacked a human capital plan. CBP has taken steps  to address C-TPAT management and staffing challenges, including  implementing a human capital plan.", "Lack of adequate internal controls: Several maritime security  programs implemented by DHS and its component agencies did not  have adequate internal controls. For example, we reported in May  2011 that internal controls over the TWIC program were not designed  to provide reasonable assurance that only qualified applicants could  acquire the credentials. During covert tests at several selected ports,  our investigators were successful in accessing ports using counterfeit  credentials and authentic credentials acquired through fraudulent  means. As a result of our findings, DHS is in the process of  assessing internal controls to identify needed corrective actions. In  another example, we found that the Coast Guard did not have  procedures in place to ensure that its field units conducted security  inspections of offshore energy facilities annually in accordance with its  guidance. In response to this finding, the Coast Guard has taken  steps to update its inspections database to ensure inspections of  offshore facilities are completed.", "Inadequate acquisitions management: DHS has also experienced  challenges managing some of its acquisition programs. As discussed  earlier, CBP coordinated with DNDO to deploy radiation detection  monitors at U.S. ports of entry. However, we reported in June 2009  that DHS\u2019s cost analysis of one type of device\u2014the advanced  spectroscopic portal radiation detection monitors\u2014did not provide a  sound analytical basis for DHS\u2019s decision to deploy the devices.  DNDO officials stated that they planned to update the cost-benefit  analysis; however, after spending more than $200 million on the  program, DHS announced, in February 2010, that it was scaling back  its plans for development and use of the devices, and subsequently  announced, in July 2011, that it was ending the program. DNDO was  also involved in developing more advanced nonintrusive inspection  equipment\u2014the cargo advanced automated radiography system\u2014in  order to better detect nuclear materials that might be heavily shielded.  In September 2010 we reported that DNDO was engaged in the  research and development phase while simultaneously planning for  the acquisition phase and pursued the acquisition and deployment of  the radiography machines without fully understanding that the  machines would not fit within existing inspection lanes at CBP ports of  entry because it had not sufficiently coordinated the operating  requirements with CBP.ended up canceling the acquisition and deployment phase of the  program in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Partnerships and Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["DHS has improved how it collaborates with maritime security partners,  but challenges in this area remain that stem from issues such as the  launch of programs without adequate stakeholder coordination and  problems inherent in working with a wide variety of stakeholders.", "Lack of port partner coordination: The Coast Guard experienced  coordination challenges in developing its information-management  and sharing system, called WatchKeeper, which is designed to  enhance information sharing with law enforcement agencies and other  partners. In particular, we found in February 2012 that the Coast  Guard did not systematically solicit input from key federal, state, and  local law enforcement agencies that are its port partners at the  interagency operations centers, and that port partner involvement in  the development of WatchKeeper requirements and the interagency  operations center concept was primarily limited to CBP. As a result,  this lack of port partner input has jeopardized such centers from  meeting their intended purpose of improving information sharing and  enhancing maritime domain awareness. We reported that the Coast  Guard had begun to better coordinate with its port partners to solicit  their input on WatchKeeper requirements, but noted that the Coast  Guard still faced challenges in getting other port partners to use  WatchKeeper as an information sharing tool. We further found that  DHS did not initially assist the Coast Guard in encouraging other DHS  components to use WatchKeeper to enhance information sharing.  However, DHS had increased its involvement in the program so we  did not make any recommendations relative to this issue. We did,  however, recommend that the Coast Guard implement a more  systematic process to solicit and incorporate port partner input to  WatchKeeper and the Coast Guard has begun to take actions to  address this recommendation. We believe, though, that it is too soon  to tell if such efforts will be successful in ensuring that the interagency  operations centers serve as more than Coast Guard\u2013centric  command and control centers.", "Challenges in coordinating with multiple levels of stakeholders:  One example of challenges that DHS and its component agencies  have faced with state, local, and tribal stakeholders concerns Coast  Guard planning for Arctic operations. The Coast Guard\u2019s success in  implementing an Arctic plan rests in part on how successfully it  communicates with key stakeholders\u2014including the more than 200  Alaska native tribal governments and interest groups\u2014but we found in  September 2010 that the Coast Guard did not initially share plans with  them. Coast Guard officials told us that they had been focused on  communication with congressional and federal stakeholders and  intended to share Arctic plans with other stakeholders once plans  were determined. DHS agrees that it needs to communicate with  additional stakeholders and has taken steps to do so.", "Difficulties in coordinating with other federal agencies: DHS has  at times experienced challenges coordinating with other federal  agencies to enhance maritime security. For example, we reported in  September 2010 that federal agencies, including DHS, had  collaborated with international and industry partners to counter piracy,  but they had not implemented some key practices for enhancing and  sustaining collaboration. Somali pirates have attacked hundreds of  ships and taken thousands of hostages since 2007. As Somalia lacks  a functioning government and is unable to repress piracy in its waters,  the National Security Council\u2014the President\u2019s principal arm for  coordinating national security policy among government agencies\u2014 developed the interagency Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa:  Partnership and Action Plan (Action Plan) in December 2008 to  prevent, disrupt, and prosecute piracy off the Horn of Africa in  collaboration with international and industry partners. According to  U.S. and international stakeholders, the U.S. government has shared  information with partners for military coordination. However, agencies  have made less progress on several key efforts that involve multiple  agencies\u2014such as those to address piracy through strategic  communications, disrupt pirate finances, and hold pirates  accountable\u2014in part because the Action Plan does not designate  which agencies should lead or carry out 13 of the 14 tasks. We  recommended that the National Security Council bolster interagency  collaboration and the U.S. contribution to counterpiracy efforts by  clarifying agency roles and responsibilities and encouraging the  agencies to develop joint guidance to implement their efforts. In March  2011, a National Security Staff official stated that an interagency  policy review will examine roles and responsibilities and  implementation actions to focus U.S. efforts for the next several years.", "Difficulties in coordinating with private sector stakeholders: In  some cases progress has been hindered because of difficulties in  coordination with private sector stakeholders. For example, CBP  program officials reported in 2010 that having access to Passenger  Name Record data for cruise line passengers\u2014such as a passenger\u2019s  full itinerary, reservation booking date, phone number, and billing  information\u2014could offer security benefits similar to those derived from  screening airline passengers. However, CBP does not require this  information from all cruise lines on a systematic basis because CBP  officials stated that they would need further knowledge about the  cruise lines\u2019 connectivity capabilities to estimate the cost to both CBP  and the cruise lines to obtain such passenger data. In April 2010, we  recommended that CBP conduct a study to determine whether  requiring cruise lines to provide automated Passenger Name Record  data to CBP on a systematic basis would benefit homeland security.", "In July 2011, CBP reported that it had conducted site surveys at three  ports of entry to assess the advantage of having cruise line booking  data considered in a national targeting process, and had initial  discussions with a cruise line association on the feasibility of CBP  gaining national access to cruise line booking data.", "Limitations in working with international stakeholders: DHS and  its component agencies face inherent challenges and limitations  working with international partners because of sovereignty issues. For  example, we reported in July 2010 that sovereignty concerns have  limited the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to assess the security of foreign  ports. In particular, reluctance by some countries to allow the Coast  Guard to visit their ports because of concerns over sovereignty was a  challenge cited by Coast Guard officials who were trying to complete  port visits under the International Port Security Program. According  to the Coast Guard officials, before permitting Coast Guard officials to  visit their ports, some countries insisted on visiting and assessing a  sample of U.S ports. Similarly, we reported in April 2005 that CBP had  developed a staffing model for CSI to determine staffing needs at  foreign ports to implement the program, but was unable to fully staff  some ports because of the need for host government permission,  among other diplomatic and practical considerations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources, Funding, and Sustainability", "paragraphs": ["Economic constraints, such as declining revenues and increased security  costs, have required DHS to make choices about how to allocate its  resources to most effectively address human capital issues and sustain  the programs and activities it has implemented to enhance maritime  security.", "Human capital shortfalls: Human capital issues continue to pose a  challenge to maritime security. For example, we reported in  November 2011 that Coast Guard officials from 21 of its 35 sectors  (60 percent) told us that limited staff time posed a challenge to  incorporating MSRAM into strategic, operational, and tactical planning  efforts. Similarly, Coast Guard officials responsible for conducting  maritime facility inspections in 4 of the 7 sectors we visited to support  our 2008 report on inspections said meeting all mission requirements  for which they were responsible was or could be a challenge because  of more stringent inspection requirements and a lack of inspectors,  among other things. Officials in another sector said available staffing  could adequately cover only part of the sector\u2019s area of  responsibility.", "Budget and funding constraints: Budget and funding decisions also  affect the implementation of maritime security programs. For example,  within the constrained fiscal environment that the federal government  is operating, the Coast Guard has had to prioritize its activities and  Coast Guard data indicate that some units are not able to meet self- imposed standards related to certain security activities\u2014including  boarding and escorting vessels. We reported in October 2007 that this  prioritization of activities had also led to a decrease in resources the  Coast Guard had available to provide technical assistance to foreign  countries to improve their port security. To overcome this, Coast  Guard officials have worked with other agencies, such as the  Departments of Defense and State, and international organizations,  such as the Organization of American States, to secure funding for  training and assistance. Further, in the fiscal year 2013 budget, the  Coast Guard will have less funding to sustain current assets needed  for security missions so that more funds will be available for its top  priority\u2014long-term recapitalization of vessels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge that DHS and its component agencies have faced in  implementing maritime security-related programs has been the lack of  adequate performance measures. In particular, DHS has not always  implemented standard practices in performance management. These  practices include, among other things, collecting reliable and accurate  data, using data to support missions, and developing outcome measures.", "Lack of reliable and accurate data: DHS and its component  agencies have experienced challenges collecting complete, accurate,  and reliable data. For example, in January 2011 we reported that both  CBP and the Coast Guard tracked the frequency of illegal seafarer  incidents at U.S. seaports, but the records of these incidents varied  considerably among the two component agencies and between the  agencies\u2019 field and headquarters units.  As a result, the data DHS  used to inform its strategic and tactical plans were of undetermined  reliability. We recommended that CBP and the Coast Guard  determine why their data varied and jointly establish a process for  sharing and reconciling records of illegal seafarer entries at U.S.  seaports. DHS concurred and has made progress in addressing the  recommendation. Another example of a lack of reliable or accurate  data pertains to the Maritime Information for Safety & Law  Enforcement database (MISLE). The MISLE database is the Coast  Guard\u2019s primary data system for documenting facility inspections and  other activities, but flaws in this database have limited the Coast  Guard\u2019s ability to accurately assess these activities. For example,  during the course of our 2011 review of security inspections of  offshore energy infrastructure, we found inconsistencies in how  offshore facility inspection results and other data were recorded in  MISLE. In July 2011, and partly in response to our review, the Coast  Guard issued new MISLE guidance on documenting the annual  security inspections of offshore facilities in MISLE and distributed this  guidance to all relevant field units. While this action should improve  accountability, the updated guidance does not address all of the  limitations we noted with the MISLE database.", "Not using data to manage programs: DHS and its component  agencies have not always had or used performance information to  manage their missions. For example, work we completed in 2008  showed that Coast Guard officials used MISLE to review the results of  inspectors\u2019 data entries for individual maritime facilities, but the  officials did not use the data to evaluate the facility inspection program  overall. We found that a more thorough evaluation of the facility  compliance program could provide information on, for example, the  variations we identified between Coast Guard units in oversight  approaches, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach,  and whether some approaches work better than others.", "Lack of outcome-based performance measures: DHS and its  component agencies have also experienced difficulties developing  and using performance measures that focus on outcomes. Outcome- based performance measures describe the intended result of carrying  out a program or activity. For example, although CBP had  performance measures in place for its Customs-Trade Partnership  Against Terrorism program, these measures focused on program  participation and facilitating trade and travel and not on improving  supply chain security, which is the program\u2019s purpose. We  recommended in July 2003, March 2005, and April 2008 that CBP  develop outcome-based performance measures for this program. In  response to our recommendations, CBP has identified measures to  quantify actions required and to gauge Customs-Trade Partnership  Against Terrorism\u2019s impact on supply chain security. The Coast Guard  has faced similar issues with developing and using outcome-based  performance measures. For example, we reported in November 2011  that the Coast Guard developed a measure to report its performance  in reducing maritime risk, but faced challenges using this measure to  inform decisions. The Coast Guard has improved the measure to  make it more valid and reliable and believes it is a useful proxy  measure of performance, but notes that developing outcome-based  performance measures is challenging because of limited historical  data on maritime terrorist attacks. Given the uncertainties in  estimating risk reduction, though, it is unclear if the measure will  provide meaningful performance information with which to track  progress over time. Similarly, FEMA has experienced difficulties  developing outcome-based performance measures. For example, in  November 2011 we reported that FEMA was developing performance  measures to assess its administration of the Port Security Grant  Program, but had not implemented measures to assess the program\u2019s  grant effectiveness.  FEMA has taken initial steps to develop  measures to assess the effectiveness of its grant programs, but it  does not have a plan and related milestones for implementing  measures specifically for the Port Security Grant Program. Without  such performance measures it could be difficult for FEMA to  effectively manage the process of assessing whether the program is  achieving its stated purpose of strengthening critical maritime  infrastructure against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks.  We recommended that DHS develop a plan with milestones for  implementing performance measures for the Port Security Grant  Program. DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that  FEMA is taking actions to implement it.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this completes my  prepared statement.

The four  characteristics that are addressed include: (1) purpose, scope, and methodology;  (2) problem definition and risk assessment; (3) organizational roles,  responsibilities, and coordination; and (4) integration and implementation. The  two characteristics that are partially addressed are: (1) goals, objectives,  activities, and performance measures and (2) resources, investments, and risk  management.

However, in other work reported on in  August 2007, we noted the existence of performance measures for individual  maritime security programs. These characteristics are partially addressed  primarily because the strategy and its plans did not contain information on  performance measures and the resources and investments elements of these  characteristics. The resources, investments, and risk management characteristic  is also partially addressed. While the strategic actions and recommendations  discussed in the maritime security strategy and supporting implementation plans  constitute an approach to minimizing risk and investing resources, the strategy  and seven of its supporting implementation plans did not include information on  the sources and types of resources needed for their implementation.

As of July 2012, CBP has  made such arrangements with five  countries and an economic union as  part of its efforts to partner with  international organizations and  develop supply chain security  standards that can be implemented  throughout the international  community.", "In our work on international supply chain security we reported that CBP has  recognized that the United States is no longer self-contained in security  matters\u2014either in its problems or its solutions. That is, the growing  interdependence of nations necessitates that policymakers work in partnerships  across national boundaries to improve supply chain security. We also reported  that other countries are interested in developing customs-to-business partnership  programs similar to CBP\u2019s C-TPAT program. Other countries are also interested  in bi-lateral or multi-lateral arrangements with other countries to mutually  recognize each others\u2019 supply chain container security programs. For example,  officials within the European Union and elsewhere see the C-TPAT program as  one potential model for enhancing global supply chain security. Thus, CBP has  committed to promoting mutual recognition arrangements based on an  international framework of standards governing customs and related business  relationships in order to enhance global supply chain security. Our work on other  programs indicated that CBP does not always have critical information on other  countries\u2019 customs examination procedures and practices, even at CSI ports  where we have stationed officers. However, our reports to date have not made  any specific recommendations related to mutual recognition arrangements.", "According to CBP, a network of  mutual recognition could lead to  greater efficiency in improving  international supply chain security by,  for example, reducing redundant  examinations of cargo containers and  avoiding the unnecessary burden of  addressing different sets of  requirements as a shipment moves  throughout the global supply chain.   CBP and other international customs  officials see mutual recognition  arrangements as providing a possible  strategy for the CSI program (which  includes stationing CBP officers  abroad).

The underlying  assumption for the program is that the  security of domestic ports also  depends upon security at foreign  ports where vessels and cargoes  bound for the United States originate.", "MTSA required the Coast Guard to  develop such a program to assess  security measures in foreign ports  and, among other things, recommend  steps necessary to improve security  measures in those ports. To address  this requirement, the Coast Guard  established the International Port  Security Program in April 2004.  Subsequently, in October 2006, the  SAFE Port Act required the Coast  Guard to reassess security measures  at such foreign ports at least once  every 3 years (46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70108,  70109).", "Our work on the International Port Security Program found that the Coast Guard  had made progress in visiting and assessing port security in foreign ports. We  reported in October 2007 that the Coast Guard had visited more than 100  countries and found that most of the countries had substantially implemented the  ISPS code. The Coast Guard had also consulted with a contractor to develop a  more risk-based approach to planning foreign country visits, such as  incorporating information on corruption and terrorist activities levels within a  country. The Coast Guard has made progress despite a number of challenges.  For example, the Coast Guard has been able to alleviate challenges related to  sovereignty concerns of some countries by including a reciprocal visit feature in  which the Coast Guard hosts foreign delegations to visit U.S. ports and observe  ISPS Code implementation in the United States. Another challenge program  officials overcame was the lack of resources to improve security in poorer  countries. Specifically, Coast Guard officials worked with other federal agencies  (e.g., the Departments of Defense and State) and international organizations  (e.g., the Organization of American States) to secure funding for training and  assistance to poorer countries that need to strengthen port security efforts.", "In implementing the program, the  Coast Guard uses the International  Maritime Organization\u2019s International  Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS)  Code. This code serves as the  benchmark by which it measures the  effectiveness of a country\u2019s  antiterrorism measures in a port.
