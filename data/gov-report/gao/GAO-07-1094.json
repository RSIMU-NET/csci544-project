RUS obligated the majority of these funds--about $4.2 billion--to about 2,800 projects. Of this $4.2 billion, RUS loans accounted for about $2.7 billion, and RUS grants accounted for about $1.5 billion. EDA, Reclamation, and the Corps, combined, obligated a total of about $500 million in grants to rural communities for about 300 water projects. RUS, EDA, Reclamation, and the Corps fund similar rural water supply and wastewater projects, but they have varied eligibility criteria that limit funding to certain communities based on population size, economic need, or geographic location. RUS, EDA, and the Corps provide funding for both water supply and wastewater projects, while Reclamation provides funding only for water supply projects. Eligible water projects can include constructing or upgrading distribution lines, treatment plants, and pumping stations. RUS and EDA have formal nationwide programs with standardized eligibility criteria and processes under which communities compete for funding. In contrast, Reclamation and the Corps fund water projects in defined geographic locations under explicit congressional authorizations. In 2006 the Congress passed the Rural Water Supply Act, directing Reclamation to develop a rural water supply program with standard eligibility criteria. The Corps continues to fund rural water supply and wastewater projects under specific congressional authorizations, many of which are pilot programs. The Congress required the Corps to evaluate the effectiveness of these various pilot programs and recommend whether they should be implemented on a national basis. The Corps has only completed some of the required evaluations and, in most cases, has not made the recommendations that the Congress requested about whether or not the projects carried out under these pilot programs should be implemented on a national basis."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 90 percent of public water supply systems and 70 percent of  wastewater systems throughout the United States serve communities with  populations of fewer than 10,000, usually in rural areas.

However, rural areas typically lack  adequate funds for constructing and upgrading water supply and  wastewater treatment facilities. Urban areas can take advantage of  economies of scale by spreading the costs of projects among larger  populations, which rural areas cannot. According to EPA, the per- household cost for water supply and wastewater projects in these areas is  almost four times more than the per-household cost of similar projects in  more urban areas. As a result, communities in rural areas often have to  rely on federal grants and loans to help finance their water supply and  wastewater projects.", "As we reported in 2005, while several federal agencies provide funding for  rural water supply and wastewater projects, these projects are primarily  funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service  (RUS), the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development  Administration (EDA), the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Reclamation (Reclamation), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  (Corps). Historically, RUS has provided grants and loans to construct or  improve water supply and wastewater facilities in rural areas. Similarly,  EDA has provided grants to economically distressed communities,  including those in rural areas, to revitalize, expand, and upgrade their  physical infrastructure, which includes water supply and wastewater  facilities. In contrast, Reclamation has traditionally funded large water  infrastructure projects to irrigate the arid western states, while the Corps  has primarily funded water-related infrastructure for inland navigation and  flood control purposes.

Alternatively,  to receive a loan, the community must certify in writing, and RUS must  determine, that the community is unable to finance the proposed project  from their own resources or through commercial credit at reasonable rates  and terms. For projects also funded through RUS loans, RUS requires the  community to charge user fees that, at a minimum, cover the costs of  operating and maintaining the water system while also meeting the  required principal and interest payments on the loan. For example, RUS  provided the Wood Creek Water District, located in Laurel County,  Kentucky, a $1 million grant and a $7.98 million loan for a major water  treatment plant expansion. A Wood Creek official told us that the water  district had attempted to obtain a loan from a commercial lender;  however, the loan would have had an interest rate of 7 percent and a term  of 20 years, which would have rendered the project financially unfeasible.  According to RUS, Wood Creek was able to receive a loan with an interest  rate of 4.3 percent and a term of 40 years, thereby significantly reducing  the annual loan payments.

Furthermore, according to documentation  provided by Reclamation officials, these indirect cost rates were updated  each fiscal year.

General and  administrative overhead includes administrative and support costs  incurred in the day-to-day operations of a district.
