Taken together, the more than 200 BBA Medicare mandates amount to what are probably the most significant modifications to the program since its inception 30 years ago. For example, the new Medicare+Choice provisions of BBA will enable beneficiaries to enroll in different types of health plans previously excluded from the Medicare program, while the introduction of prospective payment systems will alter how reimbursements are made to skilled nursing facilities (SNF), home health agencies, hospital outpatient departments, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Collectively, the objective behind these changes is to better control the growth in Medicare expenditures while simultaneously moving the program away from its fee-for-service orientation and toward greater acceptance of the different types of managed care already available to those with private health insurance. You asked me to give an overview of how HCFA\u2019s implementation has progressed since our testimony earlier this year. In addition to this overview, my testimony will provide more detailed comments on two key program elements scheduled for implementation this year that have been the subject of extensive GAO work: (1) the efforts to inform Medicare beneficiaries about the expanded health plan choices available to them in 1999, commonly referred to as the \u201cinformation campaign,\u201d and (2) the prospective payment system (PPS) for SNFs, which began a 3-year phase-in this month.", "To prepare this testimony, we analyzed HCFA reports that track the implementation of BBA mandates and discussed their status with HCFA officials. We also drew on our previous as well as ongoing work assessing the information HCFA and health plans provide to beneficiaries; HCFA\u2019s responsibilities under BBA for a new, annual information campaign; and the financing for that campaign. Finally, we analyzed HCFA\u2019s interim final rule dated May 12, 1998, that describes the new PPS and consolidated billing for SNFs. Our analysis relied on (1) discussions with HCFA officials and Medicare contractor staff; (2) the lessons learned from implementing the PPS for inpatient hospital services, which has been in place since the mid-1980s; and (3) our prior work on SNF services.", "In summary, HCFA is making progress in meeting the legislatively established implementation schedules. Since the passage of BBA in August 1997, almost three-fourths of the mandates with a July 1998 deadline have been implemented. HCFA\u2019s recent publication of the Medicare+Choice and SNF PPS implementing regulations demonstrates that progress. However, HCFA officials have acknowledged that many remaining BBA mandates will not be implemented on time. In particular, they point out that achieving compliance with Year-2000 computer requirements, a critical agency priority, competes with BBA mandates for computer system resources and, as a result, implementation of a number of BBA mandates will be delayed. HCFA maintains that these delays will have a \u201cminimal\u201d impact on anticipated Medicare program savings.", "Given the concurrent competition for limited resources and the differing importance and complexity of the many BBA mandates, the success or failure of HCFA\u2019s implementation efforts should not be judged solely on meeting deadlines. Rather, any assessment should consider whether the agency is meeting congressional objectives while taking a reasoned management approach to identifying critical BBA tasks, keeping them on track, and integrating them with other agency priorities. Continued involvement by high-level agency officials in this process as well as ongoing legislative oversight should enhance the likelihood of success. such an endeavor and the campaign\u2019s important role in creating a more competitive Medicare market.", "Questions have been raised by health plan representatives and others about the estimated cost of the information campaign.

We are concerned, however, that payment system design flaws and inadequate underlying data used to establish payment rates may compromise the system\u2019s ability to meet the twin objectives of slowing spending growth while promoting the delivery of appropriate beneficiary care. Insufficient planned oversight of the new payment system may compound these shortcomings and further jeopardize the potential for cost savings. In the short term, the new payment system could be improved if HCFA clearly stated that SNFs are responsible for ensuring that the claims they submit are for beneficiaries who meet Medicare coverage criteria.

BBA contained over 350 separate Medicare and Medicaid mandates, the majority of which apply to the Medicare program. The Medicare mandates are of widely varying complexity. Some, such as the Medicare+Choice expansion of beneficiary health plan options and the implementation of PPSs for SNFs, home health agencies, and hospital outpatient services, are extraordinarily complex and have considerable budgetary and payment control implications. Others, such as updating the conversion factor for anesthesia payments, are relatively minor.

HCFA\u2019s recent publication of the Medicare+Choice and SNF PPS regulations are examples of the progress HCFA has made in implementing key mandates. The remaining 25 percent missed the BBA implementation deadline, including establishment of a quality-of-care medical review process for SNFs and a required study of an alternative payment system for certain hospitals. It is clear that HCFA will continue to miss implementation deadlines as it attempts to balance the resource demands generated by BBA provisions with other competing objectives.", "BBA-mandated changes.

In addition to traditional Medicare and HMOs, beneficiaries will be able to enroll in preferred provider organizations, provider-sponsored organizations, and private fee-for-service plans. Medical savings accounts will also be available to a limited number of beneficiaries under a demonstration program. The goal is a voluntary transformation of Medicare via the introduction of new plan options. Capitalizing on changes in the delivery of health care, these new options are intended to create a market in which different types of health plans compete to enroll and serve Medicare beneficiaries. Recognizing that consumer information is an essential component of a competitive market, BBA mandated a national information campaign with the objective of promoting informed plan choice. From the beneficiary\u2019s viewpoint, information on available plans needs to be (1) accurate, (2) comparable, (3) comprehensible, and (4) readily accessible. Informed beneficiary choice will be critical since BBA phases out the beneficiary\u2019s right to disenroll from a plan on a monthly basis and moves toward the private sector practice of annual reconsideration of plan choice. campaign\u201d that includes comparative data on the available health plan choices.

In fact, HCFA comparative summaries will refer beneficiaries to health plans for more detailed information.", "HCFA is taking a cautious approach and testing the key components of its planned information campaign. This caution is probably warranted by the important role played by information in creating a more competitive Medicare market and by the agency\u2019s inexperience in this type of endeavor. In March 1998, the agency introduced a database on the Internet called \u201cMedicare Compare,\u201d which includes summary information on health plans\u2019 benefits and out-of-pocket costs. The toll-free telephone number will be piloted in five states\u2014Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon and Washington\u2014and gradually phased in nationally during 1999. Because of some concerns about its readability, HCFA has also decided to pilot a new beneficiary handbook in the same five states instead of mailing it to all beneficiaries this year. The handbook, a reference tool with about 36 pages, will describe the Medicare program in detail, providing comparative information on both Medicare+Choice plans as well as the traditional fee-for-service option. For beneficiaries in all other states, HCFA will send out a five- to six-page educational pamphlet that explains the Medicare+Choice options but contains no comparative information. This schedule will allow HCFA to gather and incorporate feedback on the effectiveness of and beneficiary satisfaction with the different elements of the information campaign into its plans for the 1999 open enrollment period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Standardized Comparative Data Hampers HCFA and Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["comparative information on Medicare HMOs.

Like beneficiaries, HCFA had difficulty reconciling information from different HMOs because it was not standardized across plans. HCFA\u2019s Center for Beneficiary Services, the new unit responsible for providing information to Medicare enrollees, has been forced to recontact HMOs and clarify benefit descriptions. Recognizing that standardized contract information would reduce the administrative burden on both health plans and different HCFA offices that use the data, the agency has accelerated the schedule for requiring standard formats and language in contract benefit descriptions. Although originally targeted by 2001, the new timetable calls for contract standardization beginning with submissions due in the spring of 1999. If available on schedule, standardized contracts should facilitate the production of comparative information for the introduction of the annual open enrollment period in November 1999. that the use of nonformulary drugs may result in substantially higher out-of-pocket costs.", "Only five of eight Tampa plans mention mammograms in their benefit summaries\u2014even though all plans covered mammograms.

One plan, however, included them under hospital outpatient services.", "Consistent presentation is important because beneficiaries may rely on plans\u2019 benefit summaries when comparing coverage and out-of-pocket cost information. Federal employees and retirees can readily compare benefits among health plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program because the Office of Personnel Management requires that plan brochures follow a common format and use standard terminology. It is encouraging that HCFA wants to accelerate a similar requirement for Medicare+Choice plans.

Categories of information specifically mentioned by BBA include beneficiary health outcomes and satisfaction, the extent to which health plans comply with Medicare requirements, and plan disenrollment rates. While disenrollment rates could be prepared for publication in a matter of months, other types of quality-related information have accuracy or reliability problems or are still being developed. immature health plan information systems and ambiguities in the HEDIS measurement specifications. Though committed to making the HEDIS information available as quickly as possible, HCFA emphasized that its premature release would be unfair to both plans and beneficiaries. Finally, efforts have been under way for some time to develop measures that actually demonstrate the quality of the care delivered\u2014often referred to as \u201coutcome\u201d measures. As noted, the current HEDIS measures look at how frequently a health plan delivers specific services, such as immunizations, not at outcomes. The development and dissemination of reliable health outcome measures is a much more complicated task and remains a longer-term goal.", "Before passage of BBA, HCFA had funded a survey to measure and report beneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction with their HMOs. For example, Medicare enrollees were asked how easy it was to gain access to appropriate care and how well their physicians communicated with them about their health status and treatment options. HCFA plans to make the survey results available on its Medicare Compare Internet site this fall and to include the data in mailings to beneficiaries during the fall 1999 information campaign. We believe that the usefulness of HCFA\u2019s initial satisfaction survey for identifying poor performing plans is limited because it surveyed only those individuals satisfied enough with their plan to remain enrolled for at least 12 months. HCFA is planning a survey of those who disenrolled, which could help distinguish among the potential causes of high disenrollment rates in some plans, such as quality and access issues or beneficiary dissatisfaction with the benefit package.", "Houston, Texas, the highest disenrollment rate was nearly 56 percent, while the lowest was 8 percent.

However, until HCFA actually gains experience with the toll-free number, it has no firm basis to judge either the duration of the calls or the type of information beneficiaries will find useful. The phased implementation of the toll-free numbers should give HCFA a better idea of what beneficiaries want and may necessitate adjustments to current plans.", "Ultimately, the design of this and other aspects of the information campaign should be driven less by cost and more by how effective they are in meeting beneficiary needs and contributing to the intended transformation of the Medicare program.

Under the new system, facilities receive a payment for each day of care provided to a Medicare-eligible beneficiary (known as the per diem rate). This rate is based on the average daily cost of providing all Medicare-covered SNF services, as reflected in facilities\u2019 1995 costs. Since not all patients require the same amount of care, the per diem rate is \u201ccase-mix\u201d adjusted to take into account the nature of each patient\u2019s condition and expected care needs.", "Previously, SNFs were paid the reasonable costs they incurred in providing Medicare-allowed services. There were limits on the costs that were reimbursed for the routine portion of care, that is, general nursing, room and board, and administrative overhead. Payments for capital costs and ancillary services, such as rehabilitation therapy, however, were virtually unlimited. Cost-based reimbursement is one of the main reasons the SNF benefit has grown faster than most components of the Medicare program. Because providing more services generally triggered higher payments, facilities have had no incentive to restrict services to those necessary or to improve their efficiency. care for beneficiaries for less than the case-mix adjusted payment will benefit financially. Those with costs higher than the per diem amount will be at risk for the difference between costs and payments. The PPS for hospitals is credited with controlling outlays for inpatient hospital care. Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that over 5 years the SNF PPS could save $9.5 billion compared with what Medicare would have paid for covered services.", "Although HCFA met the deadline for issuing the implementing regulations for the new SNF per diem payment system, features of the system and inadequate data used to establish rates could compromise the anticipated savings. As noted in previous testimony, design choices and data reliability are key to implementing a successful payment methodology. We are concerned that the system\u2019s design preserves the opportunity for providers to increase their compensation by supplying potentially unnecessary services. Furthermore, the per diem rates were computed using data that overstate the reasonable cost of providing care and may not appropriately reflect the differences in costs for patients with different care needs. In addition, as a part of the system, HCFA\u2019s regulation appears to have initiated an automatic eligibility process\u2014that is, a new means of determining eligibility for the Medicare SNF benefit, that could expand the number of beneficiaries who will be covered and the length of covered stays.

Because the groups are largely defined by the services the patient is to receive, a facility could do this by providing the minimum level of services that characterize patients in that group (see table 1). This would reduce the average cost for the SNF\u2019s patients in that case-mix group, but not lower Medicare payments for these patients. For patients needing close to the maximum amount of therapy services in a case-mix group, facilities could maximize their payments relative to their costs by adding more therapy so that the beneficiary was categorized in the next higher group. An increase in daily therapy from 140 to 144 minutes, for example, would change the case-mix category of a patient with moderate assistance needs from the \u201cvery high\u201d to the \u201cultra high\u201d group, resulting in a per diem payment that was about $60 higher.

This base rate may be too high, because the reported costs are not adequately adjusted to remove unnecessary or excessive costs. Second, a set of adjustors for the 44 case-mix groups is computed using information on the costs of services used by about 4,000 patients. This sample may simply be too small to reliably estimate these adjustors.", "Most of the cost data used to set the SNF prospective per diem rates were not audited. At most, 10 percent of the base year\u20141995\u2014cost reports underwent a focused audit in which a portion of the SNFs\u2019 expenses were reviewed. Of particular concern are therapy costs, which are likely inflated because there have been no limits on cost-based payments. HCFA staff report that Medicare has been paying up to $300 per therapy session. These high therapy costs were incorporated in the PPS base rates.

Medical review nurses who work with HCFA payment contractors indicated in interviews that some patients included in the 26 groups would not necessarily need daily skilled care. This may be particularly true at a later point in the SNF stay, since SNF coverage can only begin after a 3-day hospitalization. Individuals with certain forms of paralysis or multiple sclerosis who need extensive personal assistance may also need daily skilled care immediately following a hospital stay for pneumonia, for example. After a certain period, however, their need for daily skilled care may end, but their Medicare coverage will continue because of deeming.
