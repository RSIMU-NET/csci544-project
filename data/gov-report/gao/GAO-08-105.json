Despite increases in women's workforce behavior in the past 65 years, elderly women have persistently high rates of poverty. Thus, it is important to understand the differences between men's and women's retirement income, and how women may fare given future reforms to Social Security and pensions. GAO was asked to examine (1) how women's retirement income compares with men's and the reasons for differences; (2) how certain life events such as divorce, widowhood, and workforce interruptions affect women's retirement income; and (3) the possible effect on women's retirement income of certain changes to Social Security and pensions that seek to mitigate the effects of differences in workforce participation patterns. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the relevant literature, interviewed academics and other retirement experts, and used a microsimulation model to project future retirement income. GAO provided a draft of this report to the departments of Labor and Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Social Security Administration. Cognizant agency officials provided technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate. GAO is making no recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In general, women have less retirement income than men, largely because of women's lower labor force attachment and lower earnings, on average. Fewer women than men have income from most major retirement sources, and women have less income from these sources. Women's median Social Security income is 70 percent of men's. Also, fewer women than men have pensions. Among the population age 65 and over who continue to work, women earn just over half of what men earn. Women also have somewhat smaller income than men from assets, such as interest and dividends. Accordingly, rates of poverty among those 65 and over are substantially higher for women than for men. Although their participation has increased substantially in the last century, women still spend fewer years in the labor force than men, and they more often work part-time. Also, women tend to earn less than men, despite increases in their wages over time relative to men. Although work patterns are key in earnings differences, in prior work, we found that even after accounting for behavioral differences such as education or labor force participation, women still earn less than men. Certain life events--including changes in marital status, labor force interruptions, and long-term care needs--can significantly reduce the amount of pension income and Social Security benefits women receive--and leave women with fewer financial resources at retirement than men. Social Security divorced spousal benefits are available only if the marriage lasted at least 10 years. Furthermore, pension benefits are available to a divorced spouse only under certain circumstances. Women's role as primary family caregiver for children and elderly relatives can reduce their career earnings, on which retirement income is based. Because women tend to live longer than men, widowhood and costly long-term care assistance may further reduce their retirement resources. GAO's simulations of some Social Security changes that would compensate for low earnings or time out of the workforce showed that those changes tend to increase benefits for beneficiaries overall, and particularly those in lower income quintiles. Alternatively, changes that focus on shifts in family structure, such as increases in two-earner couples and increased incidence of divorce, tend to increase the benefits of groups targeted by the change, but produce mixed results for others. Some pension changes that have been proposed in the past several years take into account the changing labor force and norms of employer-provided retirement plans; while these changes are gender-neutral, they may provide important new opportunities for women to increase their retirement income. For example, decreased vesting requirements may provide additional pension income to those with intermittent workforce participation who would not qualify for pension benefits under a longer vesting schedule."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the next 40 years women aged 65 and over will account for a growing  segment of the U.S. population. In 2000, there were about 20 million  women aged 65 and over, more than 7 percent of the U.S. population; by  2050 that number is estimated to grow by nearly 28 million to about 12  percent of the population. Elderly women have persistently high rates of  poverty, and the major source of income for many retired women is Social  Security. However, the Social Security system is affected by the decrease  in the rate of growth of the working age population. Under current law, the  Social Security Trustees project that by 2041 the Social Security Trust  Funds could be insufficient to pay full benefits.", "Demographics as well as rising health care costs are profoundly affecting  not only the Social Security system, but also Medicare, private pension and  health benefits, and personal savings in ways that will likely present  serious challenges to ensuring financial security for future retirees and,  ultimately, the economic security of the nation. In recent years, many  proposed reforms of the Social Security system have focused on long-term  solvency and financing issues, many of which could result in decreased  benefits for individuals. Alternatively, some Social Security proposals  developed over the past several decades include elements that seek to  modify the program and address its limitations when applied to  nontraditional-family or earnings structures. These limitations may be due  both to the evolving nature of families and to changes in women\u2019s labor  force participation that have emerged since Social Security\u2019s creation.  These elements often address the needs of two-earner families as well as  retirement benefits after divorce. Additionally, recent and ongoing  changes in employer-sponsored pension plans, most notably the shift from  defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans, may  complement changes in workforce patterns, but also place greater  responsibility for prudent savings and investment decisions on workers.  Given the existing differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s incomes, and the  changes in women\u2019s workforce behavior in the later half of the 20th  century, any future changes to Social Security as well as both proposed  and ongoing changes to employer-provided pensions could have different  impacts on women and men. It is important to understand how each will  fare under various proposals.", "You asked us to help clarify what drives the gap in retirement income  between men and women and to provide information on the implications  of different modifications to both Social Security as well as employer- provided pensions. Our objectives were to examine (1) how women\u2019s  retirement income compares with men\u2019s and describe the reasons for  differences; (2) how certain life events such as divorce, widowhood, and  workforce interruptions affect women\u2019s retirement income, as compared  with men\u2019s; and (3) the possible effect on women\u2019s retirement income of  certain changes to Social Security and pensions that seek to mitigate the  effects of differences in workforce participation patterns.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the relevant literature and  federal laws, interviewed academics and other retirement experts, and  used a retirement-income microsimulation model to project women\u2019s  future retirement income. Specifically, we reviewed and summarized  government and academic research on women\u2019s retirement income, life  events, and poverty as well as proposed changes to Social Security and  employer-provided pensions. We used the Policy Simulation Group\u2019s  retirement income microsimulation model to illustrate differences in  benefit levels by differences in workforce attachment and marital status of  a simulated population, born in 1985. We also used the microsimulation  model to project changes in Social Security benefit levels for a sample of  workers at age 70, from the 1950 and 1985 birth cohorts, under a variety of  possible modifications. The results of our analyses reflect outcomes for  individuals in the simulated populations and do not attempt to estimate  outcomes for an actual population. Unlike some of our prior work, rather  than evaluating Social Security reform packages that seek to achieve  sustainable solvency, we evaluated proposed individual changes targeted  to enhance benefits for certain groups. We also used the model to project  changes in pension benefit levels for a sample of workers at age 70, from  the 1985 birth cohort. We used two cohorts in order to identify differences  in the effects of the changes that could be due to variations in labor force  participation across generations. For some of our analyses, we used a  measure of income that adjusts to account for household size and  economies of scale. The adjustment is made by dividing household benefit  levels by a \u201cfamily equivalence scale.\u201d We did this to facilitate  comparisons between non-married persons and married persons, whose  household income includes income from both spouses that can vary  significantly between them. We also evaluated the effect of modifications  on individual benefit levels. In addition to evaluating changes in benefit  levels resulting from each modification, we assessed changes in a variable  in the model that serves as a proxy for poverty avoidance. Consistent with  our past work on Social Security reform, when simulating benefits we  compared benefits under each reform to two hypothetical benchmark  policy scenarios that would achieve 75-year solvency, one by only  increasing payroll taxes (which simulates \u201cpromised benefits\u201d) and the  other by only reducing benefits (which simulates \u201cfunded benefits\u201d).  However, unlike prior GAO work, for the purposes of this study, we  evaluated certain specific individual modifications, rather than  comprehensive reform packages. We did this in order to focus on  modifications that account for more recent changes in family structure  and labor force composition. Additionally, to facilitate comparisons across  cohorts, we generally report the effect of each modification in terms of  percent changes in benefit levels. Using such a measure, the outcomes  from each benchmark are largely similar. In the body of the report, in most  cases, we present output from simulations using the \u201cpromised benefits\u201d  benchmark. Detailed output from both benchmarks is presented in  appendix II. For this report, we focused on examining the distribution of  benefits and did not assess equity measures. While our simulations provide  estimates of future retirement income, there is a considerable amount of  uncertainty involved with these estimates. Since these estimates could  change significantly, depending on assumptions used and behavioral  responses, they should not be considered predictions.", "We conducted our work between January 2006 and August 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A  more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology appears in  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The retirement outlook for both men and women in the United States has  changed significantly in the last 30 years. Like many industrialized  countries, the United States is undergoing a significant demographic shift  toward an aging population and is experiencing the increased pressures on  the social insurance, medical, and private pension systems that this shift  creates.", "While life expectancy in the United States has steadily increased over the  last 50 years, birthrates have declined, and both have led to rapid growth  in the proportion of the population comprised of elderly people: in 1950,  those aged 65 or older made up 8 percent of the population; in 2000, this  proportion rose to 12 percent and is projected to rise to almost 20 percent  by 2030. Also, between 1940 and 1980, women\u2019s life expectancy generally  increased faster than men\u2019s. During the same time period, the difference in  life expectancy at age 65 for women and men grew from 1.5 years in 1940  to 4.4 years in 1980. (See fig. 1.)", "The difference in men\u2019s and women\u2019s longevity has decreased over the  past 25 years, and that difference is expected to remain stable throughout  much of the 21st century. Nevertheless, the ratio of elderly women to  elderly men increased substantially in the post-World War II era, and  elderly women will continue to outnumber elderly men both in numbers  and as a percent of the population for the foreseeable future. (See fig. 2.)  As a result of these trends, women can expect on average to spend more  years in retirement than men.", "Traditionally, the financial resources that provide retirement security have  been characterized as a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions, and  savings, although increasingly, earnings are also a significant source of  income for the elderly. Overall, women have been more likely than men to  rely on Social Security to finance their retirement. Moreover, some aspects  of the Social Security system particularly benefit women. For instance,  because women tend to have lower lifetime taxable earnings than men,  they benefit from the Social Security system\u2019s progressive benefit formula,  which replaces a larger portion of lifetime earnings for people with low  earnings than for people with high earnings. In addition, Social Security is  designed specifically to accommodate both low- or non-earning spouses,  often women, by providing them with a dependent benefit based upon  their spouses\u2019 earnings. Social Security was created based upon the model  of a single-earner married couple family structure, and while many women  still never enter the paid workforce or choose to reduce their workforce  participation, at least in part to care for children or other family members,  the single-earner family model no longer describes the typical American  household. Nevertheless, this structure has been and continues to be  extremely beneficial to some women.", "However, Social Security faces a long-term financing shortfall resulting  largely from longer life spans and lower birthrates. According to 2007  Social Security projections, absent policy changes, Social Security tax  revenue is expected to fall short of benefit payments for the first time in  2017; by 2041 the system may have inadequate resources to pay full  benefits. As a result, in the future, Social Security\u2019s role could change.  Reductions in scheduled benefits and/or increases in program revenues  will be needed to restore the long-term solvency and sustainability of the  program. Within the program\u2019s current structure, possible benefit changes  might include changes to the benefit formula or reductions in cost-of-living  increases, among other options; revenue increases might include increases  in payroll taxes or transfers from the Treasury\u2019s general fund. In addition,  many proposals have been put forth over the past several decades to  address the adequacy of Social Security benefits for different kinds of  workers and their families. These proposals often address the needs of  spouses, survivors, and low earners as well as those with significant  workforce interruptions.", "Additionally, many workers bear greater risk and responsibility for their  retirement savings than in the past. About half of U.S. workers do not have  a pension plan through their employer, and those who do are less likely  than in the past to be covered by defined benefit (DB) plans. Among those  who offer plans, employers have increasingly shifted from traditional DB  to defined contribution (DC) plans, such as 401(k)s, which are based on  contributions to and investment returns on individuals\u2019 accounts. While  private sector DB plans must offer a guaranteed lifetime income in the  form of an annuity, DC plans more often provide the beneficiary with a  lump sum as the only option. While individuals could take the proceeds  of their lump sum and purchase an annuity, the cost of purchasing a  private annuity may make this option unattractive to many households. In  addition, the private equity market charges women a higher premium for a  life annuity than it charges men of the same age, because on average  women live longer than men.", "Personal savings have traditionally been an important source of retirement  income. Unfortunately, despite the challenges facing both public and  private benefit systems for the elderly, relatively few Americans are  currently saving, and some research suggests that women have less in  savings than men. According to some measures, America has the lowest  overall saving rate of any major industrialized nation. The U.S personal  saving rate as a percentage of disposable personal income has recently  reached levels not seen since the Great Depression, falling below 1 percent  in 2005 and 2006. A variety of proposals seeking to encourage more  individuals to save have been introduced in the past several years. Many of  these proposals target low- and moderate-income workers who are least  likely to have access to employer-sponsored pension plans. Some of these  proposals create added incentives or ease access for individuals to save  through existing savings vehicles, such as 401(k) plans or individual  retirement accounts (IRA). Other plans would create new vehicles for  savings, such as 401(k) type plans for those not currently covered by a  plan. One mechanism that already exists to encourage individuals to save  is the so-called spousal IRA offered to non-earning spouses, who are most  often women, as a way to build retirement income. A spousal IRA, allows  non-earning spouses to accumulate retirement savings in their own  retirement accounts.", "Finally, health care coverage and rising health costs have added to the  financial burden for retirees. Retired Americans often rely on employer- sponsored health benefits to provide health coverage until they become  eligible for Medicare or to supplement their Medicare coverage. In 2005  about 37 percent of retirees were covered by such plans. However,  retirees are paying more for these benefits, and the number of private  employers offering them has declined considerably. The rate of growth of  health care costs has generally outpaced the rate of U.S. economic growth,  and this trend is likely to continue, jeopardizing the availability of  employer-sponsored insurance for many. Rapidly rising health care costs  may be particularly burdensome for retirees with limited financial  resources. Additionally, the odds of having a disability or chronic illness  increase with age; since, on average, women live longer, dealing with the  cost of declining health may be a particular concern for women."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Women Have Less Retirement Income than Men Largely because of Differences in Labor Force Participation and Lifetime Earnings", "paragraphs": ["Generally, women have less retirement income than men, largely because,  on average, women have lower labor force attachment and lower earnings  than men. While about 90 percent of men and women aged 65 and older  receive Social Security benefits, fewer women than men have income from  most other major sources of retirement income, and they receive less  than men from those sources, according to a Congressional Research  Service analysis of Census Bureau data. Additionally, women aged 65 and  older have higher rates of poverty than men of the same age. While  women\u2019s labor force participation has increased substantially in the last  half century, it has flattened out in recent years and remains more  intermittent than men\u2019s. Women also tend to earn less than men during  their working years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Women Have Less in Total Retirement Income than Men", "paragraphs": ["While Social Security provides retirement income to almost 90 percent of  all elderly people, a smaller percentage of women than men age 65 and  older have additional income from pensions, assets\u2014such as interest or  dividends from lifetime savings, or earnings, according to the  Congressional Research Service analysis of Census Bureau data. For  example, in 2004, the percentage of men with income from pensions was  almost twice that of women and 44 percent more men than women had  wage and salary income. (See fig. 3.)", "Moreover, women\u2019s median incomes from each of the various retirement  sources are lower than men\u2019s. As shown in figure 4, men\u2019s median annual  Social Security income was $12,583 in 2004, while women\u2019s was $8,799.  Nevertheless, Social Security is an important financial resource for  women, many of whom receive spousal, divorced spousal, or survivor  benefits. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), while  Social Security is the largest single source of income for most of the  elderly population age 65 and older, it represents 53 percent of total  income for elderly unmarried women\u2014including divorced, widowed, and  never married women, compared to 38 percent for unmarried men.  Moreover, Social Security was nearly the only source of income for close  to half of all elderly unmarried women who received it in 2004, compared  to a little more than a third of elderly unmarried men. Importantly, Social  Security can become a growing fraction of total retirement income over  time since it is indexed to offset the effects of inflation. In contrast, private  pensions and income from assets are rarely indexed. Unlike Social  Security, pension income may end upon the death of the spouse if the  retired worker elects to receive a single life annuity, in which payments  cease at the time of the worker\u2019s death.", "The difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s pension income is larger than  for Social Security. In 2004, men\u2019s median pension income was nearly  twice women\u2019s, $12,000 and $6,141, respectively. Asset income is relatively  low for both women and men compared to Social Security and pensions.  Nevertheless, women\u2019s median asset income was $750, while men\u2019s was  slightly higher at $964. Finally, while less than a fifth of the elderly had  wage and salary earnings in 2004, men\u2019s median earnings were $20,800,  while women\u2019s were $12,000. (See fig. 4.)", "Additionally, rates of poverty among those 65 and over are higher for  women than for men. Over time, overall poverty rates among the elderly  have declined from 35 percent in 1959 to 10 percent in 2005, according to  Census Bureau data. This is in part due to Social Security benefits for the  aged. Here, too, gender differences remain. In 2004, 12 percent of women  and 7 percent of men age 65 and older had incomes below the federal  poverty level, with more pronounced variation among individuals of  different marital status. For example, never-married elderly men and  women had the highest rates of poverty, while the next highest rates were  among divorced and widowed elderly women. Married couples had  significantly lower rates than all other marital statuses. (See fig. 5.)

While women\u2019s participation in  the labor force increased from the mid-1960s through the late 1990s, men\u2019s  labor force participation has steadily decreased, most significantly  between the mid-1950s and the early-1970s. (See fig. 6.)", "Much of the change in women\u2019s participation rates is due to higher labor  force participation rates among married women. According to Census  Bureau statistics, between 1960 and 1995 married women\u2019s labor force  participation increased from almost 32 to 61 percent and has not changed  significantly in the past decade. As a result, there are now more married  couple households with two earners than when Social Security was first  established. These overall trends have recently stabilized, and in 2006 the  Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that women\u2019s labor force  participation rate will not change significantly in the near future.", "Despite the overall increases in women\u2019s labor force participation, women  continue to have more intermittent labor force participation than men. As  we reported in 2003, women have fewer years of work experience, work  fewer hours per year, are less likely to work a full-time schedule, and leave  the labor force for longer periods of time than men. For example, 25  percent of women and almost 11 percent of men age 16 and older usually  worked part-time in 2005.", "In addition to their spending less time in the workforce overall, women  earn less than men when they are working. Although women\u2019s earnings  have risen relative to men\u2019s over time, women nevertheless continue to  earn less than men. According to Census Bureau data, in 2005, women  earned 77 percent of what men earned for full-time, year-round work. (See  fig. 7.)", "This difference may be due, in part, to the fact that women continue to  take primary responsibility for family care and those who work outside the  home may trade some career advancement for schedule flexibility. In fact,  in prior work we found that work patterns are a key factor in explaining  the differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings. However, even after  accounting for these and other behavioral factors\u2014such as educational  attainment\u2014unexplained differences remained.", "Changes in women\u2019s labor force participation have also increased their  participation in employer-provided pension plans, according to one  study, though, as noted earlier, their overall rates of participation are still  lower than men\u2019s. Women who worked full-time throughout the year  actually had higher pension participation rates than men with similar work  schedules in 2005, but women\u2019s overall rates remain lower because, in  part, of their lower rate of full-time work and lower earnings, according to  the Employee Benefit Research Institute. While the increase suggests that  a larger share of women in younger cohorts will likely qualify for pensions  based on their own earnings, many women may continue to receive  spousal or survivor benefits through their husbands\u2019 pensions. In addition,  the general shift from DB to DC plans may have both positive and negative  consequences for women. Women may especially benefit from the greater  portability afforded by DC plans because of their more intermittent labor  force participation. However, another consequence of this general shift is  that with many DC plans, individuals have a greater responsibility to make  prudent investment decisions and to make their retirement savings last  over their lifetimes, which for women, on average, are longer than for  men.", "Changes in women\u2019s labor force participation have also increased the  percentage of women who are insured under Social Security based on  their own work history, even though many women continue to receive  dependent benefits as spouses. According to SSA, women who were  eligible to receive benefits based on their own work records increased  from 22 percent to 84 percent between 1950 and 2006. Nevertheless, in  December of 2005, approximately 60 percent of retired women received  Social Security benefits based, at least in part, on their marital history.  Moreover, nearly all spousal and survivor beneficiaries were women in  2005. Further, as women\u2019s labor force participation increases, many will  find that benefits based on their own work records are more generous  than the spousal benefit. However, when many of these same women  become widows, they will likely begin to collect benefits based on their  marital status, as the survivor\u2019s benefit, at 100 percent of their deceased  spouse\u2019s benefit, is likely to be greater than their own.", "Data on current retirees reflect the fact that those retirees comprise older  generations of workers, in which women\u2019s labor force participation rates  were lower than those of current workers. In the future, data that include  later generations of women, with greater labor force participation rates,  may show greater percentages of women eligible for and collecting  benefits based on their own work records. Nevertheless, the key factor  contributing to the difference in men\u2019s and women\u2019s Social Security  income levels will continue to be the difference in their lifetime work  histories and earnings.

Many proposed reforms for Social Security and employer-provided  pensions have focused on long-term solvency and financing issues.  Research has shown that many of these types of reforms have the  potential to reduce retirement income from levels scheduled in current  law for a large number of beneficiaries. This is of particular concern for  women because of their reliance on Social Security as a main source of  retirement income. Changes in the structure of employer-sponsored  pensions, which can have some benefits for women, may also have some  negative consequences. Although the shift to DC type plans can have a  positive impact on people who change jobs frequently or work  intermittently, such plans can transfer more of the responsibility to make  prudent investment decisions and to manage longevity risk to individuals.  While this is true for both men and women, it is of particular concern for  women because of their greater longevity. Moreover, the original design of  the Social Security system was based on a particular household  structure\u2014single earner families\u2014and that structure is no longer the  norm in America. If policy makers wish to design a system that adequately  and equitably compensates all retirees, then it will be necessary to design  a system that reflects the diversity of employment patterns and family  structure within the population it serves.

Small effects such as these, when included in  a larger package of reforms, could be overwhelmed by the effects of other  changes.

It is also helpful to understand how  changes may affect different types of individuals with different work and  earnings histories\u2014for example, women who never enter the workforce  or choose to reduce their work, possibly to care for children or other  family members. Changes to benefit structures may also have different  effects on individuals within different family structures, such as single- earner married couples, dual-earner households, or unmarried heads of  household. Recognizing these differences is important not only in terms of  improving adequacy and equity in the benefit structure, but also in  understanding how different benefit structures might affect the choices  individuals make regarding their own workforce attachment.

The SSASIM OLC mode requests GEMINI to  produce samples for each cohort born after 1934 in order to build up  aggregate payroll tax revenues and (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability  Insurance) OASDI benefit expenditures for each calendar year, which are  used by SSASIM to calculate standard trust fund financial statistics. In  either mode, GEMINI operates with the same logic, but typically with  smaller cohort sample sizes in OLC mode than in the RCS or stand-alone- model mode.", "Using the GEMINI model, we estimated Social Security benefits at age 70  for approximately 2 percent of individuals born in each of two illustrative  birth cohorts, 1950 (resulting in a sample of 63,813 individuals) and 1985  (resulting in a sample of 78,857 individuals). We also used the PENSIM  model to estimate pension income for those born in 1985. We simulated  Social Security benefits for two cohorts in order to identify differences in  the effects of modifications that could be due to variations in labor force  participation across generations. We also used the microsimulation  models to simulate Social Security benefits, pension income, and the  earnings of spouses not yet retired, in order to explore the relationships  between benefit levels and workforce attachment and marital status. For  this analysis we simulated benefit levels at ages 67 and 85 for the 1985  birth cohort. These models do not include measures of personal savings,  earnings in retirement, health benefits, or income from other income  support programs.", "Additionally, we evaluated the effect of Social Security modifications on a  \u201clow benefit avoidance rate,\u201d a measure produced by the model that  proxies for poverty avoidance. However, it does not include pension  income or savings, and so cannot be called a poverty avoidance measure.  The low benefit avoidance rate is expressed as the percentage of  retirement years in which an individual\u2019s Social Security benefits (plus any  earnings) are above a low-benefit threshold in the GEMINI model (the  thresholds are $9,669 for individuals and $12,186 for couples, in 2007  dollars). Both income and the threshold are based on individual data when  unmarried and on couple data when married.", "Benefits and taxes were simulated under our tax increase only (promised  benefits) and proportional benefit reduction (funded benefits)  benchmarks (described below) and certain specific individual  programmatic changes. These simulations are based on the Social Security  Trustees\u2019 2007 intermediate economic and actuarial assumptions. While  our simulations provide projections of future retirement income, there is a  considerable amount of uncertainty involved with these estimates. Since  these estimates could change significantly, depending on assumptions  used and behavior responses, they should not be considered predictions.  Furthermore, because simulations are sensitive to economic and  demographic assumptions, it is generally more appropriate to compare  benefits across the scenarios than to focus on the actual estimates  themselves. Therefore, to avoid inappropriate comparisons, we evaluated  the effects of modifications based on the changes in benefit levels rather  than comparing actual benefit levels.", "In general, GAO has suggested that policy makers should consider three  basic criteria when evaluating reform proposalsthe extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency and  how the proposal would affect the economy and the federal  budget;  the balance struck between the goals of individual equity (rates of  return on individual contributions) and income adequacy (level  and certainty of monthly benefits); and how readily such changes could be implemented, administered,  and explained to the public.", "Moreover, changes to the system should be evaluated as packages that  strike a balance among the individual elements of the proposal and the  interactions among these elements. The overall evaluation of any  particular reform proposal depends on the weight individual policy makers  place on each of the above criteria.", "However, for the purposes of this study we evaluated only specific  individual modifications. We looked at certain specific changes in order to  focus on those that account for more recent shifts in family structure and  labor force composition. In particular, we wanted to identify the direction  of the impact of modifications that might be used to mitigate the effects of  broad reform packages likely to reduce benefits. Nevertheless, we  recognize that there could be important interaction effects with any set of  reforms and maintain the importance of considering all possible effects of  any reform package as a whole. The solvency impact of any single  programmatic change may be marginal and, as part of a package, could be  overwhelmed by other changes. Nevertheless, in appendix IV, we have  provided the impact of each change on the Social Security Trust Fund  balance, after achieving 75-year solvency with the benchmark scenarios.  Additionally, because we simulated programmatic changes in isolation we  could not calculate traditional equity measures, which relate benefits  received to taxes paid. Because we simulated programmatic changes in  isolation on top of solvent benchmark scenarios, the results did not  achieve long-term solvency. We did not speculate on how the changes  would be paid for in the context of overall reform. Without information on  total contributions or benefits under each simulation, traditional equity  measures would not be meaningful.

To  facilitate our modeling analysis, we made a variety of assumptions  regarding economic and demographic trends.

However, the effect of using data adjusted for household  size on a reform targeted at married couples, such as a change in spousal  benefits, is that the change in benefits resulting from the program  modification is shared by both the husband and the wife. Thus, population  data based on the adjusted measure describe the number of people whose  household had a benefit change resulting from the modification.
