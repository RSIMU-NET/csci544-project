The Program Office has begun to accept and safeguard critical infrastructure information submitted voluntarily by infrastructure owners and is sharing it with other DHS entities and, on a limited basis, with other government entities. For example, as of January 2006, the Program Office had received about 290 submissions of critical infrastructure information from various sectors. The Program Office also has initiated outreach efforts to publicize the program to the public and private sectors. In addition, it has trained approximately 750 potential users in DHS and other federal, state, and local government entities how to handle protected critical infrastructure information. This training is a prerequisite to being allowed to view the information. The Program Office has also trained at least 16 federal and state officials how to establish programs in their own entities so they can receive protected critical infrastructure information from DHS and then be authorized to store and share it. DHS faces challenges that impede the private sector's willingness to share sensitive information. Key challenges include defining specific government needs for critical infrastructure information, determining how the information will be used, assuring the private sector that the information will be protected and who will be authorized to have access to the information, and demonstrating to critical infrastructure owners the benefits of sharing the information.

Without identifying a  specific use for PCII, entities are often reluctant to commit the necessary  effort toward accreditation.

Because the use for the information was considered  an isolated case, NSA does not plan to establish an accredited PCII  program.", "In addition, FEMA officials who also used PCII once, noted that PCII they  had received was valuable in developing security-related best practices that  FEMA presented at a workshop. However, they have no current plans to  establish a formally accredited program because they are uncertain how  they will use the information in the future. Also, as previously discussed,  user participation in the PCII program is completely voluntary, even for  agencies that have particular responsibilities for a critical infrastructure  sector. Nonetheless, the Program Office is attempting to train enough users  and help other government entities establish programs so that there is a  critical mass of users to help make the program viable.", "Other DHS officials stated that their own use of PCII had been purely  incidental. For example, DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis has not  found PCII to be essential for its operations largely because its emphasis is  on analyzing and responding to immediate threats, while PCII is  information relating to vulnerabilities. At this early stage of the program\u2019s  maturity, an official said PCII is not viewed by the Intelligence and Analysis  analysts as providing better or more relevant information than that which  they receive on a daily basis from the intelligence community and the many  other sources used to identify threats. On the other hand, the Deputy  Director of the Infrastructure Partnership Division stated that analysts  within the division could find PCII very useful to their mission. In addition,  DHS officials believe that as more PCII becomes available, they will use it  in their new Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center\u2014a  national center for the integration, analysis, and sharing of information  related to the threat of terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure.", "Assuring the private sector that the information will be protected and  who will be authorized to have access to it: To implement the protection  requirements in the act, the interim rule establishes procedures for  marking, safeguarding, and sharing the information. In addition, the  Program Office has established (1) the training program to equip  authorized users with knowledge of how to safeguard the information and  (2) the PCII Accreditation Program to ensure that other organizations have  processes and policies to promote the safeguarding of the information.", "However, potential submitters often continue to be reluctant to provide  their sensitive information because they are not certain that their  information will be fully protected. They fear that the information could be  inadequately protected, used for future legal or regulatory action, or  inadvertently released. For example, as follows, specific provisions in the  law and rule impact perceptions that the submitted information will not be  protected, according to DHS, other federal agencies, and the private sector:  Originator control: Under the rule, the Program Manager has the  authority to decide what PCII to provide to federal, state, or local  government employees for approved purposes; the originator of the  critical information cannot control how the submission is shared at the  federal level. According to an official representing a multisector  organization, infrastructure sector entities are hesitant to share  information because of its sensitivity, without having control over who  has access to it. According to the Program Manager, the Program Office  is considering a method that they believe would meet the act\u2019s intent\u2014 that is, submitters would identify at the time of submission what users  they believe should or should not be able to receive the information.  Under this method, the Program Office would contact the submitter if a  need arose for another entity to use the information. According to DHS,  this method has been used for some PCII submissions. However, this  method has not yet been instituted.", "Direct submissions: To receive protection, all submissions must be  received by DHS directly from the original submitter. For example, the  Department of Defense cannot receive information from members of  the defense industrial base and protect it as PCII or forward it to DHS to  be labeled and protected. However, in commenting on the interim rule,  one federal agency, as well as four infrastructure sector organizations,  expressed interest in being able to directly receive or submit this  information because of existing relationships. For example, an official  representing a multisector organization stated that private and public  critical infrastructure entities have already built relationships with each  other over many years and have sufficient trust to share information  with each other. According to the Program Manager, the issue of direct  submission will have to be addressed at some point; however, at this  early stage in the program, it is not worth the risk of having PCII  inappropriately released by an agency, because any mistake would  undermine the entire effort to build trust.", "Legal precedents: According to the Program Manager, there have been  no court cases addressing the CII Act. According to the Program Office  and the Homeland Security Advisory Council report, until the courts  uphold the protections, the private sector will frequently be hesitant to  use the program.", "In addition, potential submitters of CII have been hesitant to provide their  sensitive information because they are not certain how information would  be protected under the final rule. As of January 2006, DHS had not issued a  final rule, as planned. DHS had established April 2005, June 2005, and  August 2005 as deadlines for the rule to be issued, but it missed these time  frames. The Program Manager and other program officials reported that  the draft final rule had been undergoing legal review within DHS since the  summer of 2005 and would go to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) for interagency review before becoming final. However, they could  not predict when this would occur and did not have any target deadlines  established. In addition, the Program Manager and other program officials  were uncertain what changes, if any, would be made to the rule during legal  and interagency review.", "We have reported in the past that the uncertainty about how information  would be protected by federal agencies was a barrier to critical  infrastructure sectors sharing information with the federal government.  For example, in May 2005, we reported that critical infrastructure entities  did not openly share cybersecurity information with DHS, in large part,  because they were concerned that the potential release of sensitive  information could increase the threat to the respective entity. Also, in  April 2004, we testified that the reluctance by information-sharing  organizations to share information had focused on concerns over potential  government release of that information, among other things.", "In addition, the Program Office has been challenged to implement a  program that will provide protection to CII consistently across federal,  state, and local government entities while adhering to the scope of the act  and the interim rule. Some of the challenges that DHS, states, and private  sector entities identified were as follows:  Sharing PCII with and among the state and local governments: Under  the act, state officials are not allowed to directly share PCII with  officials in other states, unless the Program Office gets written consent  from the person or entity submitting the information. This is a challenge  that limits sharing when state officials meet and when a state official  knows that information could be useful to another state official to  address a vulnerability or threat. The Program Office is considering  resolving this issue by having submitters grant written approval for this  type of sharing when they submit CII\u2014similar to how the issue of  originator control could be handled.", "Penalties for inappropriate disclosure are limited to federal employees:  The act imposes criminal and administrative penalties for federal  employees that disclose PCII; however, those penalties do not apply to  contractors or state and local officials, who could face significantly less  penalty for disclosure. The variation of penalties could impact the level  of protection. For example, contractors are not subject to criminal  penalties and contract termination serves as a deterrent to mishandling  the information. For states, the Program Office has suggested that these  issues can be resolved through a MOA between the state entity and the  Program Office that would stipulate state laws are to be used to  prosecute violators. According to the Program Office, this arrangement  was made under the memorandum signed with Maryland and California.", "Demonstrating benefits to critical infrastructure owners of sharing the  information: DHS and other interested federal agencies have not clearly  demonstrated to the potential CII submitters the benefit of sharing their  sensitive information; therefore, potential submitters may not be willing to  take the risk of inappropriate use and release. Federal, state, and private  sector officials stated that some of the benefits that potential submitters  expect to receive include improved reaction by first responders; improved  intelligence and strategic analyses of threat information; and improved  performance of services, such as vulnerability analyses for small entities  unable to afford their own efforts. However, at the time of our review,  DHS\u2019s emphasis was on analyzing and responding to immediate threats,  rather than on combining threat and vulnerability information into strategic  analyses.", "Our prior work has shown that the federal government lacks the analytical  processes that would provide the sorts of benefits sought by infrastructure  owners. We reported that further efforts are needed to address the critical  challenges of improving the federal government\u2019s capabilities to analyze  incident, threat, and vulnerability information obtained from numerous  sources. We also reported that improvements are needed in the federal  sharing of appropriate, timely, and useful warnings and other information  concerning cyber and physical threats to federal entities, state and local  governments, and the private sector.", "Our prior work has also identified demonstrating benefits as a challenge to  the federal government. In April 2004, we testified that in white papers, the  Information Sharing and Analysis Center Council emphasized that perhaps  the greatest barriers to information sharing stem from practical and  business considerations, and that the benefits of sharing information are  often difficult to discern, while the risks and costs of sharing are direct and  foreseeable. In addition, in May 2005, we reported that even when  organizations within infrastructure sectors shared information with DHS,  the entities did not consistently receive useful information in return.", "Overcoming these challenges could help to encourage more submissions,  which in turn would provide the opportunity for the government to provide  benefits back to the private sector submitters, thereby creating a virtuous  cycle that builds on itself until a critical mass of users and submitters is  reached and the program becomes self-sustaining. This would help to  address the lack of trust in the government that the private sector has  consistently identified as a reason to limit information sharing. The  Program Manager and other DHS officials acknowledged the need to  establish trusted relationships between the CII submitters and the  information users in federal, state, and local governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made progress in implementing the CII Act by establishing  procedures and creating a Program Office to administer the program.

This effort includes issuing a final rule, as DHS has  planned to do, so that potential submitters will know how the program will  operate. Further, although DHS has a lead responsibility for federal critical  infrastructure protection efforts, its planning efforts to date have not  articulated what specific information it and other federal agencies with  critical infrastructure responsibilities need and how the information will be  used. Without this knowledge, the private sector will continue to be  hesitant to provide information to DHS. The Program Office is aware of  changes it could make to the program that might increase submissions of  CII and provide incentives to users, such as providing clarity regarding how  the information will be protected, establishing some level of originator  control, allowing direct submissions, and providing a mechanism for state- to-state sharing. However, to date, these options and initiatives have not  been aggressively pursued.
