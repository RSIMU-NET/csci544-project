According to FDA, the risk  the type of device poses to the patient or the user is a major factor in the  class it is assigned: class I includes devices with the lowest risk, and   class III includes devices with the highest risk.

Specifically, the 510(k)  process, established in 1976, requires a device manufacturer to notify FDA  90 days before it intends to market a device and to establish that the  device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device that does  not require a PMA. The legally marketed device is referred to as a  predicate device. Under federal regulations, a predicate device can be a  device that    was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which a PMA is not    was marketed on or after May 28, 1976, and was found to be substantially  equivalent to a legally marketed device through the 510(k) process; or   was reclassified by FDA from class III to class II or I.", "FDA reviews each 510(k) submission to determine whether the device in  question is SE or NSE to a predicate device. To be SE, a device must   (1) have the same intended use as the predicate device and (2) have the  same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have  different technological characteristics and submitted information  demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the marketed  device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.  Because the predicate device may be a device that was marketed on or  after May 28, 1976, that was found SE when compared to another legally  marketed device through the 510(k) process, there could be multiple  iterations of a given device type cleared through the 510(k) process. As a  result, a 510(k) submission for a new device in 2008 could be compared to  the 20th iteration of a device type that was on the market before 1976.  Figure 2 shows FDA\u2019s 510(k) decision-making process.", "Relative to the PMA process, the 510(k) premarket review process is  generally:    Less stringent. For most 510(k) submissions, clinical data are not  required and substantial equivalence will normally be determined based on  comparative device descriptions, including performance data. In  contrast, in order to meet the PMA approval requirement of providing  reasonable assurance that a new device is safe and effective, most original  PMAs and some PMA supplements require clinical data. In addition, other  aspects of FDA\u2019s premarket review are less stringent for 510(k)  submissions than for PMA submissions. For example, FDA generally does  not inspect manufacturing establishments as part of the 510(k) premarket  review process\u2014the 510(k) review process focuses primarily on the end  product of the manufacturing process rather than the manufacturing  process itself. In contrast, the agency does inspect manufacturing  establishments as part of its review of original PMA submissions.

The  department\u2019s comments, however, do not specify time frames in which  FDA will address the remaining class III device types allowed to enter the  market via the 510(k) process, stating instead that the agency is  considering its legal and procedural options for completing this task as  expeditiously as possible, consistent with available resources and  competing time frames. Given that more than 3 decades have passed since  Congress envisioned that all class III devices would eventually be required  to undergo premarket review through the more stringent PMA process, it  is imperative that FDA take immediate steps to address the remaining  class III device types that may still enter the market through the less  stringent 510(k) process by requiring PMAs for or reclassifying them.", "The department also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services and other interested parties.

These databases contain information on device  submissions, including the name of the device, the FDA-assigned product  code, the status of the submission, and any FDA decisions related to the  submission and the dates of those decisions. In both cases, we obtained  and analyzed data on submissions for which FDA made a review decision  in fiscal years 2003 through 2007. We also used FDA\u2019s Device  Nomenclature Management System to determine other attributes of the  device types covered by the device submissions.", "The 510(k) submissions we analyzed included traditional and abbreviated  510(k) submissions. We did not include special 510(k) submissions, which  are requests for clearance of modifications to devices that have already  been cleared through the 510(k) process (see table 7). The PMA  submissions we analyzed included original PMA submissions and some  supplemental PMA submissions. Specifically, we included supplemental  PMA submissions that represented requests for approval for a significant  change in a device: panel-track supplements, which are requests for  approval for a significant change in design, performance, or use of a  device for which clinical data are necessary to provide a reasonable  assurance of safety and effectiveness; and 180-day (user-fee)  supplements, which are requests for approval for a significant change in  components, materials, design, specification, software, color additives, or  labeling. We did not include other types of PMA supplements, such as real- time supplements, which are requests for approval for a minor change to a  device, such as a minor change in design, sterilization, software, or  labeling.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed FDA officials  knowledgeable about these databases, performed electronic testing for  accuracy and completeness, and where applicable compared our results to  aggregate information from other sources, such as published FDA reports  and the FDA Web site. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "In order to examine the extent to which FDA has determined that devices  reviewed through the 510(k) process had new intended uses or new  technological characteristics, we used FDA\u2019s 510(k) database to select and  review a stratified random sample of class II and all class III 510(k)  submission files from fiscal years 2005 through 2007. See table 7 for the  scope of our file review.", "All 163 class III submissions that met the inclusion criteria were included  in the sample. The 296 class II cases included in the sample constituted a  random sample of the 4,900 class II submissions that met the inclusion  criteria. The class II submissions included in the sample were stratified by  decision, meaning that class II submissions determined not substantially  equivalent (NSE) were oversampled so that the results could be  generalizable to the universe of all class II submissions, to class II  submissions determined NSE, or to class II submissions determined  substantially equivalent (SE). The sample contained a total of 459  submissions. See tables 8 and 9 for the number of submissions by fiscal  year, class, and decision.", "We conducted our file review in June 2008. We collected data primarily  from the FDA reviewer memo, which contained information concerning  the steps FDA took to reach its determination of SE or NSE.

The third party uses the same statutory  and regulatory criteria as FDA to determine substantial equivalence,  documents its review and recommendation, and forwards the 510(k)  submission and documentation to FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and  Radiological Health. At the center, a third-party 510(k) submission is  assessed by an FDA supervisor, who may accept or change the substantial  equivalence recommendation of the third party. After completing the  supervisory assessment, FDA issues a letter to the 510(k) applicant via the  third-party reviewer with a final determination on the 510(k) submission.

During our review of FDA\u2019s 510(k)  database, we found three instances of 510(k) submissions in which class II  devices that were life sustaining were cleared for market through the  third-party review program during fiscal years 2003 through 2007. FDA  officials explained that about five life-sustaining, class II device types,  hemodialysis devices, had inadvertently been added to the list of devices  eligible for third-party review when the list was expanded in 2001, and that  in May 2003, FDA removed the life-sustaining class II device types from  the list of devices eligible for third-party review on FDA\u2019s Web site. The  FDA officials said that while the three 510(k) submissions for class II life- sustaining device submissions had been submitted through the third-party  review program, FDA also conducted its own review of the three 510(k)  submissions before they were cleared for marketing.", "During fiscal years 2003 through 2007, FDA reviewed and made final  determinations on 1,082 third-party 510(k) submissions (see table 10).  According to FDA, the number of third-party submissions increased as the  result of (1) increased familiarity with the third-party review program  among potential applicants, (2) the increase in the number of device types  eligible for the program, and (3) less financial disincentives to use the  third-party review program as FDA instituted device user fees. An FDA  official familiar with the program stated that the third-party review  program may be more attractive to device manufacturers because third- party review 510(k) submissions are processed faster than traditional  510(k) submissions. The official noted, however, that as FDA\u2019s review of  traditional 510(k) submissions becomes more efficient, the advantages of  the third-party review program in terms of timeliness may diminish, which  could lead to fewer third-party review 510(k) submissions.", "Table 11 shows the third-party review 510(k) submissions by medical  specialty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: FDA\u2019s Implementation of Safe Medical Devices Act Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) amended the definition of  class II devices and required FDA, for each preamendment class III device  type and before December 1, 1995, to (1) order manufacturers to submit  information on safety and effectiveness to FDA and (2) publish proposed  and final regulations to reclassify each device type into class II or class I or  to require it to remain in class III.
