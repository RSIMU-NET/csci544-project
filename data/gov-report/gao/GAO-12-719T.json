For fiscal year 2012, HHS is  responsible for approximately $76 billion in discretionary spending and  approximately $788 billion in outlays of mandatory spending. With this  funding, HHS provides health care insurance for one in four Americans  through its two largest programs\u2014Medicare and Medicaid\u2014and  administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.  HHS also funds disease research and prevention, oversees the safety  and effectiveness of medical products, and helps ensure that the nation is  prepared to respond to public health emergencies, among other things.

In particular, many of  these recommendations relate to the Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014 which are the responsibility of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within HHS. HHS has implemented many of  these recommendations, resulting in billions of dollars of savings. Other  recommendations have led to program improvements that, while not  always quantifiable, have nonetheless enhanced the efficiency of agency  operations. For example, in 2004, we reported on CMS\u2019s management of  its Medicare Secondary Payer debt, which occurs when Medicare pays  for services that are subsequently determined to be the financial  responsibility of another payer. CMS\u2019s implementation of our  recommendation that it reduce the number of contractors managing this  workload resulted in savings of $86 million from 2006 through 2010. More  recently, greater savings have been realized as a result of work on CMS\u2019s  oversight of states\u2019 Medicaid supplemental payment arrangements. In  2007, we reported on a CMS oversight initiative established in response  to our work, which increased the agency\u2019s scrutiny of state Medicaid  financing arrangements and resulted in savings of approximately   $3.4 billion from fiscal year 2007 through 2012.", "While HHS has successfully implemented many of our recommendations,  our remarks today will focus on spending for which HHS is responsible in  the context of recommendations we have made that it has yet to  implement and that we therefore consider open. Specifically, we will  concentrate on our recommendations to improve the Medicare and  Medicaid programs. We have designated both as high-risk programs, in  part because of their size, complexity, susceptibility to improper  payments, and the need to improve program management.

We  recommended that CMS require its contractors to develop automated  prepayment controls to identify potentially improper claims when billing  reaches atypical levels. CMS agreed with the recommendation, but has  not implemented it. The agency has added other prepayment controls to  flag claims for services that were unlikely to be provided in the normal  course of medical care. However, implementing our recommendation and  adding additional prepayment controls could enhance identification of  improper claims before they are paid to reduce reliance on \u201cpay and  chase\u201d strategies.

CMS concurred with this recommendation  and has begun to implement this process, but does not yet have written  policies and procedures for a fully developed corrective action process  that includes monitoring of actions taken. Likewise, we recently testified  before the Senate Committee on Finance regarding CMS efforts to  combat Medicare fraud. We reiterated our prior recommendation and  noted that CMS could do more to strengthen provider enrollment  screening to avoid enrolling those intent on committing fraud, improve  pre- and postpayment claims review to identify and respond to patterns of  suspicious billing activity more effectively, and identify and address  vulnerabilities to reduce the ease with which fraudulent entities can obtain  improper payments.", "Enhancing payment safeguard mechanisms. In 2008, we reported on  rapid spending growth for advanced imaging services. We recommended that CMS examine the feasibility of adding front-end  approaches, such as prior authorization, to improve payment safeguard  mechanisms. CMS has not implemented our recommendation, but is  currently engaged in a demonstration project to assess the  appropriateness of physicians\u2019 use of advanced diagnostic imaging  services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.", "Aligning coverage for services with clinical recommendations. We  reported in early 2012 that Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 use of preventive  services did not always align with the U.S. Preventive Services Task  Force\u2019s recommendations. We concluded that opportunities exist to  improve the appropriate use of preventive services through means such  as revising coverage and cost-sharing policies and educating  beneficiaries and physicians. In the case of osteoporosis screening, for  instance, Medicare coverage rules may preclude utilization of the  recommended screening by all those for whom the service is  recommended. Conversely, given that the Task Force recommended  against prostate cancer screening for men aged 75 or older, the absence  of cost sharing for that population may encourage inappropriate use of  this service. To better align preventive service use with clinical  recommendations, we recommended that CMS provide coverage for  Task Force recommended services, as appropriate, given cost- effectiveness and other criteria. In response to our recommendation, the  agency stated that it had recently used its authority to expand benefits to  cover several new preventive services. This additional coverage,  however, does not address the misalignment that remains between  Medicare coverage for certain services and the corresponding Task Force  recommendations.

We suggested that Congress consider requiring  beneficiaries to share the cost of the services if they receive services the  Task Force recommends against."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Advantage", "paragraphs": ["Better reflecting beneficiary health status in payments to MA plans.  In 2010, the federal government spent about $115 billion on the MA  program, a private plan alternative to the Medicare FFS program. In  January 2012, we reported that CMS could achieve billions of dollars in  additional savings by more accurately adjusting for differences between  MA plans and Medicare FFS providers in the reporting of beneficiary  diagnoses.construct a risk score for each beneficiary. Higher risk scores result in   CMS uses this diagnosis data and other information to  increased Medicare payments to plans, while lower risk scores result in  reduced Medicare payments to plans. Risk scores should be the same  among all beneficiaries with the same medical conditions and  demographic characteristics, regardless of whether they are in MA or  Medicare FFS. MA plans have an incentive to code diagnoses more  comprehensively because doing so affects plan payments, which is not  the case in Medicare FFS. CMS is required by law to make an adjustment  to MA risk scores to bring them in line with those of Medicare FFS. In this  report, we found that CMS\u2019s adjustment for diagnostic coding differences  was too small. We estimated that MA beneficiary risk scores in 2010 were  from 4.8 to 7.1 percent higher than they likely would have been if they  had been enrolled in FFS, while CMS\u2019s adjustment for diagnostic coding  differences was only 3.4 percent. Compared to CMS\u2019s analysis, our  analysis incorporated more recent beneficiary data and accounted for  additional beneficiary characteristics that affect risk scores, such as  health status and sex. A revised methodology that incorporated this  information could have saved Medicare between $1.2 billion and   $3.1 billion in 2010 in addition to the $2.7 billion in savings from the  adjustment CMS made. We expect that savings in 2011 and future years  would be even greater. CMS has continued to use its 2010 adjustment  method for 2011 and 2012, even though both we and CMS noted an  upward trend in the impact of coding differences over time. To improve  the accuracy of the adjustment made for differences in coding practices  over time, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS direct the  Administrator of CMS to incorporate the most recent data available in its  estimates; identify and account for all years of diagnostic coding  differences that could affect the payment year for which any adjustment is  made; account for the upward trend of the annual impact of coding  differences in its estimates; and to the extent possible, account for all  relevant differences in beneficiary characteristics between the MA and  Medicare FFS populations. CMS stated that it found our findings  informative, but did not comment on our recommendations.", "Canceling the MA Quality Bonus Payment Demonstration. We  recently reported that CMS could achieve billions of dollars in savings by  canceling the MA Quality Bonus Payment Demonstration\u2014which CMS\u2019s  Office of the Actuary has estimated will cost more than $8 billion over   10 years.in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as  amended, CMS is conducting a nationwide demonstration to test whether  a scaled bonus structure would lead to larger and faster annual quality  improvement for MA plans at various performance levels. Compared with  PPACA\u2019s quality bonus payment system, the demonstration extends the  bonuses to average-performing plans, accelerates the phase-in of the  bonuses for plans with above-average performance, and increases the  size of the bonuses in 2012 and 2013. We found that the demonstration\u2019s  estimated $8.35 billion cost offsets more than one-third of PPACA\u2019s MA  payment reductions during its 3-year time frame and that most of the  additional spending will go to average-performing plans rather than to  high-performing plans. The MA Quality Bonus Payment Demonstration  dwarfs all other Medicare demonstrations\u2014both mandatory and  discretionary\u2014conducted since 1995 in its estimated budgetary impact. It  is at least seven times larger than that of any other Medicare  demonstration conducted since 1995 and is greater than the combined  budgetary impact of all those demonstrations. For a variety of reasons,  the design of the demonstration precludes a credible evaluation of its  effectiveness in achieving CMS\u2019s stated research goal. We therefore  believe that it is unlikely that the demonstration will produce meaningful  results. Accordingly, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS cancel  the demonstration and allow the MA quality bonus payment system  established by PPACA to take effect. HHS did not concur with our  recommendation, stating that it believed the demonstration supports a  strategy to improve the delivery of health care services, patient health  outcomes, and population health."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Need for Additional Oversight of Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["We have conducted a substantial body of work on Medicaid program  management.
