We also statistically controlled for the state in which counties are located. We included data from 43 states and the District of Columbia, representing 78 percent of the counties in the United States. Our results should not be generalized beyond this set of locations. The county demographic characteristics included from the 2000 Census were population size, racial composition (percent of African American and Hispanic residents in the county), and age (percent of 18-24 year olds and residents over 65). We included estimates of median income and percent of residents living below the poverty level from a 1997 Census model, and education data (percent of high school graduates in a county) from the 1990 Census.", "We measured uncounted presidential votes by subtracting the number of votes for President from the number of total ballots cast. Both numbers were included in EDS\u2019 data along with voting equipment information for each county. We supplemented the analysis using GAO survey data from a representative sample of county election officials to obtain further information on the use of error correction in conjunction with the various types of voting equipment.", "Because of the unavailability of comprehensive data, we could not determine why votes for President were not counted; could not distinguish between ballots cast at the polling place on election day and those cast by absentee ballot or through early voting; and could not assess the reliability of different models of the same type of voting equipment.

Three of these five types of equipment\u2014lever, optical scan, and electronic\u2014have some capability or can be used to prevent or allow for the correction of voting errors.", "Paper ballots. Paper ballots list the names of the candidates and the issues to be voted on. Voters generally complete their ballots in the privacy of a voting booth, recording their choices by placing marks in boxes corresponding to the candidates\u2019 names and the issues. After making their choices, voters drop the ballots into sealed ballot boxes. Election officials gather the sealed boxes and transfer them to a central location, where the ballots are manually counted and tabulated.", "Lever machines. Lever machine \u201cballots\u201d consist of a rectangular array of levers. Printed strips listing the candidates and issues are placed next to each lever. Voters cast their vote by pulling down the levers next to the candidates or issues of their choice. After voting, the voter moves a handle, which automatically records the vote and resets the levers. Votes are tallied by mechanical counters, which are attached to each lever. At the close of the election, election officials tally the votes by reading the counting mechanism totals on each lever voting machine. A feature inherent to lever machines is that they prevent voters from overvoting (i.e., voting more than once for the same office, unless the ballot explicitly allows for more than one choice to be made). Overvoting is prevented by the interlocking of the appropriate mechanical levers in the machine.", "Punch cards. Punch card voting equipment generally consists of a ballot, a vote recording device, a privacy booth, and a computerized tabulation device. Votes are cast by inserting the ballot into the vote recording device and punching a hole through the ballot such that the hole corresponds to the voter\u2019s ballot choice. Votes cast on punch card equipment are machine readable. Votes are tabulated using vote tabulation machines, and software is used to program each vote tabulation machine to correctly assign each vote read into the computer to the proper race and candidate or issue. The two basic types of punch card devices are Votomatic and Datavote.", "Optical scan. An optical scan voting system is comprised of computer- readable ballots, appropriate marking devices, privacy booths, and a computerized tabulation machine. The ballot lists the names of the candidates and the issues. Voters record their choices using an appropriate writing instrument to fill in boxes or ovals, or to complete an arrow next to the candidate\u2019s name or the issue. Like punch card software, the software for optical scan equipment is used to program the tabulation equipment to correctly assign each vote read into the computer to the proper race and candidate or issue. Optical scan equipment based in precincts can be programmed to detect and reject both overvoting and undervoting (i.e., not registering a vote for every race and/or issue on the ballot). Using such error correction technology could allow voters to fix their mistakes before leaving the polling place. If ballots are tabulated centrally, voters do not have the opportunity to correct mistakes that may have been made.", "Electronic. Electronic equipment (also called Direct Recording Electronic or DRE) comes in two basic types, pushbutton or touchscreen, with the pushbutton being the older and more widely used of the two. For pushbuttons, voters press a button next to the name of the candidate or the issue, which then lights up to indicate the selection. Similarly, voters using touchscreens make their selections by touching the screen next to the candidate or issue, which is then highlighted. When voters are finished making their selections, they cast their votes by pressing a final \u201cvote\u201d button or screen. Because all electronic equipment is programmable, it does not allow overvotes. In addition, voters can change their selections before hitting the final button to cast their votes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Studies of Uncounted Votes", "paragraphs": ["There have been several broad-based studies that have examined relationships among voter demographics, voting equipment, and/or uncounted votes.

Faulty voting equipment and confusing ballots were among the stated reasons for the ballots being unmarked, spoiled, or too ambiguous to count. The study reported that punch card and electronic voting equipment were associated with uncounted votes for President exceeding 2 percent of all ballots cast. (CalTech/MIT, July 2001.)", "Another recent research study reported that, despite the perception that minorities and poor people were disproportionately more likely to vote on antiquated voting machinery and therefore have their ballots invalidated, the data did not support this contention. The study found that in the majority of states, whites and non-poor voters were more likely than African Americans and poor voters to reside in counties that used punch card equipment, based on 1998 voter equipment data.

When counties used equipment that can be programmed to prevent overvoting (i.e., lever technology, electronic voting technology, and precinct-count optical scan systems), racial differences in the rate of invalidated votes disappeared.

Counties that used electronic, paper, or lever equipment, on the other hand, were not significantly different from those that used optical scan equipment. The R-squared value (i.e., the value representing the proportion of variation that the statistical model explained) for Model 1 indicates that differences in voting equipment accounted for only 2 percent of the variation in the percentage of uncounted votes across counties.
