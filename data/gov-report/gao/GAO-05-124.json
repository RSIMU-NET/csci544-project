However, the agencies have different procedures for processing challenges that occur within the stages. For example, BLM leasing decisions can be challenged to a BLM state director, further appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA), and litigated in federal court. Forest Service leasing decisions, however, sometimes can be appealed through the Forest Service supervisory chain of command and litigated in federal court. The Forest Service has no separate appeals board within the Department of Agriculture, such as IBLA, to review decisions. In addition, unlike BLM, the Forest Service has specific time frames during which appeals must be decided. BIA procedures offer opportunities for public challenges at the exploration and leasing stages, which are the only stages BIA makes decisions related to oil and gas development. MMS regulations do not provide for appeals at the planning or leasing stages, but do provide for appeals to IBLA during the exploration and operations stages. All MMS decisions could potentially be litigated in federal court. BLM does not systematically gather and use nationwide information on public challenges to manage its oil and gas program. BLM has a system that state offices use to collect data on public challenges during leasing, but the state offices use it inconsistently because they lack clear guidance from headquarters on which data to enter. As a result, the system does not provide consistent information that BLM headquarters can use to assess workload impacts on its state offices and to make staffing and funding resource allocation decisions. Because this system does not track all the public challenge data necessary for managing workload, headquarters and state offices also use multiple, independent data collection systems that are not integrated with one another or BLM's system. BLM is in the process of developing a new system that provides an opportunity to standardize collection of data on public challenges at the leasing stage. However, it has not decided whether the new system will be used to track public challenge information. Between fiscal years 1999 and 2003, MMS was challenged on only one of its 1,631 decisions approving offshore oil and gas development and production and only one of its 1,997 decisions approving offshore oil and gas exploration. Both decisions concerned land on the outer continental shelf off the coast of Alaska and were challenged by Alaskans, a Native American tribe, or an environmental interest group on the basis that the decisions violated the National Environmental Policy Act and other laws. One of the decisions was litigated in federal court and the court decided against the challenges. The other decision was appealed to IBLA but the company discontinued work before a decision was reached."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. energy consumption increasingly outpaces domestic production, and  this demand is increasingly being met by imports of oil and natural gas.

While BLM is the primary agency approving oil and  gas activity on federal land, it cannot readily provide nationwide data on  the number of public challenges made. Consequently, it cannot assess the  extent to which such challenges affect the workload of its state offices,  which is important to understanding what additional staffing and funding  resources may be needed to process public challenges. Although each state  office gathers its own data on public challenges to manage workload, the  data are not kept in a standardized format, and is not easily accessible. As a  result, BLM headquarters must rely on resource intensive data calls to  determine whether its state offices are experiencing backlogs of protested  decisions. The new agencywide system that BLM is developing will provide  an opportunity for the agency to maintain public challenge data in a  standardized format at least for the leasing stage and provide it with more  reliable data from which to make resource allocation decisions, but the  agency has not yet determined whether it will include public challenge data  in the system. We believe that including public challenge data into the new  system should, at a minimum allow BLM headquarters easier access to  public challenge data and provide information that will help it better  manage workload impacts on its state offices from public challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To standardize the collection of public challenge data at the leasing stage  for onshore federal lands, we recommend the Secretary of the Interior  direct BLM to take the following two actions:   Include public challenge data in the new agencywide automated system  for selling leases.", "Issue clear guidance on how public challenge data should be entered  into the new system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of the Interior and  Agriculture for review and comment. In commenting on our  recommendation for BLM to include public challenge data in its new  agencywide system for lease sales, Interior wanted to ensure that the  recommendation only applied to the leasing stage and not other stages of  oil and gas development, such as land use planning, geophysical  exploration, drilling, and reclamation. It further said the new national  Lease Sale System will be designed to track public challenge data on oil and  gas lease sales, and the BLM is developing a timeline for developing and  deploying the new system. Our recommendation is directed to collecting  data at the leasing stage and is not intended for other stages of oil and gas  development. Interior did not comment on our second recommendation  that BLM issue clear guidance on entering public challenge data into the  new system.", "The Department of Agriculture stated that the report is complete and  accurate and provides a good summary of the complex process that BLM  and the Forest Service use to jointly manage and make decisions  concerning the oil and gas programs, and appeals related to agency  decisions.", "Both the Interior and Agriculture provided us with technical comments and  editorial suggestions.

This included a review of statutes including the Federal Land  Policy Management Act, Minerals Leasing Act, National Forest  Management Act, Omnibus Indian Mineral Leasing Act, Allotted Mineral  Leasing Act, Submerged Lands Act, Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,  National Environmental Policy Act, and associated amendments and  regulations. From our analysis of these documents, we determined the  administrative procedures the agencies use to manage oil and gas  development on federal lands. We also identified the primary stages when  the public can challenge oil and gas development decisions\u2014planning,  exploration, leasing, and operations and the types of challenges that can  occur (e.g. protests, appeals, and litigation) during each of these stages. We  interviewed BLM, BIA, MMS, and Forest Service officials in their respective  headquarters, regional, and field offices and in the Department of the  Interior\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s Office to discuss the application of the laws and  regulations and to enhance our understanding of them.", "To determine the extent to which BLM gathers and uses data on public  challenges to manage its onshore oil and gas program, we identified  through discussions with BLM headquarters and state office officials the  various management information systems and databases the agency  maintains for managing the oil and gas program. We collected and analyzed  pertinent manuals, handbooks, memorandums, spreadsheets, and  procedures to ascertain the extent that BLM gathers and records public  challenge data on the oil and gas program. We interviewed BLM  headquarters officials to determine what, if any, public challenge data they  gathered on a national level for managing the oil and gas program. We also  interviewed officials from BLM\u2019s state offices in California, Colorado,  Eastern States, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming to determine how public  challenge data is gathered and used at the state office level and to ascertain  how these offices used the agencywide systems for recording such data.  We visited the Eastern States office, which has jurisdiction over the 31  states east of the Mississippi River, and the Colorado, New Mexico, Utah,  and Wyoming state offices, which, according to BLM headquarters officials,  are state offices with a higher volume of oil and gas development activity.", "To determine for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 the number of offshore oil  and gas development decisions by the MMS that were challenged, who  challenged them, and the grounds, time frames, and outcomes of the  challenges, we performed the following steps. We interviewed MMS  headquarters officials to determine the number of planning decisions and  lease sales held during fiscal years 1999 through 2003. We also analyzed  information in MMS\u2019 Technical Information Management System (TIMS) to  identify the number of exploration and operations plans and revisions to  plans the MMS approved from fiscal years 1999 through 2003. We reviewed  the procedures governing data entry into TIMS to test the reliability of the  data provided. To determine the number of public challenges to MMS\u2019  decisions, we interviewed officials at MMS headquarters and its three  regional offices: Gulf of Mexico, Pacific and the Alaska regional offices.  Officials from the Alaska regional office indicated that they had two public  challenges during this time period. Neither headquarters nor the other  regions reported any other public challenges. We collected and reviewed  the case files for the two challenged decisions to identify who challenged  the decisions, the basis for the challenge, when the challenges occurred,  and their outcomes.
