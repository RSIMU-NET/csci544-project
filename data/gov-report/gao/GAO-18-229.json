Further, all components have relevant policies or guidance in place, and all are undertaking efforts to enhance their practices in accordance with departmental guidance. Since DHS and DOJ components have varying missions and operational needs and interact with the public in different capacities, the nature and scope of training, as well as the number and duration of courses offered in response to individuals with mental illness varies; however, they generally include elements focusing on de-escalation and communication. In addition, DHS and DOJ both have efforts underway to have components review their training and policies under departmental guidance and plan to begin implementing any changes by 2018.", "Stakeholders cited leading practices and tools for effective law enforcement responses, and DHS and DOJ components have generally leveraged information from other knowledgeable parties. For example, the Crisis Intervention Team approach involves training selected law enforcement officers on mental health topics and dispatching those officers on mental-health related calls. While models like this are typically used by state and local law enforcement agencies, their benefits could be considered in other settings such as federal law enforcement. DHS and DOJ officials are also using collaborative mechanisms within their departments, such as conference calls and working groups with officials, that have helped them leverage information from knowledgeable parties. In addition, DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), which supports programs and initiatives in the areas of law enforcement, among other activities, has developed and makes publicly available resources such as its Police-Mental Health Collaboration Toolkit. BJA also is working to stand up a national training and technical assistance center to improve law enforcement responses to people with mental illness.

Since law enforcement officers can encounter individuals affected  by mental illness in the course of their duties, the nature of their  interaction has become an issue of national concern. In particular,  research has demonstrated that such encounters: may require special training and skills to address; may depend on the availability of community and mental health  resources for a positive outcome; are often time-consuming and difficult for law enforcement officers to  typically involve repeat contacts with individuals who have unmet  mental health needs; and  can involve volatile situations, risking tragic injuries or even death.", "Such concerns and potential safety issues underscore the importance of  developing tailored approaches, training, and policies to help guide police  departments and law enforcement officials.", "To date, most efforts to promote such training or policies have been  focused on state and local law enforcement agencies, such as police  departments.

We worked with officials at  each component to identify officers and agents with varied tenures and  experiences. We then summarized the information collected from the  discussion groups and identified common themes across the selected  components. We worked closely with the departments to organize these  discussion groups; however, these officers\u2019 and agents\u2019 perspectives  cannot be generalized to their entire components or to all federal law  enforcement components. Nevertheless, their views provided valuable  insights into the challenges they face on the job.", "To identify the training, policies, and guidance in place, we reviewed  documents from each of our selected law enforcement components,  when available, and conducted interviews with officials at the selected  components responsible for the development or delivery of training or  policies. We also reviewed fiscal year 2018 budget justifications for each  of our selected components to identify changes in staffing levels or  training plans that may be related to officers\u2019 and agents\u2019 response to  incidents involving individuals with mental illness. In addition, since  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (section 504)  prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, which includes mental  illness, in federally funded and federally conducted programs and  activities, we took steps to understand the section\u2019s applicability to  federal law enforcement operations. Specifically, we reviewed  departmental guidance related to section 504 and reviewed the selected  components\u2019 documentation of efforts to review their training, policies,  and procedures in accordance with that guidance. We also interviewed  department and component officials familiar with the review efforts.", "To identify leading practices stakeholders cited for effective law  enforcement responses to incidents involving individuals with mental  illness, we used a multi-stage process. We first conducted a search of  databases and organizational websites to identify published work related  to law enforcement responses to individuals with mental illness that had  been published on or after January 1, 2007. We then narrowed our  search and reviewed only literature review articles, meta-analyses, and  summary papers published by academics, think tanks and advocacy  groups, or government agencies to identify any potential leading  practices.

Through our review of these documents and websites, we  selected six stakeholders in the field of law enforcement-mental health to solicit their opinions on leading practices. These stakeholders consisted  of four organizations and two independent researchers who have either  published research or implemented programs, among other criteria,  related to law enforcement responses to incidents involving individuals  with mental illness.

This process, known as  \u201cdeinstitutionalization,\u201d has been driven in part by limited funding available  for mental health services, changes in treatment philosophy, and medical  advancements. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  publication, one result from this shift is that local police departments have  had to meet the growing needs of individuals suffering mental health  emergencies (e.g., a schizophrenic episode), and are often the first  source of assistance in helping to arrange treatment for these  individuals.", "Similarly, the IACP reports that police officers often have to \u201cmanage  situations that result from a history of mental health policy and legislative  decisions made by federal and state governments.\u201d According to the  IACP, law enforcement officers\u2014generally local police\u2014may then find  themselves serving in a role similar to that of a social worker in attempting  to locate treatment services for such individuals. The IACP also reports  that such increasing interactions may result in individuals with mental  illness being arrested and placed in jail, rather than receiving treatment  from mental health facilities. This can result in a cycle of arrest,  imprisonment, and recidivism for such individuals. In addition,  interactions between law enforcement officers and individuals with mental  illness have the potential to escalate into violence.", "In recent years, a number of professional organizations and advocacy  groups such as IACP, the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), the  National Alliance on Mental Illness, and Council of State Governments  Justice Center (CSG JC) have researched and advocated for different  approaches that may reduce the likelihood of violent encounters or help  officers connect the individuals they encounter with proper treatment  services. In addition, DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), within  its Office of Justice Programs, has created a compendium of existing  information and research in the field of state and local law enforcement  responses to individuals with mental illness.", "Federal law enforcement officers and agents may interact with individuals  displaying signs of mental illness in a number of different types of  incidents while performing their various missions, such as protecting  federal property or officials or when apprehending subjects of an  investigation. Figure 1 provides one example of a possible incident an  officer or agent might experience and the response options available.  Generally, when federal officers and agents encounter individuals  displaying signs of mental illness\u2014and there is no evidence of a federal  crime\u2014they may refer them to local law enforcement or health care  providers to assess their mental health and determine whether they need  further health care. If local providers determine that such care is  needed, it is generally provided through a voluntary or involuntary  commitment to a local mental health services provider. One exception to  this is for correctional officers and other staff within BOP, as these staff  interact with individuals with a diagnosed mental illness as part of their  daily duties in ensuring a secure prison environment. BOP pre- designates all inmates entering its institutions and assigns initial mental  health and medical screen assignments.

However, responding to incidents involving  individuals with mental illness can be challenging for multiple reasons,  including determining whether the person is suffering from a mental  illness or from another issue, such as drug addiction, and communicating  with the person, for example, when a person may be suffering from  delusions. These officers and agents face these challenges while also  being responsible for ensuring their own safety and that of others in the  area. Some of the common challenges officers and agents identified  during our discussion groups follow.", "Identifying Whether an Individual Has a Mental Illness  Some officers and agents in our group discussions stated that when  encountering individuals displaying erratic behavior (e.g., rapid or  nonsensical speech, paranoid or delusional statements), it can be difficult  to determine if that behavior is attributable to a mental illness or the  influence of drugs. Specifically, Border Patrol agents\u2014who are broadly  responsible for preventing the illegal entry or exit of people and goods at  places other than ports of entry\u2014stated that determining whether  someone has a mental illness or is experiencing other issues is  challenging and may be complicated by language barriers. Border Patrol  agents may at times encounter large groups of people attempting to cross  the border at one time and thus have limited time to make that  determination. ATF officers\u2014who may encounter individuals with a  mental illness who are targets of an investigation\u2014commented that  incidents may involve an individual who could suffer a mental illness  (treated or untreated), or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Unless the individual discloses his or her condition, or family or friends  are there to explain the condition, officers would not know the cause of  the individual\u2019s behavior. They explained that if mental health information  about a suspect is known in advance of an operation, officers can adjust  their approach; however, they told us that most of the time they do not  know if someone has a mental health condition and how it might present  itself.", "Similarly, an FBI police officer\u2014who may encounter individuals displaying  signs of mental illness if those individuals enter an FBI office\u2014told us that  it can be challenging to deal with an individual who is acting erratically,  not knowing precisely whether the behavior is attributable to a mental  illness, and there may be limited time available to address an individual  posing a safety risk. BOP corrections officers also echoed this challenge.  They said that despite having back-up mental health staff on call, their  initial reaction to an inmate exhibiting some type of erratic behavior has to  be fairly quick to secure the safety of the staff and other inmates. Officers  and agents across components and departments made clear that they  are not mental health professionals or psychologists and, as such, are  charged with responding to the behaviors that are exhibited to secure the  scene.", "Communicating with Individuals with a Mental Illness  Some of the officers and agents in our discussion groups stated that  communicating effectively with someone exhibiting signs of a mental  illness and understanding what he or she may be going through or how  he or she sees reality can be challenging. One officer told us that trying to  make individuals who may have a mental illness understand that their  reality is not everyone else\u2019s reality is particularly challenging. This was  very difficult, for example, for Secret Service Uniformed Division officers  who explained that they encounter individuals when providing security  along the White House fence and for FPS officers, who often encounter  individuals displaying signs of mental illness near or in federal buildings  that they are assigned to protect. As the Secret Service officers  explained, even if individuals exhibit delusional behavior, so long as they  have not broken any laws, then they are free to be near protected federal  venues and the officers are limited in any actions they can take.", "One officer, discussing the challenges in  speaking with someone with a mental illness  who may be experiencing delusions, stated  that the person is \u201cwholeheartedly convinced  that what he or she perceives is the true  reality.\u201d", "Officers and agents who we met with in CBP reported that they rely on  common sense to dictate appropriate action and use reasonable efforts to  protect themselves and others. They noted that additional training on  communicating effectively with individuals suffering from mental illness  could be beneficial.", "The challenges noted above in identifying causes of erratic behavior or  effectively communicating with individuals with a mental illness can make  it difficult for officers to resolve a tense situation or apprehend an  individual (if necessary) as securely or peacefully as possible. For  example, Border Patrol agents stated that ensuring that such encounters  are resolved safely for the individuals involved and other members of the  public is their biggest challenge. It might require removing someone in  distress from a group of individuals that he or she may be traveling with or  keeping him or her calm. When someone is in an extreme state of panic,  emotional distress, or anger, officers try to remove the person from the  group to prevent a potential incident from escalating quickly.", "Operating with Limited Access to Mental Health Resources  Officers and agents also stated that a limited number of mental health  professionals available within their components or through local agencies  can pose a challenge in helping persons with mental illness receive  necessary treatment. As such, they must rely on state and local entities in  the area (e.g., law enforcement, hospitals) to provide assistance for  individuals. Federal Air Marshals\u2014who provide protection at airports and  other transportation modes\u2014we spoke with explained that since they do  not have holding facilities to secure individuals with mental illness, they  are reliant on local law enforcement and mental health professionals to  manage an incident. Officers and agents highlighted the importance of  maintaining close relationships with state and local partners and added  that trained mental health professionals provide an excellent resource.", "In addition, officers and agents in some discussion groups noted there  may be training offered by state or local agencies related to  understanding and responding to individuals with mental illness that could  be leveraged by federal agencies. Officers and agents reported,  however, that it can be difficult for the components to find the time and  resources to send officers to the trainings. According to USMS officers\u2014 who provide security at federal courthouses and oversee transport of  federal prisoners\u2014this is particularly challenging in small offices where  there may be very few staff.", "Frequently Encountering the Same Individuals  Another common challenge noted in discussion groups was that officers  and agents repeatedly encounter the same individuals with mental illness.  Officers and agents explained that they can sometimes apprehend  individuals who are creating a disturbance, but these individuals often  cannot be charged with a federal crime. As such, following the  apprehension, the officers and agents release these individuals to local or  state authorities who may transport them to local providers for a mental  health evaluation. Typically, if the local providers determine a  commitment is necessary, they will hold these individuals at a hospital or  clinic for up to 72 hours. According to the officers and agents in our  discussion groups, many of these individuals return after they are  released and the officers and agents encounter them time and again, with  very little that they can do to provide these individuals with assistance.  According to the officers and agents, incidents involving frequent  encounters with the same individuals can take time away from performing  other important activities.", "Secret Service Uniformed Division officers told us they repeatedly  encounter the same individuals with mental illness and know some of  these individuals very well. For example, Secret Service officers stated  that when performing their duties in patrolling the grounds of the White  House, they have had frequent encounters with a woman who believes  she has family members living in the White House. The officers have  turned her away from the scene on multiple occasions, but she continues  to return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components Have Some Type of Training, Policies, and Guidance Related to Mental Illness, and Reviews to Enhance Practices are Underway", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS and DOJ Components Offer, Receive, or Are Developing Some Type of Training Related to Mental Illness", "paragraphs": ["All of the law enforcement components in our scope offer training directly,  receive training through FLETC, or are developing some training on  responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness.

Since these  components have varying missions and operational needs and interact  with the public in different capacities, the nature and scope of this  training, as well as the number of courses and the duration of courses  offered varies. For example, BOP\u2019s staff\u2014including food service workers  and nurses, as well as correctional officers\u2014have daily contact with  inmates with mental illness and can act as \u201cfirst responders\u201d when  situations merit.

As another example, ATF\u2019s agents told us they have  less routine contact with individuals with mental illness, but ATF offers a  course to its agents on de-escalation concepts and tactics, which  addresses responding to incidents involving individuals with mental  illness, as well as crisis intervention training to its cadre of crisis  negotiators.

Section 14025 also calls for direction and guidance on  the establishment and improvement of computerized information systems  to provide timely information related to situations involving individuals with  mental illness.", "As a result of our questions about whether such efforts would be  developed, on December 7, 2017, DOJ sent a letter from the Principal  Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs to  federal law enforcement partners outlining resources available for federal  law enforcement when considering training or procedures appropriate for  their missions. Specifically, DOJ sent the letter to executive officers within  DOJ, DHS, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and  other executive departments that DOJ deemed appropriate. Some  examples of resources that the letter highlights include (1) the Police- Mental Health Collaboration Toolkit, which provides resources to assist  law enforcement agencies in partnering with mental health providers (and  is discussed later in this report) and (2) a forthcoming \u201croadmap\u201d planned  for release in 2018 that the Office of Justice Programs and BJA are  developing that will help law enforcement agencies as they plan for  engagement with mental health entities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Leading Practices and Tools for Effective Law Enforcement Responses, and Components Have Generally Leveraged Information from Other Knowledgeable Parties", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Two Leading Practices and Four Tools Can Enhance Officer Responses to Individuals with Mental Illness", "paragraphs": ["Of the six stakeholders in the field of law enforcement-mental health we  interviewed, all six considered the Crisis Intervention Team Model to be a  leading practice and five considered the Co-responder Model to be a  leading practice\u2014see Figure 2.

To  enhance information sharing among DHS components, CRCL has  implemented an interagency collaboration mechanism. Specifically,  CRCL officials reported that since June 2016 they have led monthly  coordination conference calls with component Disability Access  Coordinators to collaborate on their respective efforts to complete their  self-evaluations. According to the Disability Access Coordinators, these  sessions have provided a forum to share ideas and lessons learned  across the DHS components. In addition, according to CRCL officials,  once their office receives the components\u2019 self-evaluations and plans, it  aims to disseminate information on lessons learned and effective  practices to all the components.", "Coordination efforts to leverage information also exist within DOJ.  Specifically, through the efforts to review policies and training under the  January 2017 guidance and provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act  discussed earlier, DOJ\u2019s components have reported taking efforts to  collaborate with one another and share information on training, best  practices and lessons learned. For example, officials from ATF reported  holding meetings with other components to discuss their efforts to  implement the January 2017 guidance.", "Additionally, BJA officials told us they took part in the ODAG\u2019s working  group in early 2016 when the then-Deputy Attorney General\u2019s January  2017 guidance was in development. Along with BJA, this ODAG working  group included DOJ\u2019s law enforcement components and other offices  within the department. The working group provided a forum to advise  ODAG in developing the January 2017 guidance and discuss issues  surrounding disabilities, which involved responses to individuals with  mental illness. BJA officials told us that they provided to components a  compendium of all its resources available to assist law enforcement\u2019s  response to incidents involving individuals with mental illness. BJA  officials said they later took the most promising of these and folded them  into its Police-Mental Health Collaboration Toolkit. Further, BJA officials  told us that they make all of the resources it develops, including the  Toolkit, publicly available on the BJA website. According to the officials,  these resources are available for all law enforcement agencies, including  federal entities, to review and consider implementing as they deem  appropriate.", "In addition to these online resources, which facilitate information sharing,  BJA is also planning to release a national CIT curriculum in 2018 that will  serve as a resource that can be tailored to reflect mental health training  and collaboration under development or underway at the local level. The  Office of Justice Programs is supporting a partnership between the IACP  and a research organization to deliver the curriculum to law enforcement  agencies. In addition, BJA\u2014as one of DOJ\u2019s grant-making entities\u2014is  standing up the National Training and Technical Assistance Center to  Improve Law Enforcement Responses to Individuals with Mental Health  Disorders and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. BJA officials  reported that in September 2017, BJA selected the awardee to design  and operate the center. Once the center is operational, it will benefit state,  local, and tribal law enforcement entities. In addition, BJA envisions that  the center will facilitate better collaboration between law enforcement  agencies and their mental health partners. A BJA official also  acknowledged that the center could serve as an additional resource for  federal law enforcement agencies to consult as they review their  trainings, policies, and guidance relevant to responding to incidents  involving individuals with mental illness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOJ and DHS for their review and  comment.

(2) What type of training, policies, and guidance, if any, are in  place at selected DHS and DOJ components to prepare federal law  enforcement officers for responding to incidents involving individuals with  mental illness? (3) What leading practices or tools have relevant  stakeholders cited for effective responses to incidents involving  individuals with mental illness, and how have DHS and DOJ components  leveraged information from other knowledgeable parties?", "We focused our review on the training, policies, and guidance put forth by  the DHS and DOJ components listed in table 6 below because they  comprise nearly all of the federal law enforcement officers in these  agencies.", "To identify challenges that federal law enforcement officers and agents at  our selected DHS and DOJ components face when responding to  incidents involving individuals with mental illness, we held discussion  groups of six to eleven agents or officers within each component in our  scope. We worked with officials at each component to identify officers and  agents with varied tenures and experiences. We held semi-structured in- person and telephone discussion groups using a script and set of  questions. Discussion groups are not designed to provide generalizable  or statistically reliable results; they are instead intended to generate in- depth information about the reasons for the discussion group participants\u2019  attitudes on specific topics and to offer insight into their concerns. During  the discussion groups, we asked officers and agents what challenges  they face when responding to incidents involving individuals with mental  illness, among other topics. We moderated each discussion to keep  participants focused on the specified issues within discussion time  frames. Participants identified challenges when we explicitly asked them  to do so, or during the course of the discussion. We took detailed notes  on each discussion and documented the perspectives participants raised  in each discussion group. We then summarized the information collected  and identified common themes. Because our questions were open-ended  and designed to allow participants to discuss any challenges they may  have experienced, we cannot determine whether the absence of a  particular concern or challenge by a group of officers or agents is an  indication that they did not experience the concern or that they did not  raise it when asked broadly about the topic.", "While these participants\u2019 perspectives cannot be generalized to their  entire component or all law enforcement components, their views  provided insights into the challenges federal law enforcement officers and  agents face when responding to incidents involving individuals with  mental illness. We have relied on the observations gathered during these  discussion groups to answer this reporting objective as the officers and  agents are uniquely positioned to speak to their experiences, and any  challenges they face, responding to incidents involving individuals with  mental illness.", "To identify the training, policies, and guidance in place, we reviewed  documents from each of our selected law enforcement components,  when available, to examine their nature and scope. We further reviewed  information on the duration, requirements, and delivery mechanism of the  training. We then summarized and verified this training information with  each component through email documentation. For the policies, we  reviewed the documentation to determine whether it was specific to  responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness or  whether mental illness was contained within a larger directive. We also  reviewed 2018 budget justification documents for each component in  order to identify changes in staffing levels or training plans that might be  related to officers\u2019 and agents\u2019 response to incidents involving individuals  with mental illness. We also interviewed officials responsible for the  development or delivery of training, policies, or guidance from the  components in our scope to gather additional information that could help  prepare federal law enforcement officers and agents to respond to  incidents involving individuals with mental illness. In addition, since  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, prohibits  discrimination on the basis of disability, which includes mental illness, in  federally funded and federally conducted programs and activities, we  took steps to understand the section\u2019s applicability to federal law  enforcement operations. Specifically, we reviewed departmental  guidance related to section 504 and reviewed the selected components\u2019  documentation of efforts to review their training, policies, and procedures  in accordance with that guidance. We also interviewed officials from the  departmental offices overseeing these component efforts\u2014DHS\u2019s Office  of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) and DOJ\u2019s Office of the Deputy  Attorney General (ODAG).", "To identify leading practices or tools stakeholders cited for effective law  enforcement responses to incidents involving individuals with mental  illness, we used a multi-stage process Specifically, we:  1.  conducted a search of databases, such as ProQuest and Scopus, and  organizational websites, such as those from the Council of State  Governments, Justice Center (CSG JC) and Police Executive  Research Forum (PERF), to identify published work related to law  enforcement responses to individuals with mental illness that had  been published on or after January 1, 2007 (the last 10 years).  2.  reviewed the 96 published research papers and articles that our initial  search yielded and then refined our selection criteria to include only  those that were literature reviews, meta-analyses, or summary papers  published by academics, think tanks and advocacy groups, or  government agencies. We reviewed summary articles rather than all  the primary research articles to balance breadth, depth, and  efficiency. After refining our search, there were 16 documents that  met our selection criteria.  3.  reviewed the 16 to identify any potential leading practices. We  determined that a practice was potentially leading if it was found in at  least one of the remaining 16 articles and was a law enforcement \u2013  mental health program. Using these criteria, we identified two  potential leading practices.  4.  asked individual and organizational stakeholders to validate whether  these were leading practices and to identify any additional leading  practices that we might have missed. In order for us to consider an  independent researcher as a stakeholder, the individual needed to  have (a) authored or co-authored at least 2 of the 16 documents that  met our search criteria as outlined earlier and (b) been recommended  by another stakeholder. These criteria yielded two independent  researchers from whom to solicit views. In order for us to consider an  organization as a stakeholder, the organizations needed to have  either (a) conducted research on law enforcement responses to  individuals with mental illness; (b) administered law enforcement- mental health collaborative programs; or (c) launched a national  campaign on law enforcement responses to individuals with mental  illness. After reviewing the websites of organizations that potentially  met these criteria, we selected four organizations from which to solicit  views. In addition, we selected individuals within the organizations as  knowledgeable stakeholders if they were either (1) recommended by  another stakeholder; or (2) managed a law enforcement-mental health  program or national campaign. As a result of these steps, we  identified and interviewed six stakeholders (two independent  researchers and four organizations) to gather their broad views of the  dynamic between law enforcement and individuals with mental illness;  to obtain their observations of any practices or tools, such as training  guides or reports that have been used to enhance officer response;  and to provide feedback on leading practices.

We also took note of any tools they  mentioned and probed further to understand their origins and intent. We  confirmed with all six of the selected stakeholders that the CIT Model met  our definition of leading practice and confirmed with five out of the six  stakeholders that the Co-responder Model met our definition. Some  stakeholders also identified other practices as leading; however, none of  those practices had at least two other stakeholders confirm it as a leading  practice.", "In addition, to determine how DOJ and DHS components leverage  information from other knowledgeable parties, such as experts,  associations, or colleagues in other components, we reviewed relevant  documentation on these efforts, as available.
