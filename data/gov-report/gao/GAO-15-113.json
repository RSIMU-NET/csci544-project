Thirty of the 112 programs were identified by the agencies as specifically targeting individuals with serious mental illness. Four agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, DOJ, and VA\u2014reported that they obligated about $5.7 billion for programs that specifically targeted individuals with serious mental illness in fiscal year 2013. Agencies had difficulty identifying all programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness because they did not always track whether or not such individuals were among those served by the program. Agencies also varied in which programs they identified because they had different definitions of what such a program might be. Such inconsistency limits the potential comparability across programs.", "Interagency coordination for programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness is lacking. HHS is charged with leading the federal government's public health efforts related to mental health, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is required to promote coordination of programs relating to mental illness throughout the federal government. In the past, HHS led the Federal Executive Steering Committee for Mental Health, with members from across the federal government. However, the steering committee has not met since 2009. HHS officials told us that the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council (BHCC) performs some functions previously carried out by the steering committee. The BHCC, however, is limited to HHS and is not an interagency committee. Other interagency committees were broad in scope and did not target individuals with serious mental illness. Staff for the majority of the programs targeting serious mental illness reported taking steps to coordinate with staff in other agencies. While coordination at the program level is important, it does not take the place of, or achieve the level of, leadership that GAO has previously found to be key to successful coordination and that is essential to identifying whether there are gaps in services and if agencies have the necessary information to assess the reach and effectiveness of their programs.", "Agencies completed few evaluations of the programs specifically targeting individuals with serious mental illness. Of the 30 programs specifically targeting individuals with serious mental illness, 9 programs had a completed program evaluation, 4 programs had an evaluation underway, and 17 programs had no evaluation completed and none planned. However, agency officials said they engaged in other efforts\u2014such as drawing on evidence in published literature\u2014to ensure their programs were effective.

DOD reported the largest number, a total of  34 programs, and HHS identified 33. Together, the agencies accounted  for more than half of the 112 programs. DOJ and VA also each reported  over 10 programs. Overall, many of the programs focused on the  provision of support services and a few programs focused on research or  surveillance. Programs that provided support services included those that  provided case management services such as SAMHSA\u2019s Criminal and  Juvenile Justice Programs. These programs sought to divert individuals  with serious mental illness from the criminal justice system by providing  support services that connect the individual to behavioral health, housing,  and job placement services.

During follow-up interviews, officials from several agencies indicated that  they were unsure how many individuals with serious mental illness were  served by various programs. Specifically, some agencies noted that they  administered broad federal programs focusing on individuals with  disabilities that could serve individuals with serious mental illness. For  example, Education officials indicated that individuals with serious mental  illness could have been among individuals eligible to receive services  under their Centers for Independent Living program that provided  financial assistance to community-based centers for independent living.", "However, Education officials were unsure the extent to which the program  served individuals with serious mental illness because that was not the  focus of the program and because individuals self-identify their disability,  which may include a serious mental illness. Similarly, the Disability  Employment Initiative administered by DOL served all people with  disabilities, including individuals with serious mental illness, but it was  unclear how many individuals with serious mental illness were served by  this program. Officials from agencies within HHS also noted that it is  possible that all of their programs could support individuals with serious  mental illness.", "The inability of agencies to identify a comprehensive list or inventory of  programs for individuals with serious mental illness is problematic. The  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires OMB to compile a  comprehensive list of all federal programs identified by agencies, and to  include the purposes of each program, how it contributes to the agency\u2019s  mission, and recent funding information. However, as we reported  earlier this year, our initial review of these lists identified concerns about  the usefulness of the information being developed and the extent to which  it might be able to assist executive branch and congressional efforts to  identify and address fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. The lack of  such a list makes it more difficult for executive branch agencies and  Congress to determine whether proposed or existing programs are  duplicative.", "In addition to difficulties in identifying a comprehensive inventory of  programs for individuals with serious mental illness, some agencies also  had difficulty identifying how much funding was obligated for programs  supporting individuals with serious mental illness. For example, HHS\u2019s  National Institutes of Health identified all of its activities, including its  mental health activities as one program, Scientific Research. Officials  said they were able to identify funding amounts for individual research  studies related to certain illnesses that may be considered serious mental  illnesses, such as depression or schizophrenia. They noted that they were currently developing a method to categorize all research grants that  were related to serious mental illness. Similarly, DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Prisons  identified three programs targeting individuals with serious mental illness  but could not provide the obligated funding amounts for the programs,  providing instead an amount that included all psychology services  programs, which included all of the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 substance abuse  and mental health programs.", "In addition, the number and scope of programs agencies identified is  likely incomplete and difficult to compare across agencies for a variety of  other reasons. Agencies varied widely in how they counted their  programs, resulting in inconsistencies among agencies, thus limiting the  potential comparability across programs. Some agencies identified  broad programs that included many activities; other agencies counted  each of these underlying activities as a separate program. For example,  within DOD, the Army included one program, the Behavioral Health  System of Care, which included a broad array of mental health and  substance abuse activities for servicemembers and their families. In  contrast, the Navy chose to list each comparable behavioral health  activity as a separate program. Furthermore, NIH identified only one  program, its Scientific Research program, which encompassed all of its  internal and external research project grants on topics ranging from  cardiovascular health to those grants related to mental illness.", "Agencies also varied in how they defined their programs and in which  programs they chose to include. For example, DOD officials identified all  of their suicide prevention programs as those that support individuals with  serious mental illness, but SAMHSA officials did not initially include any of  their suicide prevention programs. They explained that these services  were not limited only to individuals with serious mental illness and served  a broader population. Subsequently, after further discussion with us,  SAMHSA included their suicide prevention programs among those that  can support individuals with serious mental illness. In another instance,  HUD and VA jointly administered the HUD-VA Supportive Housing  program, a specialized program aimed at providing housing and other  services to disabled veterans. VA officials indicated that this program was  targeting individuals with serious mental illness while HUD maintained  that the program was not targeting this population. Similar to these  challenges in identifying programs supporting individuals with serious  mental illness, our prior work has also found that agencies took various  approaches to defining their programs. This variation in definitions across  agencies can limit comparability among similar programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Interagency Coordination of Programs Supporting People with Serious Mental Illness Is Lacking", "paragraphs": ["Agency-level committees that officials said allowed them to coordinate  efforts regarding mental health did not focus on, and took little action  specific to, serious mental illness.

Despite SAMHSA\u2019s recognition of the need to  coordinate, such coordination related to serious mental illness has been  largely absent across the federal government. Further, our previous work  has demonstrated the value of interagency coordination when it is  supported by agency leadership.

Human Services  Research Institute\u2019s 2011 evaluation report found that the program was  successful in giving those with psychiatric disabilities a voice in the  exercise of their rights, among other things. However, the report also  found deficiencies in the program, such as insufficient training for federal  program and contract officials regarding PAIMI requirements and frequent  difficulties gaining access to at-risk individuals in residential settings.  SAMHSA provided us with information about how the agency has  addressed the deficiencies outlined in the PAIMI evaluation.", "In addition, the Army Deputy Chief of Staff conducted an evaluation of the  Army National Guard Psychological Health program in 2013. The  evaluation recommended that the program demonstrate that the services  delivered were responding to a specific need of its target population\u2014 Army National Guard and Army Reservists\u2014and noted that it is unclear  whether the program is reaching Reservists. The evaluation also found  that the program adhered to its quality standards and effectively solicited  customer feedback.", "Four of the 30 programs targeting individuals with serious mental illness  reported having evaluations underway that were scheduled for completion  after September 2014. The SSA Homeless with Schizophrenia  Presumptive Disability program is scheduled for completion in December  2014, the SAMHSA Projects for Assistance with the Transition from  Homelessness program and Mental Health Homelessness Prevention  programs are scheduled for completion in 2016, and the DOD Air Force  Air National Guard Psychological Health program is scheduled for  completion in 2017.", "The remaining 17 programs targeting individuals with serious mental  illness had not completed a program evaluation. This included all 3 DOJ  programs, all 8 VA programs, 2 DOD programs, and 4 HHS programs.  (See table 4.) Our prior work has shown that program evaluations  address specific questions about program performance and may focus on  assessing program operations or results. These evaluations can play a  key role in agency strategic planning and in program management,  providing important feedback on both program design and execution.  Although our past work has found that some program evaluations can be  expensive, the relatively few evaluations completed among programs  targeted for individuals with mental illness is a concern because without  meaningful and timely evaluations, agencies may lose opportunities to  identify improvements in federal government efficiency and effectiveness,  and because comprehensive evaluations can be key to coordinating and  streamlining federal programs.30 programs and their evaluation status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Individuals with serious mental illness can face significant challenges  getting the services they need. Agencies identified a wide range of federal  programs\u2014across multiple agencies\u2014that can support individuals with  serious mental illness. Although staff in programs targeting serious  mental illness reported taking steps to coordinate their individual  programs, coordination efforts among agency leadership to address  serious mental illness are lacking. The absence of this high-level  coordination hinders the federal government\u2019s ability to develop an  overarching perspective of its programs supporting and targeting  individuals with serious mental illness. Although SAMHSA\u2014the agency  within HHS that is required to promote coordination of programs relating  to mental illness throughout the federal government\u2014has made some  effort to coordinate on mental health broadly, it has shown little leadership  in coordinating federal efforts on behalf of those with serious mental  illness. Without stronger leadership from HHS to coordinate an integrated,  interagency approach, it is difficult to attain the type of high-level  perspective needed to determine whether there are gaps in services. For  example, federal agencies reported difficulty even identifying which  programs can support this vulnerable population. Stronger HHS  leadership can also help ensure that agencies have the necessary  information to assess the reach and effectiveness of their programs for  individuals with serious mental illness. The new subcommittee within  HHS\u2019s BHCC may provide a useful starting point to facilitate this  coordination around serious mental illness; however, the subcommittee is  new and the BHCC is limited to HHS and is not an interagency  committee.", "We have also reported many times on the importance of conducting  formal program evaluations to inform program managers on the overall  design and operation of the program and ensure that the program\u2019s  objectives are being met. Although about $5.7 billion was obligated by 4  agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, DOJ, and VA\u2014to support federal programs  specifically targeting individuals with serious mental illnesses, less than  one-third had a completed program evaluation. The public health, social,  and economic impact of serious mental illness, coupled with the  constrained fiscal environment of recent years, highlights the need to  ensure that federal programs efficiently and effectively use their  resources to support the complex needs of individuals with serious mental  illness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To understand the full breadth of federal programs and the scope of  federal resources expended on programs supporting those with serious  mental illness, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS establish a  mechanism to facilitate intra- and interagency coordination, including  actions that would assist with identifying the programs, resources, and  potential gaps in federal efforts to support individuals with serious mental  illness.", "To help determine if programs are effective at supporting those  individuals with serious mental illness, we recommend that the  Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs,  and the Attorney General\u2014which oversee programs targeting individuals  with serious mental illness\u2014document which of their programs targeted  for individuals with serious mental illness should be evaluated and how  often such evaluations should be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, DOJ, DOL, Education, HHS,  HUD, SSA, and VA for review and comment.

DOJ, Education, HHS, and HUD provided technical  comments on this report that we incorporated as appropriate. Although  our report does not include recommendations directed to SSA, it said it  agreed with our report. DOL had no comments on the report.", "Our first recommendation was directed to HHS exclusively. HHS did not  concur with this recommendation, which calls for the agency to establish  a mechanism to facilitate intra- and interagency coordination. HHS noted  that funding for SAMHSA is largely allocated to specific programs by  Congress and thus improving coordination should include coordination at  the Congressional level. HHS also stated that the recommendation was  not supported because coordination was already occurring at the program  level and there was not a specific need identified by agencies,  stakeholders, or individuals with serious mental illness that more  coordination was necessary.", "The report acknowledges that coordination at a program level is important  but notes that it cannot take the place of coordination at higher levels that  would provide the perspective needed to assess the reach and  effectiveness of all of the federal government\u2019s programs targeting  individuals with serious mental illness. In addition, as we note in the  report, SAMHSA\u2019s own enabling legislation, as amended, includes a  requirement to promote coordination of programs relating to mental  illness throughout the federal government, and its own strategic plan  recognizes the need for coordination as well. In addition, our past work  has highlighted the importance of interagency coordination supported by  agency leadership. In light of these other sources demonstrating the  importance of interagency coordination beyond the program staff level to  the agency level, we believe our recommendation is appropriate and well- supported.", "In addition, HHS expressed concern that we excluded Medicare and  Medicaid from our scope, stating that this omission was unexplained and  that it created inconsistencies in our findings because we included  treatment and support services funded by DOD and VA. However, as we  stated explicitly throughout the report, we excluded health benefit  programs including Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The purpose of  this report was to provide information on programs supporting individuals  with serious mental illness beyond those of reimbursement. As a result,  we do not believe it creates the inconsistencies stated by HHS. However,  the draft included an estimate of spending on mental health services by  Medicaid and Medicare to help address HHS\u2019s concern.", "Our second recommendation on conducting program evaluations was  directed to DOD, DOJ, HHS, and VA. HHS did not concur with this  recommendation, while DOD, DOJ, and VA agreed. While HHS said that  performance measurement is important, it stated that program evaluation  is only one method of measurement and suggested that the report places  undue importance on program evaluations in particular. In the report we  acknowledge that there are other efforts to monitor performance and  program effectiveness, including the performance and outcomes targets  in SAMHSA\u2019s strategic plan, but as the report states, this type of ongoing  monitoring cannot take the place of a program evaluation. In addition,  HHS expressed concern that the report focused on completed  evaluations, noting that some program evaluations provide interim results  while still underway. In the report we acknowledge 2 HHS programs that  have program evaluations underway. Therefore, we believe we have  appropriately characterized the current status of the agency\u2019s program  evaluations.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Given the wide range of programs included in  this review, we relied on the federal agencies to identify the programs that  met the criteria above. When necessary, we discussed these criteria with  the agencies. For example, SAMHSA officials did not initially include any  of their suicide prevention programs, submitting instead only those  programs that were specifically targeted for individuals with serious  mental illness. After several discussions, SAMHSA officials provided the  names of 12 additional programs, including their suicide prevention  programs that can provide general support to individuals with serious  mental illness. However, SAMHSA officials did not identify the primary  purpose or provide additional information on these more broadly focused  programs.", "We received requests from several agencies to eliminate some of their  programs from our review for various reasons. For example, Navy and  Marine Corps program staff included their substance abuse programs in  their responses to the questionnaire. After discussions with DOD, we  determined that since these programs focus on substance abuse rather  than mental health they should be removed.

In some cases, we could not obtain data on funds obligated for these  programs because agency officials told us that they did not report  budgetary data at this level, among other reasons.", "To minimize errors arising from differences in how questions may be  interpreted, we conducted pretests with HHS and Education in February  2014. We made appropriate revisions and our final questionnaire was  sent to several knowledgeable agency officials within each of the eight  agencies.
