GAO found in January 2018 that, of the 100 largest water systems, 12 had publicized information on the inventory of lead service lines. According to EPA, among challenges in conducting inventories of lead service lines and publicizing information about lead service lines were concerns about posting on public websites information about lead service lines on private property; and a lack of records about the locations of lead service lines. EPA told GAO the agency was focused on state compliance with drinking water rules, and not following up with information on how states could address the challenges cited.

According to  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others, there is no  level of lead that is safe in drinking water. Lead poses the greatest risk to  infants, children under the age of 6, and pregnant women. In children, it  can delay growth, cause learning and behavioral problems, and lower IQ,  while in pregnant women it can reduce fetal growth and cause premature  birth. Lead in drinking water primarily comes from the corrosion of pipes  (such as service lines made of lead) that connect the drinking water main  (a primary pipeline) to a house or building. The corrosion results from a  chemical interaction between water and pipes that wears the metal and  allows lead to dissolve or lead particles to flake away over time. Other  sources of lead in drinking water include solder that connects pipes, and  fixtures made with lead or with brass that contains lead.", "Lead was widely used in plumbing materials, including service lines, until  1986 when the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was first amended to  generally prohibit the new installation of lead pipes and solder. According  to EPA, homes built before 1986 are more likely to have lead pipes,  solder, and fixtures. Consequently, these homes are a priority for  monitoring under EPA\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, which minimizes the  amount of lead in the nation\u2019s drinking water supply. As of December  2016, the approximately 68,000 drinking water systems covered by the  Lead and Copper Rule served about 312 million people\uf8e7most of the U.S.  population. When the Lead and Copper Rule was promulgated in 1991, it  required all covered drinking water systems to collect information about  the infrastructure that delivered water to customers, including any known  lead pipes and lead service lines. The purpose of this effort\uf8e7 referred to  as materials evaluation (hereafter materials inventory)\uf8e7was to identify  locations that may have been particularly susceptible to high lead or  copper concentrations, from which water systems would collect drinking  water samples. According to 2010 EPA guidance, in developing the  materials inventory, water systems should survey all records documenting  the materials used to construct and repair the drinking water distribution  system and buildings connected to the system.", "In a January 2016 letter to Michigan\u2019s Governor, EPA noted its concern  with lack of transparency and accountability to the public in Flint.

We took  a number of steps, including conducting interviews with each study\u2019s  authors, to examine the reliability of the data used in the studies. For the  one study we reviewed that used national data, the data were of  undetermined reliability because the sample of water systems included in  the study was not generalizable to all water systems and the authors  could not verify the accuracy of the information provided by water  systems. Appendix I provides more information on our reasons for  designating the data as undetermined reliability. For the two state-specific  studies, we determined that the data represented reasonable efforts to  estimate the number of lead service lines, although the states also could  not verify the accuracy of the information provided by water systems.  Therefore, we also found these estimates to be of undetermined  reliability. Appendix I provides more information on our reasons for  designating the data as undetermined reliability. We did not find any  studies with information comparing the quality of estimates among water  systems. However, we interviewed representatives of the Greater  Cincinnati Water Works water system about their estimate and found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of describing their reported  best available estimate. We also interviewed EPA staff about their  knowledge of estimates provided by states and water systems; and  subsequently interviewed officials in some of these states, namely  Massachusetts, Ohio, and Washington. We also interviewed  representatives of water organizations to identify potential studies and  other sources of information about the number of lead service lines.

However, most states have primary responsibility  for enforcing the requirements under SDWA as amended. Water  systems are generally subject to requirements under SDWA as amended,  such as the Lead and Copper Rule, and are responsible for managing  and funding the activities and infrastructure needed to meet those  requirements.", "Such infrastructure includes storage facilities and drinking water mains  and may include other pipes such as service lines. There are 1 million  miles of drinking water mains in the country, according to a 2017  American Society of Civil Engineers study. As figure 1 illustrates,  service lines are the smaller pipes that connect the water mains to homes  and buildings. According to EPA guidance, service lines also include any  smaller pipes used for connecting a service line to the water mains (e.g.,  gooseneck pipes which are also known as pigtails). Service lines can  generally be made of lead, steel, copper, or plastic. Service lines can be  fully owned by the water system (publicly owned) or by the homeowner  (privately owned), or ownership can be shared. In most communities, lead  service lines are partially owned by the water system and partially owned  by the homeowner. With shared ownership, the water system typically  owns the service line from the water main to the curb stop, and the  homeowner owns the service line from the curb stop into the home. In  such cases, each party is responsible for maintaining the part of the  service line that it owns.", "In some circumstances, if lead levels are higher than the Lead and  Copper Rule allows and other measures do not alleviate the problem, the  Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to replace lead service  lines under the systems\u2019 control. The Lead and Copper Rule does not  require homeowners to replace the portion of lead service lines they own,  but if they choose to do so they are generally responsible for the  associated costs. The Lead and Copper Rule allows for a partial  replacement by the water system when an owner of a home or building is  unable or unwilling to pay for replacement of the portion of the service line  not owned by the water system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Total Number of Lead Service Lines Is Unknown, and National, State, and Local Estimates Vary", "paragraphs": ["The total number of lead service lines is unknown and while national,  state, and local estimates exist, approaches used to count lead service  lines vary.

According to  EPA headquarters officials we interviewed in 2017, the materials  inventory required under the Lead and Copper Rule is not intended to be  a census of lead service lines (and other lead pipes such as goosenecks/  pigtails). Instead, it is intended to provide sufficient information to develop  a plan for periodically obtaining tap samples. For example, according to  2008 EPA guidance to water systems, if a system contains lead service  lines, then, if possible, half of the sample sites should include those  served by a lead service line.", "The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to conduct complete  inventories only if the water system is required to begin replacing lead  service lines. In these instances, water systems are required to expand  the materials inventory to a complete inventory that identifies the total  number of lead service lines for the purpose of tracking replacements  over time. As we reported in 2017, based on the available data, the  majority of the 68,000 water systems subject to the Lead and Copper  Rule at the time of our review had not been required to replace lead  service lines and therefore were not required to conduct complete  inventories.", "Moreover, there are no national repositories for information about lead  service lines. In September 2017, we recommended that, as a part of  revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule, EPA require states to report data  on lead pipes (including lead service lines) and incorporate these data in  the agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System. EPA agreed with  the recommendation but has not implemented it. In May 2018, EPA noted  that it was in the process of reviewing comments received through  consultations with state and local officials and tribes. According to EPA  officials, final revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule are expected by  February 2020. We continue to believe that EPA should collect data  about lead pipes (including lead service lines) from states.

First, the sample  was not statistically representative of all 68,000 water systems subject to  the Lead and Copper Rule. Rather, the water systems that responded to  the American Water Works Association\u2019s survey are not a statistical  sample. Second, according to the study\u2019s authors, survey responses were  based on water systems\u2019 best guesses of the number of lead service lines  in their systems. However, since water systems have not been required to  maintain inventories of lead service lines, many of them do not know the  exact number. For these reasons, we are not confident that the number  accurately reflects the total number of lead service lines nationwide.", "An American Water Works Association official told us that the  organization is not planning to update the study. EPA officials told us that  they were not aware of a more recent study than the association\u2019s 2016  study.

However, for the purposes of estimating the number of lead service lines,  complete details were not available about the methodologies and some  systems that did respond were only able to provide rough guesses rather  than precise counts of lead service lines. EPA headquarters officials told  us that Massachusetts and Washington were at the forefront of states\u2019  efforts to gather information about lead service lines. EPA officials also  told us that they were not aware of any other states with published reports  estimating the number of lead service lines. However, at least two states  have also collected information about lead service lines but have not  published the information in official reports, at the time of our review.

The publicly available reports that existed as of  May 2018 provide some insight into the various approaches water  systems have used. For example, to identify lead service lines, water  systems have used visual inspection or a combination of visual  inspections, existing water system records, and discussions with  homeowners. In addition, water systems have used various definitions of  lead service lines. For example, water systems have counted:  only active service lines delivering water to customers, or both active and inactive (no longer delivering water to customers) service lines; or only the publicly owned lead service lines, or both the publicly and privately owned portions of the lead service lines; or only lead service lines or the lead service lines and goosenecks/pigtails separately."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most States Reported Fulfilling EPA\u2019s Request, but Potential Challenges Remain that EPA Information Sharing Could Help to Address", "paragraphs": ["While most states informed EPA that they intend to fulfill the agency\u2019s  request to work with water systems to publicize inventories of lead service  lines, EPA has identified potential challenges to these efforts.

We  also interviewed an official with the Environmental Defense Fund  regarding the available information about the number of lead service lines  nationally and among states and water systems. We selected these  organizations because they are all members of the Lead Service Line  Replacement Collaborative, a consortium that provides information about  voluntary lead service line replacement for states and water systems. On  behalf of the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, the  organizations we spoke with are collecting examples of states\u2019 and water  systems\u2019 experiences in conducting inventories of lead service lines, as  the first step in replacing lead service lines. Using information from these  interviews, we identified three published studies from the American Water  Works Association, the state of Massachusetts, and the state of  Washington. We interviewed the authors of the studies to determine the  reliability, completeness, and accuracy of the data presented in the  studies.", "For the 2016 American Water Works Association study, we determined  that the data were of undetermined reliability because the responses of  the water systems surveyed were not generalizable to all water systems  and the study authors could not verify the accuracy of the information.  Specifically, the sample in the 2016 American Water Works Association  study was not based on a statistical sample, and therefore the sampling  error was not calculated and information was not available to determine  whether responding water systems were similar to nonresponding water  systems. For example, the estimate is based on survey responses from  978 of the approximately 23,000 water systems that existed around the  time of the surveys, and therefore may not represent all water systems  nationwide. In addition, since many water systems do not have complete  inventories of their lead service lines, the accuracy of data that water  systems submitted in response to the survey is difficult to verify. For  example, our interview with the study authors indicates that the  information provided by water systems varied in quality, with some  systems basing their responses on rough estimates. We based our  determination about the data using the criteria of Total Survey Error,  which is a framework for assessing the validity and reliability of survey  estimates. It includes sampling error (the difference between the  population and the sample), nonresponse error, measurement error (the  difference between the true response and the response provided by the  respondent) and coverage error (the discrepancy between the list of  individuals that is used to select a sample and the target population).  EPA\u2019s 2016 Lead and Copper Rule Revisions White Paper also identified  an estimate of lead service lines. According to EPA officials, this estimate  used data from the 2016 American Water Works Association study and a  1988 American Water Works Association study cited in the regulatory  impact analysis for the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule. The 1991 estimate  also had significant limitations in measurement error and representation  error as well as a lack of documentation about key aspects of the  methodology. As such, we determined the estimate was not reliable for  the purposes of establishing the total number of lead service lines in  existence as of 1991.", "The two state-specific studies represent reasonable efforts to estimate  the number of lead service lines in these states. However, they generally  could not verify the accuracy of the information provided by these  systems because, as we note elsewhere in this report, water systems  may not know the number of lead service lines they have. Therefore, for  the state-specific studies, we also determined that the data were also of  undetermined reliability. Finally, while the Greater Cincinnati Water Works  water system did not publish a report about lead service lines, we  collected the information through an in-person interview and corroborated  the information through a review of the water system\u2019s geographic  information system database. The Greater Cincinnati Water Works\u2019 GIS  database includes the location and material information for all of the water  system\u2019s distribution system. According to the Greater Cincinnati Water  Works website, the water system continues to update its map as it  obtains more information from its customers. Based on these steps we  deemed the data provided by the water system to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of describing the estimate reported by representatives of  the Greater Cincinnati Water Works system.", "To examine states\u2019 responses to EPA\u2019s February 2016 request to work  with water systems to publicize inventories of lead service lines and any  steps EPA has taken to follow up on these responses, we relied both on  the publicly available letters from each state to EPA and on interviews  with EPA regional and headquarters officials. We did not interview state  officials in all 50 states, but reviewed some state documents, where  available. We used a standard set of open-ended questions to interview  officials in EPA\u2019s headquarters and in each of the 10 regional offices. To  analyze states\u2019 and EPA officials\u2019 responses, we conducted two analyses.  Specifically, we conducted two analyses to summarize updates in state  responses to EPA\u2019s February 2016 letter and EPA\u2019s responses to  challenges states and water systems may face in conducting and  publicizing materials inventories. To confirm each analysis, one analyst  independently summarized the information and another analyst verified  the accuracy of the information. All initial disagreements were discussed  and reconciled. All numbers in our analysis are considered approximate  because interpretations of the states\u2019 responses to EPA\u2019s 2016 letter can  differ, and states may have taken actions after our interviews with EPA  regional officials, or may have taken actions that they did not report to  EPA. Figure 4 shows the EPA regions and the states within those  regions. We also reviewed EPA documents related to EPA\u2019s request that  states take certain actions following the events in Flint, Michigan. In  addition, we reviewed federal regulations; EPA guidance to water  systems on how to implement the Lead and Copper Rule; and other  relevant documents such as an EPA white paper.", "Because EPA asked states to place an emphasis on working with large  water systems to publicize their materials inventories or updated  inventories or maps of lead service lines, we reviewed the websites of the  100 largest water systems by population. Our review was conducted in  January to February 2018; and since then, additional water systems may  have provided information to the public on lead service lines. We  identified the largest water systems, based on population served, from  data in EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System/Fed. EPA has  stated on its website that the agency acknowledges challenges related to  the data in the Safe Drinking Water Information System/Fed, specifically  underreporting of some data by states. GAO has also reported on EPA\u2019s  challenges with the Safe Drinking Water Information System/Fed. Even  with these challenges, the information on the populations served by water  systems in the Safe Drinking Water Information System/Fed is generally  reliable. We used a standard set of search terms on each website to  ensure the consistency of our searches, as well as information from water  organizations and EPA officials, where applicable. We counted a water  system as having an inventory if the water system provided a map,  interactive map, list of pipes or service lines, or numerical count of lead  service lines available to the public. To ensure the completeness of this  analysis, one analyst independently conducted the search of websites  and another analyst verified the search. All initial disagreements were  discussed and reconciled. We compared EPA\u2019s actions to follow up on  state responses with federal standards for internal control for information  and communication.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
