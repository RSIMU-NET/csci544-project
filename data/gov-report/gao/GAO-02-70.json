Nine of the 13 programs experienced accountability problems, including theft or misuse of program funds. The two island nations lacked the administrative skills to meet the federal government's complex accountability requirements, and federal managers did not provide the necessary training. Although some federal agencies tried to provide oversight, their efforts at ensuring accountability fell short because of several factors, including time, distance, and travel costs and the relatively small size of the programs in the region."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, the U.S. government entered into a Compact of Free Association  (Compact) with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands.  Under the Compact, the United States was authorized to  provide federal programs, such as grants, services, technical assistance,  and loans to the two nations. The United States was also authorized to  provide aviation, disaster relief, postal, and weather services.  The cost of  program assistance extended to the two countries was about $700 million  for the period beginning in fiscal year 1987 and ending in fiscal year 2001.   The United States designated the Department of the Interior as the agency  responsible for coordinating and monitoring these federal programs, loans,  and services.", "In the fall of 1999, the United States and the two nations began negotiations  on extending the financial provisions of the Compact, which expired in  2001.  These negotiations  also included discussions about the continued  provision of several U.S. programs.  To assist the Congress in its review of  proposals for extending assistance, you asked us to report on the  effectiveness and accountability of U.S. programs, loans, and services  provided to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands.  In response, we (1) assessed the use and effectiveness of  key U.S. programs, loans, and services provided to both nations; (2)  evaluated whether each nation\u2019s administration of these programs ensured  financial accountability; and (3) evaluated whether the U.S. government\u2019s  oversight of these programs ensured financial accountability.", "We selected 13 programs and services to review, including those with the  largest expenditures and loans over the past 15 years, as well as each of the  services that the U.S. government agreed to provide under the Compact.   To determine the use and effectiveness of U.S. programs and services, we  reviewed legislation, regulations, and monitoring reports.  We also  interviewed program recipients and program managers in the United  States, in Pohnpei and Kosrae States of the Federated States of Micronesia,  and in Majuro, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  We determined that  these U.S. domestic programs were effective by using two separate  measures. The first considered whether the programs met their program  performance requirements and standards, as detailed in their legislation  and regulations.  The second measure considered whether the programs  were able to achieve broader program goals given the conditions that  existed in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands, including those that could significantly reduce potential  program accomplishments or increase costs.  To be considered effective,  the program had to meet all performance requirements and standards and  had to overcome conditions that could significantly reduce broader  program accomplishments or increase costs.  To evaluate whether the joint  U.S., Micronesian, and Marshallese administration of these programs  ensured financial accountability, we identified requirements in legislation  and regulations, reviewed monitoring reports and financial audits, and  discussed accountability issues with program managers in each country.   (For further details regarding our scope and methodology, see app. I.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a grouping of 607 small  islands with a total land area of about 270 square miles.  FSM is located in  the western Pacific, about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, lying just above  the equator.  FSM comprises four states\u2014Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap, and  Kosrae\u2014that had an estimated total population of 107,000 in 2000.  The  Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is made up of more than 1,200  islands, islets, and atolls, with a total land area of about 70 square miles.   RMI is located in the central Pacific, about 2,100 miles southwest of  Hawaii.  The RMI had a total population of approximately 50,840.  See  figure 1 for a map of the FSM and the RMI.", "Since World War II, the United States has provided government support to  the FSM and  the RMI and extended federal programs, such as housing and  food assistance.  In addition, the United States provided for their defense;  built roads, hospitals, and schools; provided support for government  operations; and funded health and education systems.  In 1986, the United  States entered into a Compact of Free Association with the FSM and the  RMI, a process that ended U.S. administration under a United Nations  mandate and secured both nations\u2019 self-governance and certain defense  rights for the FSM, the RMI, and the United States.  The Compact provided  direct financial payments to promote economic development in each  nation. These annual financial payments totaled about $2 billion from fiscal  year 1987 through fiscal year 2001.  Previously we reported that these  payments  supported general government operations but had led to little  improvement in economic development, with both nations remaining  highly dependent on U.S. assistance.  Economic self-sufficiency at current  living standards remains a distant goal for the FSM and the RMI.  In  addition, in reviewing these expenditures, we found that the island  governments and the U.S. Departments of the Interior and State have  provided limited accountability over the Compact expenditures.", "The Compact also stated that U.S. federal agencies could provide direct  program assistance as authorized by the Congress, which included the  grants, loans, and technical assistance provided by individual federal  agencies.  In addition, the Compact identified several federal services to be  supplied by specifically identified agencies: postal services, aviation, and  weather were to be provided by specific agencies (and then reimbursed by  Interior), while the Federal Emergency Management Agency was to  provide disaster relief. In total, the program assistance provided by 19 U.S.  departments and agencies from 1987 through 2001 totaled about $700  million, which included money for the 13 grant, loan, and service programs  that were the focus of this report.", "Under the Compact\u2019s implementing legislation and by executive order,  Interior was made responsible for supervising, coordinating, and  monitoring program assistance to the FSM and the RMI.  The Foreign  Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465) stated that the Department of State Chief  of Mission was responsible for the direction and coordination of all U.S.  government employees in foreign countries. Further, presidential  instructions to U.S. chiefs of mission in foreign nations charged them with  the direction, coordination, and supervision of all executive branch offices  and personnel in their nation.", "The FSM and the RMI were developing countries that, like other Pacific  island nations, faced significant development challenges because of their  small economies, few natural resources, remote location, and limited  institutional capacity.  The economies of both nations were dependent on  U.S. assistance provided through the Compact for most of their income, as  they had almost no commercial production.  U.S. assistance accounted for  a majority of government revenues in both nations, and the governments  were the primary employer in both nations. Significant unemployment  existed and has increased as the governments have cut employment in  response to scheduled reductions in U.S. payments made under the  Compact, contributing to outward migration.", "The FSM and the RMI, as developing nations, faced unique challenges in  operating their health and education programs, as compared with the  United States.  According to a 1998 study, challenges for the FSM and the  RMI\u2019s delivery of health care services included (1) lack of preventive health  care, (2) long distances to travel in order to provide care in remote places,  (3) dependence on declining levels of U.S. foreign aid, (4) inadequate fiscal  and personnel management systems, (5) poorly maintained and equipped  health care facilities, (6) the enormous costs associated with sending  patients off-island for specialized care, and (7) shortages of adequately  trained health professionals.  Likewise, the education system in both  countries faced challenges not found throughout the United States,  including high drop-out rates, poorly trained teachers, lack of adequate  buildings and supplies, and low academic achievement.  The education  systems of both nations were also dependent on declining levels of U.S. aid,  which may place additional challenges on the education systems.  In the  RMI, 68 percent of education funding came from the United States; in the  FSM, 98 percent of education funds were from the United States.", "In June 2000, the Department of State\u2019s negotiator for the Compact testified  that the general approach to the new negotiations with the FSM and the  RMI included sector grants, a trust fund, and continued provision of some  U.S. program assistance for the term of the annual financial assistance.   The negotiator testified that the executive branch was considering  reporting annually to the Congress on actions that could improve program  effectiveness, including the consideration of grant consolidation across  programs.  The November 2000 U.S. proposal to the FSM for future  economic assistance through fiscal year 2016 included a reduction in total  assistance but an increase in U.S. Compact funds for health and education,  as compared with current levels.  The proposal also included a section on  services and program assistance scheduled through 2016.  Weather and  aviation services were to be continued at a level to be negotiated.  The  proposal eliminated the commitment of disaster relief from the United  States, but it included a modest disaster preparedness grant for the first 5  years of the agreement.  Additionally, the USPS was to continue service,  with the provision of special services set forth in a subsidiary agreement.   These special services to be negotiated may include \"express mail\" and  money orders, but not collect-on-delivery.  The proposal stated that the  United States would continue to provide, through fiscal year 2016, the  programs of the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services,  and Labor on the same basis or to the same extent as they were provided  on October 1, 1999.  The United States did not propose providing  Department of Agriculture programs to the FSM.  The United States had  not presented an assistance proposal to the RMI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs Provided Important Services, but Effectiveness Was Generally Hindered by Many Factors", "paragraphs": ["The 13 federal grant, loan, and service programs we reviewed provided a  wide array of assistance to the FSM and the RMI that U.S. embassy and  country officials viewed as critical to these nations.  However, local  conditions limited the effectiveness of 9 of the 13 programs. We determined  that these U.S. domestic programs were effective by using two separate  measures: first, whether the programs met their program performance  requirements and standards, as detailed in their legislation and regulations;  second,  whether the programs were able to achieve broader program  goals, given the conditions that existed in the FSM and the RMI, including  those that could significantly reduce potential program benefits or increase  costs.  To be considered effective, the program had to meet all performance  requirements and standards and to overcome conditions that could  significantly reduce broader program accomplishments or increase costs.", "We found that, even in programs that met their requirements and standards,  local conditions often reduced their potential effectiveness.  Almost all of  them faced problems caused by attempting to implement programs in the  FSM and the RMI that were designed for the United States. Such problems  included (1) the lack of complementary public and private health care  services and financing typically found in the United States, necessary to  support the Head Start, special education, and Maternal and Child Health  programs; (2) limited opportunities for graduates of the job training  program; and (3) the lack of contractors, building supplies, and support  services typically found in the United States and used to respond to  disasters.  In addition, the federal education and health programs and  resources usually supplement state and local resources in the United  States. These resources did not exist in the FSM or the RMI, where federal  programs were the primary and often the only funding source for an  activity.", "As a result of these problems, the effectiveness of the U.S. programs was  limited.  The aviation and weather programs, as well as two of the three  loan programs, were effective in large part because they were narrow in  scope or relied on well-trained local staff and dedicated U.S. resources.  In  addition, all three loan programs (two of which were effective, and one  ineffective) may experience future repayment problems if U.S. Compact  assistance levels are reduced. (See app. II for a more detailed discussion of  each program, including the program performance requirements and  standards, our assessment against those standards, and our assessment of  whether the program encountered conditions in the countries that  significantly reduced potential program accomplishments.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Programs Provided Diverse and Important Services", "paragraphs": ["We found that the 13 programs we reviewed, which encompassed grants,  loans, and operational support, provided numerous, and in many cases  important, services to the citizens of the FSM and the RMI. For example,  because of the U.S. programs, preschool children received health,  education, and nutritional services; special needs children received special  education services; elementary and secondary schools received school  supplies and teacher training; and college students received tuition grants.   In addition, mothers and children were provided health services, and adults  received job training to improve their employment prospects.  The housing  stock, telecommunications capacity, and electrical supply were improved  through U.S. loan programs, while disaster response, postal delivery,  aviation, and weather forecasting were provided by U.S. agencies.", "U.S. embassy, FSM, and RMI officials reported that these were critical  programs in each country. Without exception, FSM and RMI program  officials said that their countries were dependent on these programs.  For  example, according to FSM and RMI officials, the loss of U.S. programs  would end special education assistance, the poorly supplied school  systems might stop functioning entirely, and the sole U.S.-accredited  colleges in the FSM and the RMI might collapse.  Program officials further  stated that the loss of disaster assistance, postal services, aviation  programs, and weather services would severely affect their economic  development.  Program managers doubted that their own governments  would have sufficient resources to finance these activities in the absence of  the U.S. federal programs.", "Table 1 identifies the 13 programs we reviewed, the purpose and funding  level of each program, and a brief description of program accomplishments  in each country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Environment and Other Factors Hindered Effectiveness of Nine Programs", "paragraphs": ["Local conditions in the FSM and the RMI significantly reduced the  effectiveness of 9 of the 13 programs, loans, and services.  These programs  were (1) Head Start, (2) special education, (3) elementary and secondary  school improvement grants, (4) Pell Grants, (5) the Job Training Program  for Adults, (6) Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, (7) housing loans,  (8) disaster assistance, and (9) the USPS.  We found that programs  designed for the United States faced a variety of problems because of  geographic, economic, and social conditions in the FSM and the RMI. For  example, the four states of the FSM are separated by as much as 2,000  miles, and the RMI is made up of 1,200 atolls and islands scattered over  750,000 square miles of ocean.  In addition, the lack of local financial  support, the poor performance of the education system, and the lack of  medical capacity commonly found in the United States hindered the  education and health programs. Limited private sector opportunities and  government downsizing reduced the value of the job training program.   Geographic and social conditions reduced the effectiveness of disaster  relief. Finally, the poor performance of FSM and RMI postal services  delayed mail service.  Most managers of the nine programs recognized that  they lacked the resources, training, and technical capacity to meet all  program requirements.", "See appendix II for a more detailed discussion of each program, including  the program performance requirements and standards, our assessment  against those standards, and our assessment of whether the program  encountered conditions in the countries that significantly reduced broader  program accomplishments or increased program costs.  Each table  contains separate sections that provide specific examples of whether or  not each program met requirements and standards and whether the  program encountered conditions in each country that significantly reduced  its potential accomplishments.  To be effective, each program had to meet  the performance requirements and standards and had to demonstrate that  it did not encounter conditions that significantly reduced potential program  accomplishments or increased costs.", "Specifically, in terms of program effectiveness, we found the following:  Head Start: Head Start was intended to promote school readiness by  enhancing the social and cognitive development of preschool children.   However, the FSM and the RMI programs could not meet a variety of  program requirements because of a lack of equipment, medical capacity,  and government support for the elementary and secondary education  system.  For example, the FSM and the RMI lacked the equipment and  medical expertise necessary to meet dental and health requirements.   Additionally, the Head Start program could not meet playground and  space standards of the program (see figures 9 and 10).  The program also  lacked data to show short- or long-term benefits to the children.  In  addition, both FSM and RMI Head Start managers and parents were  concerned that any head start provided by the program was lost because  of the poor performance of the school system.", "SEPPIE: This program was intended to provide special education and  related services to children with disabilities. Although the program met  its limited performance requirements and standards, it encountered  conditions that significantly reduced potential program  accomplishments. For example, for some children, the program\u2019s  effectiveness was limited by the lack of on-island medical care available  to those suffering severe disabilities. In addition, post-graduation  employment opportunities for program graduates were rare.  Lastly,  since neither the FSM nor the RMI contributed funding for special  education, as states and localities do in the United States, this program  was the primary funding source for special education.", "Freely Associated States Educational Grant: The program was  intended to provide elementary and secondary schools with funds for  direct educational services such as school supplies, teacher training,  and school improvement.  Although it met its limited program goals to  provide funding for school supplies and teacher training, because the  FSM and the RMI did not provide much funding in these areas, many  needs continued to go unmet. The program was never intended to be the  sole source of funding for these activities.  For example, in the United  States, most school funding comes from state and local funds, and the  federal government provides only 6.8 percent of the total elementary  and secondary school budgets.  In contrast, the FSM and the RMI  provided almost no funding in this area, relying instead on FASEG and  other U.S. grants.  However, because the program was so small relative  to needs, it could not meet all school requirements for school supplies  and teacher training.", "Pell Grants: Pell Grants were intended to provide college students with  financial assistance for educational expenses. In addition, the grants  provided graduates with the potential to improve their employment  opportunities and help meet the development and financial needs of the  FSM and the RMI. The Pell Grants program met its limited program goal  to provide financial assistance to FSM and RMI college students.   However, the poor conditions of the elementary and secondary school  system, the limitations of a 2-year college, and the lack of employment  opportunities limited the potential accomplishments of the Pell Grant  program.   According to the FSM and the RMI college presidents,  because of the inadequate school systems, many students exhausted  their Pell Grants on remedial classes.  As a result, many students could  not use Pell Grants for the credited classes they needed to graduate. In  the RMI, for example, one-half of high school graduates entered the  college with the equivalent of a 4th to 6th-grade U.S. education and  required 1 to 2 years of remedial classes.  This reduced the amount of  Pell Grants available for graduation and contributed to the low, 9- percent graduation rate.  In both countries, the low graduation rate and  the limitations of a 2-year college have reduced the contribution of the  Pell Grant program to the economy.  As a result, skilled workers and  managers were brought in from the United States, the Philippines, and  other countries to meet the demand for technical and mid- and upper- level management positions.", "Job Training for Adults: The program was intended to foster increased  employment and earnings.  However, poor economic conditions in both  the FSM and the RMI have limited the potential accomplishments of the  program. For example, because of the lack of jobs in the FSM, program  success in job placement for graduates dropped from 65 percent in 1995  to 26 percent in 1999.  FSM officials said that the program was training  people for jobs that did not exist.  In the RMI, poor data precluded  determining JTPA\u2019s effectiveness, and poor economic conditions limited  employment opportunities. For example, the RMI reported that the  percentage of trained adults finding jobs rose from 44 percent in 1993 to  100 percent in 1999. However, another 1999 report from the RMI stated  that only 14 percent found employment. Neither RMI nor Labor officials  could explain the discrepancy, and Labor officials agreed that such  problems precluded determining the program\u2019s effectiveness. In  addition, because of poor economic conditions, the RMI boosted the  number of adults it reported as being employed by counting numerous  \u201cself-employed\u201d graduates as employed and simply estimating their  potential income.  According to U.S. Department of Labor officials, the  subsistence economy in the RMI and the lack of employment  opportunities pushed the program to categorize people as \u201cself- employed\u201d when they were actually undertaking subsistence work and  not receiving market income.  Because of the lack of jobs, as well as the  lack of  those basic academic and personal competencies necessary to  benefit fully from job training, the RMI has begun providing training in  \u201csurvival skills,\u201d which include subsistence fishing, agriculture, and  handicraft production.", "MCH Block Grants Program: The program was intended to improve the  health of mothers and children and to reduce mortality rates.  However,  the lack of equipment, medical specialists, data collection capabilities,  and local government support for preventive health care limited the  accomplishments of this program. Moreover, the FSM and the RMI  programs were exempt from meeting 6 of the 18 performance measures  for the program, and they had difficulty in meeting others, because of a  lack of needed equipment, medical capacity, and support programs  (such as Medicaid) that were available only in the United States.  Additionally, the high mortality rate, a key measure of program success,  could not be reduced because of health care limitations and the lack of  basic sanitary conditions, like clean water and healthy food, necessary  for public health.  Moreover, data collection limitations within the FSM  and the RMI have hindered the ability of the HHS to determine program  effectiveness.  Lastly, the U.S. MCH Program generally supplements  state and local health care initiatives; both the FSM and the RMI  governments lacked these state or local services.  According to the FSM  and the RMI MCH directors, because the FSM and the RMI relied on the  program as their primary preventive health care system, the program  was overwhelmed by the social and economic conditions that were  causing declines in the general health of the populations, including  maternal and child health.  The former U.S. MCH officer responsible  for the FSM and the RMI programs was pessimistic about the ability of  the MCH programs to succeed because of the social and economic  problems in each nation.", "Housing Loans: This program was intended to provide housing loans to  the most  needy.  However, legal requirements not designed for use in  foreign countries precluded targeting loans to only the most needy.  As a  result, the program could not meet its performance requirement to  target only the neediest in each country.   To determine program  eligibility, the Rural Housing Service (RHS) was required to use adjusted  income limits set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD). HUD in turn used U.S. Census income data.   Because the FSM and the RMI last participated in the U.S. Census in  1980, prior to their independence, there were no income data available  from the U.S. Census Bureau. Instead, RHS used HUD\u2019s \u201cWestern Pacific  Islands\u201d adjusted income limits.  These limits were relevant only to the  population of Guam and were not an accurate measure for the much  poorer populations of the FSM and the  RMI.  Consequently, most  households in the FSM and the RMI qualified for the program.  This  violated the program eligibility regulations, which stated that it was to  serve only those with less than 80 percent of the local median income,  adjusted for household size.  Both nations have conducted censuses  since 1998 that contained information on household income, so such  data was available.", "Disaster Assistance: This program was intended to help localities  prepare for and respond to disasters. Although the program met its  performance requirements and standards, it encountered conditions  that significantly reduced potential program accomplishments and  increased costs. For example, because of the vast distances involved  and the absence of capabilities comparable to those in the United States,  the implementation of FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance programs has been  costly, difficult, and labor intensive.  In addition, according to FEMA  documents, the cultural and social practices in the FSM and the RMI  adversely affected the effectiveness of FEMA assistance.  For example,  contrary to FEMA\u2019s mission to foster self-reliance for disaster  preparedness and response, FEMA found that providing disaster  assistance to the FSM and the RMI fostered a dependency on FEMA  assistance.  FEMA found that people who would otherwise rebuild their  lives immediately after an event did nothing until FEMA money and  resources arrived.  Lastly, FEMA officials said that, as a domestic  agency, it was not structured or intended to provide disaster assistance  to foreign countries.", "USPS: Postal Services were intended to provide for mail and mail- related financial services between the United States and the FSM and  the RMI. Although the program met its performance requirements and  standards, it encountered conditions that significantly reduced potential  program accomplishments and increased costs.  For example, the postal  service has had to contract for air transport of mail, at the cost of $2  million annually, because of limited space on the few commercial flights  to the region.  Because flights to the region were limited, USPS was not  able to meet delivery guarantees on certain classes of mail.  Moreover,  despite USPS\u2019s investment in chartered flights, once the mail arrived,  FSM and RMI postal services delayed delivering the mail to its citizens.  Citizens from both nations said that mail was routinely 2 to 3 months  late. (See figure 11.) In the RMI, mail often sat in the facilities, waiting  for local postal officials to sort and place the mail in post office boxes.   In  the FSM, mail was delayed as it awaited clearance through customs.  USPS operations in the FSM and the RMI have also proven costly.  In  addition to $5.9 million in costs reimbursed by Interior, USPS estimated  that it has incurred an additional $30 million in extra mail transportation  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Programs Were Effective", "paragraphs": ["Two of the loan programs and two of the services have been effective.  These programs were (1) telecommunications loans, (2) electrical loans,  (3) aviation services, and (4) weather services.  These programs met their  performance requirements and standards and did not encounter problems  that reduced potential program benefits or  substantially increased costs.   These programs\u2019 success was partly attributed to their resource  management approach. The two loan programs were effective in meeting  their narrow program requirements to provide loans to areas that meet the  economic and social conditions that make them eligible for the loans.  In  addition, USDA, which managed the loan programs, provided guidance and  strong oversight during the construction of the telecommunication and  electrical systems, to ensure that they met U.S. building standards. For the  aviation and weather services, U.S. employees or well-trained nationals  managed and performed the work.", "The following programs were effective:  Telecommunications Loans:  The Rural Utilities Service\u2019s  telecommunications loans met its program goal to expand modern  telecommunication facilities in remote areas by financing telephone  system improvements in both nations.  For example, in 1987, when  USDA approved a loan to the FSM Telecommunications Corporation  (FSMTC), the company had 1,300 telephone subscribers.  By 1993, the  telephone subscribers in the FSM had increased to 6,000.  USDA ensured  that both nations\u2019 telephone companies met the eligibility requirements  of the program, conducted the feasibility studies necessary to determine  their economic viability, had the telecommunications systems built to  USDA specifications, and provided construction oversight to ensure that  all specifications were met. (See figure 12.)", "Electrical Loans: The Rural Utilities Service\u2019s electrical loans were  intended to expand access to modern electrical systems by providing  loans for electrical power facilities, and the USDA met this  programmatic goal in the RMI. The RMI used the loan to build new  electric power facilities that have allowed large increases in electricity  available to both homes and businesses.  The 1999 generating station  almost doubled the RMI\u2019s electrical capacity and allowed the nation to  meet its growing electricity needs.  For example, the number of private  electricity consumers rose by 11 percent and the number of new  business users rose by 34 percent between 1997 and 1999.  USDA  ensured that RMI\u2019s power company met the eligibility requirements,  conducted the feasibility studies necessary to determine their economic  viability, had the power facilities built to U.S. specifications, and  provided construction oversight to ensure that all U.S. specifications  were met. (See figure 13.)", "Aviation Services: FAA effectively provided air safety services as  required under the Compact.  FAA provided (1) en route air traffic  services,  (2) flight inspections and equipment certifications, (3)  assistance in developing and updating aviation procedures and  standards, and (4) technical assistance to help the FSM and the RMI  governments develop civil aviation safety authorities and aviation safety  and certification programs. FAA was effective because of its direct  management and implementation of program activities. Rather than  provide funds directly to the FSM and the RMI governments for air  safety, FAA provided the training, material, equipment, and facilities  construction and maintenance necessary to meet FAA standards.  For  example, when FAA funded construction and maintenance, FAA  selected the contractors to perform the work and provided oversight  and contract management to ensure that the work met contract  standards. (See figures 14 and 15.)", "Weather Service: The NWS provided weather services as stipulated in  the Compact. NWS provided the FSM and the RMI with the facilities,  equipment, technical assistance, and resources needed to operate their  weather services. To ensure that program goals were met, it maintained  control of the funds provided to each government through cost  reimbursement contracts. This allowed NWS to review and disallow  inappropriate or unauthorized FSM or RMI expenditures. NWS officials  also performed regular visits and monitored weather operations by  reviewing required reports and weather data.  In addition, NWS required  that local FSM and RMI officials working for the weather stations met  the same educational and proficiency standards as NWS employees in  the United States.  For example, NWS provided assistance to local  nationals for up to 5 years of training so that they could meet NWS  standards for meteorologists. (See figure 16.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Loan Programs May Face Future Repayment Problems", "paragraphs": ["The USDA operated the three loan programs for homeowners and utilities  (telecommunications and electric power) discussed above. Because of  FSM and RMI dependence on U.S. assistance, a reduction in this assistance  could result in future repayment problems. During the first 15 years of the  Compact, U.S. funding to the FSM and the RMI was decreased every 5  years, and the FSM government has estimated that the November 2000 U.S.  proposal reduces real per capita income in 2017 by almost 40 percent from  its 2001 levels.   Moreover, the United States has proposed an end to  annual financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI in 2016, although the  time for repaying these types of loans extends from 2017 to 2030.

For example, we found local administrative  capabilities that were not able to meet the complex requirements of many  federal programs, and U.S. administrative capabilities that were not  designed to implement U.S. programs in foreign countries.

We believe that the United  States should establish a policy regarding the duration of ongoing program  assistance during the current negotiations. If the United States were to end  the program assistance for U.S. domestic programs when annual assistance  ends, this would involve transferring the responsibility for financing and  providing these services to the FSM and the RMI.  Transferring these  responsibilities to the FSM and the RMI will require U.S. agencies to  emphasize the development of local capabilities.

To  gather information for our analysis, we interviewed more than 100 key  officials in the Departments of the Interior, State, Education, Health and  Human Services, Labor, and Agriculture; in the Federal Aviation  Administration, the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Postal Service  (USPS); and in the governments of the FSM and the RMI that were involved  with the provision of U.S. assistance to the two nations between 1987 and  2000.", "To assess the use and effectiveness of key U.S. programs and services  provided to both nations, we reviewed the Compact of Free Association,  legislation, regulations, and procedures to determine what the programs  were intended to accomplish and the performance requirements used to  assess whether programs were being effectively implemented.

In addition, we visited  clinics, schools, post offices, weather stations, and other facilities to  determine the use of the assistance, and we spoke with the intended  beneficiaries of the assistance to obtain an independent assessment of its  uses.

The Department of the Interior, in commenting on this draft,  stated that a field representative covered the FSM, the RMI, and Palau  in 1990, implying that it met its requirement to provide federal program  coordination. However, discussions with the field representative  revealed that he was neither given the authority, nor had the means, to  coordinate the federal programs in the FSM and the RMI until 1997. 2.

For that reason, our  recommendation calls for State to work in consultation with the  Department of the Interior and those federal departments with  programs in the region, as well as with the Federal Regional Council, to  take advantage of their resources and technical expertise to develop  the joint report to the Congress.

We state in the lead sentence of our Results in Brief that  many federal programs provided numerous, and in many cases critical,  services to the FSM and the RMI.  Head Start was included in this  assessment.  In addition, we stated on page 13 that the Head Start  program provided comprehensive health, education, and nutrition  services to 1,800 preschool children each year in the FSM and 1,200  each year in the RMI.  For both countries, we noted specific  accomplishments of the Head Start program. 2. Our report did not state that Federal Regional Council made a  recommendation; rather, it simply quoted the council report, in which  the council \u201cconcluded that it was essential that an on-site federal  grants coordinator be appointed...\u201d to each nation.  We removed the  statement that council members were not aware that an Interior  representative already provided an on-site presence. 3. We added a footnote to page 44 to incorporate HHS\u2019s statement that the  grantee provided documentation for the $341,378 in questioned costs.   However, neither HHS nor FSM officials indicated during the audit that  the Pohnpei program subsequently provided appropriate  documentation for the questioned costs.  As a result, we were not able  to independently verify HHS\u2019s statement or to review the supporting  documentation. 4. HHS is not correct in stating that GAO and research findings have  concluded that the Head Start program is effective.  GAO, in its 2001  report on Head Start, stated that there is still insufficient research to  draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the program.  The report  also stated that, based on GAO\u2019s recommendation, Congress mandated  that HHS fund and conduct an evaluation of the impact of the Head  Start program.  The final report is not due until 2006. 5. We added language to page 31 to clarify this point. 6. We added language to page 31 attributing these statements.  7.

However, no action was taken by the Pohnpei local office to stop the construction of the  second floor.  We also noted, based on documents in the loan file, that the borrower had  required an additional loan of $38,000 to complete the construction of the house.  However,  in an October 29, 1998, letter to the borrower, the Pohnpei local office stated that \u201cwe are  unable to approve your application on the basis that your total indebtedness with the agency  will exceed the present authorized loan limit.\u201d  As a result of our review of the loan file, on  March 16, 1999, we visited the construction site and found that a two-story house, which  appeared to be more than modest, was under construction.", "We were told in April 2001 that the local trustee agency for the Rural  Housing Service, the Pohnpei State Housing Authority, had paid off the  USDA loans from the escrow account set up to pay off any defaulted  loans.

We do not assert that the neediest residents were not served.  The  report stated that, because of the lack of accurate income data, loans  could not be targeted only to the most needy, which is the purpose of  the program.  We assert that, if income data specifically for the FSM  and the RMI were used to calculate the low- and very low-income levels  for each country, fewer people would likely be eligible for the program  than are now eligible with the current Western Pacific income levels.  2. Additional language was inserted to clarify this issue on page 42. 3. The JTPA Title II Quarterly Status Report, July 1, 1999, to June 2000  (Final Report), signed by the local program manager on September 11,  2000, reported that only 14 percent of the job training graduates entered  employment.  In contrast, RMI reported in its Program Year 1999  Annual Report that 100 percent entered employment.  Both documents  stated that 35 trainees finished their job training; however, the first  document reported that only 5 entered employment, while the second  document states that all 35 entered employment. 4. Although the RMI was exempted from having to meet the program\u2019s  national reporting requirements, the RMI was required to provide  accurate performance reports to the Department of Labor\u2019s regional  office in San Francisco.  The Department of Labor\u2019s program manager,  as well Department of Labor documentation stretching back to 1993,  documents Labor\u2019s concerns about the unreliability of the data  submitted to the regional office.  For example, a 1994 Department of  Labor memorandum on a Pacific Basin JTPA liaison meeting stated that  \u201cthe enrollment and termination rates, as reported by the RMI, cannot  be trusted.\u201d In 2001, the Department of Labor\u2019s program manager  expressed these same concerns. 5. As noted above, the program was not exempt from providing  performance reports to the regional office. 6. GAO based its conclusion that \u201cpoor economic conditions limited  employment opportunities\u201d on the fact that the program is now focused  on teaching \u201csurvival skills,\u201d or subsistence living, because of a lack of  jobs. 7. We agree with the RMI that having unreliable data precludes knowing  with certainty whether the JTPA program was effective. However, the  program was designed so that the burden of proof was on those  implementing the program, and program effectiveness was determined  by having reliable data on the numbers of trainees that found  employment. 8. We have added this to the report on page 30. 9. Table I describes the \u201cusefulness\u201d of this program to the RMI. To further  clarify this point, we have added information on the number of teachers  trained using FASEG funds.  10. Additional language has been added to page 29 to clarify this point. 11. The 9-percent graduation rate was stated by the president of the  college, who also provided documentation to support the graduation  rate. 12. The report notes on page14 that the program has made college  education available for thousands of students and funded the creation  of the only U.S.-accredited college in the RMI. 13. FEMA, not GAO, concluded that these programs should be terminated. 14. FEMA, not GAO, concluded that these programs foster dependency. 15. Disaster Preparedness Improvement Grants over two years totaled  $100,000 and are matching grants.  According to FEMA records, the  funds had not been expended at the time of our review.  The RMI  confirmed that the information had not been timely and properly  reported, and added that reorganization and capacity issues hindered  the timely reporting of these expenditures.
