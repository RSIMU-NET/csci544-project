Organizational alignment and leadership: TSA's Office of Acquisition is at an organizational level too low to oversee the acquisition process, coordinate acquisition activities, and enforce acquisition policies effectively. The position of the office hinders its ability to help ensure that TSA follows acquisition processes that enable the agency to get the best value on goods and services. Policies and processes: TSA's acquisition policies and processes emphasize personal accountability, good judgment, justifiable business decisions, and integrated acquisition teams.

For example, TSA has not effectively communicated its acquisition policies throughout the agency. TSA also lacks internal controls to identify and address implementation issues and performance measures to determine whether acquisition policies are achieving desired results. Human capital: TSA risks an imbalance in the size and capabilities of its acquisition workforce that could diminish the performance of the acquisition function throughout the agency. TSA's Office of Acquisition worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security to develop and begin implementing an acquisition workforce plan. However, TSA's Human Resource Office, which is responsible for recruiting and hiring the acquisition workforce agencywide, did not participate in developing the acquisition workforce plan.

In March 2003, TSA, along with 21 other  agencies, began transferring to the Department of Homeland Security.  Figure 1 shows the timeline of TSA\u2019s brief history.", "When TSA was established in November 2001, the agency had no  personnel, no organizational structure, no policies and processes, and no  legacy systems. To begin operating, TSA adopted some of the Department  of Transportation\u2019s infrastructure components, such as the financial  management system, and developed others in-house, such as a  procurement tracking system. In addition, the Aviation and Transportation  Security Act directed TSA to adopt the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s  (FAA) Acquisition Management System,  which establishes policy,  processes, and guidance for all aspects of the acquisition life cycle. The act  gives TSA\u2019s administrator the latitude to make modifications to FAA\u2019s  system as appropriate. Because FAA is, by law, generally exempt from  federal acquisition laws as well as the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), and TSA was directed to adopt FAA\u2019s system, TSA is also exempt  from these requirements.", "TSA has relied on contractors to accomplish much of its mission. In fiscal  year 2002, TSA obligated more than $3.7 billion for goods and services  procured under contracts awarded by TSA, FAA, and the Department of  Transportation. TSA currently has contracts to manage human resource  needs, including recruiting, hiring, training, and outfitting passenger and  baggage screeners; develop and manufacture screening equipment; and  provide the information technology systems the agency uses to manage its  day-to-day operations. These contracts represent about 48 percent of  TSA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget.", "TSA\u2019s large expenditures on goods and services have prompted reviews  by the Inspectors General of the Departments of Transportation and  Homeland Security, who found a lack of contractor oversight and  significant cost overruns. For example, in January 2004, the Department  of Homeland Security Inspector General reported that inadequate  contractor oversight contributed to TSA\u2019s lack of timely background  checks on screeners at airports. Specifically, inadequate oversight of  contractors contributed to more than 500 boxes of background check  documentation remaining unprocessed for months. The Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General also found that inadequate oversight  and contracts without clearly defined deliverables caused the cost of  TSA\u2019s initial contracts to balloon. For example, TSA\u2019s initial human  resource contract to recruit, screen, hire, and train screeners grew from  $100 million to $700 million within 1 year.", "In late 2003, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General  cited integrating the procurement functions of the department\u2019s  component organizations as a major management challenge, adding that  some of the procurement functions lacked important management  controls.

TSA\u2019s policies  require that the agency perform quality assurance, but several contract  files we reviewed contained little evidence that contract oversight or  quality assurance was performed. For example, the contract files for  background investigations, baggage screening, and engineering and  technical services contained no evidence of oversight or quality assurance  plans. TSA\u2019s policies also require that performance metrics be identified in  the requirements of complex contracts. Our review of the contract files  found that TSA failed to develop performance metrics for the contractor  prior to award.

Cost-reimbursement and time and materials contracts are generally only  suitable when appropriate government surveillance during performance  will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost  controls are used. Frequent use of cost-reimbursement and time and  materials contracts, coupled with the inspector generals\u2019 findings that TSA  failed to monitor its contracts, diminishes the assurance that efficient  methods and cost controls are being used.", "TSA generally used single-source contracts judiciously for the contract  files we reviewed.

Of the 21  contract files we reviewed, 3 were for single-source contracts. The  remaining contracts were awarded using a variety of procurement  methods, including use of existing government contracts, the Federal  Supply Schedule, required government supply sources, and competitive  procedures. In the 3 single-source contract awards we reviewed, the  contract files contained justifications for using such noncompetitive  procedures as required by TSA\u2019s policies. The justifications for awarding  contracts on a single-source basis varied. In one case, for example, the  agency identified a need for additional office furniture to be integrated  with furniture systems already installed at the work site.

Training officials said that  funds are sufficient for meeting federal training mandates; however, there  are no additional training funds for further professional development.  Acquisition officials told us that funding for training Office of Acquisition  personnel is limited to $1,000 per year per employee\u2014an amount that  acquisition officials say is insufficient to train staff who came to TSA  without prior contracting experience. The Office of Acquisition\u2019s training  funds do not cover training of other acquisition professionals outside  this office. Without sufficient training funds, TSA is able to provide few  professional development opportunities for the acquisition workforce\u2014 limiting career growth. To address the most critical training needs for the  acquisition workforce outside the Office of Acquisition\u2014such as program  managers, contracting officers\u2019 representatives, and technical monitors\u2014 TSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition has proactively developed workshops in-house.

Leading companies use  procurement and financial management systems to gather and analyze  data to identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve service levels,  measure compliance and performance, and manage service providers. For  example, organizations need integrated financial management systems  that provide reliable, accurate, relevant, and timely financial data to help  ensure dollars are well spent. Such data are needed to estimate and  control program costs, support funding decisions, and oversee contract  spending. Many leading organizations have already implemented an  enterprisewide system to integrate financial and operating data to support  both management decision-making and external reporting requirements.", "In a 1994 study of fundamental practices that led to performance  improvements in leading private and public organizations, we reported  that electronic business system initiatives must be focused on process  improvements. Information systems that simply use technology to do the  same work the same way, although faster, typically fail, or reach only a  fraction of their potential. In May 2000, we reported that when developing  new electronic business processes, it is important to ensure that current  business processes are working well before applying new technology. In  fact, agency heads are required by statute to analyze an agency\u2019s mission  and revise mission-related and administrative processes, as appropriate,  before making significant investment in information technology that is to  be used in support of the performance of those missions. Not improving  business processes prior to investing in new technology creates the risk of  merely automating inefficient ways of doing business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment", "paragraphs": ["While TSA is participating in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  efforts to develop functional requirements for an enterprisewide solution  that supports the department\u2019s resource management functions\u2014 including finance and procurement, TSA does not currently have the  strategic information needed to support effective acquisition management  decisions. Near-term improvements to TSA\u2019s acquisition outcomes will be  difficult until TSA has critical knowledge management systems, such as  financial and procurement information systems, that allow decision  makers to track spending and manage budgets and collect detailed data on  goods and services, suppliers, and spending patterns. Despite the fact that  TSA lacks detailed information on the goods and services it purchases,  some aggregate data is available. TSA is an active participant in the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s strategic sourcing program, which is  using the aggregate data to develop a strategy that will allow the  department to leverage its buying for particular commodities.", "To manage on a day-to-day basis, inform acquisition decisions, and  oversee contracts, program and acquisition managers are relying on data  derived from informal, ad hoc systems\u2014which are often out of date,  incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise unreliable. TSA\u2019s Office of  Acquisition is temporarily relying on an Access database developed in- house to track manually entered procurement information and make  acquisition decisions. However, the temporary database does not contain  enough information to analyze purchases or measure the acquisition  function\u2019s performance. For example, a TSA official told us that when a  congressional committee asked for a list of sole-source contracts, TSA  officials had to compile the list manually, by asking contracting officers  which contracts had been awarded on a sole-source basis, because this  information was not in TSA\u2019s database. Further, the database does not  automatically track the status of a procurement request. Currently,  program officials must contact the Office of Acquisition to determine the  progress being made on a procurement request\u2014relying on manually  compiled paper files, which are frequently incomplete or inaccurate, to  track the status of a purchase. TSA is now voluntarily reporting its  contract actions to the Homeland Security Contract Information System,  which feeds into the Federal Procurement Data System. This system can  produce some aggregate data, but lacks detailed information on goods and  services purchased.", "Until a departmentwide solution is developed, TSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition  is planning to adopt the Coast Guard\u2019s procurement information system as  a faster and more cost-efficient way of obtaining the basic capability to  track purchase requests and write contracts. But TSA officials told us  that, in its current configuration, the system does not have all the  components necessary to enhance strategic acquisition decisions or  enable effective evaluation and assessment of acquisition outcomes.", "An additional challenge to data collection and analysis is TSA\u2019s financial  management system. According to TSA officials, the agency\u2019s current  financial management system, run by the Department of Transportation,  does not provide the information needed to track financial events,  summarize financial information, or otherwise provide critical acquisition- related information. For example, because program offices do not have  access to reliable financial information, program budget officials cannot  certify funds availability to approve a procurement request. As a result, the  Office of Finance must certify funds availability centrally. According to  finance officials, the inability to track spending has also resulted in  difficulties in processing invoices and procurement requests.", "Here too, while the department-level enterprise architecture effort is  proceeding, TSA is in the process of adopting the Coast Guard\u2019s financial  management system, which TSA finance officials say is more user-friendly  and provides better reporting capabilities and access than the system TSA  currently uses. It is unclear, however, whether the Coast Guard\u2019s financial  management software will facilitate TSA\u2019s financial accountability  activities. Independent auditors gave the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s financial statement a qualified balance sheet opinion based, for  the most part, on problems with the Coast Guard\u2019s financial statements.
