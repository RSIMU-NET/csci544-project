However, two long-standing issues\u2014limited awareness of resources for voters and the unpredictable postal delivery of absentee ballots\u2014continue to pose challenges. DOD-commissioned studies and post-election survey results indicate that there is limited awareness of FVAP's resources among military and overseas voters. A 2015 study found, for example, that the online availability of blank ballots led to one of the most significant improvements in military and overseas absentee voting. At the same time, the full benefits of the improvement had not been realized because voters remained unaware that ballots could be requested online. Regarding the unpredictable postal delivery of absentee ballots, the timeliness of a voter's receipt or return of an absentee ballot depends on a number of variables, such as the mode and speed of transportation used to transmit mail. DOD has identified actions that it will take to address these and other issues. However, these challenges persist, in part, because DOD has not established time frames for completing the actions it has identified.", "DOD's implementation of FVAP partially exhibits six selected leading practices of federal strategic planning.

The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting  Act (UOCAVA), passed in 1986 and subsequently amended, facilitates  such coordination in part by defining the roles of the federal, state, and  local governments in protecting the right for military servicemembers,  their families, and U.S. citizens living overseas to vote absentee in federal  elections. Under UOCAVA, the Department of Defense (DOD) is  generally responsible for establishing and maintaining a program to assist  all eligible voters to register to vote and cast a ballot. Specifically, the  Secretary of Defense is the presidential designee with the primary  responsibility for federal functions under UOCAVA and, through the  Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) within the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, provides support to  potential UOCAVA voters to facilitate their participation in federal  elections.", "DOD has reported that UOCAVA voters\u2014which it estimated included  over 6 million citizens living outside the United States\u2014had their ballots  rejected at a higher rate than non-UOCAVA voters, primarily because  they were received by local election offices after each election\u2019s  deadline. Further, the Election Assistance Commission, a national  clearinghouse of information on election administration, estimated that  approximately 6 percent of UOCAVA absentee ballots from U.S. citizens  living overseas were rejected by local election offices in the 2012 and  2014 general election cycles, while the rejection rate for domestic  absentee ballots returned during the same election cycles was  approximately 1 percent.

Based on the status of FVAP\u2019s  planning efforts at the time of our review, we selected those practices that  are most closely associated with the initial stages of strategic planning.  Two analysts independently conducted a content analysis of documents  related to DOD\u2019s plans for UOCAVA voter assistance to determine the  extent to which they exhibited the six selected leading practices of federal  strategic planning. The analysts independently rated each of the six  leading practices as \u201cexhibited,\u201d \u201cpartially exhibited,\u201d or \u201cdid not exhibit\u201d by  DOD. We compared the two sets of independent observations,  discussed how each analyst arrived at the assigned rating, and  collectively reconciled any rating differences.

In 2002,  Congress passed and the President signed the Help America Vote Act of  2002, which amended UOCAVA and required states to be more  transparent about sending and rejecting UOCAVA ballots by, for example,  requiring states to provide voters the reasons for rejecting a registration  application or absentee ballot request and to report the number of ballots  sent to servicemembers and overseas voters and the number returned by  those voters and cast in the election. Most recently, Congress passed  and the President signed the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment  Act in 2009, which amended UOCAVA to require, among other things,  that states transmit a validly requested absentee ballot within a certain  time frame to absent uniformed services voters or overseas voters and  that DOD\u2019s FVAP expand its efforts to raise voter awareness regarding  voter registration and absentee ballot procedures and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities for Providing Assistance to UOCAVA Voters", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. election system for servicemembers and U.S. citizens living  overseas comprises a complex network of communication with disparate  and geographically disperse populations extending over seven  continents, 55 states and territories, and thousands of voting jurisdictions,  and relies on the coordinated efforts of federal, state, and local  governments to carry out their roles and responsibilities.

To carry out this purpose, FVAP coordinates  with DOD components and the Department of State to provide  information to, respectively, military personnel who vote absentee and to  U.S. citizens who reside abroad. Voter education and assistance efforts  for military personnel are largely implemented by the military services  through voting assistance officers, who are assigned this role in addition  to their primary duties. As of December 2015, DOD officials estimated  that the military services collectively had approximately 4,500 unit voting  assistance officers. The voting assistance officers distribute and help  UOCAVA voters to complete FVAP forms, such as the Federal Post Card  Application and the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot, as well as any state  or local forms that voters may use to register and request a ballot. See  appendixes IV and V for copies of these forms, for which FVAP is  generally responsible in accordance with statutory and regulatory  requirements. Similarly, the Department of State is responsible for  designating a voting action officer to oversee the implementation of its  voting assistance program, and designates voting assistance officers at  each of its embassies and consulates to provide voting assistance for  U.S. citizens living abroad.", "An additional FVAP election cycle responsibility is to survey UOCAVA  voters and other stakeholders, such as DOD voting assistance officers  and local election officials, and report on FVAP\u2019s voter assistance.  Specifically, after every presidential election, DOD is required by statute  to transmit a report to the President and Congress on the effectiveness of  assistance, including a statistical analysis of uniformed services voter  participation, a separate statistical analysis of overseas nonmilitary  participation, and a description of state-federal cooperation. In addition,  DOD is required by statute to transmit a report each year to the President  and relevant congressional committees to include an assessment of the  effectiveness of voting assistance activities, voter registration and  participation by servicemembers and other overseas voters, and, in years  following federal election years, information related to absentee ballots.  Figure 1 provides a general timeline of some of the voting activities that  DOD undertakes during federal election cycles.", "FVAP conducts surveys of UOCAVA voters and state and local election  officials, in coordination with the Defense Manpower Data Center and the  Election Assistance Commission, respectively, to obtain some of this and  related information. For example, FVAP works with the Defense  Manpower Data Center to survey servicemembers about their UOCAVA  voting experience. The surveys include questions to determine how  voters used DOD and FVAP voting assistance resources and how voters  requested, received, and returned their absentee ballots. FVAP also  works with the Defense Manpower Data Center to survey DOD\u2019s voting  assistance officers about the process of delivering voting services to  servicemembers. In addition, FVAP collaborates with the Election  Assistance Commission. Their partnership began in 2013 in preparation  for the 2014 election, in which they conducted a joint survey of state-level  election offices about the state\u2019s interaction with UOCAVA voters.

The elections  process is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and  territories and their local election jurisdictions. Thus, the registration and  voting process is a multistep process that varies by state and territory. As  we have reported previously, states and territories have considerable  discretion in how they organize the elections process, which is reflected in  the diversity of procedures and deadlines the states and jurisdictions  establish for voter registration and absentee voting. Further, states and  jurisdictions employ a variety of voting methods, including mailed paper  ballots, emails, and faxes.", "In order to vote, UOCAVA voters register, obtain and complete an  absentee ballot in accordance with state requirements (such as providing  a signature), and return the voted ballot to the local election office in time  to meet state election deadlines, which also vary. In addition to the time it  takes a voter to complete these steps, local election offices must process  these materials. Studies have shown that most UOCAVA voters still rely  on the mail to request, receive, and return their ballots. Figure 2 depicts  the steps of the absentee voting process for military and overseas voters.  Following is a description of each step of the multistep absentee voting  process in greater detail.  1.  Voter Prepares and Submits Voter Registration Application and/or  The voter prepares and submits a voter registration application and/or  absentee ballot request. According to FVAP\u2019s voting assistance guide, all  states accept voter registration and ballot request forms by mail.  UOCAVA voters can choose whether to use the Federal Post Card  Application, the registration and absentee ballot request form that FVAP  developed and maintains, or their state\u2019s voter registration application and  state ballot request form. Federal law requires all states to accept the  Federal Post Card Application, which is both a voter registration and  ballot request form. Some states offer online voter registration and ballot  request options directly from their websites. Ballot request options  include, depending on the state, for voters to receive their ballot by mail,  email, fax, or other electronic method, if applicable. For some ballot  request forms, including the Federal Post Card Application, the voter can  select the method by which they would like to receive their ballot from the  local election office, including mail, email, or fax.  2.  Local Election Office Receives and Processes Voter Registration  Application and/or Absentee Ballot Request and Sends Blank Ballot to  Voter  The local election office receives and processes the voter registration  application and/or absentee ballot request form or Federal Post Card  Application and sends the absentee ballot to the voter. Local election  offices provide a confirmation notice to voters that their voter registration  and absentee ballot requests have been approved, or a letter indicating  the reason the request was denied. The Military and Overseas Voter  Empowerment Act amended UOCAVA to require, among other things,  that states establish procedures to offer voters the option to receive a  ballot electronically. Local election offices transmit absentee ballots to  voters via email, fax, online download, or by mail, depending on how the  voter requested the ballot.  3.  Voter Receives, Marks, and Returns the Absentee Ballot  The voter receives, marks, and returns the absentee ballot. According to  FVAP\u2019s voting assistance guide, all states accept the completed ballot by  mail and some states accept completed ballots by email, fax, or an online  system. If the voter does not receive the ballot from the local election  office or believes the ballot may arrive too late to return the ballot to meet  the state deadline, the voter can submit a Federal Write-in Absentee  Ballot, a backup ballot that FVAP developed and maintains, in order to  meet state deadlines. FVAP makes the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot  available to voters on its website and through unit voting assistance  officers, who distribute hard copies of the ballot. Federal law requires all  states to accept the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot as a backup ballot.  4.  Local Election Office Receives and Processes the Absentee Ballot  The local election office receives and processes the absentee ballot or  Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot. The local election office must determine  whether the ballot was received by the deadline and whether the ballot is  valid for counting, depending on requirements such as, according to  FVAP, the ballot arriving at the local election office on time and the  signature on the ballot matching the signature on the voter\u2019s registration  form, among other requirements.

Through these efforts, DOD has  identified long-standing issues with the limited awareness of FVAP  resources and unpredictable postal delivery of UOCAVA ballots that  continue to pose challenges to the program\u2019s effectiveness. DOD has  identified some actions and has taken some steps to address these  challenges such as simplifying and standardizing instructions in FVAP\u2019s  voting assistance guide to better support UOCAVA voters and their  advocates, analyzing quantitative and qualitative research on barriers to  voting success, and increasing the usage of online marketing tools to  improve outreach.

According to FVAP officials, the customers of the  program are absentee voters, and the program stakeholders include the  federal agencies with which it collaborates, state and local election  officials that have a role in the absentee voting process, and the voting  action officers and military service voting assistance officers. The RAND  Corporation also identified additional stakeholders, such as congressional  staff on relevant committees, organizations that represent state and local  election officials such as the National Association of State Election  Directors, the National Association of Secretaries of State, the Election  Center, as well as nongovernment organizations that represent overseas  citizens such as the Overseas Vote Foundation. The study, issued in  2014, found in part that stakeholders did not understand FVAP\u2019s purpose  and role in the voting process due to: (1) an ambiguous mission that was  not commonly understood by program staff, (2) fragmentation among  program activities such as assistance and institutional support, (3)  inadequate capacity in data collection and analysis, and (4) the inefficient  use of staff to carry out program priorities. Based on the results, DOD  began taking steps to address these issues, including reexamining  FVAP\u2019s mission and purpose and implementing changes in how it works  with external stakeholders.", "In July 2015, DOD released the results of another commissioned study on  FVAP in which it identified barriers to UOCAVA voting success and social  and behavioral factors that influence voters. This study found that  building relationships with positions outside of DOD that communicate  with overseas voters\u2014such as human resources managers, study abroad  leaders, and nongovernmental organizations\u2014could help share  information with potential absentee voters. In addition, this study found  that DOD needed to share accurate information about the absentee  voting process to contradict the myth that absentee ballots are not  counted except in rare circumstances.", "In addition to these studies, FVAP is required to conduct surveys of  voters and voting assistance officers and to provide an assessment of  activities undertaken and the effectiveness of assistance. Using the  results of the 2014 survey\u2014the most recent results available\u2014DOD  compared UOCAVA registration and voter participation rates for the 2014  general election with the results of prior post-election surveys to better  understand dissemination of absentee voting information among the  UOCAVA voter population.", "These studies and post-election surveys have helped DOD to identify  new and emerging issues with its voting assistance program. In particular,  two long-standing issues continue to pose challenges to the program\u2019s  effectiveness. In both of the 2014 and 2015 studies that it issued and in  all of the post-election surveys that it administered between 2008 and  2014, DOD repeatedly identified that challenges persist with the limited  awareness of FVAP\u2019s resources and the unpredictable mail delivery of  UOCAVA ballots. In addition, both of these issues were discussed in all  four reports that we issued on this subject between 2001 and 2010.  Further details about these two challenges are provided below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Awareness of FVAP Resources", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD, efforts to vote by servicemembers and U.S. citizens  living overseas are most successful when voters are aware of the tools  and resources that are available through FVAP. However, as previously  noted, the results from recent studies and post-election surveys indicate  that there is limited awareness of FVAP\u2019s resources among military and  overseas voters. For example, FVAP\u2019s 2014 post-election survey  indicated that, of the active duty servicemembers who responded, 61  percent did not seek voting assistance from FVAP and were not aware of  FVAP\u2019s assistance, while 60 percent did not seek voting assistance from  unit voting assistance officers and were not aware of voting assistance  officers. Under DOD guidance implementing UOCAVA, FVAP is  responsible for establishing and maintaining a program to assist all  eligible voters. This involves various activities including, but not limited  to, collecting and reporting on survey data, prescribing forms for  UOCAVA voters to use when registering to vote, and coordinating with  the states. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 1000.04 requires FVAP to  establish a means to inform absent uniformed servicemembers of  absentee voting information and resources 90, 60, and 30 days before  each federal election. The types of information military and overseas  absentee voters need to be aware of in order to prepare to vote include,  but are not limited to: election dates and deadlines for submitting an absentee ballot;", "FVAP forms and online assistance for completing those forms;", "DOD voting assistance resources available such as the installation or  the location where the voter is registered/eligible to vote;  the way to request a blank ballot;  unit voting assistance officer; and  information on FVAP\u2019s resources, such as FVAP\u2019s website; call  center; and email address.", "Consistent with its designated responsibilities, FVAP has developed  education and outreach materials such as brochures, wallet cards, a  voting assistance guide, and a website to provide information to citizens  about the absentee voting process, including state-specific information  and service voting assistance programs. In addition, to increase  awareness of FVAP as a resource, DOD has hired contractors to support  FVAP\u2019s voter assistance campaigns through communication and  outreach. For example, FVAP\u2019s contractors assist FVAP in the  development of promotional materials such as videos, posters, and social  media messages.", "In our 2007 report, we noted that the U.S. election system is highly  decentralized and that states and territories have considerable discretion  in determining how they organize the election process, which is reflected  in the diversity of procedures and deadlines that states and jurisdictions  establish for voter registration and absentee voting. In its 2008 post- election report to Congress, FVAP similarly highlighted the variation in  and complexity of absentee voting procedures. For the 2014 general  election, the Election Assistance Commission report summarized 8,200  survey responses from local election offices across the United States and  territories about ballots that those offices transmitted to and were returned  from UOCAVA voters. To help voters and voting assistance officers to  be aware of these variations, FVAP maintains a website with links to state  election office websites, and regularly updates its Voting Assistance  Guide, which includes state-specific instructions and timelines for  completing the required voting forms.", "Despite such resources, the results of the two DOD-commissioned  studies and FVAP\u2019s post-election surveys administered between 2008  and 2014 showed that awareness of FVAP materials to assist voters  needed improvement. For example, by conducting focus groups and  interviews with servicemembers and U.S. citizens living overseas, one of  the reports commissioned by DOD found that voters were uncertain about  registration deadlines, which, as previously noted, vary by jurisdiction.  Further, while FVAP offers UOCAVA voters online assistance with  completing, among other things, the Federal Post Card Application and  the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot online, a DOD\u2013commissioned study  found specifically that some military voters interviewed as part of its study  were not aware of the Federal Post Card Application or that it could be  used to both register and request a ballot. As a result, servicemembers  may be taking additional time to separately request a ballot not realizing  that they can do so using the same form. Further, that study cited one of  the most significant improvements in UOCAVA voting as the states\u2019  transmission of blank ballots to UOCAVA voters online through email or a  state portal as a result of the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment  Act. Yet as of 2014, many overseas absentee voters interviewed as part  of the research study were unaware that they could receive their ballots  online.", "DOD\u2019s commissioned reports also found that state and local election  offices are not fully aware of FVAP\u2019s role as a resource that can assist  with implementation of UOCAVA requirements. To raise awareness about  FVAP\u2019s availability as an election resource to state and local election  officials, FVAP assists election officials by providing online training and  guidance, sending email alerts, funding research grants, participating in  conferences, conducting other local outreach, and making direct (person- to-person) contact. Upon request, FVAP can also help state election  officials look up servicemembers\u2019 military postal addresses. However,  some local election officials and other stakeholders that we spoke with  stated that the information that FVAP provides to states may not filter  down to the smaller localities. For example, one of the local election  officials we spoke with was not aware that FVAP could look up active- duty servicemembers\u2019 addresses for election officials. FVAP officials  stated that they focus coordination at the state level because, in their  experience, some state officials prefer to filter the information that FVAP  provides about UOCAVA voting to their localities.", "To address state and local awareness of FVAP resources, the Defense  Human Resources Activity, on behalf of FVAP, entered into an agreement  with the Council of State Governments in 2013. Among other things, the  agreement required the creation and support of two advisory groups, one  to identify and promote best practices for absentee voting laws,  regulations, and policy for military and overseas voters and the second to  standardize data collection and encourage state and local election  jurisdictions to test and implement tools to report uniform data from voter  registration and election administration systems. The council submits  activity reports from this partnership to FVAP on a quarterly, semi-annual,  or annual basis depending on the type of report or deliverable, as  specified in the agreement. In December 2015, the Council of State  Governments released a series of recommendations to the states, based  on the results of this collaboration. The recommendations were related to  voter communication, the Federal Post Card Application, online voter  registration, and engagement with the military community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unpredictable Postal Delivery of Absentee Ballots", "paragraphs": ["The second category of challenges identified by DOD and in our prior  work relates to the unpredictable postal delivery of absentee ballots to  and from UOCAVA voters. In addition to meeting any documentation  requirements, such as providing a signature or appropriately completing  all required sections, absentee ballots must be returned to the appropriate  election office by the specified deadline in order to have the votes  counted. However, the mail system, for a variety of reasons, can be  unpredictable for military and overseas voters. Specifically, the time it  takes for UOCAVA voters to receive an absentee ballot depends on their  location and may involve a complex and lengthy transit via different  transportation modes and speeds. For example, officials from the Military  Postal Service Agency noted that military mail transits between U.S.  Postal Service and Military Postal Service networks, and that voted  absentee ballots are shipped from overseas via air carriers. Military mail  does not enter a foreign country\u2019s mail processing network and is  considered domestic mail, according to officials. However, overseas  citizens use foreign postal systems and DOD reported that civilians who  use those systems expressed distrust for them in certain countries.", "In our 2001 report, we noted that overseas voters who do not have  access to the military postal system may have faced problems such as  longer transit times and unreliable mail service. Further, we noted that  some ballots that originated from overseas may not have been  postmarked until they arrived in the United States, raising the potential for  local jurisdictions in states with an extended deadline to disqualify them  because they lacked an overseas postmark or bore a postmark dated  after Election Day. All states provide the option to request or print ballots  online, but the availability of resources to active duty military can be  limited based on their location. For example, a service voting assistance  officer stated that U.S. Navy ships have a limited number of computer  terminals, bandwidth, and printers, which may prevent servicemembers  from accessing or printing their ballots. Furthermore, mail delays  experienced by servicemembers may also be the result of deployment  changes including the timing of their arrival at a new duty station or  departure from a current duty station. As such, guidance on the different  factors that may affect the timeliness of an absentee ballots\u2019 transit is  critical to help ensure that those voters are optimally positioned to meet  U.S. voting deadlines.", "In the 2014 general election, postal mail was the primary mode of ballot  transmission for many UOCAVA voters. For example, FVAP\u2019s 2014 post- election survey report to Congress stated that 61 percent of UOCAVA  ballots were transmitted to potential voters via postal mail, and 75 percent  of the UOCAVA ballots counted were received via postal mail. For active  duty servicemembers, a subset of UOCAVA voters, 75 percent of those  who requested a blank ballot obtained it from their local election office  through mail delivery from the U.S. Postal Service and the Military Postal  Service\u2014which handles military mail\u2014and 84 percent of those members  returned their voted ballot through the mail. FVAP is required to  coordinate with the Military Postal Service Agency (MPSA), an extension  of the U.S. Postal Service components which monitors and oversees  Military Postal Service functions, to implement measures to ensure voting  materials are moved expeditiously, to the maximum extent practicable, by  military postal authorities.", "To help UOCAVA voters meet the deadline to successfully cast their vote  in a U.S. election, U.S. Postal Service, in conjunction with MPSA,  provides servicemembers and overseas voters with recommended  absentee ballot mailing days and the corresponding dates by which  voters should mail their ballot prior to the election date. The MPSA  recommends ballot mailing dates for each Army or fleet post office  location. According to MPSA officials, the mailing dates are determined  by consulting with the major commands and combatant commands and  reviewing transportation routes and frequency. These dates provide an  estimate of the number of days required for a ballot to reach local election  offices through Military Postal Service and U.S. Postal Service networks.  In January 2016, the MPSA issued the recommended mail times for the  2016 election, and those times ranged from 7 to 30 days for ballots to be  transmitted to local election offices in the United States. Some of the  locations with longer transit recommendations include Ethiopia (30 days),  Egypt (20 days), and Afghanistan (20 days). In addition, MPSA  recommends that all deployed Navy ships in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets  mail their ballots at least 25 days before the 2016 election but no later  than October 10, 2016.", "These recommended mailing times can be helpful to voters; however,  based on our analysis, they also indicate that some military and overseas  voters who rely solely on mail delivery may not have enough time to both  request a blank ballot and cast their vote. For example, we found that  voters on deployed Navy ships in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets may  experience a 25-day transit time. Therefore, to allow for transit of (1) the  Federal Post Card Application that the voter mails to his or her local  election office, (2) the blank ballot the local election office sends to the  voter, and (3) the voted ballot that the voter mails back to the local  election office, a voter would have to multiply the recommended transit  time by three to account for each of those transits. Further, if a voter who  is deployed in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets relies solely on mail and the  local election office sends the blank ballot not later than 45 days prior to  the election as required by statute, it is unlikely that the voted ballot will  be returned on time because those two parts of the process may take up  to 50 days, according to MPSA\u2019s recommended mailing times.", "In addition to recommending mailing dates, MPSA issues a Strategic  Postal Voting Action Plan to assist military voters during each general  election cycle. This action plan specifies, among other things, deadlines  for ballots to be collected and postmarked at overseas military postal  outposts. The plan further notes that overseas military postal activities  with intermittent transportation networks or other limiting factors may  establish alternative mailing deadlines to help ensure that absentee  ballots reach election offices by the election date. States reported to the  Election Assistance Commission that they had rejected approximately  8,500 of the approximately 146,000 UOCAVA ballots received for the  2014 general election, and that the reason ballots were most commonly  rejected is because they were received after a state\u2019s ballot receipt  deadline.", "Military personnel in overseas military postal locations can return their  absentee ballots via Express Mail using an Express Mail Label 11-DOD  that can be used only for absentee ballots originating from overseas  military postal locations. Local election officials we spoke with stated that  they send their ballots to the designated military post office via First-Class  Mail or Standard Mail because of the expense of sending a ballot via  Express Mail. Election officials have the option to use a special  identification tag for official ballot First-Class or Standard Mail addressed  for domestic or international delivery; however, this is not required. We  previously reported that the U.S. Postal Service changed its delivery  standards for some types of mail in 2012 and 2015, which generally  increased the number of days to deliver some First-Class Mail in the  continental United States.

However, the purpose statement on  FVAP\u2019s website does not match the revised mission statement and DOD  Instruction 1000.04 does not clearly define the mission of the program,  although it identifies the various voting assistance activities and  responsibilities throughout DOD. As previously noted, in 2013, DOD  commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a study on aligning  FVAP\u2019s strategy and operations. The results of the study, which DOD and  the RAND Corporation released in October 2015, found, among other  things, that FVAP lacked a clearly articulated mission, shared among its  staff and stakeholders. For example, the report noted that FVAP thought  UOCAVA voters were best served through intermediaries such as voting  assistance officers and local election officials. However, the  intermediaries identified did not have a similar understanding of their role  and connection to FVAP and voters, and were generally unsure of what  FVAP was doing and why.", "In anticipation of the report\u2019s findings and before the final report was  issued, FVAP leaders and staff convened an offsite meeting during the  summer of 2015 and proactively developed a new mission statement,  vision, and strategic goals.

According to FVAP officials, the new mission and  strategic goals are part of a forthcoming strategic plan, and they do not  plan to make them publicly available until after November 2016 to avoid  distraction prior to the upcoming presidential election. However, without  communicating its updated mission, vision, and strategic goals publicly,  FVAP stakeholders may continue to be unclear about FVAP\u2019s purpose  and their role in its achievement.

We reviewed FVAP\u2019s fiscal year 2014-2016 budget  justification documents, which contain FVAP\u2019s strategic goals and  corresponding performance measures and found that FVAP has changed  its strategic goals in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and changed the  performance measures associated with the strategic goals from year to  year. In addition, the mission and strategic goals are different than the  purpose statement that FVAP shares publicly on its website. Although the  changes in FVAP\u2019s strategic goals are not substantial, the frequency with  which they have changed, coupled with the fact that FVAP does not share  its goals publicly, inhibits FVAP\u2019s ability to track and demonstrate  progress over time.

During our  review, officials acknowledged that FVAP faces challenges beyond its  control, especially related to military and overseas citizens\u2019 interest in  voting. To make decisions about populations on which to concentrate  voter awareness activities, DOD used the results of post-election surveys  to group individuals based on how likely they are to vote.

For example,  DOD has proactively commissioned studies that identified challenges with  FVAP and it has administered and analyzed the results of post-election  surveys to identify areas needing improvement. While these are positive  steps, some of the challenges identified, such as the limited voter and  stakeholder awareness of FVAP resources and the unpredictable postal  delivery of absentee ballots, are long-standing issues and continue to  persist\u2014in part because DOD has not established time frames for  completing identified corrective actions. Having time frames would help  DOD to better focus its effort and resources and would provide important  benchmarks against which DOD could demonstrate program progress to  Congress and other stakeholders, including through the statutorily  required annual reports. Further, while DOD\u2019s leadership of FVAP has  stabilized since 2013, DOD has not fully implemented the six selected  leading practices for federal strategic planning into the day-to-day  operation of the program. In addition, DOD has not developed a long-term  strategy that could help focus the program and further develop and  institutionalize the leading practices that it partially exhibits through future  leadership transitions, so it can effectively respond to the changing nature  of the voting environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s management  of FVAP.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to establish time frames to  complete actions that its Federal Voting Assistance Program has  identified it will take to address challenges, and also to use these time  frames to demonstrate progress for stakeholders, including through its  statutorily required annual reporting.", "We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, through the Defense Human Resources Activity, direct  FVAP\u2019s Director to fully implement the six selected leading practices of  federal strategic planning into the day-to-day operations of the program.", "We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, through the Defense Human Resources Activity, direct  FVAP\u2019s Director to complete the development of a strategic plan that fully  exhibits the six selected leading practices of federal strategic planning,  including, but not limited to: a statement of FVAP\u2019s revised mission and goals; an identification of strategies that address management challenges  and resources needed to achieve goals; a description of leadership involvement and accountability; a description of stakeholder involvement in the development of FVAP a coordination strategy to communicate the program\u2019s mission and  goals to other federal agencies; and a description of performance measures, aligned with program goals  that FVAP will use to track progress toward achieving goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with one  of our three recommendations, and concurred with the other two  recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix VII. DOD,  the U.S. Postal Service, and the MPSA also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated, as appropriate.", "In partially concurring with our first recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness to establish time frames to complete actions that FVAP has  identified that it will take to address challenges, and to use these time  frames to demonstrate progress for stakeholders, DOD agreed that time  frames can provide a \u201cyard stick\u201d for measuring program effectiveness.  However, DOD stated that it had not specified time frames because  recommendations in FVAP\u2019s reports to Congress are taken for immediate  action and election cycles provide a natural timeframe for completion.  DOD further highlighted a number of efforts that are complete or  underway for the 2016 election cycle and that it plans to include in its next  report to Congress.", "As stated in our report, we recognize that FVAP is accustomed to a  cyclical planning process that is largely driven by the 2-year timeframe of  the federal election schedule. In addition, we note in our report steps that  have been taken to address long-standing challenges such as increasing  voter awareness of FVAP resources and mitigating unpredictability in  postal delivery. However, these long-standing challenges persist in part  because DOD has not established time frames for completing actions  intended to address them, as discussed in our report. We believe that, if  time frames are not established with the specificity needed to help ensure  that actions are completed in a timely manner for implementation into the  next election cycle, actions may not be properly prioritized, resources  may not be effectively targeted; and decision makers and stakeholders  may not have necessary information regarding FVAP\u2019s progress with  respect to improvements.", "In concurring with our second recommendation that the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, through the Defense Human  Resources Activity, direct FVAP\u2019s Director to fully implement the six  selected leading practices of federal strategic planning into the day-to-day  operations of the program, DOD stated that its formal efforts to implement  selected leading strategic planning practices began in 2015 when the  RAND Corporation assessed FVAP\u2019s organizational structure and FVAP  took initial steps to position itself as a customer-focused service delivery  organization. We agree that FVAP\u2019s strategic planning activities began  during the review by the RAND Corporation, and in our report note  FVAP\u2019s efforts to revise the mission and strategic goals through a staff  offsite after initial feedback from the RAND Corporation.", "In addition, DOD highlighted the following steps it has taken to  incorporate the characteristics of strategic planning leading practices that  our analysis identified as missing, and provided examples that  demonstrate progress in some of these areas.  1.  Define the mission and goals: DOD noted that FVAP will make the  complete strategic plan publicly available in December 2016. We  agree that this is a positive step, and note in our report FVAP\u2019s plan to  issue a strategic plan after November 2016 because FVAP wanted to  avoid distraction prior to the upcoming presidential election.  2.  Define strategies that address management challenges and  identify resources needed to achieve goals: DOD stated that most  factors that influence the success of a voter are outside the influence  or control of DOD. Further, DOD stated that FVAP works to facilitate  the voting process and improve areas where it has the ability to affect  the process. While we agree that DOD does not control many of the  factors that influence the success of a voter to cast a ballot, we note in  our report that it is particularly important that agencies specifically  develop strategies to address those management challenges that are  outside of their control. We believe that, by identifying the challenges  that are outside of its control, FVAP can also identify a reasonable  level of resources to devote to address certain challenges, or  determine how to leverage partnerships with the stakeholders that  have more direct control on absentee voting such as states, the  voters, and the MPSA.  3.  Ensure leadership involvement and accountability: DOD noted  that it has a well-established chain of command in carrying out its  responsibilities under UOCAVA and those lines of accountability are  articulated in a relevant directive and instruction. We disagree with  DOD\u2019s implication that the guidance alone ensures leadership  involvement and accountability, and have concerns that the strategic  planning activities initiated by the current Director could be diminished  by a future leadership transition. Officials noted during our review that  leadership transitions were routinely accompanied by changes in  program priorities.  4.  Involve stakeholders: DOD noted that stakeholder involvement was  part of the RAND Corporation\u2019s study, during which stakeholder views  of FVAP responsibilities were solicited. Further, DOD stated that  some of the stakeholder misconceptions about FVAP's role were  based on previous communication from FVAP. In our report, we note  the involvement of FVAP's stakeholders in the RAND Corporation  study and continue to believe that a strategic plan could help FVAP  communicate its role consistently and publicly to its stakeholders, to  address the misconceptions, such as the perception that FVAP  stakeholder coordination was driven by individual agendas, which the  RAND study uncovered.   5.  Coordinate with other federal agencies: DOD stated that it  coordinated with other federal agencies, which were also included in  the RAND study, in the development of its mission, goals, and  strategies. These efforts led to the newly defined and focused  strategic goals. We do not have evidence from the stakeholders we  spoke with, listed in appendix III, that the RAND Corporation or FVAP  consulted them specifically regarding the development of FVAP's  mission, goals, and strategies.  6.  Develop and use performance measures: DOD stated that FVAP  and each of its employees are evaluated by yearly performance  measures tied to the work conducted on a daily basis. We disagree  that annual performance evaluations for individual staff constitute  performance measures that help FVAP measure progress toward  achieving its strategic goals, even when these performance measures  are tracked, as DOD suggests, upward from the individual to the  FVAP office, the Defense Human Resources Activity, the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), and overall DOD  strategies and goals. In addition, DOD noted that FVAP will refine its  analysis of metrics collected by service voting assistance officers and  compare the numeric values collected with historical values over time.  However, the metrics we reviewed were a tally of numbers associated  with a type of assistance or service provided. Those metrics did not  contain a baseline to indicate how such assistance efforts compared  with assistance needed or with the size of the UOCAVA voter  population.", "In concurring with our third recommendation to complete the development  of a strategic plan that fully exhibits the six selected leading practices of  federal strategic planning, DOD stated that FVAP embraces GAO\u2019s six  selected leading practices of strategic planning, and that, as noted earlier,  it will publicly issue a final strategic plan in December 2016. While FVAP\u2019s  identification of a time frame for issuing its strategic plan demonstrates  progress, it also indicates that FVAP will not have a plan to guide its work  through another presidential election. We noted in our report that the  program did not have a strategic plan during the 2012 and 2014 general  election cycles. Further, in its comments, DOD took issue with our  statement that the lack of a strategic plan has hindered FVAP\u2019s ability to  respond to challenges faced in the military and overseas citizen voting  environment. We disagree and continue to believe that, as discussed in  our report, it will be difficult for FVAP to demonstrate progress in  addressing its long-standing challenges without a strategic plan. Further,  we continue to believe that a publicly available strategic plan will help  FVAP communicate its role to stakeholders and customers, clearly state  its program goals, and identify the metrics that FVAP will use to measure  progress toward its goals and to mitigate challenges.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of  Staff; the Secretaries of the military departments, and the Commandant of  the U.S. Marine Corps.

In table 4 we show that, of the  ballots that local election offices received, counted, and rejected during  each election, the state-provided absentee ballots were the most common  in each category. Further, the usage of Federal Write-in Absentee  Ballots, FVAP\u2019s write-in backup ballot for eligible UOCAVA voters who  have not received their requested ballots at least 30 days before federal  elections, increased between the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.  Specifically, local election offices received, counted, and rejected Federal  Write-in Absentee Ballots at higher rates in the 2012 presidential election  than the 2008 presidential election. The Election Assistance Commission  reported that local election offices rejected absentee ballots primarily  because they had received those ballots after the deadline in each  election.

We interviewed the senior service voting  representative and voting action officers from each of the military  services, including the U.S. Coast Guard, to discuss their coordination  with FVAP and management of the service voting assistance activities.  We also contacted officials at other DOD organizations, the military  services, other executive branch agencies, and nongovernmental  organizations to discuss the challenges that FVAP faces in providing  voting assistance to military and overseas voters.

The  first study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, examined FVAP\u2019s  internal operations; the second study, conducted by Lake Research  Partners, identified challenges faced by overseas absentee voters, their  eligible family members, DOD\u2019s voting assistance officers, overseas  citizens, and local election officials. We interviewed staff from the RAND  Corporation that conducted the study of FVAP\u2019s internal operations to  discuss their views of the program and its challenges. We reviewed  documentation that FVAP provided from the Lake Research Partners  study, including transcripts from focus groups with voters covered under  the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA),  including servicemembers, their family members, and overseas citizen to  identify the absentee voting challenges faced by those FVAP customers.", "We also reviewed and analyzed the results of post-election surveys that  FVAP had conducted with the Defense Manpower Data Center and the  Election Assistance Commission between 2008 and 2014. The surveys  are used to determine participation in the electoral process by UOCAVA  voters; assess the impact of FVAP\u2019s efforts to simplify and ease the  process of voting absentee; evaluate progress made to facilitate absentee  voting; and identify remaining obstacles to voting by individuals covered  by UOCAVA. These surveys include questions for the voter about the  methods voters used to cast a ballot and the effectiveness of the  information sources the voters consulted. The surveys also collect data  from local election officials regarding the numbers of absentee ballots  processed and the reasons for rejection. We determined that that FVAP\u2019s  surveys with the Defense Manpower Data Center and the Election  Assistance Commission were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.", "We reviewed communication plans and a media engagement plan that  FVAP uses to promote awareness of its resources. We reviewed our  previous reports on DOD\u2019s FVAP, including the recommendations that  had resulted from those reports and the status of those  recommendations. In addition, we learned about challenges faced by  local election officials by attending an Election Data Summit sponsored by  the Election Assistance Commission, in which election officials from  fourteen states spoke about challenges they face. In addition, we  interviewed local election officials in Virginia and Colorado, among the  states with large populations of UOCAVA voters, to discuss their  perspectives on challenges associated with overseas absentee voting.", "We compared FVAP\u2019s identification of and plans for addressing  challenges with applicable internal control standards and relevant  program management criteria. Specifically, we reviewed the plans and  actions that FVAP had identified to address challenges in post-election  survey reports and press releases. We compared FVAP\u2019s actions with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which call for  agencies to complete and document actions to remediate challenges on a  timely basis. We also compared those actions with the Project  Management Body of Knowledge practice for identifying time frames  associated with projects to determine whether projects are meeting their  goals.

We also  obtained information regarding Military Postal Service Agency\u2019s process  for developing recommended dates by which UOCAVA voters should mail  their completed ballots in order for those ballots to return in time for local  election offices to count, and compared the 2016 recommended mailing  times with related statutory requirements for the transmission of ballots to  voters.", "To determine the extent to which has DOD implemented strategic  planning practices to help ensure the long-term effectiveness of FVAP,  we reviewed documentation of FVAP\u2019s long-term planning, including  information FVAP provides on its public website; annual budget estimates  FVAP submits to the Defense Human Resource Agency, which include  strategic goals and performance measures that FVAP intends to measure  progress toward those goals; FVAP\u2019s annual reports to Congress, which  include FVAP\u2019s goals and actions it intends to take to meet those goals;  and documentation of the performance metrics FVAP uses to collect data  to monitor its activities. We also reviewed a cooperative agreement  between the Defense Human Resources Activity and the Council of State  Governments related to FVAP; commissioned reports from the RAND  Corporation and Lake Research Partners; and annual reports from 2008- 14 that the DOD Inspector General conducted on FVAP and the services\u2019  implementation of their respective voting assistance programs.

The analysts independently rated each of the six  selected leading practices as \u201cexhibits,\u201d \u201cpartially exhibits,\u201d or \u201cdoes not  exhibit\u201d by DOD. We determined that DOD \u201cexhibits\u201d a leading practice  for federal strategic planning when FVAP\u2019s activities explicitly addressed  all characteristics set forth in the leading practice and determined that  DOD \u201cpartially exhibits\u201d a leading practice when FVAP\u2019s activities  addressed at least one or more characteristics of the leading practice, but  not all characteristics of the leading practice. Finally, we determined that  DOD \u201cdoes not exhibit\u201d a leading practice when FVAP\u2019s activities did not  address any characteristics of the leading practice.
