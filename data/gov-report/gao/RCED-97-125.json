The agency\u2019s mission, as mandated by the Congress, is to provide for the public\u2019s enjoyment of these resources while preserving and protecting them for the enjoyment of future generations. The 374 units that now make up the national park system cover over 80 million acres and are estimated to serve over 265 million visitors annually. The park system is continuing to grow and includes a diverse mix of sites, ranging from natural areas such as Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks to urban areas such as Gateway National Recreation Area in Brooklyn, New York, to national battlefields, national historic sites, and national preserves.", "In recent years, the Park Service has received increased funding for the operation of the national park system.

Accordingly, you asked us to (1) describe the process used by the Park Service to develop budgets and establish operating priorities; (2) determine the limitations, if any, of the agency\u2019s priority-setting processes at a sample of parks; (3) determine what, if any, implications the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) has for the Park Service; (4) provide information on trends in cutbacks of visitor services at the parks; and (5) compare funding levels for park operations with those for other federal land management agency operations.", "Our work focused on reviewing the Park Service\u2019s processes for budgeting and setting operating priorities at headquarters, four regional offices, and four parks.

On one hand, the agency is to provide for the public\u2019s enjoyment of the resources that have been entrusted to its care. This objective involves providing for the use of the parks by supplying appropriate visitor services (such as campgrounds and visitor centers) and infrastructure (such as roads and water systems) to support these services. On the other hand, the Park Service is to protect the resources so that they will be unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Balancing these dual objectives has long shaped the dialogue about how best to manage the national park system.", "In the past few years, the dialogue about how best to manage the park system has taken on a new dimension. While the Congress and the executive branch have been working under increasingly tight budget constraints, the national park system has continued to expand\u201435 parks have been added since 1985. In addition, the Park Service estimates that its maintenance backlog, including the costs of general maintenance and rehabilitation to existing facilities and roads, exceeds $4 billion. One of the ways the Park Service has dealt with these conditions is to cut back or curtail visitor services in many parks. These cutbacks and curtailments in services have led to concerns about how the agency is being managed\u2014particularly about how priorities are set within the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parks Set Priorities Through the Budgeting Process", "paragraphs": ["Most of the funding for the Park Service is for park operating budgets. For fiscal year 1997, the Park Service was appropriated about $1.5 billion. Of this, about $1.2 billion was appropriated to cover the operation of the park system\u2014including the headquarters and regional offices. About 80 percent of the operating funds go directly to the parks to cover the costs of their day-to-day operations. This operating budget is the primary funding source for any park. At the park level, it is generally referred to as the base budget.", "The process for formulating park operating budgets is incremental. This process begins with the prior year\u2019s budget as a base and focuses priority setting on requests for increases to the prior year\u2019s base budget. Requests for operating increases primarily take two forms: mandatory pay increases and specific increases for individual parks\u2014some for new or higher levels of ongoing operating responsibilities, such as law enforcement, and others for one-time projects, such as the rehabilitation of a historic property. Headquarters takes the initiative in requesting the funding for all required pay increases on a servicewide basis. However, for park-specific increases, the parks compete against one another for limited funds through their regional and headquarters hierarchy. Thus, the formal priority-setting process focuses primarily on marginal increases to last year\u2019s budget\u2014not on the priorities of ongoing park activities.", "While headquarters plays a key role in formulating requests for increases to the Park Service\u2019s budget, decisions about spending and operating priorities associated with a park\u2019s base budget are delegated to the park managers. The superintendent\u2014the chief park official\u2014at each of the 374 park units reports to one of several regional directors, each of whom reports to headquarters. However, upon receiving their budget allocation for base operations, the superintendents exercise a great deal of discretion in setting operational priorities. Many of the park officials we spoke with stressed the importance of this decentralized, park-based decision-making structure, under which park managers plan and execute their budget with as little involvement from regional and headquarters managers as possible. Park Service officials at all levels within the agency maintained that park-level managers were in the best position to plan activities at their park and make decisions about priorities and spending on a day-to-day basis. Hence, regional and headquarters officials generally do not get involved in priority-setting and spending decisions for parks. Typically, these decisions involve trade-offs among four categories of spending: (1) visitor services (e.g., opening a campground), (2) resource management (e.g., monitoring the condition of threatened species or water quality), (3) maintenance needs (e.g., repairing a trail), and (4) park administration and support (e.g., updating computer systems or attending training).", "In fiscal year 1997, about 70 percent of the Park Service\u2019s operating budget is allocated for personnel services\u2014salaries and benefits of park employees. The remaining 30 percent is allocated for items such as utilities, contracted services, equipment, training, travel, and supplies. As a general rule, the higher the proportion of personnel to nonpersonnel costs, the less flexibility an agency has to reduce costs in the short term when budgets are tight. Further limiting the Park Service\u2019s flexibility is the large proportion\u201493 percent\u2014of staff who are permanent employees. Because so many staff are permanent, the parks cannot reduce costs by reducing the largest component of their operating costs\u2014salaries and benefits\u2014during off-peak seasons. At the four parks we visited, the percentage of the park budget dedicated to salaries and benefits ranged from about 75 percent at Yellowstone National Park to about 85 percent at Olympic National Park.", "Park personnel costs will increase annually with required pay and benefit increases and other administrative actions. To the extent that a park\u2019s budget does not increase at the same rate as its personnel costs, the park must absorb some or all of the increase in salaries and benefits. For example, Independence\u2019s budget increased from $10.42 million in fiscal year 1994 to $10.64 million in fiscal year 1996\u2014an increase of $220,000. However, during this 2-year period, salaries and benefits increased by $376,000 and an administratively required salary enhancement program for park rangers cost an additional $455,000. As a result, during this period the increase in the park\u2019s funding did not cover the increase in salaries and benefits, and the park had to absorb over $610,000 in cost increases. Similarly, at Yellowstone, from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1996, the park\u2019s funding increased by $2 million while mandatory salary and nonsalary components, such as utility costs, rose by about $4 million\u2014requiring the park to absorb about $2 million in increased costs over 3 years. At Great Smoky Mountains, from 1994 through 1996, the operating cost increases for personnel alone were more than twice as great as the funding increases.", "Since park budgets consist primarily of salaries and benefits, absorbing costs can be very difficult without reducing personnel. Parks frequently try to reduce spending for training, travel, and some supplies, but these costs are only a minimal part of their budget. In some cases, parks have had to make further cuts to absorb increases, either by not hiring seasonal employees or by not filling the positions of permanent employees who resign or retire. In either case, having fewer workers means that some activities will not be performed. For example, in 1996, Great Smoky Mountains absorbed increases in costs by hiring fewer seasonal staff. As a result, park managers chose to close two backwoods campgrounds for that year because there were not enough maintenance staff to clean and maintain them. Yellowstone also absorbed increased costs in 1996 and had to cut back on a number of activities, including the operation of a campground and two museums. During the same year, Olympic eliminated six seasonal law enforcement ranger positions. According to park officials, this cutback delayed the response time to park incidents. The officials also told us that reductions in resource protection patrols resulted in the accumulation of 50 to 100 tons of trash and litter that washed up on the Olympic coast during the winter months.", "Superintendents typically face numerous trade-offs in making spending decisions. For example, in 1996, Yellowstone faced several competing demands\u2014several of which it was not able to fund. Providing the same levels of activities in 1996 as were provided in 1995 would have cost the park about $2 million more than it was provided. The additional costs were due to mandated increases for items such as employee background investigations, employee salaries and benefits, and increased water and sewage testing. To offset these increased costs, the park managers reduced spending for travel, training, and supplies; permitted several permanent and seasonal staff positions to lapse; and closed a campground and two nearby museums. Our past work has shown that such trade-offs occur frequently at many parks in the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Priority Setting and Accountability Systems Lack a Focus on Results", "paragraphs": ["Although park managers need flexibility to effectively manage their park, accountability for the results achieved with the funds spent is also important. There is nothing inherently wrong with a decentralized management system or with delegating decisions about spending and operating priorities to park managers. However, the park managers we spoke with indicated that they rarely, if ever, discussed with regional or headquarters staff their park\u2019s operating priorities or the results accomplished with the funds spent. Under these conditions, the current decentralized priority-setting and accountability systems lack a focus on the results that were achieved.", "Our prior work has shown that a good system of accountability would include elements such as (1) a process for establishing expectations for accomplishments, (2) a means of measuring progress against expectations, and (3) a means of holding managers responsible for achieving agreed-upon progress. Park Service officials told us that park superintendents set annual performance expectations with their regional director and are held accountable for meeting these expectations. However, park officials also told us these agreements generally focused on accomplishing tasks, such as completing a park\u2019s general management plan, rather than on accomplishing measurable park goals, such as inventorying and evaluating the condition of cultural resources.", "Officials at the four parks we visited indicated that few, if any, reviews of or agreements on their annual operating priorities had taken place between regional or headquarters offices and the park. Officials at the four regional offices responsible for the four parks indicated that it was up to the parks to establish operating priorities and said that they did not get involved in setting park priorities. (These four regional offices are responsible for over 275 park units\u2014or over three-fourths of the total number of parks.) Under this system, key components needed to hold superintendents accountable are missing. Without expectations about the goals that are to be achieved in the parks, a means for measuring progress toward these goals is not in place. As a result, the agency\u2019s ability to determine or ensure that the desired results are achieved is diminished.", "The parks we visited had a variety of planning documents that described critical needs within each park. However, the documents did not establish expectations for addressing these needs or provide for measuring the progress achieved during the year. Furthermore, the needs described in the planning documents were generally not linked to the budget process or to currently available budgetary resources. As a result, critical issues that are expressed as priorities in planning documents may not be funded when spending decisions are made.", "In the current fiscal climate of tight budgets, it is particularly important for a decentralized agency like the Park Service to have a good system of accountability. If a park, regional office, and headquarters agree on expectations, goals, and results and measure the park\u2019s progress against these expectations, then the agency will have a better system for holding park managers accountable for how park funds are spent. Furthermore, with such a system, the Park Service would be better able to understand and communicate what is being done and what is being accomplished with the agency\u2019s operating funding on a year-to-year basis.

Beginning with fiscal year 1999, agencies are required to prepare annual performance plans with annual goals that are linked to the goals in the strategic plan. They must then measure their performance against the goals they have set and report publicly on how they are progressing against their expectations. The Park Service has prepared a draft strategic plan that covers the 5-year period from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002.", "Implementing GPRA involves three key steps: (1) setting expectations by developing strategic plans that define the mission, goals and desired outcomes for an agency; (2) measuring progress or performance against these expectations; and (3) using information on performance as a basis for deciding whether progress has been achieved.

The extent of such reductions agencywide is unknown because the Park Service does not routinely track data on national trends in the level of visitor services or other activities provided in the parks. Our work showed that each of the four parks had reduced visitor services at various times over the past 5 years. Moreover, as we reported in 1995, reductions in visitor services have been occurring in many other parks since at least as far back as 1985. In 1995, we reported that there were significant cuts in visitor services at 11 of the 12 park units we reviewed.", "According to the Comptroller of the Park Service, the headquarters office does not routinely track cutbacks in visitor services because park superintendents are responsible for managing their park, including making decisions on visitor services, and therefore are in the best position to weigh the trade-offs in reducing operations at their park. Nevertheless, in 1996, in response to a congressional inquiry, the headquarters office attempted to obtain information from park units on such reductions and their effects on visitors and resources for fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1996. The Park Service\u2019s records indicated that over 50 parks reported significant cuts in visitor services during fiscal year 1996. The Park Service attributed all of the identified cuts to funding shortages. Examples of cuts in visitor services include the elimination of lifeguard services at some park recreational areas, reduced operating hours or the closure of visitor centers, and the closure of some campgrounds.", "However, our review showed that some of the data obtained were not accurate and that another attempt by headquarters in January 1997 to obtain updated information on reductions in park operations for fiscal year 1997 produced incomplete results.

However, in considering the amount and scope of cuts in visitor services it is important to consider this information in the full context of overall park operations. Park managers made the cuts in visitor services as part of a broader effort to match park spending with available funds. In each of the four parks, the cutbacks in visitor services were a relatively small portion of the overall reductions in park operations. Most of the cutbacks occurred in areas such as park maintenance, resource management, and park administration. For example, as noted earlier in this report, in 1996 Yellowstone needed to absorb about $2 million in increased costs. Of this amount, $72,000, or about 3 percent, came from reductions in the operations of visitor service facilities, including a campground and two museums. The rest came from reductions in other park operations. Increased operating funds allowed the park to reopen these visitor service facilities in 1997. Although the proportions differ, similar scenarios played out at the other parks we visited.", "The following summarizes the cuts in visitor services imposed by the four parks during the most recent 5-year period: In 1996, Great Smoky Mountains National Park closed three campgrounds during the winter months and two smaller campgrounds for the whole year. In addition, the park closed one of its visitor centers and staffed two others with uniformed personnel for only 5 hours per day. In 1996, Yellowstone National Park cut several visitor services, closing a campground, visitor center, and two museums. In addition, the park did not fund 10 law enforcement positions and eliminated several guided hikes. Independence National Historical Park closed several historic buildings to visitors and reduced visiting hours at several other buildings for 3 of the 5 years reviewed.", "Olympic National Park made several cuts in visitor services during each of the past 5 years, including reducing visitor center hours, shortening campground seasons, not opening two entrance stations and backcountry trails, and providing fewer law enforcement patrols and interpretative programs.", "Appendix I provides more detailed information on the four parks\u2019 cuts in visitor services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parks Attempted to Minimize the Impact of Tight Budgets on Visitor Services", "paragraphs": ["Overall, park managers have tried to minimize the impact of operational cutbacks on visitors.

In all four parks, administrative costs for items such as training, travel, and supplies were reduced; maintenance was deferred; positions went unfilled; and other discretionary programs, such as resource management, were reduced before cuts were made in visitor services. Some park managers told us that the services that were cut were selected because their loss would affect the fewest visitors to the parks. For example, at Great Smoky Mountains, three major campgrounds were closed in 1996 during the winter months\u2014a period of lower visitation. Also, other campgrounds were available both inside and outside the park. A visitation survey conducted at Great Smoky Mountains during the summer of 1996 showed that 90 percent of the visitors rated visitor services as good or very good. At Independence, historic buildings that normally received less visitation were closed or operating hours were reduced so that Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell\u2014the two historic structures that received the most visitation\u2014could operate for extended hours during the summer.

We also discussed with Park Service officials how park priorities are used in developing budget requests and allocating appropriated funds. We reviewed Park Service headquarters and regional office directives, guidance, and practices for identifying operational priorities; Park Service budget documents; and park planning documents.", "We visited four parks: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Independence National Historical Park, Olympic National Park, and Yellowstone National Park. As agreed with your offices, we selected these four parks because they (1) include large natural and historical parks, (2) are located in different regions of the country, and (3) reported several cutbacks in visitor services. We also limited our review to four parks so that we could respond to your need for information by early April 1997. Although we cannot generalize the results of our work to all 374 park units, the parks selected are among the most visible and notable in the national park system. Hence, the information collected should provide a meaningful indication of how the park system establishes operational priorities.", "To respond to the third objective, we reviewed GAO documents on implementing GPRA and interviewed officials at Park Service headquarters, the four regional offices, and the four parks to discuss how these parks\u2019 processes for establishing operational priorities relate to GPRA\u2019s requirements and to obtain information on the status of the Park Service\u2019s implementation of GPRA. We did not specifically review the Park Service\u2019s processes for implementing GPRA.", "To obtain information on trends in cutbacks in visitor services, we held discussions with officials from Park Service headquarters, the four regional offices, and the four parks included in our review and obtained documentation related to this issue. As agreed with your offices, we requested trend information for the past 5 years. Also, because servicewide trend information was not available from Park Service headquarters, we collected data on cutbacks in visitor services from the four parks we visited.", "With respect to the last objective, we interviewed officials and obtained budget trend data from the Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), and the Forest Service (FS). As agreed with your offices, we obtained budget data for fiscal years 1985 through 1997. The budget data consisted of gross obligations for the operations and maintenance accounts of each agency. We adjusted the obligations data for inflation by using the Gross Domestic Product implicit price deflator developed by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. We then compared the inflation-adjusted change in the Park Service\u2019s obligations over this period with the similarly adjusted changes in the obligations of the other federal land management agencies. We also obtained information that would provide an indication of the growth in the numbers of public visits, acres, and units managed by these agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seattle Regional Office", "paragraphs": ["Brent Hutchison Paul Staley The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
