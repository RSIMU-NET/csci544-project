FAA has agreed to address these weaknesses. Nevertheless, FAA will continue to be challenged in protecting ATC systems because it has not developed a cybersecurity threat model. NIST guidance, as well as experts GAO consulted, recommend such modeling to identify potential threats to information systems, and as a basis for aligning cybersecurity efforts and limited resources. While FAA has taken some steps toward developing such a model, it has no plans to produce one and has not assessed the funding or time that would be needed to do so. Without such a model, FAA may not be allocating resources properly to guard against the most significant cybersecurity threats.", "Modern aircraft are increasingly connected to the Internet.

The older systems, depicted on the left in figure 3 below, are  difficult to access remotely because few of them connect from FAA to  external entities such as through the Internet. They also have limited lines  of direct connection within FAA. Conversely, the new information systems  for NextGen programs are designed to interoperate with other systems  and use IP networking to communicate within FAA, as shown on the right  in figure 3 below.

As  shown in the figure, cybersecurity controls, if properly designed and  effectively implemented, can make IP-networked systems more resilient  against damage while allowing the systems to interoperate. According to  MITRE, because the older systems had limited connectivity, they were  generally not protected with cybersecurity controls. Once one of them is  breached, it is easy to potentially damage that system, gain access to  other systems with which it communicates, and potentially damage those  systems as well. According to FAA, so far, approximately 36 percent of  the ATC systems in the national airspace system (NAS) are connected  using IP, and FAA officials expect the percentage of NAS systems using  IP networking to grow to 50 to 60 percent by 2020.

The FAA\u2019s CIO is developing an enterprise approach for  non-NAS information systems and cybersecurity, and is also leading a  cross-agency team in developing the Cyber Security Strategy for 2016\u2013 2020.

FAA runs exercises that simulate cyber attacks and are designed to  increase internal collaboration and help clarify roles during such events.  Specifically, the NAS Security Risk Executive and other ATO staff  organized and conducted five of these exercises between 2013 and 2015  involving FAA cybersecurity staff from different FAA offices as well as  staff from the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, and  MITRE. FAA officials said that these exercises are an integral part of  sustaining and improving operational activities and are incorporated into  the planning process for all NAS activities. FAA plans to continue  conducting one or two per year.", "In addition to the ATO\u2019s NAS Risk Executive, FAA established the  Cybersecurity Steering Committee in November 2013 to better coordinate  FAA agency-wide cybersecurity efforts at the executive level and provide  an integrated approach to cybersecurity strategy and planning with a  mission focus for FAA. The Committee has begun establishing the  specific roles and responsibilities required to fulfill its mission. It is chaired  by the CISO and includes representatives from ATO, NextGen, and  Security and Hazardous Material Safety. These members are tasked with  working together to identify, prioritize, strategize, and operationalize  cybersecurity requirements, issues, programs, and projects needed to  integrate an agency-wide approach to cybersecurity. Given that the  Committee is in its early phases of operation, it is too early to tell whether  it will be able to provide the cybersecurity visibility and coordination  functions as outlined by the committee charter.", "While FAA is working to transform the organization of its cybersecurity  efforts, the experts we consulted said that it could improve upon those  efforts by including all key stakeholders in its agency-wide approach. All  15 of our cybersecurity and aviation experts agreed that organizational  clarity regarding roles, responsibilities, and accountability is key to  ensuring cybersecurity across the organization. In addition, the five  experts who commented on stakeholder inclusion all said that because  aircraft avionics systems have the potential to be connected to systems  outside the aircraft, aircraft cybersecurity issues should be included in an  agency-wide cybersecurity effort. For instance, AVS issues cybersecurity- related rules for aircraft and has begun reviewing rulemaking on  cybersecurity, but AVS is not included in developing the agency-wide  approach for information systems security and has no representative on  the Cybersecurity Steering Committee. FAA states that AVS subject  matter experts can be called upon to share information and  recommendations but that regulatory aspects associated with  cybersecurity for AVS\u2019s information systems are addressed by the FAA\u2019s  CIO and are therefore not under the purview of the FAA Cybersecurity  Steering Committee.

In accordance  with this guidance and other federal agency requirements, FAA\u2019s  acquisition process requires that each new system\u2019s security impact level  be categorized as low, moderate, or high based upon the risks associated  with the system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits.Of the six foundational NextGen systems we reviewed, all have  completed at least an initial categorization process.", "Select security controls: NIST guidance states that agencies should next  select protective measures, known as security controls, based on the  characterization described above. According to NIST guidance and  federal agency requirements, the impact categorization determines which  security control baseline (i.e., starting point for consideration) the system  should use, as the low-impact baseline lists fewer controls than the  moderate- or high-impact baselines. NIST guidance also states that as  part of the selection phase, organizations should tailor the baseline  security controls so that they align with the system\u2019s specific mission,  function, or environment. In some cases, this aligning may include  eliminating some inapplicable controls or applying supplemental controls.  In accordance with NIST guidance, FAA\u2019s acquisition policies require the  selection of appropriate security controls that reflect the system\u2019s  categorization, and allow for appropriate tailoring of security controls. For  example, detailed tailoring directions are provided in an FAA handbook  that supplements the AMS. In addition, FAA recently drafted guidance to  require that programs report, among other things, the cybersecurity  decisions and activities conducted in the selection of security controls.", "Implement security controls: NIST guidance also states that once  selected, the system must implement controls specified in the security  plan.

The official  noted that while the agency recognizes that its implementation cycle for  critical cybersecurity controls needs to be more agile and responsive,  swift implementation is hampered by federal-funding processes,  acquisition requirements, and, as discussed below, the need to  extensively test security controls. The official noted that FAA is  considering adapting acquisition practices in order to rapidly implement  critical controls; however, no definitive plan has been established.", "Assess security controls: Additionally, NIST guidance states that  assessments are important to ensuring that the security controls are  functioning as intended. If a weakness is discovered during the  assessment process, agencies are expected to generate a remediation  plan to address the identified weakness. OMB directs agencies to  develop plans of action and milestones (POA&Ms), which are intended to  help agencies act upon assessment findings. Similarly, FAA\u2019s acquisition  policies state that security controls should be assessed to ensure that  they provide the necessary security protection for each acquired system.  The FAA handbook that supplements the AMS provides detailed  guidance on managing POA&Ms in the event that the assessments  discover weaknesses.", "Authorize system to operate based on risk: In addition, FAA\u2019s AMS states  that systems must obtain security authorization approval prior to receiving  authorization to operate, which reflects NIST guidance that authorization  to deploy a system should only be granted after considering the risks.  NIST guidance states the authorizing officials should consider the results  of assessments, including POA&Ms, in their decisions. Similarly, the FAA  acquisition process requires that the authorizing official receive POA&Ms  to assist them in deciding if the system can be deployed. Moreover, the  AMS requires that systems be reauthorized at least every 3 years, and  the decision regarding whether or not the security risks are acceptable  must be reconsidered at that time. According to both NIST and FAA  policy, reauthorization may take place more frequently than every 3 years  if significant changes occur to the information system environment.", "Monitor security controls on ongoing basis: Last, NIST guidance states  that agencies should monitor the security controls on an ongoing basis  after deployment, including assessing controls\u2019 effectiveness and  reporting on the security state of the system. FAA\u2019s AMS states that the  security controls must be monitored after the system is deployed to  ensure that they operate as expected and provide the necessary  protection. Examples of FAA\u2019s continuous monitoring activities include  periodic scans of operational systems, patching vulnerabilities, and  updating the system\u2019s security plan.

According to NIST guidance,  these decisions must be justified and appropriately documented, such as  in a system security plan.   or deciding that controls identified by NIST  When SBSS was developed, FAA and its contractors selected controls  from NIST guidance. For example, they selected controls such as an  audit record of login attempts and automated mechanisms to alert  security personnel to malicious activity. As allowed by the NIST and FAA  guidance, SBSS determined that many controls were not applicable or  were already covered by existing common controls, such as policies and  procedures related to FAA security management activities. SBSS\u2019s initial  system-security plan accounted for the majority of moderate baseline  controls recommended at the time. However, it did not sufficiently  document the implementation details for some controls, including  contingency planning and incident response controls. For example, the  initial system security plan described the existing process that FAA used  to detect and respond to incidents affecting NAS systems. However, it did  not describe system-level requirements or procedures for incident  handling for SBSS. A few of these controls were associated with  weaknesses identified during the assessment process, indicating that  these controls should have received more consideration during the  selection process.

This lack of documentation  may have been due to limitations in FAA\u2019s system security-plan template  during that time period. While the template provided instruction that  enhancements were to be documented, it did not specifically identify them  in the same way that other controls were identified.

As for the  slightly more than 100 controls that were identified as out of scope at this  time, an FAA official explained that updates will be made as the program  matures and that more security controls may be added in the future as  deemed necessary.

Data Comm\u2019s contractor is required to follow the  third version of the guidelines, which was published in 2009, and updated  in 2010. NIST updates its guidelines to reflect new and emerging threats,  and issues new security controls to help agencies better protect their  systems. According to NIST, the most recent update was motivated by  the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of  adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such attacks, the technical competence  of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). According  to FAA, systems can incorporate new controls on an ad-hoc basis or by  modifying systems\u2019 contracts to reflect updated NIST guidance, and  NIST\u2019s most recent controls are reflected in FAA\u2019s updated templates and  guidance. However, FAA does not require that contracts be modified  within a particular time frame to reflect NIST revisions.", "Although the SBSS program asks the contractor to implement more  recent NIST controls on an ad-hoc basis, these actions are outside of the  contract\u2019s requirements and, according to program officials, must be paid  for separately. While ad-hoc additions may be sufficient in some cases,  SBSS has not yet implemented some of the controls that NIST  recommended in its 2010 revision, but plans to address these controls in  accordance with NIST\u2019s 2013 update as these are part of a large update.  SBSS officials explained that they did not previously have funding for an  update of such a large scope, but they requested and received funding  beginning in fiscal year 2015. According to program officials, these funds  will allow them to adopt the missing controls. An FAA official stated that  the SBSS program plans to adopt the most recent version of the NIST  standards in fiscal year 2016.

Specifically, FAA concurred with the  recommendation that it assess the potential cost and timetable for  developing an agency-wide threat model, and the recommendation that it  develop a plan to fund and implement NIST revisions within OMB  timeframes.", "With regard to the recommendation to incorporate the Office of Safety  into FAA\u2019s agency-wide approach by including it as a member on the  Cybersecurity Steering Committee, the Department believes that FAA has  already complied with the intent of the recommendation. According to the  Department, FAA has transferred cybersecurity personnel from the Office  of Safety to the Office of the Chief Information Officer, which manages  cybersecurity for all aviation safety information systems. The Department  also stated that FAA\u2019s Chief Information Office works closely with the  Office of Safety on certification standards for non-FAA information  systems operating within the National Airspace System. We agree that  these actions will help in the execution and coordination of cybersecurity  activities involving the Office of Safety. However, we maintain that in  addition to these actions, the Office of Safety should be a member of the  Cybersecurity Steering Committee, which, as the department notes in its  letter, was established to lead FAA\u2019s efforts to develop a comprehensive  cyber-risk management strategy, and to identify and correct both existing  and evolving vulnerabilities in all Internet protocol-based systems.  Because aircraft aviation systems are becoming increasingly connected  to systems outside the aircraft, the Office of Safety, which is responsible  for certifying aircraft systems, should be involved in agency-wide  cybersecurity efforts, including cybersecurity planning and vulnerability  identification, since such efforts may be crucial in conducting its  certification activities. As we state in the report, not including the Office of  Safety as a full member of the Committee could hinder FAA\u2019s efforts to  develop a coordinated, holistic, agency-wide approach to cybersecurity.  This lack of involvement could result in omitting an FAA stakeholder that  has an understanding of specific technological changes in aircraft  traversing the NAS environment and how these changes might intersect  with changing ATC technologies and cybersecurity needs.", "In its comments the Department stated that FAA is committed to  strengthening its capabilities to defend against new and evolving  cybersecurity threats. According to the Department, FAA is initiating a  comprehensive program to improve the cybersecurity defenses of the  NAS infrastructure, as well as other mission critical systems. The  Department\u2019s letter lists a number of actions FAA has taken to improve  cybersecurity, many of which are described in this report. We applaud  FAA\u2019s commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in the NAS, and agree  that the actions it has taken are important steps for FAA to take. We also  believe that addressing our recommendations will result in valuable  improvements to the information security of the NAS.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Department of Transportation  and the appropriate congressional committees.

We also selected a non-generalizable sample of 15  cybersecurity and aviation experts with varied experience\u2014some of  whom have knowledge of FAA\u2019s internal cybersecurity activities, policies,  and personnel. We then analyzed the information about FAA\u2019s  cybersecurity efforts, synthesized it, and produced a document that we  provided to the experts for their review. FAA concurred that the document  was accurate. We then interviewed the experts, collecting information on  the cybersecurity challenges they think FAA faces and will face in the  NextGen transition. Interviewees also commented, to the extent they  were able, on the extent to which FAA\u2019s cybersecurity activities and plans  address the identified challenges. We analyzed and synthesized these  responses, reporting on the numbers of experts who discussed particular  topics as well as the numbers of experts who agreed or disagreed on  particular messages. The experts from whom we obtained responses are  listed in table 1.", "Separately, we also obtained the views of several aviation industry  officials, including officials from the Airlines for America, Airports Council  International\u2014North America, Air Line Pilots Association, General  Aviation Manufacturers Association, Garmin, MITRE Corporation,National Air Traffic Controller Association, and the Boeing Corporation.  We also reviewed relevant reports issued by GAO, the Inspector General  of the Department of Transportation, and the National Academies.", "To assess the extent to which FAA and its contractors, in the acquisition  of NextGen programs, have followed federal guidelines for incorporating  cybersecurity controls, we compared pertinent FAA policies, procedures,  and practices with selected federal information security laws and federal  guidance, including standards and guidelines from the National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST). In particular, we compared FAA\u2019s  Acquisition Management System (AMS) against NIST\u2019s risk management  guidelines and information technology-security guidelines (800-37) and  security considerations in software development life cycle (800-64) to  determine if FAA\u2019s acquisition policy follows federal cybersecurity  guidelines for the six foundational NextGen programs: Surveillance and  Broadcast Services (SBSS); Collaborative Air Traffic Management  (CATM); Data Communications (Data Comm); NAS Voice Switch (NVS);  Common Support Service-Weather (CSS-Wx); and System Wide  Information Management (SWIM). The NextGen Foundational Programs  consist of different segments, also called builds; parts; and subsystems.  Some security activities take place at the program level, while others  apply to specific components of the program. We analyzed FAA\u2019s  program documentation of key cybersecurity activities as described by  NIST and interviewed system managers to determine if FAA completed  the activities or has plans to complete the activities that were started but  not fully completed.", "In addition, we chose two key NextGen acquisitions, SBSS and Data  Comm, for an in-depth review because of their importance to NextGen,  cost, and deployment status. SBSS has completed the acquisition cycle,  while Data Comm will allow for insight into how the process has changed  and what still might be an issue for upcoming programs. We assessed if  FAA had established and implemented a disciplined life-cycle  management approach integrated with information security by comparing  FAA\u2019s policies for system life-cycle management and cybersecurity to  NIST guidance on security risk management system acquisition. We also  compared documentation of project activities and plans to these  requirements, and interviewed officials about FAA\u2019s policies and FAA\u2019s  information security practices. We assessed how well FAA and  contractors completed key cybersecurity activities and the extent to which  they complied with AMS and NIST requirements relating to cybersecurity.  We also compared documentation of project activities and plans to these  requirements, and interviewed agency officials about FAA\u2019s policies and  information security practices. We also reviewed pertinent sections of  prior GAO reports related to cybersecurity. We performed our work at  FAA headquarters in Washington, D.C.; the Air Traffic Control Systems  Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia; and at an FAA contractor  location in Herndon, Virginia.", "We determined that information provided by the federal and nonfederal  entities, such as the type of information contained within FAA\u2019s security  assessments and Plans of Action and Milestones, was sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our review. To arrive at this assessment, we  corroborated the information by comparing the plans with statements from  relevant agency officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 through  March 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
