In October 2006, GAO reported that UN management reforms were progressing slowly and that many were still awaiting review by the General Assembly. For this review, GAO was asked to (1) determine the progress of UN management reform initiatives in five key areas--ethics, oversight, procurement, management operations of the Secretariat, and review of programs and activities (known as mandates)--and (2) identify factors that have slowed the pace of reform efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents relating to UN management reform and interviewed U.S. and UN officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The progress of UN management reform efforts has varied in the five areas that GAO reviewed--ethics, oversight, procurement, management operations of the Secretariat, and review of programs and activities (known as mandates). To determine the status of these reform efforts, GAO developed three categories of progress, defined as follows: (1) Little or no progress = Few or no steps have been taken; (2) Some progress = Some steps have been taken, while others remain; and (3) Substantial progress = The reform effort has been mostly or fully implemented. The ethics office has made substantial progress in staffing its office and implementing a whistleblower protection policy, as well as some progress in developing ethics standards and collecting and analyzing financial disclosure forms. Member states made some progress in improving oversight at the UN when they created an Independent Audit Advisory Committee, which is expected to be operational by January 2008. Additionally, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) improved the capacity of individual divisions, including internal audit and investigations. However, UN funding arrangements continue to constrain the independence of OIOS and its ability to audit high-risk areas. Some progress has been made in the area of procurement, such as developing a comprehensive training program for procurement staff. However, the UN has made little or no progress in establishing an independent bid protest system. Some progress has been made in reforming management operations of the UN Secretariat, such as improving human resource functions and information technology. In contrast, little or no progress has been made in reforming the UN's internal justice system for resolving and adjudicating staff grievances and safeguarding the rights of staff members, certain budgetary and financial management functions, and the delivery of certain services. Finally, despite some limited initial actions, the UN's review of programs and activities (known as mandates) has not advanced due in part to a lack of support by many member states. Various factors have slowed the pace of UN management reforms, and a number of reforms cannot move forward until these factors are addressed. Four key factors that have slowed the pace include (1) disagreements among member states on the priorities and importance of UN management reform efforts, (2) the lack of comprehensive implementation plans for some management reform proposals, (3) administrative policies and procedures that continue to complicate the process of implementing certain complex human resource initiatives, and (4) competing UN priorities, such as the proposal to reorganize the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, that limit the capacity of General Assembly members to address management reform issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation in 1945, the United Nations (UN) has undertaken various  management reform efforts, including a series of reforms in 1997 and 2002  that included proposed changes in human resources and budgeting  activities. However, several independent reports have found that serious  problems and inefficiencies in UN management persist. For example, the  2005 Independent Inquiry Committee\u2019s investigation of the UN\u2019s Oil for  Food program and the Gingrich-Mitchell task force review in June 2005  found fraud, corruption, mismanagement, and inadequate oversight in UN  procurement activities. Recently, in October 2007, the UN reported further  fraud and corruption in procurement activities, including 10 additional  cases in which over $25 million was misused or misappropriated. Given  the growth in complexity and significance of UN worldwide operations,  such reports underscore the immediate need to reform and modernize UN  management processes.", "In September 2005, heads of member states held a World Summit to  address, among other things, long-standing concerns about UN  management. The resolution approved by all member state representatives  at the summit\u2014known as the \u201coutcome document\u201d\u2014recognized the  urgent need to improve UN management processes and called on the  Secretary-General and General Assembly to propose and approve reforms  to strengthen the organization. As the largest financial contributor to the  UN, the United States has a strong interest in the progress of reform  initiatives and has advocated the need for comprehensive management  reform. We reported in October 2006 that UN management reforms were  progressing slowly and that many were still awaiting review by the  General Assembly. We also reported the UN had not developed  comprehensive implementation plans with associated time frames, cost  estimates, and potential savings. In response to your request, we (1)  determine the progress of UN management reform initiatives in five key  areas\u2014ethics, oversight, procurement, management operations of the  Secretariat, and review of programs and activities (known as mandates)\u2014 and (2) identify factors that have slowed the pace of these reform  initiatives. The reform efforts were implemented too recently for us to  evaluate their effectiveness.", "To assess the progress of specific UN management reform efforts within  each of the five areas we reviewed, we developed the following three  categories: little or no progress, some progress, and substantial progress.  However, we did not assign an overall level of progress to each of the five  reform areas because the various initiatives within each area are highly  diverse. During our review, we determined which category of progress to  assign to each reform effort based on documents we collected and  discussions we had with State Department, UN, and other officials. After  we had made our initial assessments of progress, three other GAO staff  members not involved in this review used the evidence and the categories  to make their own assessments independently of each other. These staff  members then met with each other to reconcile any differences in their  initial assessments. Finally, they met with us and confirmed that we were  all in agreement on our assessments. To address our objectives, we  reviewed documents proposing UN management reforms and interviewed  officials from several UN departments in New York. We reviewed reports  and bulletins published by the UN General Assembly and Secretariat,  relevant UN resolutions, and related budget documents. The majority of  the cost estimates for the proposed reform initiatives are preliminary, and  detailed cost estimates are being developed; therefore, we did not analyze  the assumptions underlying these estimates to determine whether they are  reasonable and reliable. We met with officials from the General Assembly  Office of the President, the Office of the Deputy Secretary-General, the  Department of Management, and the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (OIOS). We also met with representatives from 17 of 192 member states  from various geographic regions to obtain a balance of views on the most  critical challenges to reforming UN management. We discussed the status  of UN management reforms with officials from the Department of State in  Washington, D.C., and New York and the UN in New York.

In May 2000, we reported that while  the Secretary-General had substantially reorganized the Secretariat\u2019s  leadership and structure, he had not yet completed reforms in human  resource management and planning and budgeting. In September 2002, to  encourage the full implementation of the 1997 reforms, the Secretary- General released a second set of reform initiatives, some expanding on  those introduced in 1997 and others reflecting new priorities.

We found that UN funding arrangements constrained  the ability of the UN Secretariat\u2019s Office of Internal Oversight Services  (OIOS) to operate independently and direct resources toward high-risk  areas as needed. In addition, we found serious weaknesses in procurement  internal controls.

UN and Government Accountability Project staff told us  that some UN staff members might not trust the current system to be fair  or impartial and, consequently, might not come forward with claims of  retaliation. In its August 2007 annual activities report, the ethics office  expressed a concern that it had not had an opportunity to provide input  into its role in the proposed new internal justice system in relation to other  offices, such as OIOS and the Office of the Ombudsman, and the office  expressed the importance of its inclusion in the justice reform process.", "UN and State officials told us another concern about the whistleblower  protection policy is its lack of jurisdiction over UN funds and programs.  In August 2007, after initially reviewing a whistleblower retaliation case of  an employee at the UN Development Program, the ethics office and the  Office of Legal and Procurement Services concluded that the UN\u2019s  whistleblower protection policy applies only to employees directly under  the Secretary-General. They also concluded that the office has no formal  jurisdiction over various UN funds and programs, including the UN  Development Program. UN and State officials told us that the  whistleblower protection policy is limited in its effectiveness if it is not  applied to the entire UN system. Similarly, the Government Accountability  Project has criticized the effectiveness of the current UN whistleblower  protection policy and recommended that the jurisdiction of the ethics  office be extended to UN funds and programs and possibly to specialized  agencies.

For example, the United States and  several other countries had originally favored that candidates for  membership be referred by the International Organization of Supreme  Audit Institutions and that members not be eligible for re-election. Other  member states disagreed. In addition, State wanted IAAC to be responsible  for assessing the work of all UN oversight bodies, including the UN Board  of Auditors and the UN Joint Inspection Unit. However, both of these  bodies strongly resisted having IAAC oversee their respective functions,  and it was ultimately decided that IAAC would focus primarily on the  work of OIOS while taking into account the work plans of the other UN  oversight bodies.

OIOS argued that such a shift would  significantly diminish the UN\u2019s oversight functions by potentially  compromising the independence of investigations and creating a potential  conflict of interest. Since 2006, about 16 new posts have been created for  the investigations division. OIOS has established a separate special  investigations task force for sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as a  procurement investigations task force.", "Finally, OIOS has made progress in reducing its range of functions and  improving the capacity of its evaluations and inspections sections.

Without operational  independence, OIOS is constrained in its ability to prevent or mitigate  risks to the UN\u2019s resources and personnel. These risks include fraud,  waste, abuse, inefficiencies, and mismanagement. In April 2006, we  reported that UN funding arrangements adversely affect OIOS\u2019s budgetary  independence and constrain its ability to audit high-risk areas.

OIOS pointed out that serious deficiencies in internal controls  have left the UN susceptible to mismanagement and fraud, particularly  regarding procurement activities in Sudan and Congo. OIOS reported that  its internal audit division continues to rely directly on organizations  funded from extra-budgetary resources to provide the resources necessary  to finance a portion of its functions. This reliance does not allow the  division to focus its attention on the areas of highest risk and constrains  the implementation of its audit work plan.
