A 2008 congressional hearing by the Joint Economic Committee drew attention to some small market prescription drugs that had an extraordinary price increase--a price increase of 100 percent or more at a single point in time. GAO was asked to examine extraordinary price increases for brand-name prescription drugs. Specifically, GAO examined the: (1) frequency of extraordinary price increases for brand-name prescription drugs from 2000 to 2008, (2) characteristics of the brand-name prescription drugs that had extraordinary price increases, and (3) factors that contributed to the extraordinary price increases experienced by these brand-name prescription drugs. To determine the frequency and characteristics of the brand-name prescription drugs that experienced an extraordinary price increase, GAO reviewed drug pricing and other data from a pharmaceutical industry compendium. To illustrate the factors that may contribute to extraordinary price increases, GAO developed case studies of six brand-name prescription drugs identified from the analysis of drug pricing data. These brand-name prescription drugs were selected based on factors including price, and the percentage and number of price increases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 2000 to 2008, 416 brand-name drug products--different drug strengths and dosage forms of the same drug brands--had extraordinary price increases. These 416 brand-name drug products represented 321 different drug brands. The number of brand-name drug products that had these extraordinary price increases represents half of 1 percent of all brand-name drug products. The number of extraordinary price increases each year more than doubled from 2000 to 2008 and most of the extraordinary price increases ranged between 100 percent and 499 percent. Almost 90 percent of all brand-name drug products that had an extraordinary price increase sustained the new higher price--by either having another increase in price or remaining at the increased price. More than half of the brand-name drug products that had extraordinary price increases were in just three therapeutic classes--central nervous system, anti-infective, and cardiovascular. These therapeutic classes include drugs used to treat conditions such as fungal or viral infections, and heart disease. About half of the extraordinary price increases were for brand-name drug products that were purchased from drug manufacturers or wholesalers, repackaged, and resold in smaller packages to health care providers such as hospitals or physicians. However, some drug repackagers serve a niche in the drug market, and therefore may have a small share of the market in a therapeutic class. The majority of all extraordinary price increases were for drugs priced less than $25 per unit; however, a full course of treatment for some of these drugs could total several thousand dollars. Based on interviews with experts and industry representatives, a lack of therapeutically equivalent drugs--both generics and other brand-name drugs used to treat the same condition--and limited competition may contribute to extraordinary price increases. The limited availability of therapeutically equivalent drugs may result from patent protection and market exclusivity, and the size of the market for a given drug. Patent protection and market exclusivity temporarily limit competition and thereby allow a drug company to recoup research and development costs and earn a return on its financial investment. Two of six case study drugs that had extraordinary price increases were patented at the time of the extraordinary price increase. The transfer of the rights to a drug and corporate consolidations among drug companies may result in fewer drug options and contribute to extraordinary price increases, according to experts. For example, the rights to four of the case-study drugs were obtained by a new drug company, and two of these drugs had an extraordinary price increase shortly after the rights to the drugs were purchased. Finally, experts and industry representatives noted that unusual events--such as disruptions in production due to shortages of raw materials--and other factors, including manufacturing issues, may also contribute to some extraordinary price increases."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The growing cost of brand-name prescription drugs can be a burden on  patients, payers, and providers of health care\u2014particularly when price  increases are large and occur suddenly.

Red Book includes drug prices for each  package size (for example, 30, 60, or 100 tablets) and dosage form (for  example, tablet or injection) of a brand-name drug. We report the  frequency of extraordinary price increases in two ways\u2014by drug brand  (or drug label name as recorded in Red Book) and by brand-name drug  product. For the drug brand frequencies, we counted an extraordinary  price increase if the price of any version of a brand-name drug increased  by 100 percent or more at a single point in time. For brand-name drug  products, we counted each extraordinary price increase for each  version\u2014drug strength and dosage form\u2014of the brand-name drug  separately. For example, if both the 1mg and 5mg tablet versions of a drug had extraordinary price increases, we categorized this as one drug brand  increase, and as two brand-name drug product increases (one for each  version of the brand-name drug). The frequencies of extraordinary price  increases reported include brand-name drug products that were  repackaged for resale to health care providers such as hospitals or  physicians. To identify the characteristics of brand-  name drug products that had an extraordinary price increase, we used Red  Book data on therapeutic class and price.", "To identify the factors that may contribute to extraordinary price  increases, we interviewed drug policy experts; academic researchers; state  and federal government officials; consumer advocates; insurance company  representatives; and representatives from hospital, health insurance, and  retail pharmacy associations.

Each brand-name drug that was active in  the market as of December 31, 2008 and that had an extraordinary price  increase was eligible for selection for the case study. To achieve variability  in the characteristics of the brand-name drugs reviewed for the case study,  our selection was based on several factors, including a drug\u2019s price, the  level of the percentage increase, whether the drug had more than one  extraordinary price increase between 2000 and 2008, availability of the  drug from multiple sources, and permanence of the price increase. To gain  an understanding of the market and other dynamics leading to the  extraordinary price increase experienced by each brand-name drug in our  case studies, we interviewed representatives of the companies that  manufacture and distribute these brand-name drugs, and obtained  information about each drug company\u2019s business strategy from the  companies\u2019 Web sites, annual and quarterly reports, and other resources.

Repackagers may obtain prescription  drugs from wholesalers, and sell the repackaged drugs to health care  providers such as hospitals or physicians who then dispense them to  patients. Proponents of repackaged drugs believe that they offer  convenience to patients and may reduce medication errors.

Generally, market exclusivities prevent the FDA from approving any  application for a competing drug compound for a stated period of time.  These exclusivities may relate to new chemical entities (5 years),  previously approved drugs with a new application that is based on new  clinical studies (3 years), generic drugs (180 days), drugs tested for use  in children (6 months), and orphan drugs (7 years). Market exclusivity  and patent protection may run concurrently.", "The Joint Economic Committee hearing in July 2008 identified certain  brand-name drugs which treat rare diseases that experienced  extraordinary price increases. Incentives are available for drug companies  to develop innovative drugs for rare diseases (orphan drugs).

In the past, large drug companies conducted research and  development on several drugs, with the goal of releasing one or more  \u201cblockbuster\u201d drugs that treat a large population and can earn billions of  dollars. Recently, drug companies have increasingly focused on specialty  drugs that target niche markets, or a smaller population of people with a  narrow indication or medical condition. According to experts and industry  representatives, the pace of consolidation among drug companies through  mergers and acquisitions and transfers of drug ownership rights has  increased.

If a company raises the price of its goods,  consumers would likely purchase fewer goods, causing the company\u2019s  revenues to decline. However, health care providers influence demand  because they typically act on behalf of patients, who may remain unaware  of drug costs. If the patient is insured and their medical bills are paid by a  third-party payer, then demand may not be significantly influenced by  changes in price to the extent that it might be in other markets. Some price  restraint may be provided by pharmacy benefit managers and health plans  that use drug formularies to negotiate price rebates on brand name  prescription drugs.", "According to industry representatives and experts, drug companies may  consider several issues when setting the price of a drug. These include:   (1) the perceived value of a drug relative to its competitors, such as its  ease of use; (2) the unique characteristics of a drug, such as its novelty, the  frequency of administration, and safety; (3) the cost of therapeutically  alternative drugs and alternative therapies, such as surgery, medical  devices, and existing drugs; (4) the disease treated; (5) the size and  characteristics of the patient market; (6) research and development,  manufacturing, and marketing costs; (7) the willingness of customers to  pay for the drug; and (8) the amount of reimbursement for the drug from  third-party payers.

Companies are required to notify the FTC and DOJ of  certain pending mergers, also known as the pre-merger notification  program. In addition, the FTC has authority to investigate and take action  against unfair methods of competition affecting commerce, including in  the drug industry. Price fixing agreements between businesses, certain  monopolies, and other anticompetitive conduct are subject to review and  enforcement action. FTC officials indicated that the FTC has not brought a  case against a drug company for charging extraordinarily high prices  because such activity is not expressly prohibited by federal law, and  because high drug prices in the absence of anticompetitive behavior are  not per se illegal.

For example, a drug in our case study was purchased  from a drug company that was suspending production of the drug. The  company that purchased this drug reported investing millions of dollars  transferring and upgrading the manufacturing equipment, processes, and  testing methods required to make the drug. The drug\u2019s manufacturer  attributed the first of two extraordinary price increases to compensating  for the drug\u2019s production expenses and other costs. Prior to the company\u2019s  purchase of the drug, it was sold only in limited quantities through a  patient advocacy group. Another drug from our case study was  purchased by a company that spent several years trying to identify a  technical partner capable of processing the drug\u2019s active ingredient, which  was difficult to manufacture because of its cytotoxic nature and the  limited quantity of drugs produced. The company\u2019s representative stated  that due to the unique challenges of producing the active ingredient of the  drug, two companies were involved in manufacturing and packaging the  drug. As a result of changes made in manufacturing the drug, the company  reported investing several million dollars upgrading its manufacturing  equipment and processes in order to meet updated FDA regulations. This  company considered its investment to produce a stable supply of the drug  when pricing the product.", "Other Factors: Representatives of the drug companies we reviewed for our  case studies reported that they considered other factors when determining  the price of their drugs. For example, one expert noted that extraordinary  price increases may occur because a drug manufacturer updates the price  of a drug after obtaining new information about certain demand and  supply factors affecting the drug. Three of the drug companies reported  that their products were difficult to manufacture. These companies  employ third-party manufacturers that produce the drugs. One of these  companies said that its drug was very toxic, and since its manufacturing  equipment was used to make other drug products, the equipment must be  decontaminated after each batch is produced. These drug companies  factored in these additional costs when they raised the price of their  products.", "Some of the drug companies we reviewed revised the price of their brand- name drugs to bring them in line with the prices of what they regarded as  similar drugs. One company reviewed the estimated annual cost of several  orphan drugs when determining the price for its drug, which treats a rare  disease. Three companies reviewed various drug products and priced their  drugs in line with these drugs. This pricing strategy led, in part, to these  drugs experiencing an extraordinary price increase. An official from one of  these companies reported that the drug was underpriced, and the  company increased the price of the drug based on the prices of competing  drug products used for similar medical conditions. Some of the drug  companies considered the financial solvency of their drug product and  company, and their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders when  determining the price of their drug.", "In some cases, representatives of drug companies cited the quantity of free  or low-cost drugs donated through their patient assistance program and  the level of rebates paid to the Medicaid program as factors that they  considered when raising the price of their brand-name drugs. Two drug  companies said that the level of rebates paid to the Medicaid program was  a factor for their drugs\u2019 extraordinary price increases. The companies  reported that they charged a higher retail price for their drugs, in part, to  account for the large financial outlays to patient assistance and  government programs. One company said that Medicaid beneficiaries  represent a large portion of the patient population that uses their drug  product. This company\u2019s representatives stated that over half of its drug  sales were targeted to their patient assistance program for low-income,  underinsured, or uninsured individuals or were reimbursed under  Medicaid and therefore subject to rebates. These companies reported that  they offered patient assistance programs that provide a large volume of  free prescription drugs to patients who meet established criteria. The  programs also provide financial assistance to insured patients who face  financial hardship from paying copayments or coinsurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expert Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to drug policy experts, who provided  technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We calculated the percent change in unit AWP recorded  in the Red Book for each 11-digit national drug code (NDC-11). For  example, where a NDC-11 had three unit prices reported in Red Book from  2000 to 2008 (unit price at point 1, unit price at point 2, and unit price at  point 3), two data records were created. One record contained the percent  change in unit price from point 1 to point 2, and the other record  contained the percent change from point 2 to point 3. We identified  extraordinary price increases by selecting only records (NDC-11s) with a  percent change of 100 percent or more.", "Drugs sold in different package sizes\u2014for example, 30, 60, or 100 tablets\u2014 have different NDC-11 codes. Each NDC-11 record captures the label name  of the drug which includes the dosage form of the drug. Because a brand- name drug may have several NDC-11 codes for different package sizes, we  identified the number of brand-name drug products that had an  extraordinary price increase by their NDC-9 code, which represents the  manufacturer and drug name, and strength. Where more than one package  size of the same brand-name drug had an extraordinary price increase, we  selected the package size with the highest extraordinary price increase.  We counted an NDC-9 with different package sizes that had an  extraordinary price increase on the same date only once. In this report, we  use three terms to refer to the brand-name prescription drugs recorded in  the Red Book. Drug brand refers to the label name of a brand-name  prescription drug; brand-name drug product refers to the different  products of the same drug brand. Otherwise we use the term brand-name  drug or drug when we do not need to distinguish between drug brand and  brand-name drug product. We report the frequency of brand-name drugs  that had extraordinary price increases by (1) drug brand (drug label name  as recorded in Red Book), and (2) brand-name drug product (NDC-9  code). The frequencies of extraordinary price increases reported by brand- name drug products (NDC-9) include the same drug brand sold in different  strengths and dosage forms (e.g., a 1mg or a 5mg tablet). The frequency of  extraordinary price increases reported includes brand-name drug products  that were repackaged by a distributor for resale to health care providers.  (See app. II for a list of the brand-name drugs that had extraordinary price  increases.) To identify the characteristics of brand-name drugs that had an  extraordinary price increase, we used Red Book data on therapeutic class  and price.", "To identify the factors that may contribute to extraordinary price  increases we interviewed drug policy experts; academic researchers; state  and federal government officials; consumer advocates; insurance company  representatives; and hospital, health insurance, and retail pharmacy  associations representatives. To illustrate the factors that may contribute  to extraordinary price increases, we developed case studies of six drugs  from different companies identified from our analysis of Red Book data.  Each brand-name drug (NDC-11) was eligible for inclusion as a case study  if it was active in the market as of December 31, 2008, and had an  extraordinary price increase. To achieve variability in the characteristics  of the drugs reviewed for the case study, selection was based on several  factors, such as the (1) unit price, (2) percentage increase in price, (3) year  of increase, (4) number of increases, (5) availability from multiple sources,  (6) orphan drug status, and (7) permanence of the price increase.", "We also interviewed representatives of the companies that manufactured  and distributed the case study drugs about the market dynamics leading   to the drugs\u2019 extraordinary price increases. We gathered information on:  (1) the characteristics of each drug, such as its patent and market  exclusivity status, indication, volume, and utilization; (2) corporate  business and marketing strategy for each drug; (3) factors that influenced  the extraordinary price increase; and (4) agreements with the makers of  drugs in the same therapeutic class. Some information provided by the  representatives during these interviews is considered proprietary. As a  result, the names of the participating companies and brand-name drugs are  not identified. (See app. III for information on each of the drugs from the  case studies.) Information was also obtained from drug companies\u2019 Web  sites, annual and quarterly reports, and other resources.", "We systematically reviewed Red Book to assess its reliability. The review  involved an assessment of the frequencies of all numeric and date  variables in Red Book to identify incorrect and erroneous entries or  extreme outliers. We compared a sample of the pricing data for brand- name drugs that had extraordinary price increases reported in Red Book  with pricing data contained in another drug pricing compendium and  found a high degree of concurrence between the prices recorded in both  data sources. Based on this review, we determined that the data used in  our report were adequate for our purposes. We conducted our work from  October 2008 through December 2009 in accordance with all sections of  GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives.  The framework requires that we plan and perform our engagement to  obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives  and to discuss any limitations in our work.

AWP  records in Red Book are reported by the drug manufacturer and published  in Red Book. In some cases, when drug manufacturers do not report AWP,  Red Book calculates AWP from other drug pricing benchmarks provided  by drug manufacturers. GAO did not audit the drug pricing information  reported to Red Book by drug manufacturers nor the calculations  performed by Red Book to fill nonreported AWP data. Some of the drugs  on this list were repackaged, or nonrepackaged, while other drugs were  both repackaged and nonrepackaged. In a few cases, drugs were removed  from the list because changes in the recorded package size led to errors in  the calculated change in unit prices.
