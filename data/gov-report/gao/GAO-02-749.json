As the steward of  taxpayer dollars, the federal government is accountable for how its  agencies and grantees spend those funds and is responsible for  safeguarding those funds against improper payments.  As noted in the  reports we have issued on this matter over the past 3 years, the federal  government\u2019s record in identifying and reporting the magnitude of program  funds associated with improper payments and actions to better manage  these payments needs improvement.", "In our view, improper payments include payments that should not have  been made or were made for incorrect amounts.  Specifically, they include  inadvertent errors, such as duplicate payments and calculation errors;  payments for unsupported or inadequately supported claims; payments for  services not rendered or rendered to ineligible beneficiaries; and payments  resulting from fraud and abuse.  They occur in a variety of programs and  activities, including those related to contractors and contract management;  health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid; financial assistance  benefits, such as food stamps and housing subsidies; and tax refunds.   Improper payments result in spending taxpayer dollars for other than their  intended purposes, services to those not entitled to program benefits at the  expense of legitimate beneficiaries, or both.", "As we noted in our report on strategies to manage improper payments,  these payments occur for many reasons including insufficient oversight or  monitoring, inadequate eligibility controls, and automated system  deficiencies.  However, one point is clear\u2014the basic or root cause of  improper payments can typically be traced to a lack of or breakdown in  internal controls.  A lack of internal controls can result from factors  beyond an agency\u2019s control, such as statutory barriers and program design  issues, as well as factors within its control, such as ineffective program  procedures.  Collectively, internal controls are an integral component of an  organization\u2019s management that are intended to provide reasonable  assurance that the organization achieves its objectives of (1) effective and  efficient operations, (2) reliable financial reporting, and (3) compliance  with laws and regulations.  Internal controls are not one event, but a series  of actions and activities that occur throughout an entity\u2019s operations on an  ongoing basis.", "Because of your continued interest and concerns regarding financial  management in the federal government, you asked us to update certain  aspects of our 2000 report on improper payments.  Specifically, you  requested that we (1) quantify, where possible, the amount of improper  payments reported in agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2000 financial statements, (2)  assess the extent to which agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2002 performance plans  address improper payments, (3) determine the extent to which the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) has implemented the recommendations  made in our prior reports, and (4) identify other actions that might  encourage agencies to better report the extent of their improper payments.   On November 2, 2001, we reported that agency fiscal year 2000 financial  statements identified about $19.6 billion in improper payments, the first  item in your request.

In  addition, reports such as the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs\u2019  Government at the Brink and The President\u2019s Management Agenda,  Fiscal Year 2002, highlight the impact of improper payments on federal  programs and the need for actions to strengthen the system of internal  control over areas where improper payments occur.", "Our past reports have shown that relatively few agencies report improper  payments in their financial statements, even though our audits and those of  agency Offices of Inspector General (OIG) continue to identify serious  improper payment problems and related internal control issues.  Federal  agency financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 show improper  payments of about $20.7 billion and $19.6 billion, respectively.  Along with  this decrease in the total amount of improper payments reported, changes  have occurred in the agencies reporting improper payments and in the  programs identified with improper payments.", "During this same period, agency-specific audits and studies continued to  indicate that the extent of the improper payment problem was much more  widespread than had been disclosed in agency financial statements.  For  example, in March 2001 we reported that, during fiscal year 2000, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), relying on past experience, screened tax  returns claiming Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) to identify (for  detailed examination) those considered most likely to be invalid.  IRS  examiners performed detailed reviews of about 257,000 tax returns  claiming approximately $587 million in EITC and found that about 173,000  of those tax returns claiming $395 million in credits (67 percent) were  invalid.  At the Department of Defense (DOD) the OIG noted that, during  fiscal years 1999 and 2000, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS) overpaid contractors about $183 million and $148 million,  respectively, as a result of inadvertent errors, such as paying the same  invoice twice and data input errors.  None of these amounts show up in our  improper payment totals because neither the IRS nor DOD financial  statements reported improper payments for those programs for those  years.", "The basic or root causes of improper payments can typically be traced to a  lack of or breakdown in internal controls.

Under it, agencies were to  include, in their 2003 budget submissions to OMB, information on improper  payment rates, including actual and target rates, where available, for  benefit and assistance programs over $2 billion.  The agenda also notes  that, using this information, OMB will work with agencies to establish goals  to reduce improper payments identified in the programs.  In addition, the  agenda included specific program initiatives for HUD and the Department  of Education that addressed improper payments.  In July 2001, OMB issued  revisions to OMB Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget  Estimates, requiring 16 federal agencies to include certain improper  payment information for about 50 programs in their initial budget  submissions to OMB.

These letters asked the agency heads and OIGs to assess their  improper payment efforts in the five areas outlined in our October 2001  report, Strategies to Manage Improper Payments: Learning From Public  and Private Sector Organizations.  These areas are (1) the control  environment, (2) risk assessments, (3) control activities, (4) information  and communications, and (5) monitoring.", "We also selected four CFO Act agencies (USDA, HHS, HUD, and SSA) for  more detailed review of their efforts to reduce improper payments.   These  agencies accounted for over 97 percent of the improper payments reported  in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 financial statements.  At these agencies, we  spoke to officials in the inspector general, chief financial officer, and  program offices and obtained reports and other documentation evidencing  actions that they have taken or are planning to take to reduce improper  payments.  We focused on obtaining information on the agency actions to  reduce the improper payments reported in their financial statements and/or  performance plans.  We also obtained information on barriers that they  encountered when attempting to develop and/or implement methodologies  to reduce improper payments.", "Finally, we met with OMB officials and reviewed documents regarding  OMB\u2019s progress in implementing recommendations made in our prior  report.

For example, federal agency  financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2001 show improper  payments of about $20.7 billion, $19.6 billion, and $19.1 billion, respectively.   Although significant, these amounts are not indicative of the magnitude of  improper payments governmentwide.  Currently, relatively few agencies  report improper payments in their financial statements, even though our  audits and those of agency OIGs continue to identify serious improper  payment problems and related internal control issues.

About $18.8 billion (99 percent) of the improper payments reported in the  fiscal year 2001 financial statements occurred in the programs  administered by HHS, HUD, and SSA.

For  fiscal year 2001, FNS did not publicly issue separate financial  statements.  While USDA\u2019s financial statements contained FNS\u2019s  financial information and recognized that improper payments occurred  in the food stamp program, the statements did not identify a specific  improper payment amount.", "HUD reported improper payments of $1.25 billion in fiscal year 2000 and  $2 billion in fiscal year 2001.  Specifically, in fiscal year 2000 it estimated  $1.94 billion in annual housing subsidy overpayments and $.69 billion in  underpayments.  In fiscal year 2001, it reported overpayments of $2.65  billion and underpayments of about $.65 billion.  In commenting on this  report, HUD noted that, in fiscal year 2000, it also identified $617 million  in improper payments due to underreporting of tenant income.  We do  not include this amount in the HUD total in table 1 because HUD\u2019s fiscal  year 2000 financial statement notes that the $1.25 billion and $617  million \u201cshould not be considered totally additive.\u201d  An unknown  amount of overlap exists in these amounts.  Regarding the increase in  improper payments reported since fiscal year 1999, HUD revised its  methodology for measuring the types of errors that make up its  improper payments estimate.  In fiscal year 2000, it expanded the scope  of its error estimation to include subsidy determination errors by its  administrative intermediaries in addition to the impacts of tenant  underreporting of income.  In fiscal year 2001, it refined its methodology  to obtain a combined estimate of both types of errors.  More specifically,  HUD\u2019s error measurement methodology covers errors made by public  housing authorities, owners, and agents (POAs) in determining tenant  income and rent as well as errors made by the tenants in reporting their  income.  Past estimates only considered the impact of tenants  underreporting income for amounts over $3,000 and used a sample of  tenants from HUD\u2019s data systems.  However, the fiscal year 2001  estimate was based on more stringent criteria.  It considered tenant  underreported income for amounts over $1,000 and was based on a  random selection of all tenants, including those who were not covered  in the past.", "At the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the fiscal years 1999 and  2000 financial statements identified improper payment amounts for the  retirement, federal employees\u2019 health benefits, and federal employees\u2019  group life programs.

For example, historically, the  IRS\u2019s EITC program has been vulnerable to high rates of invalid claims.   IRS follows up on only a portion of the suspicious EITC claims it identifies.   The amount of improper payments included in the almost $26 billion IRS  disbursed for EITC in fiscal year 2001 is unknown.  However, based on an  IRS report of the estimated $31.3 billion in EITC claims made by taxpayers  for tax year 1999, an estimated $8.5 billion to $9.9 billion (27 percent to  about 32 percent) should not have been paid.  Weaknesses in IRS\u2019s  controls over refund disbursements, particularly those related to EITC,  continue to expose the federal government to material losses due to  disbursing improper refunds.", "Similarly, while DOD reported improper payments related to the Military  Retirement Fund for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, departmentwide  estimates of improper payments remain unreported in the financial  statements.  For example, over the last several years DOD has overpaid its  contractors by hundreds of millions of dollars.  Specifically, according to  DFAS Columbus (the largest centralized DFAS disbursing activity) records,  in fiscal year 2001 DOD contractors refunded about $128 million primarily  attributed to DFAS payment errors and duplicate invoices.  This amount  might not reflect total improper payments DOD made to contractors  because contract reconciliation is likely to identify additional  overpayments.  Further, although small in relation to the approximately $78  billion that DFAS Columbus disbursed in fiscal year 2001 to DOD  contractors, this amount represents a sizable amount of cash in the hands  of contractors beyond what is intended to finance and pay for the goods  and services DOD purchases, and is indicative of the need for stronger  internal controls within the payment system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Information on Improper Payments or on Progress in Reducing Them Is Publicly Available", "paragraphs": ["Periodically and consistently estimating the rate and/or amount of  improper payments and publicly reporting progress enables agencies and  others with oversight and monitoring responsibilities to measure progress  over time and determine whether further action is needed to minimize  future improper payments.

Improper payment  information is currently reported in a variety of places, including annual  financial statements, performance plans, and the budget.  However, neither  the financial statements, as previously discussed; the performance plans;  nor the budget provide a comprehensive view of either the scope of the  improper payment problem or of individual agency or governmentwide  efforts to reduce it.

They provide information on the purpose and effectiveness of  federal programs and on the resources spent in conducting them.  On  February 14, 2001, the Director of OMB issued a memorandum to agency  heads requiring agencies to update their fiscal year 2002 performance plans  to include performance goals for the President\u2019s governmentwide reforms  for every reform that would significantly enhance the administration and  operation of the agency.  One of these reforms is reducing improper  payments to beneficiaries and other recipients of government funds.  We  did not determine the level of significance of improper payments at any  agency.  However, as a result of the memorandum, we expected improper  payment-related actions to have been discussed in agencies\u2019 fiscal year  2002 performance plans, at least for those agencies required to report  improper payment information in their initial budget submissions to OMB.   We reviewed the plans for improper payment-related issues.  In general, our  review revealed that none of the 15 performance plans examined contained  detailed information for all of the areas that GPRA requires agencies to  address\u2014goals, measures, strategies, or procedures to validate  performance data\u2014for each reform discussed in the performance plan.   Only 4 of the plans comprehensively addressed any of the four areas in  their improper payments discussion.", "Table 2 summarizes our evaluation of the extent to which the annual  performance plans contained improper payment-related discussions for the  four areas GPRA requires to be addressed\u2014goals, measures, strategies,  and procedures to validate performance data\u2014for the 15 CFO Act agencies  required by OMB Circular A-11 to report improper payment information in  their initial budget submissions.  This evaluation was based on the  performance plan assessments contained in the separate agency reports  that we issued last year.  (Appendix III lists these reports.)  We considered  an agency to have comprehensively addressed goals, measures, strategies,  and procedures to validate performance data if our report did not reveal  any weaknesses for how the performance plan addressed each of those  elements for improper payment-related issues.", "We found that, although 10 of the 15 agencies discussed improper  payments in their fiscal year 2002 performance plans, none  comprehensively addressed improper payments for all four of the plan  elements required by GPRA.  Furthermore, only 4 of the 15 agencies  comprehensively addressed improper payments for any of the GPRA- required elements.  In addition, six performance plans discussed at least  one of the elements but not comprehensively.  That is, the reports  acknowledged improper payments and cited some information regarding  one or more of the elements, but that information was not adequate to use  as a basis for evaluating agency actions or progress in addressing improper  payment problems.  Further, four plans made no reference to improper  payments.", "Our key outcomes reports noted the following examples of weaknesses in  agency performance plans.", "Within HHS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  had adequate procedures to validate performance data, but the  strategies needed to achieve its improper payment goals were not  adequately addressed and these goals were not consistently measurable.   In some instances, the plan stated generally that the accomplishment of  a goal was the target and did not explain, in sufficient detail, CMS\u2019s  strategies to ensure that the goal is accomplished.  In others, progress  was difficult to measure because of continual goal changes that were  sometimes hard to track or that were made without sufficient  explanation.  Specifically, in both the fiscal years 2001 and 2002  performance plans, goals were dropped, revised or subsumed into other  goals, or goals were added for the Medicare program integrity outcome.   While refinements may be desirable as efforts become more mature, the  inability to track individual initiatives makes it difficult to measure  progress in achieving outcomes.  Furthermore, because many of the  baselines and measures for the new and revised goals were under  development, CMS\u2019s intended performance regarding them was unclear.", "IRS\u2019s EITC program under Treasury has historically been vulnerable to  high rates of improper refunds\u2014paying billions of dollars for improper  EITC claims.  Treasury\u2019s performance plan did not report on  performance measures for any aspect of IRS\u2019s administration of the  EITC, and IRS lacked performance measures for the program.   Therefore, we are unable to assess progress toward achieving less  waste, fraud, and error in the program.  The performance plan noted  that, in 1998, IRS began implementing a 5-year EITC compliance  initiative that involved several components directed at the major  sources of EITC noncompliance.  While IRS is collecting data on the  initiative\u2019s results, the data are not yet sufficient to determine whether  the initiative has reduced the overall noncompliance rate.", "SSA\u2019s annual performance plan includes several goals and performance  measures targeted specifically at increasing program integrity and  reducing fraud and abuse.  Yet the performance plan was not clear about  SSA\u2019s progress in meeting these goals because of continued revisions to  prior indicators and goals as well as SSA\u2019s inability to provide timely  performance data.", "Since the conclusion of our fieldwork, some agencies have issued their  annual performance plans for fiscal year 2003.  Some of those plans may  have addressed improper payments more thoroughly.  In future work, we  plan to review these plans for information on improper payments and  compare fiscal years 2002 and 2003 performance plans for consistency and  to assess the progress reported in achieving improper payment-related  outcomes and strategies.", "Although no specific requirement exists for public reporting on improper  payment-related activities at the agency level, the administration has  recognized the importance of reducing governmentwide improper  payments.  The President\u2019s Management Agenda, Fiscal Year 2002,  discusses the reduction of improper payments as a key element under its  initiative to improve financial performance within the government.  As a  result of this initiative, OMB revised its Circular A-11 to incorporate needed  efforts to address improper payments within 16 selected federal agencies  and about 50 programs within those agencies.  Section 57.3 requires the  selected agencies to include specific improper payment-related  information in their fiscal year 2003 initial budget submissions to OMB.   More specifically, the circular states that agencies that currently estimate  improper payment rates for the programs identified are required to submit  the following data:  estimated improper payment rates projected for fiscal year 2001;   actual improper payment rates for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, if   target rates (goals) for improper payments for fiscal years 2002 and   causes of improper payments;  variances from targets or goals that were established; and   descriptions and assessments of the current methods for measuring the  rate of improper payments, and of the quality of data resulting from  these methods.", "The circular also requires each of these agencies to submit an assessment  of the effectiveness of current agency efforts to minimize improper  payments as well as an action plan that includes  additional actions the agency could take to prevent and correct   an evaluation of the costs and benefits of implementing these corrective   a description of programmatic and legal considerations, and   an assessment of the extent to which undertaking these actions would  hinder the achievement of major program objectives.", "For programs administered by states or other organizations for which  agencies are not currently estimating improper payment rates, the circular  requires each agency to submit an analysis of whether and how improper  payments could be estimated and of the costs and benefits of collecting  new or additional data.  In preparing their responses, agencies were told to  consider programmatic and legal obstacles to collecting additional data or  establishing estimation procedures.  Both the circular and the President\u2019s  Management Agenda, Fiscal Year 2002, note that OMB plans to review the  information provided and coordinate with each agency to develop detailed  action plans on a program-by-program basis.", "Furthermore, in August 2001, OMB distributed a memorandum to agency  CFOs and budget officers containing supplemental guidance on submitting  the improper payment information required by OMB Circular A-11.  Among  other things, it identified eight basic principles all federal agencies should  recognize to minimize improper payments.  The principles are   prevention is more effective than after-the-fact efforts,   program payment integrity is a joint management responsibility,   improper payments should be kept to the lowest practical level,    payments should be balanced with program goals and other competing   controls should take into account both the benefits and costs,   performance measurement and reporting provide better accountability,   data verification strengthens program payment integrity, and   impediments to effective controls may exist and should be considered.", "The discussion of one of these principles\u2014performance measurement and  reporting provides better accountability\u2014further notes that \u201cPublic  reporting of progress enhances accountability.  Agency performance can be  reported in a variety of places, including reporting under the Government  Performance and Results Act, annual financial reports, or regularly-issued  stand-alone program reports.\u201d   The memorandum also requires  documentation to support any conclusion that estimating improper  payments is unnecessary or would not be cost-beneficial because the  program is not susceptible to significant improper payments, has strong  internal controls to prevent improper payments, or has not experienced an  improper payment problem, or that the burden outweighs the benefit to be  gained by developing estimates.  OMB is currently analyzing the  submissions and revising the requirements based on feedback from  agencies.", "In addition, other OMB initiatives include (1) working with the Congress on  legislation to improve agency access to data for data sharing and drafting  related agency guidance, (2) refining the OMB Circular A-11 guidance on  reporting improper payment activity, (3) funding improper payment  activities in the budget, (4) establishing electronic government Web sites  including GovBenefits\u2014which should improve the up-front accuracy of  benefit determinations, and (5) assessing quarterly executive branch  management scorecards to track how well agencies are executing the  President\u2019s management initiatives.", "These actions are appropriate for tracking and managing progress in this  area.  Unfortunately, the vehicle being used to assemble these data inhibits  public disclosure of the information.  OMB Circular A-11 requires selected  programs and agencies to submit improper payment data with their initial  fiscal year 2003 budget submissions but Section 36 of the circular prohibits  the submissions from being publicly disclosed.  Therefore, we reviewed the  Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2003, to determine  the improper payment information it contained.  Since OMB incorporates  the individual agencies\u2019 budget requests into the budget and since the  administration has made the reduction of improper payments a priority, we  expected to find some improper payment information in the budget.  Our  review showed minimal discussion of improper payments as compared to  the detailed information OMB Circular A-11 requires agencies to provide in  their initial budget submissions.  For example, even though OMB Circular  A-11 requires 15 CFO Act agencies to provide improper payment  information on about 50 programs, the budget shows  actual improper payment rates for fiscal year 2000 for 2 programs\u2014food   target error rates for food stamps and Supplemental Security Income,  types and causes of improper payments for the Department of  Education\u2019s Student Financial Aid Program and HHS\u2019s Medicare and  Medicaid programs, and   a description of additional actions 6 agencies could take to prevent or  correct improper payments for 8 programs.", "Furthermore, the Budget did not contain information for any agency for  several areas cited in OMB Circular A-11, including an analysis and  description of whether and how improper payments could be estimated, an  analysis of the costs and benefits of collecting new or additional data, and  obstacles to collecting additional data or establishing estimation  procedures.", "Given the fact that the agency financial statements, fiscal year 2002  performance plans, and the budget contained little substantive information  on improper payments, we attempted to locate other data that might offer  added insights into agency efforts.  One source was agency responses to  June 2001 congressional requests to agency heads and OIGs for  information on agency efforts to control improper payments.  The requests,  from the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee  on Governmental Affairs, asked for specific information about the five  components of internal control\u2014control environment, risk assessment,  control activities, information and communication, and monitoring\u2014 outlined in our report that addressed strategies to manage improper  payments.", "The congressional requesters received responses from either the agency  head, the IG, or both for 9 agencies.  Specifically, we found that, for the 15  CFO Act agencies required to report improper payment information under  OMB Circular A-11, 9 agency heads and 8 OIGs responded to the  congressional request.   For 6 of the agencies, neither the agency head nor  the OIG responded.  Of those that did respond, 5 agency heads and 2 OIGs  addressed all of the internal control components, as requested, as  demonstrated in the following examples.", "The responses of the Secretary and OIG of HUD show, among other  things, how HUD (1) promoted an environment of accountability to  reduce improper payments by establishing the Rental Housing Integrity  Improvement Project (RHIIP) to help ensure that the \u201cright benefits go  to the right person,\u201d (2) estimated its improper payments in the past and  is now implementing plans for a more comprehensive error  measurement process, and (3) reduced the risk of improper payments  by implementing new rent calculation systems and performing data  matches with IRS and SSA data.", "The Secretary of HHS\u2019s response showed how the agency (1) addressed  the control environment through numerous oversight and program  integrity activities, (2) computed an error rate for Medicare fee-for- service claims and determined the cause of these improper payments,  (3) established a GPRA goal to reduce the percentage of improper  payments made under the Medicare fee-for-service program, (4) worked  on a methodology to measure improper payments for the Medicare  Managed Care and Medicaid programs, (5) assisted medical providers in  submitting claims correctly,  and (6) developed statistical analyses to  stem fraud, waste, and abuse.", "The Acting Commissioner of SSA explained how SSA (1) created a  culture of accountability through the day-to-day operation of its  compliance program, (2) estimated payment errors through stewardship  reviews, (3) detected and deterred improper payments through a series  of system enhancements, (4) collected improper payments by using  various methods such as credit bureaus and the Treasury offset  program, and (5) established payment accuracy goals and methods to  track progress as part of its annual performance plan.", "We expected agencies to have accurate and timely information available to  respond to the congressional request since, in February 2001, OMB had  asked these agencies to address their improper payment issues in their  fiscal year 2002 performance plans.  However, for the most part, the  responses provide only partial answers showing that, while the agencies  agreed that managing improper payments is important, they lacked  comprehensive strategies to do so.  For example, one agency answered all  of the questions, yet indicated that it did not know the aggregate amount of  improper payments made on a departmentwide level and that the most  recent estimate of improper payments for one of its high-risk programs was  from 1997.  Another agency stated that it has not performed a risk  assessment and has no formal process to estimate or track improper  payments because it has an inherent culture of high standards, operating  efficiency, sophisticated systems, and personal attention to detail, which  results in few improper payments.  A third agency could not provide  substantive answers to the request.  Rather, it stated that while audits have  recommended improving internal controls, it does not believe they  disclosed an unacceptable level of risk.  This agency did not estimate the  amount of its improper payments or provide details of any related risk  assessments.", "The Congress and the administration have clearly indicated that agencies  should consider the reduction of improper payments a top priority.  Despite  this focus, little improper payment information is publicly available.  Public  disclosure provides information against which agency efforts to reduce  improper payments can be measured and evaluated.

In establishing a sound control environment, agency  management recognizes that personnel throughout the organization make  internal controls work and, therefore, human capital issues must be  seriously considered in all changes to the system of internal control.", "As noted in our report on strategies to manage improper payments,  changes in the control environment may require actions by both the  Congress and agency officials.  These actions can include enacting  legislation, setting and maintaining the ethical tone, delegating roles and  responsibilities, and implementing human capital initiatives.", "Legislative and management actions that affected the control environment  over improper payments occurred at each of the agencies.  Legislative  actions involved passing laws that revised program operations and called  for various prevention and detection methodologies and periodic reporting  on the status of agency improvement efforts.", "For example, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000   authorizes additional resources to assist the Risk Management Agency\u2019s  (RMA) Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) in identifying  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in its programs;   helps FCIC collect bad debts by imposing severe penalties and interest  and offsetting future benefit payments for those who willfully and  intentionally provide false or inaccurate information with respect to a  policy or plan of insurance; and   requires RMA\u2019s Office of Risk Compliance to use data mining, data  warehousing, and data reconciliation to identify potential improper  payments and provides up to $23 million in funding for these efforts  through fiscal year 2005.", "Two legislative reforms have helped the HHS\u2019s CMS enhance Medicare\u2019s  anti-fraud and abuse activities.  First, the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 established the Medicare Integrity Program,  which provides CMS with levels of funding for Medicare program safeguard  activities such as audits of cost reports and medical prepayment claim  reviews.  In the cost report area alone, CMS reported $570 million and $493  million in improper payments for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, respectively.   In addition, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided CMS with increased  authority to keep health care providers who have been convicted of health  care related crimes out of the Medicare program, exclude providers who  abuse the program, and impose monetary penalties on such providers.", "At SSA, the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 helped strengthen  program integrity by  authorizing SSA to conduct matches with Medicare data and simplify  procedures to gain access to recipient records from financial  institutions to help verify Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  recipients\u2019 financial eligibility;   authorizing SSA to prohibit individuals who provide false or misleading  eligibility information from collecting Old Age and Survivors Insurance  (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) and SSI cash benefits;  making a representative payee\u2014a person authorized to receive benefit  payments for a qualified individual\u2014liable for OASI and DI or SSI  overpayments caused by payments made to deceased beneficiaries; and   authorizing SSA to use all available debt collection authorities to  recover SSI debt.", "Equally, if not more important, an effective control environment requires  management\u2019s commitment to reduce improper payments.  Agency  management can affect the control environment by, among other things,  setting expectations and goals for reducing improper payments,  implementing program-specific measures to reduce fraud and errors,  calling for periodic performance reporting, and requiring follow-up actions  based on performance results.", "For example, USDA\u2019s FNS administers the food stamp program under  which state welfare agencies certify eligibility and provide benefits to  households.  Although not reported in USDA\u2019s financial statements, FNS  identified about $976 million in food stamp program overpayments for  fiscal year 2001.  FNS strives to increase the accuracy of eligibility  determinations and benefit computations and also oversees the level of  benefits issued.  Its food stamp Quality Control System (QC) measures the  accuracy of eligibility determinations and benefit computations and then  publicly reports each state\u2019s overissuance rate.  FNS reviews these data to  identify areas needing corrective action and practices that are effective in  improving payment accuracy.", "USDA management also encourages state agencies to minimize improper  payments by offering financial incentives for those with high payment  accuracy and imposing sanctions on those with payment overissuance  rates above the national average.  In fiscal year 2000, FNS imposed $46  million in financial sanctions on 18 states with overissuance rates above  the national average.  At the same time, it provided $55 million in  supplementary funding to 11 states with payment overissuance rates equal  to or below 5.9 percent\u2014a rate well below the national average of about 8.9  percent.  These actions have resulted in a decline in state payment error  rates from 10.7 percent in fiscal year 1998 to 9.9 percent in fiscal year 1999,  to 8.9 percent for fiscal year 2000.  However, FNS and OMB officials believe  that the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 will likely reduce  the number of states sanctioned in future years, as only those with  persistently high rates of improper benefit and eligibility determinations  (those exceeding 105 percent of the national performance measure for 2 or  more consecutive fiscal years) would be penalized.", "SSA management demonstrated its commitment to reduce improper  payments in its 1997 strategic plan, Keeping the Promise.

The two most recent reviews estimated  overpayments of $1.1 billion and $976 million in fiscal years 2000 and 2001,  respectively.  These reviews provided more detailed information about the  causes of the improper payments.  For example, the report of fiscal year  2000 payments found that about 56 percent of the overpayments and  underpayments in the food stamp program occurred when state food stamp  workers made mistakes such as misapplying complex food stamp rules in  calculating benefits.  The remaining 44 percent of the errors occurred  because participants, either inadvertently or deliberately, did not provide  accurate information to state food stamp offices.", "HHS measures improper payments within the Medicare fee-for-service  program and estimated improper payments in this program of $11.9 billion  and $12.1 billion for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, respectively.

However, we cannot conclude  that these error rate differences are statistically significant.  As reported in  the OIG fiscal year 2001 Medicare fee-for-service payments review, \u201cThe  decrease this year may be due to sampling variability; that is, selecting  different claims with different dollar values and errors will inevitably  produce a different estimate of improper payments.\u201d", "CMS has initiated projects to improve the precision of Medicare fee-for- service improper payment estimates and aid in the development of  corrective actions to reduce improper payment losses.  In fiscal year 2001,  CMS implemented a provider compliance rate to measure the  appropriateness of claims submitted prior to payments.  In addition, CMS  developed a comprehensive error testing program that will produce  contractor-, provider-, and benefit-specific error rates.

HUD has taken several actions to identify the risks associated  with these programs and is working to further refine the procedures  currently used to obtain more useful assessment information.  In one  example, HUD analyzed risk designed to measure postpayment accuracy.   An annual study of rent calculation errors estimated the extent, severity,  costs, and sources of rent errors for the Public Housing and Section 8  programs.  The study, which relied on the integrity of the data supplied by  the tenants and third-party income verification sources, matched  independent determinations of tenants\u2019 incomes, rents, and subsidies to  those made by local public housing agencies (PHAs) and Section 8 staff to  identify incorrect rental calculations due to administrative and  mathematical errors.  The study results, issued in June 2001, reported  tenant rental underpayments of approximately $1.7 billion annually (an  average of $95 per household) in 34 percent of households and tenant  rental overpayments of over $600 million annually (an average of $56 per  household) in 22 percent of households.  HUD used the study results to  strengthen its procedures for ensuring administrative compliance with  regulations.", "In another study, HUD developed an approach to identify differences  between tenant federal income tax data and the income tenants reported to  HUD by using a large-scale computer matching income verification  process.

Aside from minimizing  overpayments, preventing improper payments increases public confidence  in the administration of benefit programs and avoids the difficulties  associated with the \u201cpay and chase\u201d aspects of recovering improper  payments.  However, since some overpayments are inevitable, agencies  also need to adopt effective detection techniques to quickly identify and  recover them.  Detection activities play a significant role not only in  identifying improper payments, but also in providing data on why these  payments were made and, in turn, highlighting areas that need  strengthened prevention controls.  The agencies in our study used many  different prevention and detection control activities to manage improper  payments.  The nature of these activities ranged from sophisticated  computer analyses of beneficiary and program participant data using data  sharing and computer-editing techniques to on-site verification of claim  information.", "Data sharing allows entities to compare information from different sources  to identify inconsistencies and thus help ensure that payments are  appropriate.  For example, data matches of social security numbers and  other data can help determine whether beneficiaries are inappropriately  receiving payments at more than one address.  For government agencies,  data sharing can be particularly useful in confirming initial or continuing  eligibility of participants in benefit programs and in identifying improper  payments that have already been made.", "Of the four agencies included in our review, SSA is the most active in the  data sharing arena.

RMA\u2019s crop insurance program uses a variety of  computer-generated edit checks to ensure valid program requirements are  met.  These edit checks include ensuring that the liability was not increased  at the time of loss, the cause of loss was insurable according to policy  language, and the insurance company applied appropriate calculations to  determine the loss payment.  In addition, RMA matches each producer\u2019s  social security and employer identification numbers with the agent and loss  adjuster to ensure that the producers have not been debarred from  participating in the crop insurance program.  Once information is accepted  through the above edit processes, RMA loads it into databases where it is  subject to further audit and review.", "The computerized data sharing and data mining efforts discussed in this  report help identify improper payments by providing more useful and  timely access to information.

Educational activities for both beneficiaries  and other program participants help reduce improper payments and  strengthen program operations.  Complex program regulations can be  confusing to both agency personnel and beneficiaries and thus can  potentially contribute to improper payments.  The better educated agency  employees, contractors, and beneficiaries are about what is expected of  them and the consequences of not meeting those expectations, the greater  the chances for reducing fraud and errors in the payment process.

However, they  stated that the Internal Revenue Code and the Privacy Act of 1974 have  prevented or made it difficult for HUD to obtain this information and have  limited how HUD can use it.  Specifically, HUD officials noted that the  agency can only disclose federal tax data to the tenants and not to the  POAs\u2014the entities that determine monthly housing benefits based, in part,  on income information.  When HUD identifies discrepancies, it sends  letters to the tenants notifying them of the discrepancies and directing  them to submit revised income information to their respective POAs.  At  the same time, HUD notifies the POAs that discrepancies exist between the  income in HUD\u2019s tenant databases and federal tax data for specific tenants,  but it is prohibited from identifying the specific amounts in question.  HUD  then requests that the POAs resolve the unspecified discrepancies and  report the resolution to HUD.", "Data currency is also a factor.  HUD receives taxpayer income data in  September for the previous year and, by then, many of the beneficiaries  were either no longer working, had changed jobs, or had moved.  While  more timely data are available, legislation prevents HUD from using it.  For  example, the HHS Office of Child Support Enforcement maintains the  National Directory of New Hires containing employee wage data that is  updated quarterly, versus the IRS data that is updated annually.   However,  Section 453 of the Social Security Act limits use of the data to those entities  listed in the act, and HUD is not one of those entities.", "Some improper payments are inevitable because agencies are not  permitted to stop or adjust payments until the due process hearing or  appeals processes are completed.  For example, SSA disburses SSI  payments to recipients at the beginning of the month based on the income  and asset levels recipients expect to maintain during the month.  Some  government programs pay benefits in advance under the assumption that  the beneficiary\u2019s circumstances, such as income and asset levels, will  remain the same during the period for which payment was rendered.  If  SSA initially determines that an overpayment occurred, court decisions  and language in the Social Security Act allow individuals to continue  receiving the same amount of SSI and DI benefits pending the results of a  hearing to determine eligibility.  If the initial determination is affirmed, the  payments made during the hearing and appeals processes are considered  overpayments, which SSA may recover using a variety of means.", "USDA\u2019s FNS faces a similar situation.  FNS officials stated that the Privacy  Act of 1974 has several disclosure prohibitions, access and amendment  provisions, and record-keeping requirements that hinder its efforts to share  information with other federal agencies and with state agencies.  The  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 amended the  Privacy Act of 1974 to add procedural requirements for agencies to follow  when conducting computer matching.  For example, agencies must provide  matching subjects with opportunities to receive notice and to refute  adverse information before having a benefit denied or terminated.   Agencies must establish data protection boards to oversee the data  matching activities.  Exceptions to the disclosure requirements are  possible but require a series of due process steps designed to validate the  debt and offer the individual an opportunity to repay it.

As such, federal agencies must  depend on state, county, and local officials and other entities to ensure that  eligibility requirements are met and that benefit amounts are determined  correctly.  Further, these third-party organizations that manage federal  programs often have little incentive to ensure that the right amounts go to  the right individuals.", "Medicaid is the primary source of health care for 34 million enrollees, or  about 12 percent of the U.S. population.  In fiscal year 2000, federal and  state Medicaid outlays totaled $207 billion\u2014of which $119 billion  represented federal expenses.  Medicaid legislation provides states with a  variety of options for program administration.  They can elect to administer  the program at the state or county level, and they can operate fee-for- service programs, managed care programs, or some combination of the  two.  States may also elect to operate their claims-processing systems  directly or contract with private vendors.  The variety and complexity of  the state Medicaid programs provide challenges for federal oversight.    CMS assists interested states in developing methodologies and conducting  pilot studies to measure and ultimately reduce improper payments.   However, according to CMS officials, only a limited number of states are  interested in participating in these studies since they believe that  measuring improper payments could lead to penalties against states based  on their error rates.

Through  the appropriations process, it has the opportunity to review recent  expenditures in detail.  Specifically, the Congress can use its appropriations  authority to assist agencies in setting financial priorities that support  identifying, reducing, and collecting improper payments.  For example, the  SSA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget proposes $1.05 billion for ensuring that only  those who remain disabled continue receiving benefits and for assessing  whether SSI recipients continue to meet the financial eligibility  requirements.  In considering this budget request, the Congress can help set  priorities and expectations for specific program outcomes.", "The Congress also reviews the actions taken and regulations formulated by  departments and agencies to make certain that program officials execute  laws according to congressional intent.  Therefore, it can determine  whether the public\u2019s needs are adequately served by federal programs, and  thus lead corrective action through legislation or administrative changes.

However, as  evidenced by the actions taken by USDA, HUD, HHS, and SSA, federal  agencies can perform them and these actions can result in reductions in  improper payment rates.  Determining payment error rates is important to  ensure program integrity.  In addition, the administration and the Congress  have taken important steps to address improper payments.  For example,  the President\u2019s Management Agenda, Fiscal Year 2002, and OMB\u2019s  revisions to Circular A-11 demonstrate the administration\u2019s interest in and  plans to address improper payments across the government.  Both  documents call for OMB to work with agencies to establish goals and  action plans to reduce improper payments.  The agenda and the revisions  to the circular are important first steps.  The administration must now take  all necessary actions to ensure that federal agencies meet the requirements  set forth in those documents.    In addition, through legislation, the  Congress has provided resources for anti-fraud and abuse activities and  agencies with the authority to impose penalties and take actions to keep  dishonest recipients from further program participation.  Legislative  initiatives such as these are critical to governmentwide actions to reduce  improper payments and demonstrate that the Congress is willing to take  actions to address improper payments.  As stated in the Budget of the  United States Government, Year 2003, \u201cThe Administration cannot  improve the federal government\u2019s performance and accountability on its  own.  It is a shared responsibility that must involve the Congress.\u201d", "Few agencies publicly report improper payment information such as  improper payment rates, causes, and strategies for better managing their  programs to reduce or eliminate these payments.  This is evidenced by the  fact that publicly available documents such as annual agency financial  statements and the performance plans required by GPRA contain minimal  information on the extent of improper payments, the actions taken by  agencies to address them, and the impact or results of those actions on  improper payment levels.  OMB Circular A-11 requires that 16 agencies  report improper payment information, including error rates and target  rates for improvement, but that information is not publicly reported and,  therefore, the Congress, the public, and others with oversight and  monitoring interests cannot use this information to hold agencies  accountable for achieving target rates or otherwise implementing  specifically planned actions.", "On a case-by-case basis, agencies\u2019 abilities to control improper payments  can be hindered by legislative, program design, and resource barriers.   These barriers can hamper the design and implementation of actions to  prevent, detect, and mitigate improper payments.  Reducing or eliminating  some of these barriers may not be feasible without legislative or program  design changes that could significantly alter federal program missions or  the methods used to achieve the program goals and objectives established  by the Congress and the administration.  Yet it must be recognized that,  barring actions in these areas, these barriers will continue to restrict an  agency\u2019s ability to address all of its improper payment problems.", "As we noted in our report on strategies for managing improper payments,  significant progress in minimizing improper payments can only occur as a  collaborative governmentwide effort.  The government\u2019s reduction of  improper payments will only be achieved as a result of the design,  development, and implementation of better internal controls.  These efforts  will require strong support and active involvement from agency  management, the administration, and the Congress.  Once committed to a  plan of action, all parties must remain involved and committed to the end  goals and their support must be transparent to all.
