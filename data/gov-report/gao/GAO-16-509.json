For example, OMB and the PIC changed the CAP goal governance structure to include agency leaders, and holds regular senior-level reviews on CAP goal progress. They also provide ongoing assistance to CAP goal teams, such as by helping teams develop milestones and performance measures. Based in part on prior GAO recommendations, OMB and the PIC updated its guidance to assist CAP goal teams in managing the goals and in meeting GPRAMA reporting requirements. CAP goal teams told GAO that the CAP goal designation increased leadership attention and improved interagency collaboration on these issues.", "GAO's assessment of the selected CAP goals' quarterly progress updates\u2014published on Performance.gov\u2014determined that CAP goal teams are meeting a number of GPRAMA reporting requirements, including identifying contributors, reporting strategies for performance improvement and quarterly results.

Further, all of the selected CAP goal teams reported that they are working to develop performance measures, and are at various stages of the process. However, the selected CAP goal teams were not consistently reporting on their efforts to develop performance measures. Given OMB, the PIC, and CAP goal teams' emphasis on developing measures that are relevant and well-defined, greater transparency is needed to track goal team's efforts on a quarterly basis.

Effectively managing  these government-wide efforts requires coordination between multiple  federal agencies and transparent communications to the Congress and  decision makers about progress toward achieving results. Further, to  ensure that the federal government is achieving its crosscutting goals,  both top leaders and agency managers must have accurate and reliable  performance information to monitor and track the progress they are  making on achieving their goals.

We assessed the updates against 13 reporting  requirements\u20146 that we determined were relevant at the CAP goal level,  and 7 that we determined were relevant at the sub-goal level. To fully  meet each requirement, the quarterly progress update had to provide all  information required by GPRAMA, either for the overall CAP goal or for  each sub-goal, as appropriate. For those requirements analyzed at the  sub-goal level, we determined a goal had partially met a requirement if  the required information was present in the quarterly progress update for  at least one of the goal\u2019s sub-goals. For requirements that were not met,  we determined the required information was not present in the quarterly  progress update.

We issued reports in 2012 and 2014, evaluating  implementation challenges faced during the interim CAP goal period. In  May 2012, we reported that the interim CAP goals did not leverage all  relevant parties, and therefore important opportunities for achieving these  goals may have been missed. OMB responded by identifying and  including additional relevant departments, agencies, and programs for the  interim CAP goals. In June 2014, we identified a number of reporting and  accountability gaps with the interim CAP goals. Specifically, we found  that some goals did not report on progress towards a planned level of  performance because the goals lacked either a quantitative target or the  data needed to track progress. We also found that quarterly progress  updates published on Performance.gov listed planned activities and  milestones contributing to each goal, but some did not include relevant  information, including time frames for the completion of specific actions  and the status of ongoing efforts. We concluded that the incomplete  information in the updates provided a limited basis for ensuring  accountability for the achievement of targets and milestones. As a result,  we made seven recommendations to OMB and the PIC to improve the  reporting of performance information for CAP goals and quarterly  progress reviews. OMB responded to these recommendations by  updating its guidance to CAP goal teams to address the reporting and  accountability gaps we identified.

Specifically, OMB developed updated guidance and a new  reporting template for CAP goal teams that provide a consistent reporting  format across all goal teams, and helps goal teams meet GPRAMA  reporting requirements. According to OMB staff managing the CAP goals,  this revised reporting structure and template is intended to promote  engagement from goal leaders, facilitate performance monitoring, ensure  transparency of the CAP goal initiative, and provide a framework for CAP  goal teams to articulate cross-agency goals using milestones and  measures. The template outlines information that GPRAMA requires goal  teams to report on Performance.gov, such as goal leaders; contributing  agencies, organizations, and programs; performance measures and  targets; key milestones; and plans to address government-wide  management challenges. The updated guidance directs CAP goal teams  to include additional performance information\u2014not required by  GPRAMA\u2014in their quarterly progress updates, such as the status of  milestones, associated time frames for their completion, performance  indicators (or measures) under development, and an organizational chart  depicting the goal\u2019s governance team.", "According to the seven CAP goal teams we spoke with and OMB staff,  the quarterly progress updates provide useful information for goal leaders  to track progress over time and to make timely management decisions  that affect goal implementation. PIC guidance states that the update  should provide succinct, high-level information that is understandable to  all involved in implementation (i.e., program staff to senior leaders). OMB  staff managing the CAP goals told us that the quarterly progress updates  summarize the progress made on each CAP goal. They added that, at  this point in the goal period, reviewing the milestone status for each CAP  goal is the best way to determine whether goals are at risk or sufficient  progress is being made quarterly. For example, the Lab-to-Market CAP  goal leader in the Department of Energy told us that the progress updates  enables the goal team to track progress on activities that support and  expand technology between the national laboratories and the private  sector. The goal leader also told us the quarterly reports are useful to  implementation teams because they reinforce the need to coordinate  across agency lines, and drive discussion about what can be done to  achieve goals and milestones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Developed Strategies to Build CAP Goal Teams\u2019 Capacity for Goal Implementation", "paragraphs": ["OMB and the PIC have also implemented strategies to build agency  capacity to work across agency lines.

According to OMB staff, this new  governance structure reflects agency leadership and expertise in CAP  goal subject areas, more effectively leverages agency resources for  crosscutting efforts, and promotes greater coordination across  multiple agencies. For example, Science, Technology, Engineering  and Mathematics (STEM) Education CAP goal team staff from the  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) told us that they  found contributing agencies to be more receptive to directives and  efforts for implementing the CAP goal because they come jointly from  the National Science Foundation (NSF) and are not solely based on  OSTP\u2019s policy perspective. They also told us that NSF\u2019s leadership of  CAP goal activities and its ability to secure agency buy-in, among  other things, makes it an effective CAP goal leader.", "Provide ongoing guidance and assistance to CAP goal teams.", "The seven CAP goal teams we spoke with told us that OMB and the  PIC staff are available regularly to provide them with ongoing support,  such as assisting with the regular collection of performance data,  leading seminars to develop useful milestones and priority actions,  and improving teams\u2019 ability to track and report progress. The PIC  plans to continue to assist teams with tracking their progress and  ensuring accountability across the goals, including supporting the  quality and completeness of the regular quarterly progress updates  through Performance.gov. For example, in August 2014, PIC staff met  with the STEM Education CAP goal team to assist it in developing  milestones and performance measures and to define actionable next  steps. The STEM Education CAP goal leader from NSF told us the  assistance provided by the PIC helped the goal team improve its  implementation plan and develop relevant performance measures.", "Holding senior-level reviews. Another way OMB and the PIC are  increasing leadership attention of CAP goal implementation is by  committing to hold regularly scheduled senior-level meetings to review  CAP goal progress. OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management leads  implementation-focused meetings for the eight management CAP  goals approximately three times a year, and OMB\u2019s Deputy Director  for Budget leads meetings to review the seven mission-focused CAP  goals as necessary. According to OMB, as of March 2016, it held the  senior-level review meetings for all 15 CAP goals as planned.", "Obtained a means of funding cross-agency CAP goal activities.", "As part of the fiscal year 2016 consolidated appropriations act,  Congress provided authority for the heads of executive departments  and agencies, with OMB approval, to transfer up to $15 million for  purposes of improving coordination, reducing duplication, and other  activities related to the implementation of the CAP goals. OMB staff  told us that they proposed this means of funding crosscutting activities  in response to lessons learned from the interim CAP goal process,  feedback from agencies, and our work on enhancing collaboration in  interagency groups. Table 1 lists the fiscal year 2016 interagency  transfers for selected CAP goals. For example, OMB reported that the  Lab-to-Market CAP goal team would use $1.9 million of transferred  funds to develop an interface for all 17 DOE national laboratories to  directly interact with external stakeholders, such as the investment  community, and allow the public to access specific capabilities across  the national laboratory network.", "Launched a government-wide White House Leadership  Development Program. OMB staff told us that leadership fellows  were selected and assigned to one of the CAP goal teams and other  cross-agency initiatives to expose emerging agency leaders to cross- agency issues and address the need for strong leadership on the CAP  goals, while leveraging existing resources.

CAP goal teams  we spoke with told us that the increased focus on CAP goal  implementation enabled CAP goal teams to request and receive agency  resources that helped sustain progress toward goals. For example, the  Smarter IT Delivery CAP goal team worked with OPM to obtain a new  hiring authority for digital service experts to assist with production of  information technology and digital services. As of December 2015, five  agencies and OMB reported hiring digital service experts. Goal team  staff told us that obtaining the hiring authority was a direct result of the  CAP goal.", "According to OMB and PIC staff, the CAP goal process is a management  tool to encourage interagency collaboration. OMB staff told us that they  selected CAP goals, in part, that would focus on implementation  challenges that could benefit from greater collaboration between multiple  agencies. According to OMB staff, some CAP goal efforts are relatively  new and agencies do not have much experience working together,  whereas other CAP goal issues have long-standing relationships and  interagency mechanisms in place. All of the CAP goal teams described  approaches they are using to work across agency lines. For example,  CAP goal teams established formal interagency groups, used information- sharing tools to communicate, and developed standardized guidance.", "Leveraging expertise across agencies. CAP goal teams report that  they are working with pre-existing interagency working groups or  establishing new working groups or communities of practice to  leverage expertise and experience across agencies. For example, the  Customer Service CAP goal team established an interagency  Community of Practice (COP) which meets monthly to share practices  and provide feedback to CAP goal leadership. For example, the goal  team reports that a group within the COP led the development of a  draft customer service toolkit, which includes customer service  principles and a model for gauging program-level progress toward  those principles. Likewise, the Open Data CAP goal team established  the Interagency Open Data Working Group, which includes the 24  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and smaller entities  government-wide. The group meets biweekly and its members  represent a diverse range of levels of employees, such as IT  contractors and chief data officers. According to the goal team, the  establishment of this working group is the best outcome from the CAP  goal so far. The group shares best practices, allows agencies to learn  from other agencies that may be farther along, and shares tools. For  example, the goal team told us that it hosted a series of webinars on  Data.gov explaining a new method to convert data from common  format to machine readable. The goal team told us that this process  was a challenge for agencies, but through the webinars and the  working group, every agency now knows how to produce machine- readable documents, and is currently validating their processes.", "Developing common reporting framework. The Job-Creating  Investment goal team told us that the CAP goal designation has  helped the Department of Commerce (Commerce) headquarters staff  to engage with overseas staff and better leverage their resources and  data. For example, the CAP goal team told us that they launched an  interagency effort between State and Commerce to provide training  and update guidance to U.S. overseas staff on standardized methods  and procedures for reporting information on their activities to attract  foreign direct investment. Overseas staff are now submitting updates  that reflect Commerce\u2019s activities abroad. The goal team reported that  it now holds quarterly reviews, in part, to ensure the data is being  collected and reported consistently by staff from multiple agencies  and programs.", "Outreach to the public and nonfederal stakeholders. The Open  Data CAP goal team reported a number of White House-sponsored  events to encourage public participation in using government data and  to elicit feedback on Open Data CAP goal efforts. For example, the  goal team reported that agencies hosted Open Data Roundtables to  highlight success stories and get feedback from its stakeholders,  including nonfederal data users.

The  STEM Education goal team also partially met this requirement by  reporting a 1 percent quarterly target increase in the number of views,  downloads, and international downloads of a June 2015 webinar focused  on implementing evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM  instruction. OMB and PIC staff told us that they would like to work  toward requiring quarterly targets, as appropriate, going forward.  However, they also noted it may not be possible or appropriate for a goal  to have a quantitative quarterly target, as relevant data may not be  available quarterly, particularly for new initiatives. In such a case, a  qualitative target might be more appropriate. CAP goal teams we spoke  with expressed similar concerns and told us that they are instead relying  on milestones to track progress quarterly. For example, the People and  Culture CAP goal team relies on results from the Federal Employee  Viewpoint Survey to measure progress on employee engagement efforts.  Since the survey is administered annually, the goal team reports annual  targets for this measure. The Lab-to-Market CAP goal team told us that  its goal to accelerate and improve the transfer of new technologies from  the laboratory to the commercial marketplace can take years and is not  measured quarterly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action 4: Use Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["The fourth action related to goal implementation involves using  performance information during regular progress reviews to assess if  major actions and contributors are collectively achieving the desired  results.

The other three CAP goals did not meet this requirement because they  either did not have measures in place, or did not have performance  measures that assess contributions by agencies or programs responsible  for implementing the goal. For example, some of the measures for these  goals are focused on an outcome or output that is external to the  government, such as number of STEM degrees as a performance  measure for the STEM Education CAP goal.
