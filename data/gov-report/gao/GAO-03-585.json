Their contributions totaled over $200 million from 1997-2001 and were an important supplement to federal appropriations. These organizations also have additional assets totaling about $200 million, which could become available for future donation to the parks. The primary revenue-generating activities of cooperating associations are selling educational materials in park bookstores and providing educational services to park visitors. In contrast, friends groups generally rely on donations and membership dues to generate revenue. Accordingly, only cooperating associations directly compete with concessioners or other local for-profit businesses. In some parks, the sales and services provided by cooperating associations have caused conflicts between park management, the associations, and concessioners. There are three major factors that contribute to conflicts between associations and concessioners: (1) Park Service policies encourage an expanding reliance on nonprofit organizations; (2) the broad discretion local park managers have in deciding the role and scope of association activities has permitted expanded sales and service activities by cooperating associations; and (3) the agency has a financial incentive to use cooperating associations because they provide a higher return on sales revenue. To minimize conflicts and better ensure that park managers consistently apply agency policies in making decisions about whether and how to use cooperating associations and concessioners, Park Service guidelines call for individual park managers to develop \"Commercial Services Plans.\" However, these plans are rarely developed or used. In addition, even though one of the agency's key goals is to increase its reliance on partnerships with nonprofit organizations, the Park Service does not have a process for holding local park managers accountable for meeting contribution goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The needs of America\u2019s parks are not met with federal dollars alone.  Although the national parks are primarily a public responsibility, parks  have benefited for many years from other sources of support. In particular,  individuals, corporations, and nonprofit organizations have donated time  and money to enhance the U.S. National Park Service\u2019s mission of  promoting and protecting the parks.", "Because federal funding for the Park Service has not kept pace with such  needs as visitor services and maintenance requirements, the Congress and  the Park Service are seeking expanded funding from other sources. One  such source, the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, allows parks  to charge and retain visitor recreation fees. Similarly, the Park Service is  attempting to increase the support it receives from nonprofit organizations  and for-profit businesses\u2014concessioners\u2014that provide merchandise and  services to park visitors under Park Service contracts. To help accomplish  this objective, the Park Service has established agencywide and park- specific plans and goals that encourage local park managers to work with  these organizations to increase the donations and services provided by  nonprofits as well as the fees paid to the Park Service by concessioners.  Some concessioners are concerned that these park initiatives are resulting  in nonprofit organizations expanding into sales and services that have  traditionally been provided by concessioners.", "In this context, you asked us several questions about the scope and roles of  the two most common types of nonprofit organizations that work with the  parks: cooperating associations and friends groups. Cooperating  associations support parks by providing educational services to park  visitors largely through sales and information assistance at bookstores.  Friends groups support park operations by raising funds for specific park  projects such as construction and maintenance projects. In addition, both  cooperating associations and friends groups provide volunteer services  such as maintaining trails and painting historic structures. As agreed with  your office, we are reporting on (1) the number of national park units  supported by cooperating associations and friends groups and the amount  of contributions these groups made to the parks, (2) the revenue- generating activities of cooperating associations and friends groups and the  extent to which these activities compete with park concessioners, (3)  factors that contribute to competition and potential conflicts between  nonprofits and concessioners, and (4) how local park managers are held  accountable for meeting agency goals for nonprofit financial contributions.  In addition, you asked that we cite the specific statutory authorities for  nonprofit operations in national parks.", "Our work involved the development of an original database that is based in  part on a GAO survey of friends group organizations working with parks  throughout the system. We obtained financial information on about two- thirds of the friends groups queried, including all of those with annual  revenue over $25,000 that were required to file tax reports. Among other  things, the database we compiled includes the name, location, park  affiliation, and contribution amounts of every cooperating association and  each friends group that responded. To help determine if, and how,  nonprofit organizations compete with for-profit businesses serving park  visitors, we visited six parks that have partnerships with such  organizations. These parks were selected based on the scale of their  nonprofit and concession operations and, in two cases, because of known  concessioner concerns about the activities of nonprofit organizations in  those parks. Details of the scope and methodology of our review are  presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The National Park System is a network of natural, historic, and cultural  treasures. The system\u2019s 385 park units include 56 areas that are formally  titled \u201cnational parks,\u201d as well as many other designations. As the  network\u2019s federal manager, the National Park Service is charged with  conserving \u201cthe scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild  life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner  and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of  future generations.\u201d In short, the agency has the difficult task of balancing  resource protection with providing for appropriate public use, including  meeting the needs of nearly 300 million park visitors each year\u2014 responsibilities that entail considerable management and financial  challenges.", "To manage this diverse system, the 385 park units are arranged within  seven regional offices. These offices offer administrative or specialized  support not always available at the local parks. However, the true hub of  the system\u2019s management is the park superintendent. Superintendents  oversee each park unit, and the agency relies heavily on their judgment for  most decisions affecting local park operations. For financial support, the  Park Service depends primarily upon federal funding. The agency\u2019s fiscal  2003 annual appropriation totaled over $2 billion, supplemented by  financial support from admission and user fees collected at park sites,  franchise fees paid by over 600 park concessioners, and private donations.  Nonetheless, federal funding has not kept pace with increasing  responsibilities. Accordingly, the Park Service has launched several  initiatives seeking expanded supplemental support, including one  promoting increased partnering with nonprofit and other private  organizations.", "Nonprofit organizations have a long history of partnering with the Park  Service. Since the agency was created in 1916, the Park Service has  developed partnerships with nonprofit organizations, as well as for-profit  concessioners, to help serve its mission. These partners supply important  financial and nonfinancial assistance, in effect, supplementing  congressionally appropriated funds available for park use. The Park  Service is authorized by statute to accept donations and to enter into  agreements with nonprofit organizations and other fundraising partners.", "The two types of nonprofit partners discussed in this report are  cooperating associations and friends groups. Cooperating associations are  corporate entities with boards of directors and an executive director  responsible for day-to-day management. The Park Service requires that  cooperating associations operate as tax-exempt organizations and  employs a standardized cooperating association agreement identifying the  specific federal statutes (see app. II) and agency policies that govern  agency and association responsibilities. There is no specific legal definition  or federal statute for friends groups; most are local volunteers organized  for a specific purpose or interest in a particular park. The Park Service  does not require friends groups to operate as tax-exempt entities or to have  formal partnership agreements with the agency, unless these groups raise  funds for the parks. Moreover, the Park Service does not have a standard  agreement governing friends group operations or specific policy guidance  for friends groups. Guidelines for park fund-raising activities are the  primary source of park policy covering friends group activities. Although  other nonprofit organizations also provide services and conduct  commercial activities, such as guided hiking and rafting trips at park sites,  these organizations are not included in this review.", "Park concessioners are a third type of Park Service partner discussed in  this report. Concessioners provide such services as lodging, food, and  guided services, and sell merchandise at park stores. Generally,  concessioners are private, for-profit entities. Concessioners operate under  Park Service contracts or permits that require them to pay a franchise fee  to the park where they operate and that specify agency oversight functions  and concessioner responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parks\u2019 Reliance on Nonprofits Is Substantial and Increasing", "paragraphs": ["Cooperating associations and friends groups support 90 percent of the  nation\u2019s 385 national parks.

In addition, cooperating  associations and friends groups have accumulated funds and other  assets\u2014such as land, buildings, and equipment\u2014worth more than  $200 million that could become available for future park donations.

As a result, we constructed a database using existing Park  Service data, tax records that are available on nonprofit organizations, and  friends group responses to a GAO survey. Appendix III lists each national  park that is affiliated with a cooperating association and/or friends group.", "Since 2001, an estimated 215 nonprofit groups\u201466 cooperating  associations and 149 friends groups\u2014have worked with 347 parks across  the country. Cooperating associations often serve multiple parks while  friends groups are typically associated with a single park. Table 2 shows  the number of each type of organization and the number of parks served.", "Moreover, much of the support provided by nonprofit organizations is  concentrated in a few large cooperating associations that serve many  different parks. As table 3 shows, 5 cooperating associations serve about  58 percent of all 385 national parks, or 70 percent\u2014225 of 323\u2014of all parks  served by cooperating associations.", "One of the key characteristics of these large cooperating associations that  serve multiple parks is that they have the ability to serve smaller, less  visited park units that might not be able to otherwise provide bookstores or  educational services. For example, Eastern National operates some  bookstores as an educational service to visitors even though the stores are  not profitable. Eastern National can do so because it operates at 127 parks  and shares money from its more profitable locations with its less profitable  locations. This shared donation approach allows the association to operate  bookstores at small locations like the Charles Pinckney National Historic  Site (29,272 visitors in 2001) that are not as commercially viable as other  parks. On average, as table 4 shows, the five large cooperating associations  operate in parks with lower visitation and operating budgets than other  associations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonprofit Financial Contributions Have Dramatically Increased", "paragraphs": ["Nonprofit contributions to the park system doubled from fiscal years 1997  through 2000, before dropping in 2001. Specifically, as table 5 shows, the  total contributions by cooperating associations and those friends groups  for which we were able to obtain data rose from about $27 million in 1997  to about $53 million in 2000, before dropping to about $47 million in 2001.  Cumulatively, these contributions are substantial. Cooperating associations  and friends groups contributed over $200 million to support park programs  and projects from 1997 through 2001. Table 5 also shows that revenues  from both types of nonprofit organizations followed a pattern similar to  that of contributions, increasing from about $110 million in 1997 to about  $178 million in 2000, but dropping to $148 million in 2001. The decrease in  contributions and revenues in 2001 may be related to decreased park  visitation or other negative commercial effects following the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, as agency officials speculate, or to the  general economic downturn and corresponding reduction in charitable  giving that has occurred across the United States.  In addition, during the  1997-2001 fiscal year period, the Golden Gate National Parks Association  made large contributions.  These varied considerably from year to year  and help explain the fluctuation in cooperating association contributions  (see app. IV).", "Although contributions and revenues from both cooperating associations  and friends groups increased considerably over the 5-year period, the  increase in friends group contributions and revenues is most dramatic. This  increase may be explained by recent increases in the number of friends  groups as well as by the relative newness of friends groups compared to  cooperating associations. According to Park Service data, the number of  cooperating associations changed little from 1996 to 2001, rising from 64 to  66 and then dropping to 65 as 2 associations merged. In contrast, friends  groups are recent additions to the park scene and are expanding more  rapidly throughout the park system. While the Park Service does not have  historical data on friends groups, in the six parks we visited the years of  incorporation for friends groups operating in these parks generally ranged  from 1988 to 2001, with only one dating to 1959. By comparison, the years  of incorporation for cooperating associations ranged from 1923 to 1961  (see table 6). Moreover, while the median date of incorporation for  associations also is 1941, the median incorporation date for the friends  groups is 1995. Contributing to the establishment of new friends groups is  recent legislation that directed the National Park Foundation to design a  program fostering fund-raising at individual park units and specified that  program implementation include assisting in the creation of local nonprofit  groups.", "The importance of nonprofit support varied considerably across parks. For  example, Golden Gate NP received over $10 million in aid in fiscal year  2001, the highest contribution by a cooperating association that year, while  Voyageurs NP received $3,233 from its cooperating association, the lowest  financial contribution to a park that year. Similarly, one friends groups  affiliated with the Statue of Liberty NM contributed over $8 million to the  park, while 34 friends groups reported zero financial contributions to their  affiliated parks in fiscal year 2001.

According to tax data for 2001, friends groups  retained over 60 percent of these accumulated assets. More precisely, the  net assets of friends groups totaled $125 million in 2001, according to data  collected for over two-thirds of the groups, including the largest friends  groups (see app. V). In comparison, net assets held by cooperating  associations, according to 2001 tax data, were $78 million (see app. IV).  These assets represent the accumulated monetary assets (such as cash,  stocks, or bond investments) and nonmonetary assets (such as land,  buildings, and equipment) of the organizations. The monetary component  of these assets often consists of restricted and unrestricted accounts.  Restricted accounts typically represent funds that have been earmarked for  specific future projects, such as a park construction project or an  endowment to fund future maintenance costs of a capital project.  Unrestricted accounts usually represent funds that are currently available  for any expenses related to a park project. For example, the friends group  associated with Acadia NP has net assets of about $14 million, including  $13 million in restricted accounts for 2001. The funds in the restricted  accounts are for such things as an endowment to fund future maintenance  of the carriage road in Acadia NP and an endowment to support future  Acadia Youth Conservation Corps activities in the park. Further,  information we obtained based on available tax records from 1998 through  2000 indicates that friends groups are adding substantial amounts to their  accumulated assets each year.

Nonprofit members of both  cooperating associations and friends groups recruit and organize  volunteers for park projects and promote support for parks in local  communities. Some friends groups, such as the Appalachian Trail  Conference, make little if any direct financial contributions but have a  substantial volunteer base engaged in volunteer stewardship programs at  the parks. The Appalachian Trail Conference reported that its  4,500 volunteers contributed 187,475 hours to trail work in fiscal year 2000.  The exact number of volunteers for all park-affiliated nonprofit  organizations is not known. However, many groups have thousands of  members and volunteers. Of these, the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island  Foundation, Inc., is the largest friends group donor within the national park  system and has close to 160,000 members; other groups responding to our  friends group survey averaged 3,700 members and volunteers.

Generally, the educational attributes  associated with association sales and services distinguish them from  concessioner sales and services. However, this is not always the case. In  fact, in three of the six parks we visited, competition between cooperating  associations and concessioners or local businesses led to conflicts.

Accordingly, association activities are intended to provide the public with  educational materials related to the parks and to generate revenue for  other association programs and activities that support the agency.  Associations support park programs by making direct purchases on behalf  of the parks and by providing funds for use by park staff. Typically, each  park has a standard agreement with an affiliated cooperating association.  This agreement documents and clarifies the association\u2019s scope of  responsibility and permitted activities and is often supplemented to  address association services specific to a park. Local park managers are  responsible for overseeing association activities including ensuring that  sales and services are consistent with the terms of the agreement and  assuring that association support is appropriately targeted.", "Cooperating association activities focus on supporting parks by providing  visitors with educational materials and services. The main revenue- generating activity of associations is operating bookstores that sell  educational and other merchandise, often at park visitor centers.  Cooperating associations reported generating revenue of $109 million in  fiscal year 2001. As figure 1 shows, of this amount, 90 percent came from  sales and services to park visitors. Over $84 million (78 percent) was raised  through the sale of educational materials\u2014primarily books. About  $10 million (9 percent) was from educational program services such as  audio tours and organized backcountry hiking and camping activities.  Association operated \u201cfield institutes\u201d frequently provide these educational  program services. Field institutes are a part of cooperating associations  that focus on providing visitors with active learning experiences within a  park. Another $3 million (3 percent) came from sales of visitor  convenience items\u2014items that are not educational and that the Park  Service describes as necessary for the comfort and convenience of visitors.  These items include beverages, aspirin/antacids, insect repellent, sun  screen, film, disposable cameras, and stamps. The remaining 10 percent of  association revenues came from fund-raising, membership fees, and park  donation boxes.", "In addition, some associations support the needs of the parks they serve in  other, nontraditional ways. For example, associations may act as  concessioners, generating income by operating park concession contracts.", "This is the case at Mt. Rushmore NM, where the cooperating association  has a 20-year concession contract for constructing and operating a parking  facility at the site. Under these circumstances, associations are required to  report this revenue to the park service as concession contract revenue. As  such, these revenues are not included in figure 1. However, these  circumstances are exceptional and do not occur frequently.", "A description of the sales and services offered by cooperating associations  at the six parks we visited will help clarify the revenue-generating activities  that occur throughout the system. Associations at each of the six parks  operated a bookstore, and five of the six associations also sold  merchandise via a park-affiliated Web site. At three parks, a field institute  was a significant part of the association\u2019s educational service program. At  Grand Canyon NP, for example, the Grand Canyon Field Institute offered  exploratory tours where visitors could learn about the canyon\u2019s geology,  ecology, and Native American and pioneer history. This institute also  provided park-related educational materials to elementary classrooms  across the United States. Two of the six associations provided other  services\u2014one provided a guided park tour and one operated the park\u2019s  wilderness reservation system.", "Except for visitor convenience items, we found that the merchandise sold  and the services provided at each of the six parks visited were generally  related to the educational mission of the cooperating associations and to  park themes. Cooperating association bookstores carried a wide variety of  park-related publications, maps, videos, and theme-related merchandise  intended to enhance visitor understanding, appreciation, and knowledge of  parks. For example, at areas managed by Fort Sumter NM staff, the  cooperating association operated four bookstores with educational books  and items related to Civil War occurrences in the Charleston, South  Carolina area. At Yosemite NP, the association sold books, Native American  artifacts and jewelry, and CD-ROMs that were generally consistent with its  educational mission and park themes. Cooperating association Web sites  generally offered the same merchandise as the bookstores. Although our  examination of the items being sold at association bookstores and Web  sites at the six parks we visited revealed a few items that were not clearly  related to the association\u2019s educational mandate, these were low volume  and low cost items that were not financially significant. For example, the  association sold magnets at Ft. Sumter, and slinkys and hula hoops at the  Eisenhower National Historic Site.  In commenting on our report, the  association\u2019s executive director noted that magnet sales were discontinued  at this store.  The director stated that hula hoops and slinkys are sold with  interpretive text and help connect visitors to the lifestyle of the 1950s,  which is a park interpretive goal.", "Like merchandise sales, we found that the services provided by  cooperating associations at the six parks we visited were educational and  consistent with park themes. Some of these services generated substantial  revenue for individual parks. For example, at Gettysburg NMP, the local  association operates the \u201cElectric Map\u201d and \u201cCyclorama\u201d mural painting.  The Electric Map orients visitors to the park by depicting the progress of  the 3-day Gettysburg battle, while the historic mural depicts the cavalry  battle known as \u201cPickett\u2019s Charge\u201d in a 360-degree panorama. In fiscal 2000,  these operations generated revenue of $758,183 and $320,475, respectively,  of which the association donated about 40 percent to the park.  Associations, however, also provide services that generate little or no  revenue or profit. At Yosemite NP, for example, the cooperating association  operated the park\u2019s backcountry reservation program and worked with  concessioners to rent bear-resistant food canisters to visitors having  backcountry reservations. All association receipts from this program were  used to purchase more canisters. The park received no revenue from this  activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue-Generating Activities of Cooperating Associations and Concessioners Are Not Always Distinct and Sometimes Lead to Conflicts", "paragraphs": ["Generally, the educational and thematic attributes of association sales  items and services distinguish them from concessions sales items and  services. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes the sales and  services of associations and concessioners as well as other for-profit  businesses are in direct competition with one another. At three of the six  parks we visited, sales and services by associations and for-profit  concessioners and other businesses were not clearly distinguished and this  led to conflicts among these organizations. At the other three parks we  reviewed, there were no apparent conflicts between associations and  concessioners or other for-profit businesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "At Some Parks Competition between Cooperating Associations and Concessioners Leads to Conflict", "paragraphs": ["The three parks with conflicts were Grand Canyon NP, Fort Sumter NM,  and Gettysburg NMP. In each instance, the conflicts resulted from local  park managers\u2019 decisions to permit associations to sell goods or services  that had been traditionally provided by concessioners or other for-profit  businesses. At Grand Canyon and at Fort Sumter, the conflicts involved  association and concessioner sales. At Gettysburg, the conflict involved  services provided by the association and a local business that, like  concessioners, depended on park visitors for its survival.", "At Grand Canyon NP, three concessioners operated stores throughout the  park that sold, among other things, film, disposable cameras, and a variety  of other visitor convenience items to the millions of people that annually  visit the park. These items were traditionally sold by the concessioners and  were an important part of their business. However, in 2001, park managers  began allowing the Grand Canyon Cooperating Association to sell visitor  convenience items, including film and disposable cameras, at the  association\u2019s new bookstore. As a result, the association\u2019s sales of these  items went from zero in 2000 to over $50,000 during a 7-month period in  2001. This change caused considerable concern among park concessioners,  whose collective film sales total over $1.5 million. Representatives of each  of the three park concessioners believe that park management\u2019s decision  allowing association sales of visitor convenience items resulted in unfair  competition that would adversely affect their profitability. At the time of  our review, each concessioner estimated that film sales had decreased  considerably. One concessioner told us that film sales decreased by  $140,000 and another stated that, while overall sales declined by  9.5 percent, film sales deceased by 10.5 percent.", "The concessioners\u2019 concerns were based on three factors. First, the  association\u2019s point of sale is located at the initial gathering place for most  park visitors, which provides a marketing advantage that concessioners  believe reduces their business. Second, because visitor convenience items  are neither educational nor characteristic of a Grand Canyon theme,  concessioners view these items as inconsistent with an association\u2019s  traditional scope of sales and educational mission. And third, because  concessioners could not compete for operating the new bookstore at this  location, they believe the association received favorable treatment that  placed them at a competitive advantage. On the other hand, park managers  and the cooperating association Executive Director pointed out that  locating the association bookstore at the visitor center area was consistent  with the park\u2019s General Management Plan. Further, park officials told us  that bids were not solicited on the bookstore operation because the  bookstore was intended to serve an educational purpose\u2014an activity  consistent with the association\u2019s mission and its agreement with the Park  Service.  They also noted that the cooperating association was willing to  fund the building\u2019s construction.  In commenting on a draft of this report,  the new association executive director stated that the conflict with  concessioners was overstated and that the association has a strong  working relationship with park concessioners.", "The situation at Fort Sumter NM is similar to that at Grand Canyon NP. At  Fort Sumter there are two locations where merchandise is sold. The  largest of these is a bookstore operated by the cooperating association in  the recently opened visitor center in Charleston, South Carolina. Because  this center is the main departure point for visiting Fort Sumter, it has  generated considerable increases in association sales revenue. Moreover,  according to park plans, in the future it may be the only commercial  location serving Ft. Sumter visitors. The other sales location is a small store  at the fort (see fig. 2).", "When the bookstore in the Charleston visitor center opened in 2001, the  park manager permitted sales of educational and theme-oriented  merchandise traditionally sold by associations as well as visitor  convenience items. Prior to the opening of the new bookstore, visitor  convenience items were sold by the store at the fort. This store was  operated by a concessioner during the peak season\u2014March 15th through  Labor Day\u2014when the park gets about 65 percent of its visitors, and by the  cooperating association during the remaining months. Park plans  envisioned this store closing when the new visitor center opened in  Charleston and, in August 2000, several months before the new bookstore  opened, the park discontinued all concessioner sales operations at the fort.  However, the park manager subsequently decided that there was a need for  educational and theme-related merchandise at the fort and determined  that the association would operate the store at the fort on a year-round  basis, including selling visitor convenience items. The concessioner  questioned the decision to close the concession store at the fort because  the association store remains open there and sells items similar to what the  concessioner sold. The concessioner also believed that park officials  should have afforded for-profit businesses an opportunity to compete for  the bookstore operation in the new visitor center. This situation has  contributed to conflict between the concessioner and park management.  From park management\u2019s perspective, the decision to have the association  provide all of the sales at both the fort and the Charleston visitor center  was consistent with the long-term plans for the park and the association\u2019s  educational agreement. According to park plans, these decisions were  made to de-emphasize commercial activities at the park, to reduce the time  spent by staff in supervising concession sales operations, and to focus  merchandise sales on the park\u2019s educational and interpretive goals.", "Because the conflicts at both the Grand Canyon and Fort Sumter involved  increased association sales of visitor convenience items, we examined  convenience item sales data for the 323 parks with cooperating  associations to determine if the increases at these parks were part of a  trend throughout the national park system. As table 8 shows, revenue from  the sales of visitor convenience merchandise is expanding more rapidly  than other sources of association revenue. These sales increased by  55 percent (from $2.06 to $3.19 million) between 1997 and 2001, while  revenue from other sources increased only about half as much\u2014about  21 percent.", "These data indicate that this sales trend is occurring nationwide.

The table also shows that  merchandise concessioners typically operate in parks with high visitation.  Accordingly, competition is more likely in the largest parks. Appendix III  provides a complete list of parks that have cooperating associations and  merchandise concessioners.", "The third park we visited where a conflict was evident was Gettysburg  NMP. This conflict involved the cooperating association and a local  for-profit business that, like concessioners, derived its revenue from  visitors to the park. In contrast to the conflicts at Grand Canyon and  Fort Sumter, the conflict involved competition over providing tour bus  service, not the sale of merchandise. Specifically, with the approval of park  management, the cooperating association initiated a bus tour in 2001 that  directly competes with locally operated bus tours. Further, because the  association is affiliated with the park, this tour is permitted to pick up and  drop off its customers at the park\u2019s main visitor center\u2014unlike the  privately run for-profit tours. Neither of the local businesses that provided  battlefield tours is permitted to pick up or discharge at the visitor\u2019s center.  Instead, their tours operate primarily from their offices in the commercial  district of the town of Gettysburg\u2014a few blocks from the visitor center.", "One of the local businesses contends that the association-administered bus  tour service was unnecessary because similar tour services were already  available to visitors. This business owner also was concerned because the  association tour originates at the park visitor center and, as a result, has an  important competitive advantage. Further, although park officials  informally discussed the tour service with this business owner, the owner  is concerned because the Park Service did not advertise and solicit bids for  this new service and, thus, denied the business the opportunity to bid and  compete for providing the service. Finally, this owner asserts that his  business has already experienced adverse financial consequences as a  result of the association tour, but because of difficulty in isolating the  effects of this new service, cannot provide documentation supporting his  assertion. In contrast, two other parks we visited, Yellowstone and Fort  Sumter, also offered guided tours for visitors. In both instances, the tours  were operated by for-profit businesses\u2014concessioners\u2014under contract  with the respective parks.", "According to the park manager at Gettysburg, the association began  operating the tour service at his request in order to enhance the  educational and interpretive services offered to park visitors. Park  managers told us that they require the cooperating association to use  licensed park guides to provide narration and interpretation for customers  on these tours and that this arrangement improves the quality of service  provided to park visitors.

However,  there are some exceptions where the boundaries distinguishing these two  kinds of organizations are indistinct.", "Typically, friends groups raise revenue through fund-raising campaigns to  support a local park project. To raise funds on behalf of the Park Service,  agency policy requires that friends groups have an agreement signed by a  local park manager, usually the park superintendent, and the president or  chief executive officer of the friends group. Under this policy, national  fund-raising campaigns or fund-raising campaigns with a goal of $1 million  or more require the approval of the Park Service Director. Fund-raising  campaigns also require an approved fund-raising plan detailing techniques,  timing, staff needs, strategy, and costs. Park Service policy states that fund- raising plans will not be approved if overhead costs\u2014which include fund- raising and administrative expenses\u2014are projected to exceed 20 percent of  revenues over the life of the campaign. The primary sources of friends  group revenue are  Federal & State Grants The precise proportion of revenue that friends groups derive from these  various sources is not known. The Park Service does not collect such data,  and available federal tax data do not provide detailed information related  to these revenue sources. However, the tax data that are available suggest  that fundraising is by far the most important source of friends group  revenue.

More typical of friends group sales are those by  the group at the Virgin Islands NP, which offers T-shirts, license plates, and  park-related merchandise at its office outside the park, on its Web site, and  through local stores in St. John, Virgin Islands. Similarly, the friends group  at Great Smoky Mountains NP reported selling items such as hats, T-shirts,  specialty license plates, and other merchandise with its logo outside park  boundaries, at its offices in Tennessee and North Carolina, through its Web  site, and at festivals.", "Friends groups also generate revenue membership fees, through special  events, and park donation boxes. Many friends groups offer fee-based  memberships that provide member benefits. For example, at Yellowstone  NP, a friends group offers memberships beginning at $25; it reported having  over 8,000 members or volunteers. Paying members receive a free  subscription to the group\u2019s biannual newsletter, a copy of the annual report,  and have their names displayed in the Yellowstone NP Honor Book at the  Old Faithful Visitor Center for 1 year.

Similarly, at Acadia NP the friends  group netted about $250,000 through a special auction held in 2001.", "The development of data on friends group revenues is complicated by a  blurring of the functional and organizational boundaries between some  friends groups and associations. Although both types of organizations work  to help the Park Service meet its mission, distinctions between cooperating  associations and a friends groups are not always clear as evidenced by  several \u201chybrid\u201d groups that serve the parks. For example, the association  at Golden Gate NP combines cooperating association and friends group  functions under the same organization. The nonprofit organization at Mt.

Third, cooperating associations return a  higher percentage of their sales and service revenue to the parks compared  to for-profit businesses, giving park managers a financial incentive to  expand association operations. The Park Service recognizes the balancing  act that is needed to manage the roles of cooperating associations and  businesses that serve parks visitors, and agency policy encourages park  managers to develop and implement plans addressing these roles. Among  other things, these plans\u2014called Commercial Services Plans\u2014are intended  to reduce conflicts in parks by clarifying the roles and competitive  relationships of associations and concessioners and providing a more  predictable business environment for them. However, these plans are  rarely developed or used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policies Encouraging Increased Financial Support from Cooperating Associations Also Promote Increased Competition", "paragraphs": ["Park Service policies and plans encourage park managers to generate  increased financial support from cooperating associations and  concessioners. The Park Service\u2019s strategic and annual performance plans  set programmatic and financial goals designed to substantially increase  donations from cooperating associations as well as the amount of franchise  fees from concessioners. For cooperating associations to provide  increased financial support to parks, they must expand profit-making  activities including the sale of merchandise. This promotes increased  competition between cooperating associations and concessioners for park  visitor dollars.", "The Park Service has set a goal of increasing cooperating association  support by 35 percent between 1997 and 2005. As table 10 illustrates,  between fiscal years 1997 and 2001 revenues increased about 22 percent\u2014 from about $89.36 million in fiscal year 1997 to about $108.78 in fiscal year  2001.", "Table 10 also shows that $18.37 million (about 95 percent) of this  revenue increase has come from activities that are most like those of  concessioners\u2014merchandise sales of educational materials and visitor  convenience items. Accordingly, this trend contributes to increased  competition with concessioners. This trend is likely to continue as the Park  Service and cooperating associations try to meet their increased revenue  goals for 2005.", "Park Service policies and plans also have established goals for increasing  revenue from concessioners. Specifically, the agency\u2019s goal is to increase  franchise fees paid by concessioners from about 4 percent of gross revenue  in fiscal year 2000 to about 10 percent by 2005. While the mechanisms for  concessioners achieving this goal are varied and complex, getting this done  could involve increased concessioner offerings of their most profitable  merchandise to park visitors.  To the extent that concessioners and the  associations are each vying for visitor dollars or offering similar  merchandise, this would lead to increased competition.", "Further, the Park Service encourages concessioners to sell merchandise  that is educational and consistent with park-related themes. Although there  is no agencywide list of preferred merchandise, the Park Service\u2019s  Management Policies 2001 encourages concessioners to offer items for  sale that foster awareness and understanding of a park. In this regard, the  2001 policy directs each park with a concessioner to have a gift shop  mission statement that ensures concessioners sell merchandise reflecting  information about the park. For example, at the Grand Canyon, one  concessioner\u2019s gift shop mission statement states that \u201cto the greatest  extent possible, merchandise will have an identifiable relationship to  Grand Canyon National Park\u201d and identifies several park themes, such as  the park\u2019s geology and history, that serve as a guide for implementing this  objective. While this increased emphasis on concessioners selling more  educational and theme-related merchandise may help provide visitors with  a better park experience, it also promotes greater competition among  associations and concessioners. According to some concession officials at  the parks we visited, this emphasis by the Park Service makes  concessioner sales venues more like those of cooperating associations. On  the other hand, concession officials at other parks we visited stated that  this change did not pose serious competitive issues.", "In a broader context, the issue of competition between for-profit and  nonprofit organizations is a long-standing one that is not limited to the Park  Service. As we have previously reported, representatives of for-profit  businesses believe that the revenue-generating activities of nonprofit  organizations exceed the traditional role of these organizations, and that  the nonprofits receive a competitive advantage by virtue of their nonprofit  tax status and other benefits. On the other hand, representatives of  nonprofits believe certain nontraditional activities further their nonprofit  purposes by generating additional revenue to fund these purposes.

Concessioners at two of the parks we visited, a local business at a park  without a merchandising concessioner, and officials from the national  organization representing park concessioners, contended that this  delicate balance has become unsteady, and expressed concern that  cooperating association operations are expanding into areas traditionally  served by concessioners or for-profit businesses. They were unsure of the  bounds on association sales activity and believed some association  merchandise and services duplicated or replaced merchandise and services  available in or near parks, were inconsistent with nonprofit educational  mandates, and placed for-profits in increased financial jeopardy.

Further, in each instance, the sales and services  at the center of these conflicts were to be provided at prime locations  within each park and the decision was made without providing a  transparent rationale. In two cases, park officials decided to allow  associations to provide new sales or services without addressing the  decision in park plans.

The association raised $1.8 million for the project, gave the store property  to the Park Service, and assumed responsibility for operating the store. As  previously discussed, park managers permitted the association to sell  traditional, park-related educational merchandise as well as visitor  convenience items. Concessioner officials at the Grand Canyon told us  that, in their opinion, providing them an opportunity to compete to operate  the bookstore would have been a more balanced approach. Further, the  officials told us that a double standard is applied by park managers that is  advantageous to the cooperating association. As evidence of this concern,  the concessioners cited how signage restrictions are applied differently for  concessioners than for the cooperating association. On the south rim of the  canyon, a store operated by the concessioner was not permitted to post any  outside signage or displays, while an adjacent store operated by the  cooperating association was permitted to do so (see figs. 3 and 4).  In  commenting on these pictures, the current cooperating association  executive director stated that the signage outside the association\u2019s  bookstore was justified because, unlike the concession store, the  bookstore was not visible from the major visitor contact area. However, in  our view, this does not justify different signage standards for concessioners  and associations. Moreover, these displays do not make the store visible  from where it was previously invisible. Finally, the sandwich board  displayed outside this store, advertised an association bookstore that is  located elsewhere in the park.", "At Fort Sumter, the long-term plan for the development of the park  specified that the concessioner-operated sales facility at the Fort would be  relocated to a new visitor\u2019s center. In a commercial services plan designed  to implement the long-term plan, park officials decided that the  cooperating association would operate the new sales facility at the visitor\u2019s  center, that the cooperating association could sell visitor convenience  items as well as educational merchandise, and that no other merchandise  facilities would be permitted. In accordance with the park\u2019s commercial  services plan, park managers did not provide the existing park  concessioner an opportunity to operate the new sales facility. However,  although both the long-term and implementation plans envisioned closing  the sales facility at the Fort, this has not happened and the association  operates two stores\u2014one at the new visitors center and a second at the  Fort.

According to park officials, their decision to allow the cooperating  association to manage a new tour from the visitor\u2019s center instead of a  concessioner or other for-profit business was made for several reasons,  including their belief that the association would provide the best  educational service to visitors; and that associations require less park  resources to administer and allow changes that are responsive to the needs  of park management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives Encourage Increased Use of Cooperating Associations by Parks", "paragraphs": ["Cooperating associations can provide a much higher return to parks  than concessioners.

These plans also are intended to clarify  what kind of sales and services are to be provided by the various  commercial interests in a park. In brief, the plans rationalize a park\u2019s  approach to providing visitor sales and services and provide a  decision-making framework that is transparent to the public, visitors, and  commercial stakeholders at the park.

These increased nonprofit donations are good news  for the Park Service and the national park system because they supplement  the appropriated funds provided by the Congress. However, the expanding  presence and scope of cooperating association sales and service activities  is causing some conflicts at parks where concessioners or other local, for- profit businesses are competing for similar sales and services. Given the  conflicts we found at three of six parks we reviewed and the agency\u2019s  continuing emphasis on increasing the amount of nonprofit support for the  national park system, we believe these conflicts will become more  common.", "Several other factors add to the likelihood of increased conflict, especially  at parks having both association and concessioner sales and services.  Specifically, agency policies that encourage concessioner sales and  services that are related to park themes, and agency decisions permitting  increased visitor convenience item sales by cooperating associations, blur  the distinction between concessioner and association activities. Local park  managers\u2019 broad discretion in determining whether concessioners or  cooperating associations provide needed sales and services and the  substantial financial incentive for using cooperating associations also  heighten the likelihood of conflict. In light of these circumstances, it is not  surprising that park managers are expanding cooperating association roles.  In the final analysis, these decisions may be in the best interest of the  parks; however, the process for making these decisions does not serve to  minimize conflicts because it does not provide a transparent rationale or  give concessioners or other local for-profit businesses an opportunity to  compete for new sales and services.", "The Park Service understands the competitive tensions that exist between  concessioners and cooperating associations. To help minimize conflicts,  park managers are advised to develop Commercial Services Plans. These  plans are intended to provide a logical and consistent basis for decisions,  reflect public comments, and provide a more predictable commercial  environment in the parks, which would give businesses greater confidence  in their long-term decisions. However, these plans are only rarely  developed or used. As a result, the basis for park decisions is not always  clear, and public accountability is diminished.", "Moreover, because the Park Service does not collect accurate or complete  information on the contributions it receives from its nonprofit partners\u2014 either agencywide and on a park-by-park basis\u2014it cannot hold park  managers accountable for meeting strategic contribution goals.

Although other nonprofit organizations also provide services and conduct  commercial activities such as guided hiking and rafting trips at park sites,  based on the subcommittee\u2019s letter and discussions with subcommittee  staff, these organizations were not included in the scope of this review.", "To identify the number of parks supported by nonprofit organizations and  these organization\u2019s contributions, we obtained annual reports of  cooperating association\u2019s aid and revenue from the National Park Service\u2019s  Division of Interpretation and Education. We obtained the National Par  Service\u2019s most recent directory of friends groups (1998-1999) from the Park  Service\u2019s Partnership Office and contacted groups listed in the directory. To  determine which groups were active, we telephoned all groups listed in the  directory. For groups that could not be reached, we confirmed with the  associated parks whether the group was still active. We also obtained  organizational information from representatives of nonprofit groups, including the  National Park Foundation, and National Park Service officials. We identified 149  friends groups, although it is possible that there are other groups that we  were not able to identify. Contribution amounts and other nonprofit financial  information used in this report are based on several sources. We received  data on cooperating associations for 1997-2001 from the Park Service;  these data are based on annual reports that all cooperating associations are  required to submit to the Park Service. Tax data for 1998-2000 were  purchased from the Urban Institute, which contracts with the Internal  Revenue Service to digitize data on tax-exempt organizations; these data  were based on tax returns submitted by nonprofit organizations with  revenues over $25,000. Tax data were also obtained from the GuideStar  Web site operated by Philanthropic Research Inc.; these data consisted of  electronically scanned tax reports for friends groups and cooperating  associations with revenues over $25,000. We also surveyed identified  friends groups, as described below.", "We did not verify that information in the annual reports and tax returns was  correct. We relied heavily on self-reported donation and tax data from tax- exempt organizations; however, we previously reported that because  potential donors look at what percentage of expenses go to the charitable  purpose rather than management and fund-raising, nonprofit organizations  have an incentive to report management and fund-raising costs as  charitable expenses. Thus, there may be some over reporting of charitable  contributions and underreporting of management and fund-raising costs. In  this regard, we noted significant differences in reported tax information by  two of the largest cooperating associations, Eastern National and Parks  and History. Eastern National reports that about 20 percent of its  expenditures are for charitable purposes and about 80 percent is used to  cover the costs of materials, selling, and administrative expenses; Parks  and History reports that about 90 percent of its expenditures are charitable  expenses.", "Data from the Park Service on cooperating associations were not  comparable with tax data from the Urban Institute and GuideStar because  of differences in reporting periods and accounting practices. We assessed  the reliability of the electronic data we received from the Park Service and  the Urban Institute through tests to determine obvious problems with  completeness or accuracy. We determined that the data were reliable  enough for the purposes of this report.", "In addition, we conducted a survey of active friends groups regarding their  financial information. We mailed the survey to all 149 identified groups in  June 2002 and conducted several follow-ups by telephone and e-mail to  encourage responses; we completed data collection in November 2002. Of  the 149 groups surveyed, 79 returned responses (53 percent). Survey data  were supplemented with tax data for an additional 23 groups, resulting in  102 of 149 groups (68 percent) with available financial data. Where  possible, survey data were compared to tax data and any discrepancies  were resolved through discussion with the groups. Figures presented in  this report represent the two-thirds (68 percent) of identified friends  groups for which we had either tax data or survey data, and dollar amounts  should be considered a minimum estimate of the totals for all friends  groups.", "To identify the revenue-generating activities of nonprofits in the parks, and  factors that contribute to cooperating association and concessioner  competition and conflicts, and to assess how park managers are held  accountable for meeting park service goals for nonprofit contributions, we  (1) reviewed Park Service documents, plans, and policies; (2) obtained  information from each of the Park Service\u2019s seven regional offices; and (3)  met with National Park Service officials, the Association of Partners For  Public Lands the National Park Foundation, the National Park Hospitality  Association, and the Friends Alliance. We also met with park, nonprofit,  and concessioner officials at Gettysburg NMP, Fort Sumter NM, Grand  Canyon NP, Badlands NP, Yosemite NP, and Yellowstone NP and discussed  a nonprofit-managed concession contract with park and association  officials at Mt. Rushmore NM. We chose to visit Grand Canyon, Yosemite,  and Yellowstone national parks because their cooperating association and  concession operations were among the largest in the park system;  Gettysburg NMP and Fort Sumter NM to explore concessioner and local  business concerns about nonprofit activities in these parks; and Badlands  NP for perspective on a smaller nonprofit operation. Because these parks  were not a random sample, they may not be representative of the system as  a whole.

We agree that NPS must better manage information on nonprofits, and  this is one of our recommendations. We do not agree that the report  title should be changed as proposed because the change would not  capture another issue that our report and recommendations address --  the need to better manage the increasing role of nonprofits in providing  visitor convenience items and services. Problems in these areas led to  conflicts at three of the parks we visited. Moreover, our  recommendation that parks develop commercial services plans is  directed at managing the roles of nonprofits in the parks. 2. The association correctly points out, as we likewise observed in the  report, that our observations at six parks cannot be generalized to the  system as a whole.  However, because association sales of convenience  items are growing more rapidly than other association revenue items  (table 8), we are concerned that the likelihood of conflicts between  associations and concessioners may also increase. Positive  relationships between associations and concessioners are discussed in  the section \u201cNot All Concessioners Were Concerned about Competition  from Cooperating Associations,\u201d on pp. 25 - 26. 3. We agree that cooperating associations provide benefits to visitors that  are not measured by the amount of donations to the Park Service. We  identified nonfinancial benefits that associations provide in a distinct  report section on p. 14 and noted that association activities are focused  on providing visitors with educational materials and services on p. 16.  In addition, examples of nonfinancial assistance are in table 7.   4. This effort focused on the National Park Service\u2019s role in partnering  with nonprofits. We do cite prior GAO efforts that examined IRS  oversight of nonprofits. For example, we cite TAX-EXEMPT  ORGANIZATIONS: Additional Information on Activities and IRS  Oversight, (GAO/T-GGD-95-198), which found compliance and  administrative difficulties with Unrelated Business Income Tax  reporting (see p. 32). 5. We added the association\u2019s view to the discussion on p. 36. As stated in  this section, we believe cooperating associations offer a considerable  financial advantage, owing to the associations\u2019 nonprofit status and  other park support. However, we did not attempt to quantify the value  of these advantages or to measure their effect on park decision makers. 6. We agree that net assets are intended to cover operating reserves and  are not held exclusively for future contribution. We added the  clarification that these assets are \u201cpotentially\u201d available (pp. 3 and 13)  and \u201ccould become\u201d available (p. 7) for contribution. To the extent that  nonprofit assets exceed operating expenses and other liabilities, net  assets can only be used for their tax-exempt purpose, which for most of  the nonprofits discussed in this report, is solely to benefit national  parks. 7. Detailed technical and clarifying comments were incorporated into the  report as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the National Park Hospitality Association", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the National Park Hospitality  Association\u2019s letter dated June 18, 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We agree that Commercial Services Plans will require time to develop  and implement and that development and implementation may be  difficult because of resource constraints or because General  Management Plans must first be prepared or updated. In this regard, we  note on p. 1 that federal funding for the Park Service has not kept pace  with such needs as visitor services and maintenance requirements.  On  p. 40, we note that Park Service officials told us that Commercial  Service Plans were not developed because park resources are limited  and there are higher priorities. We also note that Commercial Services  Plans must be consistent with long-term plans \u2013 General Management  Plans \u2013 and while the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978  requires that each park unit maintain an up-to-date General  Management Plan, these are frequently out of date. Although progress  in developing and implementing Commercial Services Plans is  necessarily dependent upon the availability of agency resources and its  consideration of other agency priorities, we believe the likelihood that  concessioner and nonprofit conflicts will become more common (see p.  42) supports placing greater emphasis on Commercial Services Plans.  2. As is clear from the heading on p. 33, the section \u201cPark Managers Have  Broad Discretion in Deciding to Expand Cooperating Association Sales  and Services and Do Not Always Provide Transparent Rationale\u201d  already discusses the considerable autonomy park managers have at  the local level. This was an important factor in our recommending that  these managers provide rationale for decisions involving the scope,  mix, and appropriateness of association and concessioner sales and  services (see p. 44). Because we did not examine the advantages and  disadvantages of the Park Service\u2019s decentralized structure, we cannot  address the need for increased headquarters\u2019 or regional oversight of  park managers.  3. We did not identify instances where the contractual rights of  concessioners were not respected.  In addition, D.O. # 32 makes  reference to the preferential rights of concessioners.  The National  Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (P. Law 105-391) prohibits the  Secretary of the Interior from granting a preferential right to a  concessioner for most new contracts or services.  Although D.O. # 32  could be updated for consistency with current law, we are not making  this recommendation because we did not identify problems related to  the outdated wording.", "Moreover, the contracts that we examined as part of our work usually  did not give concessioners \u201cexclusive\u201d rights to sell or provide services.   In fact, contract language in some cases specifies that concessioners  are not granted \u201can exclusive or monopolistic right, to provide public  accommodations, facilities, and services.\u201d", "The Association correctly points out that the Reference Manual for  D.O. # 32 specifies that associations may be authorized to sell visitor  convenience items when \u201cconcessioners are not presently providing  such services\u201d.  This same instruction later specifies that a  concessioner and an association generally will not carry on duplicative,  competitive operations \u201cin the same building.\u201d Although the Park  Service may wish to reexamine these provisions, we did not make this  recommendation because, in some cases, concessioners and  associations may need to provide similar services at a park.  For  example, prior to the new visitor center facility opening at Fort Sumter  NM, the merchandise concessioner chose not to operate its store  during the off-season.  During this period, the association operated that  facility, providing visitor convenience items in addition to interpretive  materials.  4. Table 5 notes that association financial contributions include a dollar  value assigned to information assistance provided by association staff  to visitors and that the Park Service allows associations to claim up to  50 percent of association sales staff salaries.  However, we agree that  additional detail would provide a clearer picture of the composition of  association contributions.  We added language to tables 5 and 11 that 25  percent of association contributions were for information assistance.   We also added that information assistance is a primary type of park  support to the discussion on p. 2.  5. The issues addressed in this report do not provide a basis for making  these recommendations.  6. Associations have appointed concessioner officials to their Boards of  Directors.
