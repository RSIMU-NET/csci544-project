Strategic readiness focuses on broad functional areas, such as intelligence and mobility, that meet worldwide demands.", "The foundation for assessing readiness at the unit level is the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), an automated system for measuring the extent to which individual military units possess the required resources and training to undertake their wartime missions. To address joint readiness, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Joint Monthly Readiness Review (JMRR) in 1994. During this review process, the Joint Staff compiles readiness assessments from the combatant commands, the combat support agencies, and the military services. The Joint Staff and the services use the JMRR assessments to brief DOD\u2019s leadership on the Senior Readiness Oversight Council (SROC)\u2014an executive-level forum for monitoring emerging readiness issues at the strategic level.

During SROC meetings, the services provide their assessments of unit readiness, and the Joint Staff provides a joint readiness assessment. The briefings to the Council are intended to present a view of readiness at the strategic level. For instance, the Joint Staff reports on elements of strategic concern, such as mobility shortfalls, that are based on readiness deficiencies reported through the JMRR. Similarly, the services report on the readiness of major combat units and on broad trends in personnel, equipment, and training.

As stated earlier, this issue has been identified in prior reports as a system limitation. In addition, the database is being modified to retain only the most current remarks of a unit commander. Before this change, the database retained remarks from prior reports, commingling past and current remarks, which made analysis of SORTS reports more difficult. Also, service-unique data maintained in the SORTS database has been made available DOD-wide, Joint Staff officials said. The Joint Staff plans to make additional improvements to the database in fiscal year 1998.

While current readiness deficiencies often require long-term, programmatic solutions, the JMRR seeks mitigating actions that can be implemented within the next 2 years.", "The JMRR elevates current readiness deficiencies to the attention of senior military officials. The senior leadership of the participating DOD components reviews and approves the JMRR assessments. The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairs the JMRR meetings.

(Fig. 3.2 shows the annual schedule for the two formats.)", "At the beginning of each quarterly cycle, a Full JMRR is held to get input from the DOD components on their readiness status and deficiencies. The assessment process leading up to the Full JMRR begins when the Joint Staff Readiness Division issues planning guidance describing the scenario to be assessed. The combatant commands and the combat support agencies conduct their readiness assessments and provide their reports to the Joint Staff. The Joint Staff analyzes these reports and summarizes them in a briefing. The military services conduct separate readiness assessments and develop their own briefings. The joint and service briefings are given at the quarterly Full JMRR meeting. In the 2 months of each quarter that a Full JMRR is not held, the DOD components are required to report any major changes in their readiness.", "After the Full JMRR meeting, the Director Joint Staff assigns newly identified deficiencies to the appropriate Joint Staff directorates. For instance, deficiencies related to joint personnel are assigned to the Directorate for Manpower and Personnel. A joint personnel deficiency may involve the level of peacetime staffing of a command headquarters organization. The Joint Staff directorates are responsible for tracking the deficiencies assigned to them and coordinating corrective actions. A Feedback JMRR is held 2 months after each Full JMRR as a forum for the Joint Staff directorates to report on the new deficiencies identified in the previous Full JMRR and to give an update on progress addressing deficiencies.", "The routine, cyclical nature of the JMRR has institutionalized the readiness assessment process at DOD. The JMRR requires regular input from a broad spectrum of officials across the agency. To participate in the JMRR, DOD components have established internal processes for gathering readiness information, conducting their assessments, and obtaining approval of the assessments from senior leaders. The preparation for the Full JMRR and Feedback JMRR meetings involves extensive discussions and regular meetings among various participants in the process.", "Officials said the JMRR has undergone some changes since its inception in 1994 but has matured over the past year or so. One significant change, in 1996, was a requirement that the Joint Staff directorates conduct the Feedback JMRR briefings on the deficiencies for which they are responsible. In the early Feedback JMRRs, the Readiness Division had conducted these briefings. An official at one Joint Staff directorate said this change promoted more ownership of the issues by the directorates. The JMRR is still being refined. In May 1997, for instance, the services were required to provide regular assessments of (1) antiterrorism/force protection readiness and (2) special-interest areas such as maritime prepositioning and war reserve stocks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JMRR Incorporates Wartime Scenarios", "paragraphs": ["Planning guidance issued by the Joint Staff Readiness Division prior to each Full JMRR provides details on the wartime scenario to be assessed.

The planning guidance identifies the war plans and taskings the components are to use in their assessments. The guidance also specifies key dates, such as the day the scenario is to commence, and discusses assumptions regarding the availability of reserve forces and strategic lift assets.", "Joint Staff Readiness Division officials said a scenario may be based on guidance from the Director for Operations or other senior Joint Staff officials. Alternatively, Readiness Division officials may suggest a scenario. The key planning documents used in drafting the scenario are the National Military Strategy, Defense Planning Guidance, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. In addition, Readiness Division officials said they receive input from intelligence officials and from the combatant commands.", "Various readiness officials viewed the wartime scenario as an important aspect of the JMRR. They said it raises \u201cwhat if\u201d questions and provides insight on whether U.S. forces would be ready today to carry out a war plan with existing resources.

While combatant commands reported periodically to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a range of joint force readiness subjects, there was no defined comprehensive approach to assigning responsibilities and matching control of resources to these responsibilities, the task force said.", "The JMRR is structured to incorporate the joint readiness concerns of the combatant commands. The commands assess their readiness in eight functional areas\u2014joint personnel; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; special operations; mobility; logistics and sustainment; infrastructure; command, control, communications, and computers; and joint headquarters capability. A rating scale is used to rank the readiness of each functional area. Separate ratings are assessed for current readiness, projected readiness, and readiness to meet the demands of each conflict or threat in the scenario. The scale runs from C-1 (most ready) to C-4 (least ready). JMRR officials at the combatant commands told us that the eight functional areas cover the key areas of joint readiness that need to be assessed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JMRR Process Tracks and Addresses Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["The outcome of the JMRR is a list of deficiencies that fall under the eight functional areas. Readiness concerns that are rated by the combatant commands or the combat support agencies as C-3 or below are considered to be JMRR deficiencies. For instance, one combatant command rated its readiness for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance as C-3 because of insufficient mapping for major portions of his geographical area. The Joint Staff enters such deficiencies into its deficiency database so they can be tracked. The database assigns a control number to each deficiency and contains a number of data fields, such as a short description of the deficiency, its source, impact, status, date opened, and estimated completion date for corrective actions. The Joint Staff directorates responsible for tracking deficiencies update the database, which is made available to all JMRR participants.", "We checked selected deficiencies reported by the combatant commands and found that they were included in the database. The entries in the database often contained more detail than the original input because the Joint Staff directorates documented new information as they addressed the issue. As of January 1998, 237 deficiencies had been entered into the database. Most deficiencies were reported by either the U.S. Central Command or the Combined Forces Command, the leading combatant commands in a scenario involving two major theater wars.", "Although the combatant commands report service-related deficiencies, the database generally does not include readiness deficiencies identified by the military services. For example, one service reported that its readiness to respond to a worldwide terrorism threat was C-3 because it did not have enough special security units. Such service-identified deficiencies are not entered into the database to be monitored or addressed by the Joint Staff. The officials said that the services are responsible for addressing their own deficiencies independent of the Joint Staff. At the same time, however, the services are actively involved in addressing deficiencies reported by the combatant commands.", "Deficiencies in the database are categorized as either readiness deficiencies or capabilities deficiencies. A \u201creadiness deficiency\u201d is one in which existing resources are not prepared to accomplish assigned tasks. A typical readiness deficiency involves personnel who lack required training. A \u201ccapability deficiency,\u201d on the other hand, denotes a lack of resources within DOD to meet mission requirements. For example, a combatant command may not have sufficient reconnaissance assets to monitor its key geographical areas. More than three-fourths of all deficiencies identified through the JMRR have been capability deficiencies.", "Some service officials we interviewed said that the combatant commands clog the JMRR process by reporting a large number of capability deficiencies, diverting attention from readiness deficiencies. Some of the reported deficiencies are, in their opinion, of relatively minor importance. JMRR officials at the combatant commands rejected this criticism. They said the JMRR is their vehicle for reporting all deficiencies, including capability deficiencies, and a combatant commander would not report a deficiency he deems to be trivial.", "A deficiency in the database may be closed with the approval of the Director Joint Staff or through an annual revalidation process in which the combatant commands review their previously reported deficiencies to ensure they are still relevant. As of January 1998, 91 of the 237 (38 percent) deficiencies in the database had been closed. For example, a combatant command reported that the wartime staffing authorization for one of its service components was too low. In response, the service designated staff to the component headquarters for wartime, and this deficiency was closed. Joint Staff officials, however, said relatively few deficiencies are solved quickly. Most of the deficiencies reflect major, long-term problems for which mitigating countermeasures are sought. In some cases, DOD has decided not to address the deficiency but to understand and live with the risk it poses. In other cases, programmatic action is required to address the deficiency.", "For JMRR deficiencies requiring programmatic action within DOD, a linkage has been established with another Joint Staff process\u2014the Joint Warfighting Capabilities Assessment. This capabilities assessment is intended to help the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff influence DOD funding decisions. Functionally oriented teams study military capability issues that require significant expenditures. The teams\u2019 findings and recommendations are used to formulate the Chairman\u2019s Program Recommendations and Chairman\u2019s Program Assessment, which in turn influence the Defense Planning Guidance. Twice a year, the Director Joint Staff nominates JMRR deficiencies for study by the Joint Warfighting Capabilities Assessment. In August 1997, for example, 18 JMRR deficiencies were nominated.

As a result, the components have developed their own JMRR assessment processes to comply with the Joint Staff\u2019s reporting requirements.", "At the combatant commands, the JMRR assessments are based on input from the headquarters staff directorates and from the service component commands. An assessment for each of the eight functional areas is approved by the responsible staff director. The functional area assessments are then combined into an overall JMRR assessment that is reviewed by the chain of command. Once approved, the assessment is reported to the Joint Staff. To conduct their readiness assessments, the combatant commands have independently developed measures for each of the eight functional areas. For instance, U.S. Central Command officials said they have developed three to five measures for most of the functional areas. Officials told us this flexibility is appropriate because of the differing missions of the commands and their areas of responsibility.", "The services, like the combatant commands, draw JMRR input from a variety of sources. Service readiness officials said the predominant indicators they use are derived from SORTS, which they found useful for a variety of analyses. However, they added that SORTS data often does not stand on its own, and service headquarters officials must investigate the reasons that a unit reports degraded readiness. JMRR officials in the service operations directorates seek input as needed from other directorates, such as personnel and logistics. These directorates, in turn, have developed their own processes for gathering JMRR input. The logistics directorates at the Air Force and the Navy, for example, gather SORTS data and other data for various critical support enablers, such as sustainment, maintenance, and engineering. This information is used to develop C ratings similar to those the combatant commands use for their eight functional areas.", "Despite the use of various readiness indicators, JMRR assessments are fundamentally subjective. Readiness officials said subjectivity was critical to obtaining a sound assessment of readiness because of the inherent problems of quantifying and measuring all factors affecting readiness. Readiness indicators are tools to be used by commanders. JMRR assessments are subject to change throughout the review and approval process, and the final assessment ultimately represents each commander\u2019s military judgment.", "Service officials told us they may improve their overall readiness ratings by substituting units for those apportioned in war plans. For example, a unit may have key equipment in maintenance that is not available for the scenario. In such cases, another unit would be chosen for the scenario. The officials said such substitutions would occur in the event of a real crisis. In addition, service officials may use more optimistic assumptions to improve a unit\u2019s readiness rating. For example, one service official told us that he recalculated the readiness rating for some units by assuming that the units could travel faster and arrive in theater sooner. The command that made the initial calculation agreed with these changes, he said.", "The JMRR relies on the voluntary participation of DOD components to offer realistic assessments of their readiness. No procedures exist to validate the components\u2019 assessments. Furthermore, the services do not provide backup data to the Joint Staff in support of their JMRR assessments. Joint Staff officials, however, said they were satisfied with the level of service involvement in the process. In addition, the Joint Staff independently monitors unit readiness through SORTS and gathers information on specific service-related readiness issues as they arise.", "According to the OSD readiness office, the objectivity of JMRR assessments could be improved by integrating the review with the joint training system. The joint training system evaluates the capabilities of joint forces based on an approved set of tasks, conditions, and standards, and the combatant commands could be required to evaluate their readiness based on these same tasks, conditions, and standards. According to OSD, the JMRR assessments also could be made more objective by using simulation models to verify a unit\u2019s mobilization capability and its ability to move to the designated port of embarkation. This information would enhance the credibility of war plans and improve JMRR assessments of scenario readiness, they said.

However, the JMRR assessments are largely subjective by design, and standard measures are not used to assess the eight functional areas.

The SROC briefings are basically summaries of the information discussed in the JMRR or are in response to requests from the Deputy Secretary of Defense for infomation on special readiness topics. Our review of selected service JMRR and SROC briefings showed the services did not include all information presented to the SROC that was briefed to the JMRR.

The format of the SROC also allows service chiefs the discretion to highlight and brief any readiness deficiency they choose. Furthermore, senior-level service officials may update information briefed to the SROC from what was briefed to the JMRR. During our review, for instance, we found that one service made updates to emphasize the need for timely reimbursement of funds spent on contingency operations.", "Since the quarterly readiness report flows from the SROC, it too contains readiness information at the strategic level. Further, information excluded from SROC briefing documents, such as the readiness of critical support functions, is also excluded from the quarterly reports.

Officials said this was an explanation for why visits to individual units may yield impressions of readiness that differ from those given in official reports. Some officials said the quarterly report was too aggregated and bland to be of any use. Other DOD officials, on the other hand, said the quarterly report does a good job of summarizing the current state of readiness in the armed forces. Officials emphasized that the quarterly report is not the only medium for providing readiness information to Congress. Readiness information is also provided in testimony, reports, and discussions with congressional staff.", "Our review of six quarterly reports issued since May 1996 disclosed that forecasts of service readiness tended to reflect a stable or positive readiness situation.
