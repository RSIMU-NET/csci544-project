A policy owner with unneeded life insurance can surrender the policy to the insurer for its cash surrender value. Or, the owner may receive more by selling the policy to a third-party investor through a life settlement. These transactions have involved high-dollar-amount policies covering older persons. Despite their potential benefits, life settlements can have unintended consequences for policy owners, such as unexpected tax liabilities. Also, policy owners commonly rely on intermediaries to help them, and some intermediaries may engage in abusive practices. As requested, this report addresses how the life settlement market is organized and regulated, and what challenges policy owners, investors, and others face in connection with life settlements. GAO reviewed and analyzed studies on life settlements and applicable state and federal laws; surveyed insurance regulators and life settlement providers; and interviewed relevant market participants, state and federal regulators, trade associations, and market observers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The life settlement market is organized largely as an informal network of intermediaries facilitating the sale of life insurance policies by owners to third-party investors. Policy owners may sell policies directly to investors in some cases, but owners and investors commonly use intermediaries. Life settlement brokers represent policy owners for a fee or commission and may solicit bids for policies from multiple life settlement providers with the goal of obtaining the best price. Life settlement providers buy life insurance policies for investors or for their own accounts. No comprehensive data exist on market size, but estimates indicate it grew rapidly from its inception around 1998 until the recent financial crisis. Estimates of the total face value of policies settled in 2008 ranged from around $9 billion to $12 billion. State and federal regulators oversee various aspects of the life settlement market. Life settlements typically comprise two transactions: the sale of a policy by its owner to a provider, and the sale of a policy by the provider to an investor. As of February 2010, 38 states had insurance laws specifically to regulate life settlements. State insurance regulators focus on regulating life settlements to protect policy owners by imposing licensing, disclosure, and other requirements on brokers and providers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), where its jurisdiction permits, and state securities regulators regulate investments in life settlements to protect investors. One type of policy (variable life) is considered a security; thus, settlements involving these policies are under SEC jurisdiction. SEC also asserted jurisdiction over certain investments in life settlements involving nonvariable, or traditional, life insurance policies, but their status as securities is unclear because of conflicting circuit court decisions. All but two states regulate investments in life settlements as securities under their securities laws. Inconsistencies in the regulation of life settlements may pose challenges. Policy owners in some states may be afforded less protection than owners in other states and face greater challenges obtaining information to protect their interests. Twelve states and the District of Columbia do not have laws specifically governing life settlements, and disclosure requirements can differ among the other states. Policy owners also could complete a life settlement without knowing how much they paid brokers or whether they received a fair price, unless such information was provided voluntarily. Some investors may face challenges obtaining adequate information about life settlement investments. Because of conflicting court decisions and differences in state laws, individuals in different states with the same investments may be afforded different regulatory protections. Some life settlement brokers and providers may face challenges because of inconsistencies in laws across states. GAO developed a framework for assessing proposals for modernizing the financial regulatory system, two elements of which are consistent consumer and investor protection and consistent financial oversight for similar institutions and products. These two elements have not been fully achieved under the current regulatory structure of the life settlement market. Congress may wish to consider taking steps to help ensure that policy owners involved in life settlements are provided a consistent and minimum level of protection. SEC agreed with our matter for congressional consideration, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners did not agree or disagree with it but raised related concerns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Emerging in the late 1990s, the life settlement market offers consumers  benefits but also exposes them to risks, which have raised regulatory  concerns. Policy owners with unneeded or unaffordable life insurance can  surrender their policies to their insurance companies for the cash  surrender value. However, life settlements provide policy owners with  another option: in a life settlement transaction, third-party investors  compete to buy an existing, or in-force, policy from its owner\u2014potentially  resulting in an offer for the policy that is higher than its cash surrender  value. In exchange for the payment, the investor becomes the new policy  owner and is responsible for paying the policy premiums but is entitled to  receive the policy death benefit when the insured dies. Life settlements  evolved from viatical settlements, which historically have involved insured  persons who are chronically or terminally ill and expected to live 2 years  or less. In contrast, life settlements traditionally have involved policies  covering older persons (for example, 65 or older) who are expected to live  more than 2 years.", "Importantly, life settlements are complex transactions that can take  several months to complete. Policy owners commonly rely on specialized  intermediaries to help them understand and complete the transactions. As  the Senate Special Committee on Aging highlighted in its April 2009 report,  life settlements may have unintended consequences for older Americans.  For example, policy owners entering into life settlement transactions may  incur unexpected tax liabilities or not be able to obtain additional life  insurance, if needed, in the future. Just as there have been cases of fraud  and abuse in viatical settlements, there are examples of similar problems  with life settlements. Abusive business practices by intermediaries include  charging policy owners excessive commissions, not seeking competitive  bids for policies from potential buyers, and not providing policy owners  with all relevant information.", "Recognizing that life settlements can not only provide important benefits  to older Americans but also pose risks to them, you asked us to address  the following questions:    How is the life settlement market organized?", "How are the life settlement market and its participants regulated?", "What challenges are policy owners, investors, and life insurance  companies facing in connection with the life settlement market?", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Twelve  states and the District of Columbia have not enacted laws specifically  governing life settlements, and disclosure requirements can differ among  the states that have such laws.

Second, licensing, disclosure, and other requirements differ among some  states with life settlement laws, resulting in different protections for different  policy owners. Third, policy owners also can be afforded different  protections, depending on whether the policy being sold is a variable policy  subject to FINRA and federal sales practice rules or a nonvariable policy.  Although variable policies, unlike nonvariable policies, expose their policy  owners to investment risk, life settlements involving both types of policies  generally raise the same potential risks for policy owners.", "A potential federal role in the regulation of insurance has been the subject  of debate, which the current financial crisis has renewed. For example, the  financial regulation reform legislation currently under consideration by  Congress would, among other things, create a Federal Insurance Office, in  part to monitor the insurance industry (other than health and crop  insurance). The bill contains a provision directing the office to consult  with states on matters of national importance and conduct a study on how  to modernize and improve insurance regulation, including gaps in state  regulation. In the last decade, we have made a number of  recommendations to encourage state regulators to implement a consistent  set of insurance regulations.

SEC noted that investors  often face challenges in obtaining adequate information about life  settlement investments and, as indicated in our report, may be afforded  different regulatory protections and receive different disclosures,  depending on where they reside. According to SEC, these are issues that  should be addressed through clarification of regulatory authority. In that  connection, SEC\u2019s Life Settlement Task Force has focused its review on  enhancing investor protections and addressing regulatory gaps in the life  settlement market and is expected to make recommendations to the  commission along those lines.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, NAIC\u2019s Chief Operating Officer  and Chief Legal Officer summarized our matter for congressional  consideration but noted that NAIC disagrees that an option for a federal  charter for insurance is an appropriate solution for the life settlement  market. He also noted that NAIC objects to the inclusion of a discussion of  federal chartering for insurers or the creation of a federal insurance  regulatory entity, as neither proposal has included any federal role in the  life settlement market. Our references to federal chartering and a federal  insurance regulatory entity in the conclusions served to illustrate the  debate over the advantages and disadvantages of a federal role in the  regulation of insurance, given the difficulties of harmonizing insurance  regulation across the states. As discussed in our report, states also have  faced difficulties in harmonizing their life settlement regulations. Because  of regulatory inconsistencies, policy owners in some states may be  afforded less protection than policy owners in other states, and addressing  this issue should be part of any regulatory reform effort. Our matter for  congressional consideration seeks to raise this as an issue to be  considered but does not provide any specific approach that Congress  should take. While NAIC discusses potential approaches that it views as  inappropriate\u2014regulation through federal chartering or a federal  regulatory agency\u2014other approaches have been taken to harmonize state  insurance regulations. For example, in 1999, Congress passed the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act, which encouraged states to enact uniform laws and  regulations for licensing insurers or reciprocity among states when  licensing insurers that operate across state lines.", "The NAIC official also commented that our report did not mention that  policy owners entering into life settlements have received, in the aggregate,  a small fraction of the face value of their policies (based on our provider  survey)\u2014indicating that such transactions are a poor financial choice for  most consumers. The costs and benefits provided by life settlements to  policy owners has been a controversial issue. For example, some have  noted that policy owners could maximize their estate value by liquidating  assets other than their life insurance policies, and others have noted that life  settlements offer policy owners an alternative to surrendering their policies  for their cash value, which also typically is a small fraction of the face value  of the policies. As we noted in our report, life settlements can provide policy  owners with a valuable option, but policy owners can face challenges in  assessing whether a life settlement is their best option or knowing whether  they are being offered a fair price for their policy.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly release its contents earlier,  we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date of  issue.
