This report examines (1) how CMS oversees providers' implementation of the PSDA requirement; (2) what is known about the approaches providers use and challenges they face to inform individuals about advance directives; and (3) what is known about the prevalence of advance directives and how it varies across provider types and individuals' demographic characteristics. To do this work, GAO reviewed CMS documents and survey data reported by state survey agencies into CMS's Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting system about covered providers' implementation of the PSDA requirement.

Covered providers include hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies (HHAs), hospices, and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides operations manuals, memoranda, and model documents to these providers to inform them about the advance directive requirement and describe how the agency will monitor providers' implementation. Because individual states are responsible for administering contracts with and providing guidance to Medicaid managed care plans, also specified in the PSDA, CMS ensures that the contracts include the advance directive requirement, but does not issue guidance to these plans. To monitor providers' implementation of the advance directive requirement, CMS primarily relies on other entities. CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to periodically survey and report data, which CMS collects, on deficiencies related to advance directives for hospitals, nursing homes, HHAs, and hospices. CMS also relies on accrediting organizations to survey providers that participate in the Medicare program through accreditation and subsequently make recommendations to CMS regarding providers' participation in Medicare. In addition, CMS reported reviewing MA and Medicaid managed care plans' contracts to determine that they include the advance directive requirement.", "Approaches used to inform individuals about advanced directives vary by type of provider, but providers face similar challenges, according to stakeholders interviewed and literature GAO reviewed. For example, hospitals, nursing homes, HHAs, and hospices inform individuals about advance directives during the admission process, while MA plans and Medicaid managed care plans inform individuals during enrollment. Challenges in informing individuals about advance directives include discomfort talking about end-of-life issues and lack of staff time for such discussions. Providers may address these challenges by using leading practices, such as patient education or population specific materials.", "Many adults have advance directives, but estimated prevalence varies by provider type and an individual's demographic characteristics. In 2013, 47 percent of adults over the age of 40 had an advance directive, according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Dying in America . However, the prevalence of individuals with advance directives varies by type of provider and demographic characteristic. For example, a National Center for Health Statistics report found that 88 percent of discharged hospice patients had advance directives in 2007 compared to 65 percent of nursing home patients in 2004. Studies GAO reviewed found that individuals who were older, white, had higher education or incomes, or were women were more likely to have advance directives than others.", "HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Advance directives\u2014such as living wills or health care powers of  attorney\u2014specify, consistent with applicable state law, how individuals  want medical decisions to be made for them should they become unable  to communicate their wishes.

For example, 69 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries that died in 2009 experienced a hospitalization in  the last 90 days of life. A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report noted  that an advance directive may be a useful component of a comprehensive  approach to end-of-life care, called advance care planning, which  includes discussions about end-of-life treatment preferences and  documenting those preferences.

In 1990,  similar federal efforts resulted in what is commonly referred to as the  Patient Self Determination Act (PSDA), which, as amended, requires six  types of Medicare and Medicaid funded providers\u2014hospitals, nursing  homes, hospices, home health agencies (HHAs), health maintenance  organizations, and Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations (hereafter  collectively referred to as covered providers)\u2014to maintain written policies  and procedures to inform those they serve about advance directives, and  document information about individuals\u2019 advance directives in the medical  record.

In this report, we examine: (1) how CMS oversees  providers\u2019 implementation of the PSDA requirement to maintain written  policies and procedures to inform individuals about advance directives  and document advance directives, and providers\u2019 implementation of these  policies and procedures; (2) what is known about the approaches  providers use and challenges they face to inform individuals about  advance directives and document advance directives; and (3) what is  known about the prevalence of advance directives, and how they vary  across provider types, individuals\u2019 demographic characteristics, and over  time.", "To examine CMS\u2019s oversight of covered providers\u2019 maintenance of written  policies and procedures, and providers\u2019 implementation of these policies  and procedures, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and CMS  documents and data. We also conducted interviews with CMS officials  and stakeholders, including officials that represent each of the six types of  covered providers, and two organizations representing individuals likely to  benefit from advance directives, including older individuals and those  near the end of life. In addition, we reviewed data in the Certification and  Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER) system, which CMS  uses to retain data regarding deficiencies, including those related to  advance directives, identified during surveys of providers that must meet  certification standards for participation in Medicare. Such providers  include nursing homes, HHAs, and hospice care providers. To collect  CASPER data, CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies  to conduct provider surveys and report survey results into the CASPER  system. However, a substantial portion of certain covered providers,  particularly hospitals, are certified for participation in Medicare through  accrediting organizations, and full survey data for these providers are  generally not included in the CASPER system. The CASPER system  does however, contain full survey data from a relatively small number of  providers\u2014hospitals, HHAs, and hospices\u2014 accredited through  accrediting organizations, which are included in our analysis. To assess  the reliability of the CASPER data, we reviewed data documentation,  discussed the data with CMS officials, and examined the data for  consistency and unusually high and low values.

For each of the studies that we reviewed, we  identified how a particular type of covered provider informs patients about  advance directives; how the provider documents whether a patient has an  advance directive; challenges related to these activities; and how these  challenges can be addressed. In addition, our work was informed by  IOM\u2019s 2015 Dying in America report, a key source of information on  end-of\u2013life care. We also interviewed stakeholders representing covered  providers and individuals likely to benefit from an advance directive, and  supplemented these interviews with information from CMS about how the  agency oversees managed care plans.", "To examine what is known about the prevalence of advance directives  and how this varies across provider types, individuals\u2019 demographic  characteristics, and over time, we relied on the same literature review of  peer reviewed articles and selected federal government reports published  from 2009 through 2014. For each of the studies relevant to this objective,  we identified the prevalence of individuals with an advance directive  within the general population, within provider types, by demographic  characteristics, and how the prevalence has changed over time. In  addition, we identified statistical data from four studies: (1) Dying in  America, IOM; (2) \u201cCompletion of Advance Directives Among U.S.  Consumers,\u201d American Journal of Preventive Medicine; (3) \u201cUse of  Advance Directives in Long-Term Care Populations,\u201d National Center for  Health Statistics Data Brief; and (4) \u201cAdvance Directive Completion by  Elderly Americans: A Decade of Change,\u201d Journal of the American  Geriatrics Society.

For example, an advance directive may be used to record  an individual\u2019s wish to receive all available medical treatment, to withdraw  or withhold certain life sustaining procedures, or to identify an agent to  make medical decisions on the individual\u2019s behalf if necessary. The most  common forms of advance directives are living wills and health care  powers of attorney.", "During the last 6 months of life, many individuals receive care from one or  more covered providers, including hospitals and nursing homes, and  having an advance directive that specifies an individual\u2019s treatment  preferences to covered providers in preparation for difficult medical  decisions that may arise at the end of life may be useful. According to the  IOM, advance directives are most effective when used as part of advance  care planning, which may involve multiple, in-depth discussions with  family members, legal and financial counsel, and healthcare providers,  and may also include the formulation of medical orders. The IOM also  reported that multiple discussions at various stages of life are needed,  with greater specificity as an individual\u2019s health deteriorates, because an  individual\u2019s medical conditions and treatment preferences may change  over time. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to end-of-life care,  rather than any one document, such as an advance directive, helps to  ensure that medical treatment given at the end of life is consistent with an  individual\u2019s preferences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Covered Providers and CMS Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The six provider types covered by the PSDA provide or arrange for  Medicare or Medicaid health care services in multiple settings for  individuals of varying demographics.

The characteristics and distribution of individuals enrolled in MA  and Medicaid managed care also have similarities and differences. For  example, individuals enrolled in MA may be disabled or elderly (over the  age of 65), and individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care may  include adults who are also disabled and elderly. However, in 2013, CMS  reported that half of the Medicaid population was children in comparison  to Medicare in which 83 percent of beneficiaries were over age 65. In  addition, while most individuals enrolled in Medicare are not enrolled in a  managed care plan, over 70 percent of individuals enrolled in Medicaid  are enrolled in some form of Medicaid managed care, according to CMS.

These agencies conduct surveys of covered  providers\u2014observations, interviews, and document/record reviews\u2014that  assess compliance with applicable requirements for Medicare and/or  Medicaid participation.

For  example, there are about 200 quality and safety standards for nursing  homes that range from determining the prevalence of pressure sores and  use of restraints to documenting the posting of an individual\u2019s bill of rights.", "However, in some cases, particularly for hospitals, accrediting  organizations provide primary oversight. Specifically, hospitals, HHAs,  and hospices that choose to undergo accreditation by an accrediting  organization, rather than certification from a state agency, must  demonstrate to the accrediting organization their ability to meet the  standards of accreditation, including PSDA standards. The accreditation  organization subsequently recommends to CMS certification of providers  meeting such standards. The processes that accrediting organizations  use to certify providers for Medicare participation are subject to CMS  review and approval.

Guidance in the  operations manual describes to state survey agencies and covered  providers the activities and documents that may be observed and  reviewed during surveys. For example, the operations manual indicates  that state survey agencies may review the provider\u2019s policies, examine an  individual\u2019s medical records for documentation that required information  was provided to the individual, and whether or not the individual has an  advance directive; or conduct interviews with other individual patients and  provider staff to understand how the provider\u2019s policies are implemented.

For example, in  September 2012, a CMS memorandum notified state survey agencies  that CMS had updated its guidance regarding how survey agencies  should assess nursing home compliance with the advance directive  requirement and encouraged survey agencies to share the information  with providers. Further, in October 2013, a CMS memorandum to state  survey agencies clarified nursing homes\u2019 cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) policies in the context of an individual\u2019s advance directive.  According to the memorandum, nursing homes must provide CPR to all  individuals in their care unless an individual\u2019s advance directive specifies  otherwise, and may not establish or implement facility-wide \u201cno CPR\u201d  policies. The memorandum instructs state survey agencies to examine  nursing home policies and individuals\u2019 medical records to ensure that no  such policy has been established or implemented. A stakeholder that  represented nursing home providers reported that the memoranda and  updated survey guidance for nursing home providers clarified and  reinforced CMS\u2019s expectations for nursing homes\u2019 policies related to  advance directives, and demonstrated CMS\u2019s focus on providing  oversight in this area.", "In addition to the guidance that CMS provides to MA plans\u2014the fifth  provider type\u2014through the Medicare Managed Care Manual (chapter 4  entitled, \u201cBenefits and Beneficiary Protections\u201d), CMS also provides MA  plans with model documents used to inform enrollees about advance  directives to demonstrate how plans are to implement the guidance in the  manual. For example, the model document contains the exact wording  that the plans must use to inform individuals enrolled in MA plans about  their right to formulate an advance directive. MA plans are required to  provide this document, called an Evidence of Coverage, to each  individual at initial enrollment and each year thereafter. According to CMS  officials, MA plans are not permitted to modify the language in the model  document unless otherwise instructed by CMS.

Specifically, under agreements with  CMS, state survey agencies periodically survey four of the six provider  types\u2014hospitals, nursing homes, HHAs, and hospices. Survey  frequencies for each provider type are determined by statute or CMS  policy. For example, the frequency of nursing homes, HHAs, and  beginning in 2015, hospice standard surveys is statutorily determined and  must occur, on average, every year for nursing homes and every 3 years  for HHAs and hospices. The frequency of hospital standard surveys is  determined by CMS and should occur, on average, every 3 years.

For example,  about 2 percent of the 14,161 nursing homes that were surveyed in 2013  had a deficiency related to the advance directive requirement.  Deficiencies related to the advance directive that were identified during  surveys of the four provider types included providers\u2019 failure to inform  individuals about advance directives, including failure to provide individual  patients with written information about the providers\u2019 policies regarding  advance directives. Providers also failed to accurately document an  individual\u2019s advance directive in the medical record. Surveyors based  their findings on observations, medical record reviews, and interviews  with provider staff, and noted that a provider\u2019s failure to ensure that  individuals have an opportunity to formulate complete and accurate  directives has the potential to cause harm to individuals who may receive  treatment or have treatment withheld when their exact treatment  preferences are not known.

The challenges to informing individuals about  advance directives include discomfort talking about end-of-life issues,  confusion about which staff should have the discussions with individuals,  and lack of staff time to have the discussions. Specifically, 18 studies  found and five stakeholder officials representing providers and seniors  confirmed that providers, individual patients, or both are often  uncomfortable talking about end-of-life issues, in some cases even when  an individual is close to the end of life. For example, 9 studies found that  physicians often do not communicate poor prognoses with individuals, in  part, due to their discomfort to do so, which can deprive individuals of the  opportunity to understand that they are nearing the end of life and the  opportunity to discuss their advance care preferences in that context.  Three studies also found confusion about which staff\u2014nurses, social  workers, or physicians\u2014should have discussions to inform individuals  about advance directives, although most individuals prefer to have  these discussions with their physicians, according to 3 other studies.

Specifically, 13 studies found that  many individuals lack an understanding about advance directives,  assume incorrectly that these documents are expensive or require  attorneys, or have difficulty understanding complex medical information  included in some advance directive forms. Thirteen studies also  identified challenges specific to Latinos or African Americans, such as  language barriers, lack of trust in health care providers, or fear that  advance directives may prevent them from getting the care they want to  receive.", "In addition to the challenges with informing individuals about advance  directives, providers face similar challenges documenting this information,  such as errors in individuals\u2019 medical records and challenges related to  access or updates to advance directives, according to the literature and  stakeholder officials. Specifically, nine studies found errors in individuals\u2019  records related to advance directives, such as lack of documentation  about advance directives that should have been included in the records\u2014 in one case despite the fact that individuals had recently discussed  directives with providers. In addition, five studies reported challenges  related to access to this information, such as challenges identifying where  a copy of individuals\u2019 directives may be located or concerns that  information about directives may not be transferred with individuals if they  are moved from one provider to another; for example, from a nursing  home to a hospital. Similar concerns about access to documents were  reiterated by four stakeholders we interviewed that represented providers  and seniors. Two stakeholders representing nursing homes and managed  care plans reported that providers face difficulties ascertaining in the  documentation whether individuals had recently reviewed or updated their  directives, or if the directives in individuals\u2019 records were current.", "Providers may better address challenges to inform individuals about  advance directives and document them by using leading practices,  according to the literature and stakeholders. Some of the leading  practices for informing individuals about advance directives include  patient education, materials tailored for specific groups, or an iterative  advance care planning process. For example, one study using the  Respecting Choices program\u2014an advance care planning model  developed by Gunderson Health System that includes multiple stages of  care planning involving patients, providers, and communities\u2014 demonstrated that a provider using patient education and staff training  efforts can increase the extent to which individuals understand and  complete advance directives. In addition, 12 studies suggested that  providers use materials designed for specific groups, such as videos, for  those with low literacy or information developed for those with specific  medical conditions that can help individuals better understand and  communicate their preferences with providers. Eleven studies and four  stakeholders that represented providers and individuals nearing the end  of life also suggested using an iterative advance care planning process,  such as a process that would start with community education about  advance directives, continue with increasingly specific discussions with  providers as an individual\u2019s health deteriorates, and culminate with the  completion of increasingly specific documents, such as advance  directives or medical orders, as an individual nears the end of life.  Fifteen studies noted the importance of such planning when individuals  are diagnosed with a major illness or impending loss of decision-making  capacity so that the individuals can communicate their preferences with  providers before they are unable to do so.", "Providers may also use leading practices to better address challenges to  documenting information about advance directives in order to help ensure  the accuracy and the accessibility of this information in an individual\u2019s  medical record, according to the literature and stakeholder officials. For  example, five studies found that using specific documentation methods,  such as spreadsheets or electronic health record systems, can improve  the accuracy\u2014including quantity and quality\u2014of the information about  advance directives maintained in individuals\u2019 medical records. Six  studies also suggested that providers adopt electronic health record  systems that, in addition to indicating whether individuals have an  advance directive, could contain copies of the directives to ensure that  individuals\u2019 preferences are more easily accessible to providers and  families, especially for individuals that may transfer from one provider to  another."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Adults Have Advance Directives, but the Prevalence Varies by Provider Type, Demographics, and Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Many adults in the United States have advance directives. In 2013, about  47 percent of adults over the age of 40 had an advance directive,  according to IOM\u2019s report Dying in America. In addition, an earlier  nationally representative survey that included younger adults age 18 and  older found that an estimated 26 percent of this population had an  advance directive during the 2009 and 2010 time period.", "The prevalence of individuals with advance directives varies by the type  of provider that individuals are served by\u2014hospitals, nursing homes,  HHAs, and hospices\u2014according to the literature. For three of these four  provider types (hospice, nursing homes, and HHAs), a 2011 National  Center for Health Statistics report found that 88 percent of discharged  hospice patients in 2007 had advance directives, compared to 65 percent  of nursing home patients in 2004, and 28 percent of HHA patients in  2007. (See fig. 1.) Among the four covered provider types for which  information was available, our analysis of 12 studies found that hospital  patients were least likely to have advance directives and that hospice  patients, who are by definition close to the end of life, were the most  likely to have advance directives as compared with nursing home and  HHA patients. We did not find peer reviewed studies in our literature  review on the prevalence of those with advance directives among  individuals enrolled in MA and Medicaid managed care plans, although  these individuals may also be served by the other four covered provider  types.", "In addition to variations by provider type, the prevalence of advance  directives also varies among individuals based on certain demographic  characteristics, such as medical conditions including chronic and life  threatening diseases, according to the literature. For example, in 2010,  individuals 18 years of age and older with chronic diseases were more  likely than those without such diseases to have advance directives, with  an estimated 33 percent and 22 percent prevalence, respectively. (See  fig. 2.) A total of 20 studies found that individuals with certain medical  conditions were more likely to have advance directives than healthier  individuals. In general, certain medical conditions\u2014such as diabetes,  malignancies, renal dysfunction, dementia, or declining health\u2014increased  the likelihood that individuals had advance directives, according to the  literature.", "The prevalence of advance directives also varies by age, race, income,  education, and gender, according to the literature. Older individuals were  more likely to have advance directives than younger individuals. For  example, a 2009 and 2010 nationally representative survey found that an  estimated 51 percent of individuals 65 years of age and older had  advance directives, while among individuals 18 to 34 years old, an  estimated 12 percent had advance directives. The survey also   indicated that an estimated 31 percent of whites compared to an  estimated 17 percent of African Americans or Latinos had advance  directives. In addition, this study found that an estimated 32 percent of  individuals with incomes of $75,000 or more had advance directives in  comparison to an estimated 21 percent of those with incomes under  $25,000. Similarly, prevalence among individuals with post-graduate  educations compared to those who had not completed high school was  an estimated 38 percent and an estimated 14 percent, respectively,  according to the study. Women were also more likely to have advance  directives than men, an estimated 28 percent versus 25 percent,  according to the study. In addition to this study, 36 studies found  variations in the prevalence of advance directives by age, race, income,  education, or gender.", "The prevalence of advance directives has been increasing over time,  according to the literature and CMS data. For example, prevalence within  the older population has increased over time, according to a study  examining the prevalence of advance directives for those 60 years of age  or older who died between 2000 and 2010. This study found that  individuals 60 years of age and older who died during that period with   an advance directive increased from an estimated 47 percent to   72 percent. Available information on nursing home residents also shows  an increase over time. Our analysis of CMS data found that the proportion  of nursing home patients with advance directives has increased between  2004 and 2014. We found that the average percentage of nursing home  patients who had an advance directive increased from 46 percent in 2004  to 55 percent in 2014, based on data from nursing homes that were  surveyed during that time. (See fig. 3.) However, the percentage of  nursing home residents having advance directives fluctuated over this  period. Eight additional studies found increases in the prevalence of those  with advance directives over time for a specific group, such as those from  one state or type of provider. Factors that may have contributed to the  increasing prevalence of individuals with advance directives over time,  according to the literature, include community education efforts and  provider staff training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this product from HHS.
