DOE estimates that more than $100 billion has been invested in the laboratories over the past 20 years. The laboratories\u2019 work covers many scientific areas\u2014from high-energy physics to advanced computing\u2014at facilities located throughout the nation. Although DOE owns the laboratories, it contracts with universities and private-sector organizations for their management and operation\u2014a practice that has made the laboratories more attractive to scientists and engineers.

For example, the laboratories have long produced and applied nuclear isotopes now used in thousands of diagnostic medical procedures daily. Safer cars and planes have evolved using computer crash simulation software developed at one laboratory. In 1994, the laboratories\u2019 technological achievements received 25 of the 100 prestigious \u201cR&D 100 Awards\u201d given annually by R&D Magazine for the year\u2019s most technologically significant products.

From this national security mission, the laboratories generated expertise that initially developed nuclear power as an energy source. The laboratories\u2019 missions broadened in 1967, when the Congress recognized their role in conducting environmental as well as public health and safety-related research and development. In 1971, the Congress again expanded the laboratories\u2019 role, permitting them to conduct nonnuclear energy research and development. During the 1980s, the Congress enacted laws to stimulate the transfer of technology from the laboratories to U.S. industry. DOE estimates that over the past 20 years, the nation has invested more than $100 billion in the laboratories.", "The 1990s have brought the most dramatic changes affecting the multiprogram laboratories, including the following.", "The Soviet Union\u2019s collapse has reduced the nuclear arms race, raising questions about the need to maintain three separate weapons laboratories.", "The weapons laboratories, facing reduced funding in nuclear weapons research, have diversified their work in order to maintain their preeminent talent and facilities.", "Expectations are growing that all laboratories can and should help improve the nation\u2019s economic competitiveness by working with industry to develop commercial technologies.", "As the laboratories have aged, concerns have arisen about their ability to maintain their skills in weapons programs. Major investments will be needed to provide up-to-date facilities and attract younger scientists. In light of the general budget austerity facing the federal government, a stable funding environment is no longer guaranteed, and the laboratories will increasingly need to show useful results.", "These and other forces have accelerated the laboratories\u2019 diversification from defense and nuclear research. For example, the nuclear weapons laboratories\u2014Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore\u2014although created to design, develop, and test nuclear weapons, now devote less than half of their budgets to work on nuclear weapons. While these laboratories have been affected most dramatically by recent geopolitical changes, all DOE laboratories have been influenced by recent events and are redirecting their priorities.", "The federal government owns the facilities and grounds of the laboratories and funds the work but has relied on contractors to manage and operate them. These contracts generally run for 5 years; however, some of the laboratories have been run by the same contractor for decades, even since their inception in the early 1940s.

This work was carried out as part of our general management review of the Department of Energy.", "Our work focused on DOE\u2019s nine multiprogram laboratories because of their size and importance as national science and technology resources. We selected laboratory staff to interview by asking each laboratory to identify five programs that best represented its current contributions and future capabilities. (App. II contains the list of programs the laboratories identified.) From these programs, we selected three for assessment. This approach allowed us to examine both the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the laboratories. When collecting information, we strove to identify and assess mission and management issues from the experience of the laboratory managers responsible for directing the programs we had selected. Our work also focused on each laboratory\u2019s technology transfer activities because of the increased national emphasis on using the laboratories to enhance U.S. technological competitiveness.", "We collected information about the laboratories\u2019 missions and management from multiple sources with direct knowledge of these issues. At the laboratories, we interviewed managers who were responsible for the research programs we had chosen.

One manager described as a \u201chorrible problem\u201d the limited emphasis on cross-program coordination.", "To illustrate the difficulties in combining expertise from different programs to achieve core missions, several laboratory managers cited the fragmented research on preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Although solutions to proliferation problems require expertise in identifying the effects of weapons, the nonproliferation and weapons missions are carried out in different laboratories and are managed by different assistant secretaries. Laboratory managers also cited weak links among the energy conservation, fossil fuel, and nuclear energy research programs as having limited DOE\u2019s progress in commercializing energy technologies.", "When DOE and the laboratories have successfully combined their multidisciplinary resources, impressive results have occurred. For example, laboratory managers attributed the rapid progress toward a coordinated understanding of global environmental change in DOE\u2019s Global Studies Program to the use of nine laboratories\u2019 diverse capabilities.

Past studies and reviews of the laboratories have all reached the same conclusion, as the following examples show: In 1983, the White House Science Council Federal Laboratory Review Panel issued a report (commonly known as the Packard Report) addressing all federal laboratories. The report found that while some of the laboratories, particularly DOE\u2019s, had clearly defined missions for parts of their work, most activities were fragmented and unrelated to the laboratories\u2019 main responsibilities. This report recommended that all parent agencies review and redefine the missions of their laboratories. In 1992, a DOE Secretary of Energy Advisory Board found that the broad missions the laboratories were addressing, coupled with rapidly changing world events, \u201c. . . ha caused a loss of coherence and focus at the laboratories, thereby reducing their overall effectiveness in responding to their traditional missions as well as new national initiatives. . . .\u201d The Board identified the most important cause of the stress between DOE and its laboratories as \u201c. . . the lack of a common vision as to the missions of the laboratories. . . .\u201d", "A 1993 report of an internal DOE task force on laboratory missions reported that the missions \u201cmust be updated to support DOE\u2019s new directions and to respond to new national imperatives. . . .\u201d", "None of these past studies and reviews has resulted in overall consensus about the future missions of the multiprogram laboratory system, raising questions about DOE\u2019s capacity to provide a vision for this system. A 1982 DOE Energy Research Advisory Board task force provided some insights into this question. The Advisory Board acknowledged the impressive nature of the research and development conducted throughout the system but noted that certain weaknesses prevented the laboratories from achieving their full potential. The Advisory Board found, for example, that structural problems and fragmented programs required the laboratories to interact with DOE on an excessive number of levels. The Advisory Board recommended that DOE designate a high-level official to focus solely on the laboratories. DOE did not follow the Advisory Board\u2019s recommendations. In early 1993, however, DOE created an Office of Laboratory Management whose purpose was, in part, to coordinate the interests of the various DOE program offices that interact with the laboratories on a program-by-program basis. However, according to DOE officials, the plan was not implemented, and the existing office does not coordinate laboratory activities for all program offices and does not report directly to the Secretary.", "We called attention to the limitations of DOE\u2019s program-by-program approach to directing its laboratories as early as 1978, after reviewing the laboratories\u2019 contributions to nonnuclear energy, a critical policy issue at that time. The laboratories\u2019 activities in this area were limited by several factors. First, DOE\u2019s organizational alignment created obstacles; specifically, the laboratories reported to three different senior officials. This arrangement focused the efforts of the laboratories on particular programs and eroded their abilities to pursue research on topics cutting across several areas, such as nonnuclear energy. Second, the roles of the laboratories were determined in a piecemeal way so that each laboratory was given small, fragmented responsibilities. We recommended that DOE align the laboratories under a separate high-level office that was not responsible for specific programs.", "Most of what we do is determined from the bottom-up . . . in other words, the program level in DOE\u2014and DOE program managers don\u2019t  about what the  missions are.

While the laboratories have already made contributions in these areas\u2014such as effective weapons systems, energy conservation programs, environmental cleanup techniques, and commercialized technologies\u2014our panel concluded that clarifying and, in some cases, redefining the current missions for the laboratory system as a whole would enhance the value of the laboratories."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security Work Will Continue to Be Important", "paragraphs": ["Our panel of experts agreed that the laboratories\u2019 national security work will continue to be important. Until the Department of Defense has decided whether to support defense work at the laboratories and DOE\u2019s missions are clear, the defense roles of Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore are unclear. However, several panelists anticipated a defense mission with new and continuing objectives that would use these three laboratories\u2019 nuclear weapons competence and other laboratories\u2019 experience.", "In nuclear weapons technologies, several of the experts on our panel predicted that the laboratories\u2019 missions would continue to shift from designing weapons to overseeing and dismantling the nuclear stockpile, verifying international nuclear treaties, and conducting research on nonproliferation. Because the Department is substantially responsible for overseeing the weapons stockpile, it will require the laboratories\u2019 unique competencies. Ensuring that stockpiled nuclear weapons are reliable and safe is a major responsibility that will persist as long as the nation needs to sustain a nuclear stockpile, a panelist pointed out.", "The defense mission also makes the laboratories responsible for overseeing the dismantling of nuclear weapons in accordance with the nation\u2019s international treaty obligations\u2014a task that will take decades to complete at the current pace, a laboratory director pointed out. According to a laboratory director, the United States and Russia each estimate that they can dismantle only 2,000 weapons a year. The current U.S. stockpile contains many thousands of weapons.", "The proliferation of nuclear technology and materials will be an increasingly important national concern. As a DOE manager noted, a growing number of nations are now able to make nuclear weapons, and more have the political will to develop them. Our panel of experts concurred that the laboratories have unique knowledge to address these issues. For example, the laboratories already have experience in detecting clandestine nuclear weapons programs, locating terrorists\u2019 weapons, responding to nuclear weapons emergencies, and identifying the origin of nuclear materials and weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Links Between Energy and Environmental Missions Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["Energy and the environment are areas in which the laboratories have already made useful contributions. However, our panel of experts suggested that the laboratories could enhance their contributions by linking their missions in these areas to focus on energy-related environmental problems\u2014an increasingly important issue, according to a DOE secretarial advisory board. This linkage would demonstrate the effect of research in one area on work in another, an important consideration because energy development and use underlie most of the nation\u2019s serious environmental problems. For example, the use of electric vehicles would reduce emissions of hydrocarbons but create problems in disposing of batteries. Similarly, the production of commercial nuclear power reduces some air quality problems but creates a need for technologies to dispose of radioactive wastes. As a panelist pointed out, linking energy and environmental research would draw upon the laboratories\u2019 ability to address cross-disciplinary problems. This linkage would benefit research in both areas and enhance the ability of DOE and the laboratories to set research and policy priorities.", "Our panel of experts agreed that the laboratories have an important energy research mission. One panelist described it as perhaps their principal mission because developing energy sources and efficient uses of energy is vital to the nation\u2019s economy. However, another panelist maintained that although the laboratories\u2019 energy mission is broad, it has become fuzzy. Panelists also noted that despite substantial investment, the laboratories\u2019 energy research has been disappointing. One panelist noted that the nation has been unable to decide on an energy policy to guide the laboratories\u2019 work. DOE has produced several different national energy strategies over the years, each with different priorities, making long-term planning for the laboratories difficult. Despite these conditions, however, panelists agreed that a redirected energy mission would serve the United States very well and provide opportunities for large-scale interactions between industry and government. One panelist urged DOE to consider the laboratories\u2019 experience, encourage closer laboratory-industry interactions to define priorities, and focus on path-breaking, high-risk, cross-industry research with the potential for major payback in 10 to 20 years.", "The laboratories\u2019 environmental mission has been more implicit than explicit, according to one panelist. Although the laboratories have been developing environmental technologies, the scope of their environmental mission has not been clear. However, several of the panelists envisioned that the laboratories could make unique contributions, particularly in environmental technology\u2014an area where other federal agencies have limited experience\u2014and in nuclear waste disposal. Significant contributions may also stem from the laboratories\u2019 ability to model environmental impacts with their advanced computing facilities. Several panelists believed that greater coordination between DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency would be needed to maximize the value of this type of laboratory work.", "A laboratory director emphasized to us that through their basic research competencies the laboratories can make a major contribution to solving environmental challenges, but their strengths have been underutilized. According to the director, \u201cWaste remediation cannot continue on its present course without \u2018bankrupting the country\u2019 because it is being done without a knowledge base.\u201d", "As a laboratory manager noted, developing a basic understanding of underlying problems before developing waste cleanup technologies is important.

A laboratory director pointed out that U.S. industry has sometimes been at a disadvantage because public-private research is better coordinated in other countries.", "There was considerable agreement among both the experts on our panel and other experts we consulted about the need to change the laboratories\u2019 current focus on transferring existing technology to industry on a project-by-project basis. Industry, expert, and government sources concurred that the technology mission would be more productive if it supported nonproprietary research that could help all industries compete; technology research as an integral part of the national security, energy, and environmental missions; long-term cooperative research relationships between the laboratories and industry; and training in science for future progress in technology.", "According to a panelist, nonproprietary research that can benefit all industries is important but has been underfunded and conducted without focus. The panelist emphasized that the government can usefully and appropriately support research that underpins a broad array of specific technology applications in many different industries, stopping short of supporting proprietary technology that companies themselves should fund. For example, experts noted that laboratory research to improve the U.S. transportation system could enhance U.S. manufacturers\u2019 ability to compete. Similarly, a panelist noted that laboratory work on advanced computer-aided design tools could improve productivity throughout the U.S. manufacturing sector.", "Although a commercial technology mission is important, laboratory managers, industry representatives, and experts cautioned that developing technology should not become the laboratories\u2019 primary mission or reason for existence. The officials described the challenge as defining a broad technology mission that supports long-term relationships between the laboratories and industry while sustaining the laboratories\u2019 other missions and abilities. For example, the laboratories develop technology through other missions that have technological needs of their own. Sustaining the laboratories\u2019 basic research is also important. Laboratory managers observed that a balance is needed between basic and applied research in order to avoid \u201ceating the seed corn\u201d that leads to new technologies. In addition, not all programs\u2014such as high-energy physics\u2014lend themselves to cooperation with industry.
