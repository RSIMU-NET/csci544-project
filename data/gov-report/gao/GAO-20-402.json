DOD initiated another attempt in response to 2010 OMB guidance. However, this initiative was terminated shortly thereafter, again due to security concerns.", "For its current initiative, DOD has not completed three of four longstanding OMB requirements (see table).

DOD completed six of the 18 activities as of March 2020. DOD officials acknowledged that the department's transition time frames were optimistic; they added that they had thought that the activities' deadlines were reasonable until they started performing the work. Without an inventory, a cost estimate, or a risk analysis, DOD significantly reduced the probability that it could have developed a realistic transition schedule.

These numerical  descriptions allow devices to be distinguished from each other over the  internet. In some ways, an IP address is like a physical street address.  For example, in the physical world, if you want to send a letter from one  location to another, the contents of the letter must be placed in an  envelope that lists both the sender\u2019s and the recipient\u2019s addresses.  Similarly, if data is transmitted across the internet from one device to  another, IP addresses must be placed in an IP header with sender and  recipient information. In addition to containing the addresses of the  sender and the receiver, the header also contains a series of fields that  provide information about what is being transmitted. Figure 1 provides a  simplified illustration of this concept.", "The Internet Engineering Task Force, the principal body engaged in the  development of internet standards, developed IPv6 in the 1990s to  address IPv4\u2019s limited address space, among other things.

IPv6 improves mobility  features by allowing each device to have a unique IP address  independent of its current network or connection point to the internet.  This enables mobile IPv6 users to move from network to network  while keeping the same unique IP address.

According to the 2014 DOD IG report on DOD\u2019s IPv6 transition efforts,  use of IPv6 could provide DOD with several potential benefits related  to battlefield operations, such as improved communication, warfighter  mobility, situational awareness, and quality of service. IPv6 auto- configuration capabilities provide secure ad hoc networking and  mobility, as well as improved end-to-end security and simplified  network management capabilities. This could potentially enable  individuals and entire units to disconnect from military base networks,  travel into theater, and quickly establish communications.  Additionally, IPv6 capabilities could allow warfighters and  commanders to improve situational awareness and mission execution  during deployment and battle operations, allowing units to securely  move from one wireless network to another.", "Increased use of the IoT may improve decision-making.

In addition, without a cost estimate  to guide decision-makers, DOD\u2019s current IPv6 transition plans could be  based on unrealistic assumptions about costs and resource demands.  Further, by moving forward without a risk analysis, DOD increases the  probability that it is not proactively managing potential threats that could  either disrupt the transition or introduce new IT security vulnerabilities.  Completing these longstanding planning requirements would enable DOD  to develop realistic plans with accurate transition requirements and  proactive risk mitigation strategies, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to DOD.", "The Secretary of Defense should direct the DOD CIO to complete a  department-wide inventory of existing IP-compliant devices and  technologies to help with planning efforts and requirements development  for the transition to IPv6.

The  department said that it plans to complete both the cost estimate and the  risk analysis by the end of May 2020.", "However, DOD stated that it did not agree with our recommendation to  complete a department-wide inventory of existing IP-compliant devices  and technologies (Recommendation 1). Specifically, the department  referred to the draft IPv6 guidance that OMB developed in March 2020,  stating that the draft guidance will rescind OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2005 IPv6  guidance, which includes the inventory requirement. DOD also said that  creating such an inventory would be impractical given the department\u2019s  size. It added that it has been mitigating the risk of not having an  inventory by only acquiring IPv6-capable devices since December 2009.", "We acknowledge that OMB\u2019s March 2020 draft IPv6 guidance, once  finalized, would rescind its fiscal year 2005 IPv6 guidance. However, the  draft guidance focuses on completing the operational deployments of  IPv6, not on the initial key transition step of completing an inventory, as  required in the 2005 guidance.", "The draft guidance also requests information on agencies\u2019 completion of  certain milestones using the percentage of IP-enabled devices that are  IPv6-only as the metric. DOD\u2019s completed inventory would be essential to  accurately responding to OMB\u2019s draft requirement. In addition, NIST\u2019s  current IPv6 transition guidance cites an inventory of IP devices as a key  step in transitioning to IPv6 since such information would help identify  requirements for transitioning, including which assets would transition and  what security controls would be needed. As DOD has acknowledged,  however, it has not yet completed an inventory. Accordingly, we believe  that our recommendation that DOD complete a department-wide  inventory of its existing IP-compliant devices and technologies is  warranted.", "In addition, DOD provided a technical comment, which we incorporated  as appropriate.
