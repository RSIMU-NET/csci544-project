We used generally  accepted economic principles for benefit-cost analysis, including Office of  Management and Budget Circulars A-4 and A-94 to develop breakeven  prices for which DOD could offer the motors. These breakeven prices,  reflecting our calculations of the net present value of motor storage and  disposal costs, are those at which DOD must sell the motors to cover the  costs of transferring them to commercial launch providers. We did not  include sunk cost\u2014that is, the costs previously incurred to develop,  produce, and sustain the ICBM motors\u2014but rather, we calculated  potential prices based on fulfillment cost, which includes all costs that an  entity will incur in fulfilling the promises that constitute a liability. These  costs are the value to the entity of the resources that will be used in  liquidating the entity\u2019s assumed liability.

The Air Force\u2019s  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program is responsible for  acquiring intermediate to heavy U.S. national security space launches for  DOD and the intelligence community and has recently implemented a  competitive strategy for acquiring launch services by allowing certified  commercial providers to compete for certain national security launch  opportunities. DOD has historically relied on the EELV program\u2019s  intermediate and heavy launch vehicles to place its national security  satellites into desired orbits. These launch missions have typically taken  2-3 years from initial order to launch date. Additionally, DOD has been  striving for over 10 years to develop launch systems that can deliver  smaller payloads into orbit more quickly. For example, as we reported in  2015, the Air Force\u2019s Operationally Responsive Space office is one of  several efforts underway to develop or demonstrate low-cost responsive  launch capabilities for small to medium satellites. The Operationally  Responsive Space office uses ICBM motor-based launch vehicles,  among others, to deliver quick-response space-based capabilities with  small satellites.", "NASA has also sought to acquire launch services from multiple providers  to reduce launch costs and meet the needs of a diverse set of civil  objectives. For example, in 2006, NASA started the Commercial Orbital  Transportation Services program and provided several commercial  companies funding under Space Act agreements to help develop and  demonstrate cargo transport capabilities using commercial space  transportation systems. NASA now uses commercial resupply services  contracts to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.  Additionally, in an effort to facilitate private investment into small launch  vehicles, in 2015, NASA awarded multiple Venture Class Launch Service  contracts to provide access to low-Earth orbit for small satellites. This  effort is to demonstrate dedicated launch capabilities for small payloads  that NASA anticipates it will require on a regular basis for future missions.", "The U.S. government has also strived to encourage the growth of the  commercial space launch industry by limiting government activities that  might interfere with market forces. The 1994 National Space  Transportation Policy and Fact Sheet stated that U.S. government  agencies shall purchase commercially available U.S. space transportation  products and services to the fullest extent feasible and generally  prohibited the use of surplus ICBM motors for launch unless certain  conditions were met. According to Department of Commerce officials, this policy continued the generally agreed upon practice that has been in  place since the early 1990s to prohibit the use of surplus ICBM motors for  private purposes. The Commercial Space Act of 1998 prohibited the  commercial use of surplus ICBM motors and directed government  agencies to purchase and use commercial services with only limited  exceptions. Further, the 2010 National Space Policy directs the  government to develop government launch systems only when doing so  is necessary to assure and sustain reliable and efficient access to space  and there is no U.S. commercial system available. The 2010 policy also  instructs agencies to refrain from conducting U.S. government space  activities that preclude, discourage, or compete with U.S. commercial  space activities, unless required by national security or public safety.  The 2013 National Space Transportation Policy directs agencies to foster  and cultivate innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. commercial  space transportation sector. Members of the Federal Aviation  Administration Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee  and other industry stakeholders have said that eliminating the prohibition  on the commercial use of surplus ICBM motors may harm the commercial  launch industry. Department of Transportation officials said that using  surplus ICBM motors is not innovative and that these motors are old  technology.

However, the breakeven price  is just one of several methods that DOD could use to set the sales prices  of surplus ICBM motors. For example, industry stakeholders, in response  to the Air Force\u2019s request for information, provided written input to the Air  Force stating that the sales prices should be based on methods for  determining the value of an asset in the FASAB Handbook, such as the  fair market values or prices of comparable new commercially available  motors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Breakeven Price Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The breakeven price is the price at which DOD could sell surplus ICBM  motors, recuperate the costs to transfer the motors for launch, and  account for savings from avoiding storage and disposal costs had the  motors not been used for space launch.

According  to the RSLP office, transfer costs vary from mission to mission  depending on the number and type of motors required, the location of  the launch site, and other factors. Transfer costs include ensuring that  the motors will be reliable for launch, refurbishment to ensure  flightworthiness, transportation between the motor storage facility and  the launch site, and other mission costs. According to DOD, it spends  approximately $4.5 million per Peacekeeper motor set and $1.7  million per Minuteman II motor set to ensure that the motors will be  reliable during flight\u2014referred to as Reliability of Flight. This involves  static fire testing to assess how well the motors are aging.", "Additionally, DOD is responsible for restoring motors to flightworthy  status (known as \u201crefurbishment\u201d) and this must be completed on the  motors before they are transferred to the launch site. Refurbishment  costs per launch are roughly $840,000 for a set of 3 Peacekeeper  motors to $460,000 for a set of 2 Minuteman II motors. Transportation  costs are approximately $1.3 million per Peacekeeper motor set and  approximately $130,000 per Minuteman II motor set. Other mission  specific costs that are included in the cost to transfer the motors  include those for activities such as mission assurance, program  management, and facilities and civilian salaries at Hill Air Force Base.", "Motor Storage and Disposal: We found DOD spends about $5.8  million to store Minuteman II motors and $2 million to store  Peacekeeper motors each year.

The number  of expected future launches affects potential storage and disposal  cost savings to DOD because if more motors are used\u2014either  through launch or disposal, the bunkers in which the motors are  stored are emptied more quickly. We estimated that under the current  government only scenario, the stockpile of Peacekeeper motors would  be depleted in 13-22 years and the Minuteman II motors in 9-10  years. Under a scenario in which motors are also used for commercial  launches, Peacekeeper motors may be depleted more quickly\u2014in 11- 13 years.

Differing assumptions would likely cause the breakeven  prices to change. For example, if launch demand is much lower or higher  than current assumptions, consequent changes to storage and disposal  costs would affect savings estimates. Additionally, if some motor transfer  activities the Air Force currently conducts, such as transporting the  motors to the launch site, are instead performed by the companies that  purchase the motors, breakeven prices could decrease.

Because the use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial launches may  create competition for existing and emerging commercial space launch  providers, the degree to which these benefits and challenges are realized  largely depends on price at which DOD sells the motors.

According to  Department of Transportation officials, the price a launch customer  ultimately pays depends on a range of factors, including mission  objectives and market conditions. Launch prices may also differ between  primary and secondary payloads.", "According to DOD, since fiscal year 2006, foreign launch providers have  aggregated about 100 U.S.-manufactured payloads that could have been  launched by a U.S. launch vehicle. It is not clear how many ICBM-based  commercial launches would have been needed to serve these 100  payloads, as approximately 90 percent of them were 150 kg or less and  thus were likely aggregated to varying degrees on a medium or large  launch vehicle. However, the benefit of increasing U.S. launch service  global competitiveness as a result of allowing commercial use of surplus  ICBM motors may be limited. According to the FAA, domestic launch  capability may soon become more robust and competitive because of the  emergence of new space launch providers and vehicles. Specifically,  several U.S. companies developing launch vehicles and related  technologies to provide low- and medium-weight payload launch  capabilities began conducting test flights in 2017 and some plan to begin  carrying commercial payloads as early as next year. Table 17 in appendix  II provides a list of emerging launch vehicle providers.", "Allowing the use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial launches could  further benefit the commercial space sector by providing U.S.-based  launch customers more options and flexibility from which to choose  launch services. As we reported in July 2016, customers select from  available launch providers based on a number of factors, including price,  capability, and reliability of the launch vehicle. Another factor that  customers consider is the location of the launch. Some satellite  manufacturers and other potential customers of launch services we  interviewed said they prefer a domestic provider and may be willing to  pay a higher price for a domestic launch depending on factors such as  lower licensing costs and simpler, lower-cost logistics.", "Increasing the domestic launch capability could also help launch  customers gain greater schedule certainty. Specifically, launch customers  may have stringent schedule requirements and must select a launch  vehicle that will deliver their payload to the desired orbit. According to  several experts we interviewed, customers with smaller payloads often  choose to launch as a secondary or aggregated payload on a larger  launch vehicle. They said that this likely reduces the customer\u2019s costs,  since aggregated payload customers share launch costs, but it may also  create schedule uncertainty. For example, customers who choose to  aggregate their payload with others may not be able to determine the  planned launch date, which may then be delayed if one or more of the  other aggregated payloads are not ready in time. In contrast, as a sole or  primary payload, the customer typically has more control over the launch  schedule. However, there are indications that the domestic launch market  is already responding to this type of customer demand. Several emerging  space launch providers we spoke with said providing customers greater  schedule flexibility is a key component of their business strategy and an  important factor that distinguishes them from many existing launch  providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Demand for Newly Manufactured Solid Rocket Motors", "paragraphs": ["The use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial space launches could  provide the U.S. solid rocket motor industrial base a limited benefit by  increasing demand for newly manufactured solid rocket motors, helping  ensure that these assets remain available to support government space  launches and other missions. As we have reported in the past,  Congress and DOD have identified the health of the solid rocket motor  industrial base as an area of concern. According to Institute for Defense  Analyses research, there were six U.S. solid rocket motor suppliers in the  mid-1990s, but these six are now consolidated into two remaining  entities\u2014Aerojet Rocketdyne and Orbital ATK. These manufacturers  are dependent on a single U.S. company to provide the main ingredient  for the solid rocket motor propellant, ammonium perchlorate.", "In recent years, demand for solid rocket motor fuel has dropped because,  among other things, NASA retired its Space Shuttle program in 2011,  which historically comprised most of the demand for solid rocket motors.  According to the Institute for Defense Analyses, the Space Shuttle  program was responsible for as much as 90 percent or more of the total  U.S. demand for large solid rocket motor propellant from 1990 to 2010.  However, the Institute reported that since the end of the Space Shuttle  program, annual demand for solid rocket motor propellant has dropped  from more than 20 million pounds to about 5 million pounds and is  expected to drop further, creating excess capacity throughout the solid  rocket motor industrial base. Since at least 2009, DOD has identified the  solid rocket motor industrial base as being particularly risky for programs  that require solid rocket motors because decreased production has made  the remaining two solid rocket motor suppliers even more vulnerable,  among other things. However, according to NASA officials, they expect  demand for solid rocket motor propellant to increase in the future as their  Space Launch System becomes operational. Each Space Launch System  launch requires two solid rocket motors that each contains approximately  one million pounds of propellant, for a total usage of two million pounds  per launch.", "Increased use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial or government  launch could provide a limited benefit to the solid rocket motor industrial  base through greater use of manufacturing equipment, personnel, and  processes. Due to differences in design and payload delivery, surplus  ICBM motors cannot be used for higher stage propulsion on space launch  vehicles. As a result, the use of an ICBM motor-based launch vehicle  creates demand for one or more newly manufactured higher stage solid  rocket motors. For example, the Minotaur I and Minotaur IV launch  vehicles require one to two newly manufactured higher stage solid rocket  motors. However, the commercial use of surplus ICBM motors, in  comparison to historical demand from NASA and other government  missions, is likely to have a limited benefit on the solid rocket motor  industrial base. For example, the two higher stages of a Minotaur I or the  single higher stage of a Minotaur IV use 10,362 and 1,698 pounds of  propellant, respectively. In comparison, each of the two reusable solid  rocket motors that launched the final version of NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle  burned about 1.1 million pounds of propellant. At most, depending on the  type of launch vehicle, the use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial  launch would create demand for two to four newly manufactured higher  stage solid rocket motors and roughly 3,400-20,700 pounds of propellant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Opportunities for DOD Personnel with Specialized Skills", "paragraphs": ["Greater use of surplus ICBM motor-based launch vehicles could support  U.S. efforts to assure its access to space by increasing opportunities for  DOD personnel to utilize specialized skills.

DOD and Air Force  officials we spoke with said that a consistent launch rate is an important  factor in helping maintain these specialized skills. Since 2000, the  government has used ICBM motor-based launch vehicles 15 times in  support of a variety of space launch missions; however, the launch pace  has declined. For example, from 2000 to 2011, the Air Force launched  13 space missions using ICBM motor-based launch vehicles.

Several respondents to  the Air Force\u2019s August 2016 request for information stated that the  availability of surplus ICBM motors may erect unfair barriers to entry in  the space launch market and discourage investment in new space launch  vehicles. We found that the price for a launch using surplus ICBM  motors\u2014assuming the motors are available to commercial customers at a  breakeven price roughly equal to DOD\u2019s costs to prepare the ICBM  motors for launch\u2014would be about $27,000 per kilogram of payload for  Peacekeeper motor-based vehicles and about $71,000 per kilogram for  Minuteman II motor-based vehicles.

Table 3 presents the price per kilogram for a Peacekeeper- based and Minuteman II-based launch vehicle.", "The price per payload kilogram for a launch using Peacekeeper based  launch vehicle is in a similar range with the planned future launch prices  for emerging launch vehicle providers. Emerging providers developing  launch vehicles with capability between 1 kilogram and 2,000 kilograms are estimating their launch prices to be between about $10,000 and  $55,000 per payload kilogram. Among these emerging providers,  several estimate their launch prices will be between $20,000 and $30,000  per kilogram. Many of the emerging providers are designing small launch  vehicles to provide dedicated launch services. However, one company we  spoke with plans to start with a small launch vehicle but eventually offer  launches for medium payloads on new, non-ICBM motor-based vehicles  at capabilities close to a Peacekeeper motor-based vehicle. As satellite  manufacturers examine the launch vehicle market from which they will  choose a launch, they may choose the slightly lower priced ICBM motor- based vehicle to aggregate multiple small satellites on one launch vehicle  at its highest capability. Conversely, the sale of surplus ICBM motors at  the breakeven price for the surplus motors and the cost of higher stage  propulsion may not have an effect on existing providers because the price  per payload kilogram of a launch vehicle using surplus Peacekeeper  motors\u2014approximately $27,000 at its highest capability\u2014is still  significantly higher than the launch prices of most existing launch  providers, with some exceptions. However, the extent of effects to  existing providers would be dependent on the price that the launch  provider chooses to offer. A commercial launch provider is likely unwilling  to purchase Minuteman II motors at the breakeven price we calculated  because the estimated price per payload kilogram of a launch using  Minuteman II motors is significantly higher than and not competitive with  both emerging and most existing launch vehicles. However, a commercial  launch provider may be willing to purchase Peacekeeper motors at the  breakeven price we calculated and sell launches for an aggregation of  small payloads, or compete at the low end of the medium class launch  market to launch the smaller medium class payloads.

If commercial launches are  allowed, the net present value of storage and disposal costs of  Peacekeeper motors for DOD would be $8.5 million to $10.3 million with  the rest of the cost being absorbed as a discount from the price for  commercial launches, and it would take 11 to 13 years to deplete the  inventory of ICBM motors.", "If commercial launches are allowed, net present value of storage and  disposal cost for Minuteman II motors for DOD would be $35.5 million to  $36.4 million with the rest of the cost being absorbed as a discount from  the price for commercial launches, and it would take 9 years to deplete  the inventory of surplus ICBM motors.", "In order to find the prices at which the Air Force would be indifferent  between maintaining the status quo and adding commercial launches, we  found the difference between the net present value of the storage and  disposal costs and then broke those costs down by motor set, as shown  in tables 11 and 12.", "Total Peacekeeper storage and disposal savings per motor set increases  as demand for launches decreases because of the growth in the number  of years it takes to deplete the stockpile. Total Minuteman II motor  storage and disposal savings per motor set decreases as demand  decreases because of the relatively low cost to store the motors, the large  number of motors that are decommissioned each year \u2014about 50\u2014and  the relatively small difference in number of years that it takes to deplete  the stockpile of those motors.", "Sensitivity Analysis: We used the sensitivity analysis element of an  economic assessment to determine how the use of surplus ICBM motors  for commercial launch may affect the commercial launch industry. We  compared the cost per payload kilogram of an ICBM motor-based launch  vehicle to the price per kilogram of commercial launches with publicly  available price data. According to generally accepted economic  principles, a sensitivity analysis adequately justifies the data, analytical  choices, and assumptions used. It explicitly addresses how plausible  adjustments to each important analytical choice and assumption affect  the economic effects and results of the comparison of alternatives. Our  analysis assessed quantitatively how the variability of the key uncertain  data underlying the estimates of economic effects\u2014like future launch  demand and capacity that may be used on a launch vehicle\u2014affects  these economic effects and the results of the comparison of alternatives.  The sensitivity analysis shows that the resulting price per kilogram is  sensitive to assumptions about launch demand, resulting storage and  disposal cost avoidance, and the resulting number of years until the motor  stockpile is depleted. The parameters and results of our sensitivity  analysis are below:  Peacekeeper Motors Sensitivity Analysis:", "Levels of government motors launched: 12 (high), 9 (mid), 6 (low)", "Levels of commercial motors launched: 3, 6, 6", "Payload capacity of 500 kilograms, 1,000 kilograms, and 1,800  kilograms.", "Minuteman II Motors Sensitivity Analysis:", "Levels of government motors launched: 8 (high), 6 (mid), 4 (low)", "Levels of commercial motors launched: 2, 4, 4", "Payload capacity of 100 kilograms, 300 kilograms, and 500 kilograms.", "We used a range of potential payload capacities that could be launched  by a Peacekeeper or Minuteman II based launch vehicle and applied this  variable across a range of potential future launches using the motors. We  estimated the launch prices per kilogram by first adding to the breakeven  prices the costs of the required higher stage propulsion and then applied  a 20 percent factor to the totals in order to calculate launch prices.  According to the Air Force, propulsion costs historically account for 20  percent of a launch vehicle\u2019s price and this is a reasonable assumption  for projecting prices. Tables 13 and 14 show the resulting prices per  launch after adding the higher stage and ICBM motor propulsion  breakeven prices and applying the 20 percent factor.", "We then divided the launch prices by the range of payload capacity.  Tables 15 and 16 show the price per kilogram of launches using  Peacekeeper and Minuteman II motors, respectively.", "Documentation of Our Analysis: We concluded our assessment of  potential surplus ICBM motor prices and resulting effects by documenting  our analysis.
