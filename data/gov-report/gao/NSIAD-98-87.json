It has a budget of over $40 billion for fiscal year 1998 to acquire and upgrade weapons and may not receive substantially more than that in future years unless savings materialize in other budget areas. Therefore, it must find new ways to modernize more economically. DOD has an opportunity to incorporate commercial supplier practices into the process it uses to acquire weapon systems. In doing so, DOD may be able to respond more quickly to technological changes with shorter cycle times, reduce costs, and improve weapon system quality."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Suppliers Play a Key Role in Developing and Producing End Items", "paragraphs": ["The term \u201csupplier\u201d refers to a firm that provides goods or services that comprise part of a final product being made by another firm. For example, a tire manufacturer would be considered a supplier to an automobile manufacturer. In this case, the automobile manufacturer would be viewed as the \u201ccustomer\u201d by the tire supplier. On a complex product such as an aircraft or a weapon system, suppliers can number in the thousands and are categorized into different levels or tiers. The term \u201csubcontractor\u201d is also used to refer to a supplier.", "In the case of a military aircraft, the firm responsible for putting the complete aircraft together and delivering it to DOD, the final customer, is referred to as the prime contractor. Although the prime contractor may make some of the aircraft itself, it may buy major subsystems, such as engines, landing gear, and navigation equipment, from other firms. The firms supplying these items and other products to the prime contractor comprise the first tier of suppliers. Each of these firms, in turn, makes significant products for which it depends on suppliers. For example, the engine manufacturer buys major engine components from its own suppliers; thus, it is a supplier to the aircraft manufacturer and a customer to the engine component suppliers. The major engine component suppliers would comprise the second tier. The firms that they buy parts from would comprise the third tier. These tiers continue down to basic piece parts, such as rivets, bolts, common computer chips, and raw materials.", "Some firms are suppliers for one product and prime contractors for others. Although the smaller firms tend to be found among the lower tiers on complex products, in the upper tiers it is possible for a supplier on a given product to be a larger firm than the firm assembling the complete product. For example, it is possible for a large firm like Lockheed Martin, a manufacturer of major military and commercial end items, to supply components for a smaller firm\u2019s product.", "Suppliers are typically responsible for the majority of a complex product\u2019s content, whether the item is military or commercial. Generally speaking, suppliers account for 50 to 80 percent of a major item\u2019s value. For DOD, this means that a large part of the money spent on building a new weapon system may actually be paid to suppliers. Perhaps more importantly, much of the technical innovation that is incorporated into a new weapon comes from the suppliers. According to the Aerospace Industries Association,much of the technical innovation comes from the suppliers at the lower tiers. Studies of agile manufacturing techniques reinforce that much of a company\u2019s competitive edge will depend on its supply chain.", "Many leading companies recognize they must encourage the best suppliers to view them as valued, preferred customers. Being a good customer may be a necessity because the supplier can be less dependent on the customer company than vice versa. Suppliers are becoming increasingly powerful in dealing with customers because of their size or almost sole-source relationships. Some suppliers can choose their customers or be inflexible about the product they are willing to supply. Such is also the case for DOD, as evidenced by the recent withdrawal of many integrated circuit manufacturers from the military market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Best Supplier Practices Produce Tangible Benefits", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that companies have become increasingly aware that they cannot do everything on their own. Therefore, companies are rethinking their business relationships, such as developing closer relationships with strategic suppliers. Companies have found that cooperative business relationships improve their abilities to respond to a changing economic environment by allowing them to focus on their core businesses and reduce costs in their business processes. For example, since 65 percent of its automobiles is made by suppliers, Ford Motor Company realized that to reduce costs and improve quality, it would have to improve its relationships with suppliers. In addition to lower product and administrative costs, exemplary supplier relationship practices can translate to significant company benefits such as higher supplier quality levels, greater productivity, faster product design and delivery times, and better supplier engineering and technological contributions, as the following examples show.", "Texas Instruments Semiconductor Group reduced its cycle time in obtaining manufacturing supplies by 25 to 40 percent and the number of material inspectors from 14 to 1 at one site and 15 to 7 inspectors at another site.", "Honda claimed an 8 to 1 return on its supplier relationships investment with an average 48-percent increase in supplier productivity, a drop in the average parts per million defect rate from 900 to 200, and virtual elimination of cost overruns.", "Varian Oncology Systems saved about $10 million and eliminated half of its inspection staff.", "To the extent that opportunities to improve supplier relations on defense programs exist and are capitalized upon, the outcomes of weapon system programs could similarly improve. Suppliers can contribute to resolving long-standing cost and schedule problems in major weapon system programs. As the pace of technological improvement quickens, shorter product cycle times will improve DOD\u2019s ability to incorporate the latest innovations. Better supplier relationships may lower investment costs, enabling the services to modernize at a faster pace with existing funding. DOD believes that modernization should proceed more quickly and wants to increase the annual investment in procurement by $20 billion, but the money has been slow to materialize.

It is an Army program and Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor. The Army has funded efforts to develop a new version of the BAT, which is to improve performance against stationary targets. It is expected to be fielded about 5 years after the basic BAT. Figure 1.1 shows the BAT.", "The BAT program has had some turbulence. We recently reported that the submunition\u2019s test schedule appeared to be extremely ambitious and that testing uncovered several problems that required design changes, additional testing, and schedule delays. Subsequently, the low-rate initial production was rescheduled from December 1997 until December 1998. An earlier delay (2 years) resulted from the Army\u2019s switch of BAT carriers, from the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile to the Army Tactical Missile System, according to the program manager. Further, the number of BATs to be purchased was cut from 35,000 to 19,500. Most recently, the Congress deleted all $85.2 million in fiscal year 1998 procurement funds and added $35 million in research and development funds in response to the program delay.

However, on the basis of our meetings with prime contractors, we found that it can be difficult to translate the desire for better supplier relations into tangible differences in the actual relationships among suppliers, prime contractors, and DOD. It is particularly difficult to create an environment in which suppliers for DOD programs believe there are true incentives for doing more than complying with the terms of the contract.

In essence, this is how the product developer created the system and communicated it to the different tiers of suppliers. Together, the individual practices within these traits shaped and guided the relationships and developed a clear understanding of the product goals and business terms as well as effective conduits for assessing performance and communicating. These conduits were primarily face-to-face contacts with people who used agreed-on measures of performance.

The practices within this trait created the \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d that is, the realization by the key team members that they were all benefiting from the relationship and that more significant contributions were matched with significant rewards. Essentially, the best practices emerged and were sustained when the product developer created an environment in which it became an attractive customer. It did this by not only rewarding superior suppliers with future business but by building partnerships, allowing top suppliers to participate in product planning and design, sharing business plans, and relaxing the procedures for doing business together. In turn, the suppliers were willing to go the extra mile, commit their own resources to enhance prospects for future business, and comply with the demands of the source selection and evaluation mechanisms. They were also willing to invest their ideas and intellectual capital back through the system.

The commitment of the prime contractor to improve supplier relationships was not perceived by some key suppliers as having been much more than procedural changes. Part of the reason is that although DOD shares responsibility for determining what is important in managing an individual program, its traditional approach has been to maintain an \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d relationship with prime contractors and have little involvement with suppliers.", "Regarding the fourth trait, some key BAT lower-tier suppliers did not believe they were encouraged to contribute to the design of the product or that their extra efforts to innovate were encouraged, or that business relationships were simplified. Instead, they believed there was no basis for expecting the business relationship to extend beyond the contract in hand. Consequently, their performance was limited to compliance with contract requirements, impairing the program\u2019s ability to take full advantage of the suppliers\u2019 intellectual capital, such as design or product ideas.", "The JDAM program office took a much more active role in ensuring that high-performing suppliers were selected, ensuring that all tiers of suppliers understood and participated in meeting the program\u2019s priorities, and offering long-term benefits to the prime contractor and its suppliers for good performance.

Specifically, the mechanisms applied on the BAT program did not effectively reach or have the same impact on several second-tier suppliers as they did on JDAM. To some extent, these differences could be attributed to the newness and increased latitude of JDAM as a pilot program and to its prime contractor being further along in adopting commercial practices.

By so doing, the firms not only informed the different business units but also helped the units agree on implementing factors, such as supplier costs, selection, development, and long-term alignment of key suppliers with business goals. The firms implemented their supplier strategies primarily by creating supplier management teams (often called commodity teams or internal councils). These teams or councils linked business objectives and performance factors\u2014such as quality, cycle time, and total cost initiatives\u2014with supplier relationship activities. In so doing, they replaced independent supplier relationships previously forged by individual business units.", "For example, Chrysler is organized around several product platform teams such as for large cars, small cars, and trucks. The platform teams developed strategies for each product, coupled with commodity strategies that defined which product components were to be purchased from which suppliers. Motorola has had a commodity team structure since 1982. Motorola said they also established a central Supplier Management Council and three regional councils for the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The councils followed the same mission and vision statements and shared decisions with each other to ensure consistency across the company. The use of councils encourages people in all areas of the company to approach supplier relationships from a common understanding. Collectively, the council and commodity structure forged unity and a willingness to share supplier information between business units and regions and a willingness to work together.

Often a blend of centralized and decentralized operations, the purchasing organizations assisted line management on both a company-wide and business unit level. These purchasing organizations were staffed by experienced and well-trained people who helped line managers consider multiple factors, such as product quality, total life-cycle costs, and technological capabilities, in deciding on which suppliers to use. Commercial firms also supported their supplier management strategies by streamlining the supply ordering and distribution process and building a technological infrastructure to facilitate company and supplier business contacts and supplier base management.

He noted that until recently, the Association had not adequately considered supplier firms in its dealings, citing an example of how an acquisition reform that prime contractors support can have unanticipated consequences on suppliers.

However, suppliers that worked for more than one prime contractor suffered as each contractor established its own processes. In 1997, the Association expanded its membership to supplier firms and created a council to represent the suppliers\u2019 views.", "Similarly, while DOD is interested in whether its prime contractors choose capable suppliers, it has traditionally taken a hands-off approach to how prime contractors deal with suppliers. DOD officials attributed this approach to a concern that direct dealings between the government and subcontractors would be contrary to the legal doctrine of privity of contract.", "Privity refers to the direct relationship that arises between the parties to a contract as a result of their mutual obligations. Thus, there is privity between DOD and the prime contractor on a contract but not between DOD and the suppliers because there is no contract between them. According to DOD officials, the traditional concern about privity of contract has distanced DOD and its program managers from supplier management concerns. Although privity concerns might preclude communications that could imply a contractual relationship between DOD and a subcontractor or that would be inconsistent with the existing contracts, they need not be a barrier to other forms of communication with suppliers or to efforts to improve relationships between and among the government, a prime contractor, and suppliers. Moreover, privity concerns may be reduced by the parties agreeing that the government may have direct communications with suppliers. We believe such communication appears to have facilitated innovation and teamwork on the JDAM program.", "While the role played by DOD through the Army program office on the BAT program was traditional regarding supplier relationships, a very different role was played by the JDAM program office. Officials were significantly involved in the JDAM effort from the beginning of the program, taking a much more open, hands-on role in dealing with potential prime contractors and their suppliers. This approach set the expectation that supplier selection and management would figure prominently into program success and DOD\u2019s selection of the prime contractor. According to DOD officials, the more active approach was taken because affordability was the top program objective. DOD program officials visited and evaluated the performance of the individual suppliers to the two competing prime contractors. They used the actual performance of the suppliers and the prime contractors during an early development phase as a key factor for choosing the prime contractor and supplier team that would win the competition to complete development and enter production.", "DOD\u2019s traditional reticence in guiding supplier relationships represents a significant difference in the environment defense prime contractors operate in compared with commercial firms. Commercial firms are driven toward optimizing supplier relationships to gain a competitive edge in winning the customer\u2019s business and they can act unilaterally in garnering those relationships. In the acquisition of weapon systems, DOD is the customer on the one hand and on the other it shares responsibility for managing and directing the program with the prime contractor.

Specific practices included using stringent supplier selection criteria, relying on a manageable number of suppliers, maintaining or developing some level of competition between suppliers, and periodically assessing the supplier base against company goals. A desired result of such a process was a strong supplier base that companies can effectively manage. For example, Texas Instruments Semiconductor Group said their selection process meant there was a reliance on a few, very capable suppliers, a stronger relationship between the company and suppliers, and stronger business processes for both companies when they interacted.", "Knowing the importance of suppliers to their business success, the leading commercial companies used specific criteria to select suppliers and the supply chains they represented. Companies selected suppliers based on needs for supplier backup, capacity requirements, competition needs, suppliers\u2019 product range, and the complexity of the product. In their selection procedures, the companies weighed the total cost of doing business with each supplier, not just the sales price of the item. The total cost of doing business included tangible factors, such as quality, and intangible factors, such as effective communications. If the companies only considered lowest price suppliers, then their total costs might be higher because of quality, delivery, and service problems. Using the total cost approach in conjunction with selecting a limited number of suppliers was seen as important to building more sophisticated supplier relationships.", "Another key selection criterion best practice companies stressed was comprehensive quality. They expected their suppliers to have a comprehensive quality system, generally based on ISO-9000, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, or other quality standard systems. For example, Motorola required all of its suppliers to show intent to apply for the Baldrige competition. Xerox used a multinational supplier quality survey and an on-site assessment as part of its supplier selection. As a result, many companies often replaced expensive incoming part or item inspection of selected supplies with supplier certification programs or the assurance of high performance capabilities through the supplier selection process. Baxter Healthcare Corporation, for example, developed a quality history for supplier certification. By certifying the supplier\u2019s test methods, Baxter minimized its own product testing and eliminated some receiving and inspection functions. Its plants did not have to wait for supplier shipments to be inspected or hold inventories anticipating poor quality materials or delayed shipments.", "The companies evaluated suppliers using assessment methods such as certifications, surveys, inspections, statistical process control, and quality audits. The method varied by the importance of the product and how much performance assurance was desired. Companies started by thoroughly analyzing their supplier base needs, drawing on information about business requirements, industry performance trends, supplier base performance and supply chain management, and potential suppliers.

At the time of our review, Toyota Motor Sales officials said they planned to reduce the number of suppliers providing goods and services, such as advertising, from 1,500 to about 1,000. Of these, only 100 suppliers accounted for 80 percent of the company\u2019s indirect purchasing expenditures. In 1986, Motorola began implementing its supplier reduction strategy, which relied on creating a base group of suppliers that stayed the same unless performance fell or new suppliers offered technological innovations.

The JDAM program had a much greater emphasis on a commercial-like, long-term supplier strategy at the outset of the program.", "Of the 10 BAT suppliers we met with, 5 were original suppliers and 4 were replacements for original suppliers that had trouble with their components. Northrop Grumman reported one new supplier was added when the Army decided to use a different\u2014and faster\u2014missile to carry the BAT submunition, which required a different technology. Second-tier supplier F, the third BAT supplier for a particular component, stated that the two previous suppliers had good track records and lower bids, but after 2 years of development neither could produce the part within specifications. A company official said it took the firm\u2019s experience and special processes to make the part within specifications. On another component, second-tier supplier D was the back-up source until the first supplier \u201cbowed out.\u201d If supplier D had been selected earlier, company officials said they could have used their knowledge in establishing the requirements. Two other firms informed us that they became BAT suppliers after the original suppliers had failed.

Some suppliers were picked by the contractor to meet unique JDAM requirements, such as the high-volume requirements. Others were used because of their performance and preferred supplier status. Some dual sources were used to address component criticality and risk issues. JDAM suppliers confirmed the rigor of the process. Supplier M said that the process was much more involved than that of other weapon systems, typified by an intensive site survey process of first-tier suppliers.

For example, each Chrysler supplier had a Chrysler person knowledgeable about the supplier\u2019s business to contact for all supplier dealings for that commodity. Typically, the leading companies also interacted with key suppliers in close teaming arrangements that facilitated sharing information. Commonly called integrated product teams (IPT), members worked together so that design, manufacturing, and cost issues were considered together. Team members were encouraged to participate as partners in meeting project goals and to interact frequently. In addition, some companies collocated suppliers with their own people or set up central working facilities with suppliers for working out issues such as how a product might be improved or be made less expensive. Motorola and Xerox saw such teams as a key vehicle for facilitating early supplier involvement in their products\u2014one of their primary strategies. Motorola said key suppliers had building access and came in many times during a week to work with Motorola engineers.", "To establish an objective basis for communicating about performance, the leading commercial companies set performance measures and expectations for each supplied product and service, using key elements such as quality, responsiveness, timeliness, and cost. These factors were consistent with the firms\u2019 selection criteria, and the product developer made clear to suppliers what these elements meant and how they would be used in business decisions. Most leading companies also provided periodic \u201creport cards\u201d and met formally with their key suppliers to discuss issues such as performance evaluation results, comparison of the suppliers with their competitors on key quality measures, customer and supplier improvement strategies, and future business opportunities. For example, Plow and Hearth reported sending suppliers a quarterly performance summary that supplemented continuous supplier feedback. Also, once a week, Plow and Hearth officials representing merchandising, product returns, quality assurance, and inventory control discussed specific supplier issues.", "The customer and the supplier generally worked together to develop milestones, commitments, and deliverables for corrective action. Suppliers needing improvement met with Plow and Hearth for a \u201ccustomer-supplier alignment,\u201d which clarified each other\u2019s services and problems and developed corrective action plans. Commercial firms typically provided their suppliers technical assistance to help improve performance that was supported by sophisticated company, supplier, and industry information systems and reports. Examples of such assistance included quality audits, benchmarking, training, newsletters, and direct help on production techniques. Specific assistance provided by individual firms is shown in figure 3.4.", "Commercial companies also extended their attention to lower-tier suppliers. This level of attention was in recognition that lower-tier products accounted for a significant portion of product costs and significantly affected the final product\u2019s performance. Few companies reported direct involvement with lower-tier suppliers if they were satisfied with the first-tier supplier\u2019s supplier management processes and performance. While not directly managing lower-tier suppliers, the companies had ongoing knowledge of these suppliers\u2019 efforts through communication and monitoring of first-tier activities. More importantly, their own commitment to optimal supplier relationships helped them to look for and expect the same commitment from their own suppliers. For example, Honda reported working with first-tier suppliers to develop self-reliance or the capability to effectively manage their own supply chains. In other cases, companies took a more hands-on approach; Chrysler said they worked with first-tier suppliers to jointly manage lower-tier suppliers, extending all the way to the raw material stage.", "Most of the prime contractors informed us that they had processes for setting supplier performance expectations, assessing supplier performance, and providing feedback. McDonnell Douglas continuously measures supplier performance and reports to suppliers quarterly.

For example, to remain a bronze supplier, the lowest level of preferred supplier, quality must be at 98 percent or better, and delivery must be within the 15 days prior to delivery date at least 95 percent of the time. AlliedSignal incorporates performance criteria in its agreements measuring cost, quality, delivery, and service.

Boeing\u2019s Space and Systems Group had established a process for evaluating selected suppliers semiannually on performance factors that included cost, delivery, quality, and technical contribution.", "Similarly, Honeywell Defense Avionics Systems suppliers received monthly reports detailing their performance and were rated on quality, delivery, and any shortfall. Honeywell also met quarterly with the executives of their top suppliers to discuss short- and long-term strategies and improvement plans. Northrop Grumman formally discussed performance results biannually with suppliers, supplementing other sources of performance feedback. The company recently began a supplier management program as a result of its Baldrige self-assessment that identified supplier management as an area for improvement. In 1997, the firm initiated a Subcontractor Performance Assessment procedure and planned to give suppliers a color-coded score based on performance in 16 areas, such as submitting data on time, and performance of a supplier\u2019s subtiers.

The initiative established teams as the preferred method for DOD to perform acquisition functions. This direction is consistent with the teaming that the leading commercial companies are doing. All of the defense prime contractors we met with stated that they were using IPTs. For example, Motorola said the Land Warrior program had many major development subcontracts, with a significant amount of new design, that were set up as teaming agreements.

McDonnell Douglas tailored corporate performance measures to JDAM and used a variety of methods to collect performance data. Suppliers generally received monthly reports or program reviews for JDAM. Informally, the IPTs allowed for ongoing assessments and responses to problems. Second-tier suppliers believed that the technical assistance provided by McDonnell Douglas and upper-tier firms was extensive and was facilitated by the IPTs.

Supplier D officials stated the original design for its component had a costly scrap rate and was not likely to be producible at high rates. The company invested its own funds to design an alternate part that met government specifications and could cut costs in half. However, the alternate part was not used because it challenged certain requirements.", "Some suppliers thought that the prime contractor was not serious about adopting acquisition reforms and other changes in the upcoming low-rate production phase. Supplier B noted that although the prime contractor would say it removed some of the detailed military specifications from the program, the prime contractor had retained its own tight requirements anyway. The supplier also stated that the low-rate production proposal contained requirements that had been waived during development. Supplier A noted that the low-rate production contract referred to documents to be used as \u201cguidelines,\u201d which were military specifications. Another supplier questioned why its component still needed government source inspection after passing its own ISO-certified quality manufacturing inspection and prime contractor inspection, considering that none of its products had failed the government inspection. The supplier shared concerns with the prime contractor and the Army regarding the added cost and effort for retesting thousands of production components, but the prime contractor included it in its contract proposal. Other suppliers believed that the continued use of military specifications limited their ability to contribute to the product and reflected the customer\u2019s lack of trust.", "The president of one second-tier company said that commercial firms kept suppliers more abreast of business plans and that he was confident that his commercial investments would pay off. Because of the uncertain nature of defense contracting, the president explained that he had to look at each defense order as a stand-alone order, which was an expensive way to do business. For example, he stated that while he invested the firm\u2019s own funds for commercial tooling because of its long-term potential, he would not invest the firm\u2019s funds in BAT tooling because the return was too uncertain. He said that although the 19,000 BAT units planned for production were held out as a carrot, the probability of the company working through the entire production was low because the program could be downsized, canceled, or the prime contractor might award later production to another supplier.", "One second-tier supplier did have a long-term agreement with a first-tier customer that had not worked out well. According to one supplier official, the firm established a fixed-unit price for its component based on the volume forecast. They noted that while the supplier made good on its prices, the customer had only met 30 percent of the forecast volume, and had been inaccurate from the start. One supplier manager said that they typically invested their own funds in engineering efforts because with most customers, the return from large volume production covered the investment. On BAT, they lost money with this approach. The official said that they will not renew their long-term agreement with the first-tier customer and that any new agreements for research and development will be on a customer-funded basis.", "Some suppliers had more positive experiences on the program. Supplier E officials said that they helped formulate the requirements in the development contract and that they had worked with another supplier to compromise on space utilization. Supplier F also believed the prime contractor was open to suggestions.

The officials stated that the development contract with DOD was very clearly defined and they were compelled to pass explicit requirements down to their suppliers, regardless of prior dealings with those suppliers. The officials said one difficulty in obtaining supplier input was that the program started with a \u201cbuild-to-print\u201d development package based on specifications. Every drawing referred to military specifications we were told. As a result, the prime contractor prepared and sent technical documents to potential suppliers requesting that they bid on the component as designed. They said they did not solicit input from suppliers even in low-rate initial production because the design was set and it would be too expensive to make substantial design changes. DOD disagreed that it has exerted such control over the BAT design. According to DOD, the Army did not have control of design when the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase started, but only established a functional baseline. DOD stated that the contractor was responsible for developing the specifications and passing on requirements to subcontractors.", "Prime contractor officials believed the low-rate production phase of the program would have more latitude in the requirements passed down to suppliers, but that many customer-imposed requirements would persist. They stated they have tried to use the miliary specifications only as guidelines wherever possible, but the customer still wanted the same product. Consequently, many of their direct suppliers incorporated the original military specifications in their low-rate production contract proposals.", "Prime contractor officials stated that they have forwarded any business forecast information they received from their customer to the suppliers. They noted that one of the reasons the firm invited the DOD customer to a supplier conference was so that suppliers could get the information directly. They said they wanted their suppliers to stay interested in the product because they wanted their suppliers to invest in equipment and tooling for BAT.

However, the approach did receive praise from key suppliers for the types of relationships it fostered.", "The prime contractor and all four key first-tier suppliers informed us that the strong alliance between participants was based on trust and mutually shared goals. The parties agreed to long-term relationships that, according to the prime contractor, was the optimal way to achieve program target costs, high quality, and schedule performance. This approach was strongly supported by the Army customer. Vice presidents from the key first-tier suppliers were members of an executive IPT, which made them strategic partners in the program\u2019s development and design process. Participants had to focus on how to make the best product as a whole because of the top priority DOD placed on decreasing the cost. To achieve cost reductions, the program manager at the time said the prime contractor had to turn to their suppliers. These characteristics encouraged suppliers at different tiers to invest more of their own resources in design and performance improvements.", "Suppliers echoed the importance of developing a strong alliance between the parties. In highlighting differences between JDAM and other projects, supplier M said the \u201cseamless\u201d teams on JDAM stood out. The supplier said the prime contractor did not take a strong-armed role but asked its subcontractors to participate as partners. Supplier N said the prime contractor held clear authority over the program, but the development of new solutions to win the contract was the result of great teamwork. A second-tier supplier said the teaming arrangement was a lot closer than with other weapon systems. These arrangements also offered the second-tier suppliers the opportunity to add value because they were involved early in the design phase.", "The JDAM environment was the byproduct of actions taken by DOD, the prime contractor, and the suppliers. Suppliers participated in the weapon\u2019s design and had open communications with the prime contractor. Unlike the detailed specifications for BAT, DOD had stated the JDAM requirements in terms of key performance parameters, which allowed the contractor teams room to make design trade-offs. Instead of passing down specific design requirements to the suppliers, the prime contractor delegated design authority and configuration control where possible, according to DOD program officials. This added responsibility gave the suppliers a stake in the product design and ultimate success. The suppliers retained ownership of their design responsibilities as long as they met the cost and performance specifications. According to the DOD program manager at the time, the lifetime warranty DOD demanded of JDAM also had the consequence of increasing supplier involvement. He said the suppliers were willing to accept the liability as long as they had a voice in the design.", "Second-tier suppliers reported similar team participation experiences.

The supplier was asked how it would meet requirements and also to pose alternatives. At no time was the first-tier contractor dictatorial. The supplier was treated as an expert and its opinions were respected.", "The planned stability and high procurement volume of the program facilitated the building of long-term relationships on the JDAM program by allowing the prime contractor to guarantee suppliers a certain amount of work and obtain their commitment, according to DOD program officials. One of the major steps that DOD took to facilitate this was to state in the contract that the government would neither compete the production nor ask the prime contractor to compete the suppliers for the duration of the commitment, as long as the program\u2019s performance specifications and cost goals were met. Prime contractor officials agreed that the long-term aspect of the program was very important and believed that suppliers were attracted to the high volume and long-term mutually beneficial relationships that resulted.", "The suppliers agreed that the JDAM program was attractive from a business standpoint and they did not believe they were contending with a low volume, annually funded program.

Suppliers could fit JDAM into their own strategic plans because the program offered long-term stability\u2014they would be together for 5 or 6 years if they won the contract. Supplier U said they signed a general memorandum of understanding for 5 years with its first-tier customer. Most suppliers also reported that there was extensive sharing of business information. According to supplier A, the prime contractor shared project information, scope, scale, and business forecasts with them, which they shared with their second-tier suppliers.

Suppliers are critical in terms of both the amount of the finished product they make, as well as the technological innovation included in the final product. The leading commercial firms have found that developing sophisticated relationships with key suppliers gives them a competitive edge in the cost, features, quality, and development time of their products. If such relationships were not beneficial from a business standpoint, they would not be cultivated because they take commitment, effort, and resources. DOD and its prime contractors realize the criticality of suppliers to the success of weapon system programs and DOD has emphasized the selection of capable suppliers. Nonetheless, a gap can be seen between how supplier relationships have traditionally operated on weapon system programs and how they operate in the leading commercial firms. DOD\u2019s experience with JDAM may show how to narrow that gap. Clearly, the need exists. The persistence of problems on weapon system programs, coupled with DOD\u2019s desire to modernize more quickly, spotlight the need to get better outcomes from new weapon programs, particularly in terms of development cycle time and cost.", "Best commercial supplier practices, when analyzed in the aggregate, can be seen as four traits that operate in a system that is self-sustaining because it provides mutual benefits to both suppliers and the product developer. When this construct is applied to a traditional DOD program, gaps can be seen in two traits: (1) providing central support for optimum supplier relationships and (2) creating an environment whereby key suppliers see their extra commitment and effort as worthwhile. Experience on the BAT program shows that weaknesses in these two areas can diminish the effect of other best practices, such as the use of a rigorous supplier selection process, teams, and rating procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Central Support", "paragraphs": ["In the commercial sector, the product developer can unilaterally commit to centrally supporting better supplier relationships and can institute the requisite organizational changes that make a company a preferred customer. In the defense sector, DOD and prime contractors share this responsibility. It is difficult for the prime contractors to translate the desire for better supplier relations into tangible differences in the actual relationships without the active support of DOD. To some extent, the prime contractors have their own history to overcome; the Aerospace Industries Association, for example, noted that until recently, the Association itself had not adequately considered supplier firms. Similarly, DOD has traditionally focused its attention on the prime contractors; it has encouraged the selection of capable suppliers but adopted a hands-off approach regarding supplier relationships.", "DOD\u2019s involvement is important in influencing the prime contractors\u2019 commitment to better supplier relations and the extent to which such commitment permeates the different tiers of suppliers. DOD shares this responsibility because on any given weapon systems program, it is the customer, financier, requirements setter, and co-manager. One reason for the distance DOD has kept between itself and suppliers is the concern over violating the privity of contract that exists between the prime and its suppliers. However, the role played by the program office on JDAM shows how critical DOD\u2019s support can be to the value placed on supplier relationships at the outset of a program, without crossing the line on privity. Essential to DOD\u2019s influence on that program was the program office\u2019s weighing the choice of suppliers heavily in selecting a prime, supported by clear action\u2014such as substantive visits to the suppliers during the competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Rewarding Environment", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the prime contractors share in fostering an environment in which suppliers believe that there are true incentives for doing more than complying with the contract\u2019s terms.

DOD believes that current policies and efforts address some of the concerns raised in the report. These initiatives include (1) reducing the use of detailed specifications; (2) placing decision-making authority with the prime contractor; and (3) using IPTs, cost as an independent variable, past performance information, and integrated program team contractor reviews. DOD stated that, in addition to the extensive acquisition reform training currently offered, a JDAM case study was being prepared for release this year. Finally, DOD noted that (1) the biggest impediment to acquisition strategies that support good supplier relationships is the financial stability of the program and (2) stability is considerably beyond the control of any program manager or service. Nonetheless, DOD stated that long-term relationships can be established that are contingent upon the program\u2019s continuation under commercially acceptable terms and conditions.", "We believe that some of DOD\u2019s current policies\u2014such as less detailed specifications and cost as an independent variable\u2014can give a program manager the latitude needed to create an environment that fosters greater supplier involvement. Others, such as IPTs, represent tools program managers can use to build and maintain relationships. Although these policies and tools are not directed at supplier relationships, they can facilitate stronger relationships and are at the same time dependent on the relationships. A supplier policy could thus clarify the role expected of program managers in cultivating supplier relationships to increase the chances for program success. We believe that the JDAM case study DOD plans to incorporate into its training curriculum could help communicate a supplier policy by sharing not only the specific experiences of the JDAM program, but also by making the broader points that program managers (1) recognize their responsibility to be fully aware of the activities and progress being made by key suppliers, regardless of tier; (2) be made aware that, with appropriate regard for privity concerns, they may be more directly involved with suppliers; and (3) be encouraged to do so for the benefit of the program.", "As DOD points out, there are factors that create instability beyond the control of a program manager or service. These could include reductions necessitated by an unexpected military operation or congressional direction.

Nonetheless, stability is but one of several factors that can affect a program manager\u2019s ability to build trust and commitment among suppliers. Other factors, which are more controllable, include setting reasonable expectations about production quantities and schedules; setting a cost, schedule, and performance baseline that has a practical probability of being executed within available funding; and taking steps to ensure that prime contractors reward high-performing suppliers, such as with simplified business arrangements and increased business."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
