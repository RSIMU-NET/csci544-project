DOD leaders have expressed concern that rising compensation costs may not be sustainable in the future and could crowd out other important investments needed to recapitalize equipment and infrastructure. Given the looming fiscal challenges facing the nation in the 21st century, GAO believes it is time for a baseline review of all federal programs to ensure that they are efficiently meeting their objectives. Under the Comptroller General's authority, GAO (1) assessed whether DOD's approach to compensation provides adequate transparency over costs; (2) identified recent trends in active duty compensation, and how costs have been allocated to cash and benefits; and (3) reviewed how active duty servicemembers perceive their compensation and whether DOD has effectively explained the value of the military compensation package to its members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's historical piecemeal approach to military compensation has resulted in a lack of transparency that creates an inability to (1) identify the total cost of military compensation to the U.S. government and (2) assess the allocation of total compensation investments to cash and benefits. No single source exists to show the total cost of military compensation, and tallying the full cost requires synthesizing about a dozen information sources from four federal departments and the Office of Management and Budget. Without adequate transparency, decision makers do not have a true picture of what it costs to compensate servicemembers. They also lack sufficient information to identify long-term trends, determine how best to allocate available resources to ensure the optimum return on compensation investments, and better assess the efficiency and effectiveness of DOD's current compensation system in meeting recruiting and retention goals. To address this and other major business transformation challenges in a more strategic and integrated fashion, GAO recently recommended the creation of a chief management official at DOD. Transparency over military compensation is critical because costs to provide compensation are substantial and rising, with over half of the costs allocated to noncash and deferred benefits. In fiscal year 2004, it cost the federal government about $112,000, on average, to provide annual compensation to active duty enlisted and officer personnel. Adjusted for inflation, the total cost of providing active duty compensation increased about 29 percent from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004, from about $123 to $158 billion. During this time, health care was one of the major cost drivers, increasing 69 percent to about $23 billion in fiscal year 2004. In addition, military compensation is weighted more toward benefits compared with other government and private sector civilian compensation systems. Furthermore, less than one in five service members will serve 20 years of active duty service to become eligible for retirement benefits. Increasing compensation costs make the need to address the appropriateness and reasonableness of the compensation mix and the long-term affordability and sustainability of the system more urgent. DOD survey results and analysis of GAO focus groups and survey data have shown that servicemembers are dissatisfied and harbor misperceptions about their pay and benefits in part because DOD does not effectively educate them about the competitiveness of their total compensation packages. About 80 percent of the 400 servicemembers that GAO surveyed believed they would earn more as civilians; in contrast, a 2002 study showed that servicemembers generally earn more cash compensation alone than 70 percent of like-educated civilians. Servicemembers also expressed confusion over aspects of their compensation, like retirement, and many complained that benefits were eroding despite recent efforts by Congress and DOD to enhance pay and benefits. By not systematically educating servicemembers about the value of their total compensation, DOD is essentially allowing a culture of dissatisfaction and misunderstanding to perpetuate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The military compensation system has had the same basic structure since  the end of World War II, but over time, it has become a complex and  piecemeal culmination and accretion of pay, benefits, and special tax  preferences\u2014each designed to meet a specific need in managing an  evolving force. Today, the total military compensation package includes  dozens of pays and allowances; several noncash benefits to take care of  troops who, increasingly, are married with children; certain preferences; as  well as lifetime retirement pay and health care for retirees and their  families. Valuing military service is complicated. Serving in the military  offers personal and professional rewards but also requires many  sacrifices\u2014frequent moves and jobs that are arduous and sometimes  dangerous. Moreover, military culture is paternalistic, and servicemembers  expect the United States to take care of them and their families as reward  for their service. Since the late 1990s, the Department of Defense (DOD)  and Congress have sought to improve military pay to make it more  competitive. Congress has improved benefits by repealing the unpopular  REDUX retirement system in 1999 and expanding health coverage to cover  retirees and their families for life in 2002, among other enhancements.  Even with these efforts, however, reports of dissatisfaction with some pays  and benefits among military members still abound, and public perceptions  linger that enlisted military members and their families are living in  poverty.", "In recent years, Congress has taken steps to fund enhanced compensation  and benefit programs for active duty and reserve personnel at a time when  many military personnel are spending months or years away from home,  often in harm\u2019s way, as the nation is heavily engaged in the war on  terrorism. Moreover, as of 2005 DOD\u2019s budget had grown to nearly half a  trillion dollars, including supplemental funding to support activities related  to fighting terrorism. In our recent report on the challenges facing the  United States in the 21st century, we expressed concerns about whether  the current trends are both affordable and sustainable. Many federal  programs\u2014such as military compensation\u2014were designed decades ago to  address earlier challenges related to labor markets, security conditions,  organizational structures, and compensation strategies of prior eras. Some  DOD leaders have expressed similar concerns, specifically that the  increasingly expensive compensation system could crowd out other  important investments needed to recapitalize aging defense-related  equipment and infrastructure. Moreover, DOD leaders are particularly  concerned about the growth in compensation entitlements\u2014such as health  care and concurrent receipts for disability and retirement\u2014that do not  have a significant impact on recruiting and retention. In 2005, the  compensation debate was reopened when mounting concerns within the  department about the growth in compensation cost\u2014and the limited  management flexibility afforded by the current system\u2014led the Secretary  of Defense to form a committee to comprehensively assess the approach  the department uses to compensate its personnel.", "Given the nation\u2019s increasing fiscal imbalance, we believe it is time for a  baseline review of all major federal programs and polices, including  military compensation, to ensure that they are efficiently and effectively  meeting their objectives and well adapted to 21st century realities. We  recognize that this will not be a simple or easy process and careful  consideration must be given to any compensation changes because the  stakes are high. We are convinced, however, that this reexamination offers  compelling opportunities to both redress our current and projected fiscal  imbalance while better positioning government to meet the new challenges  and changing expectations of the 21st century.", "In light of the above and under the statutory authority of the Comptroller  General, we (1) assessed whether DOD\u2019s current approach to military  compensation provides adequate transparency over total costs to the  federal government; (2) identified the recent trends in active duty military  compensation costs, and how compensation has been allocated to cash and  benefits; and (3) reviewed how active duty servicemembers perceive their  compensation and whether DOD has effectively explained the value of the  military compensation package to its members.", "In conducting this review, we limited our scope to the compensation  system for active duty military personnel. Numerous methods were used to  gather and assess information for this work. We reviewed congressional  justification budget books for DOD as well as the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA). We calculated the federal tax expenditure and accrual cost of  some programs, such as those run by the VA. We conducted 40 focus  groups with over 400 servicemembers across all four services and enlisted  and officer pay grades at eight military installations in the continental  United States. While the information from the focus groups is not  generalizable to the entire DOD population of active duty servicemembers,  it provides valuable context as to servicemembers\u2019 perceptions about their  compensation and augments DOD survey findings. We reviewed DOD\u2019s  Status of Forces survey data on satisfaction with compensation. The 2002  survey administered to over 30,000 servicemembers had a response rate of  32 percent. DOD has conducted and reported on research to assess the  impact of nonresponse rate on overall estimates. It found that, among other  characteristics, junior enlisted personnel (in pay grades E1 to E4),  servicemembers who do not have a college degree, and members in  services other than the Air Force were more likely to be nonrespondents.  We have no reason to believe that potential nonresponse bias not otherwise  accounted for by DOD\u2019s research is substantial for the variables we studied  in this report. Therefore, we concluded the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. See appendix I for more detailed  information on our scope and methodology.

DOD is also the largest employer and trainer of young adults in the United  States, recruiting about 200,000 individuals into active duty in 2004\u2014the  majority of them recent high school graduates. Although DOD competes  with academia and other employers for these qualified people, the  military\u2019s distinctive culture and job experience are unique from any other  government or private sector employer. To maintain national security, DOD  must meet its human capital needs by recruiting, retaining, and motivating  sufficient numbers of qualified people.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness is  principally responsible for establishing active duty compensation policy.  However, reservists fall under the active duty compensation policy if they  have been mobilized for active duty. The department also sponsors regular  studies on military compensation called the Quadrennial Review of Military  Compensation\u2014most recently completed in 2002\u2014that typically focus on  specific issues like flexibility in compensation. In 2005, the Secretary of  Defense formed a committee to study military pay in order to seek ways to  maintain a cost-effective, ready force. Although the structure of the military  compensation system has been largely unchanged since the end of World  War II, with the advent of the all-volunteer force in 1973, the system has  been enhanced by adding various pays, benefits, and tax preferences over  time. Currently, the system is a complex mix of pays, benefits, and tax  preferences\u2014about a third of which are deferred until after the completion  of active duty service.", "In the 1970s, DOD and Congress adopted the concept of \u201cregular military  compensation\u201d\u2014which is defined as the sum of basic pay, allowances for  housing and subsistence, and the federal tax advantage\u2014to describe the  foundation of servicemembers\u2019 cash compensation which can be used to  compare military and civilian pay. Basic pay\u2014which is predicated on rank  and tenure of service\u2014is the largest component of regular military  compensation. In addition to regular military compensation, there are over  60 authorized special and incentive pays\u2014generally offered as incentives  to undertake or continue service in a particular specialty or type of duty  assignment\u2014as well as the combat zone tax exclusion, which generally  makes income earned while serving in a combat zone nontaxable.  Furthermore, DOD offers a wide range of benefits, many of which are  directed at members with family obligations.

Lack of transparency over costs is in part due to the sheer  number of pays and benefits that make up the military compensation  system and to the lack of a single source to show total cost of  compensation. Moreover, the lack of principles to guide military  compensation policy is a long-standing problem for DOD."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost of Compensation Is Scattered Across Many Budgets", "paragraphs": ["A total cost to compensate servicemembers does not exist in a single  source for decision makers to view, and transparency is further hindered  by the sheer number and types of pays, benefits, and tax preferences in the  military compensation system. Good business practice requires adequate  transparency over investments of resources, especially in times of fiscal  balance constraint. In a typical civilian firm, managers would know the  costs of compensation among other investments, such as capital and  technology, in order to make decisions on the most efficient use of  resources because decision makers have to consider both the obvious and  implicit costs of their actions. Furthermore, federal accounting standards  are aimed at providing relevant and reliable cost information to assist  Congress and executives in making decisions about allocating federal  resources. Therefore, we believe it is good business practice for decision  makers to establish transparency over total compensation costs, including  the long-term cost implications of current decisions.", "Because of the lack of a single source of compensation costs and the  number and types of pays and benefits that combine to make up the  compensation system, we had to gather information from multiple sources  to compile our estimate of the total costs to provide military compensation.  Funding for the numerous components of compensation resides in  different budgets (see table 1). For example, the funding for cash  compensation that servicemembers receive today, such as basic pay and  housing allowance, are in DOD\u2019s military personnel budget. Despite its  name, this title does not include all of the funding provided for military  compensation and benefits. Funding for noncash benefits, such as health  care and education assistance, is displayed partially in the department\u2019s  Operation and Maintenance budget as well as in the VA\u2019s budget. And,  deferred benefits like retirees\u2019 health care, which represent a significant  portion of the costs of compensation, have long-term cost associations and  are not adequately visible. Funding for military retirement is budgeted for  on an accrual basis in the military personnel budget, as is health care for  retirees over 65 years of age and their dependents. However, health care  funding for retirees less than 65 years of age and their dependents is  appropriated annually in the Operation and Maintenance budget as part of  the Defense Health Program. In addition to DOD\u2019s deferred benefits, some  servicemembers are eligible for veteran\u2019s benefits after they leave the  military. These benefits, such as health care, pensions, and other  compensations, are funded annually through the VA\u2019s budget. Furthermore,  the lost federal tax revenue\u2014the federal tax benefit servicemembers\u2019  receive because part of their cash compensation is nontaxable\u2014is not  displayed in a DOD budget exhibit for decision makers to consider when  assessing new proposals or changes to the compensation system. This  amount is significant: we estimate that it totaled about $6.4 billion in fiscal  year 2004. Furthermore, we should note that our calculations  underestimate the impact of compensation costs to the federal government  annually, because we did not include significant outlays for the unfunded  liabilities for current retirees\u2019 pay and health care benefits that are in the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s annual budget, which totaled $34.4 billion in  fiscal year 2004. These unfunded liabilities are being paid out of current  appropriations, because the government has not always set aside monies  for future liabilities. In fact, the government did not start setting aside  monies for retirement pay until fiscal year 1985 or for health care benefits  for retirees until 2003.", "Since the costs of compensation are scattered across the federal budget, no  one organization has visibility over the total costs of military  compensation. The lack of transparency over total costs to compensate  servicemembers impacts decision makers\u2019 ability to manage the system,  including (1) assessing the long-term cost implications, (2) determining  how best to allocate resources to ensure an optimum return on investment,  and (3) assessing the efficiency of the current compensation system on  DOD\u2019s ability to meet recruiting and retention goals. As a result, the current  compensation system is made up of a number of benefits and over 60  different pays and allowances that have been added piecemeal over the  years to address specific needs. The main problem with this piecemeal  approach is that it does not consider the system as a whole\u2014and, as a  result, new initiatives are considered in isolation and often with little  consideration to how these will contribute to the ability of the military  compensation system to efficiently meet recruiting and retention goals and  if resources are being allocated to ensure the optimum return on  compensation investments within current and expected resource levels.  For example, in 2000 Congress enhanced retirement benefits to include  health care for retirees over 65 years old and their dependents. This  additional benefit came at significant costs, about $6.5 billion accrual  funding in fiscal year 2004 alone, and with little evidence of whether, and if  so how it contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the  compensation system in terms of recruiting and retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Principles to Guide Military Compensation Policy Is a Long-standing Problem", "paragraphs": ["\u201cthe relationships between the individual components of compensation and their systemic  interrelationships as a coherent structure remain largely implicit rather than explicit.

Of particular concern to the department was the growth in entitlement  spending for things like health care and the appropriateness of the mix of  in-service and post-service compensation. However, Congress has taken  certain measures to enhance post-service compensation or benefits that  DOD has not requested or in some cases has discouraged, such as the  expansion of concurrent receipts for retirees with disabilities.

Between fiscal years 2000 and 2004, overall compensation costs increased  from $123 billion to $158 billion\u2014or about 29 percent, in 2004 dollars.  Increases in costs were primarily driven by basic pay, allowances for  housing, and health care benefits. Furthermore, over half of the mix of  compensation costs is in the form of noncash and deferred benefits, which  stands in contrast to private sector and federal civilian organizations that  tend to rely more heavily on cash pay, and less on benefits.

Over this same time period, the  number of active duty troops remained relatively constant at about 1.4  million people, but military compensation costs grew from $123 billion to  $158 billion in fiscal year 2004 dollars annually. We estimate that the  average cost of compensation per servicemember (i.e., both enlisted  personnel and officers) in 2004 was about $112,000. Three things are  important to understand about our estimate. First, it is an average of what  it cost the government to compensate servicemembers, not what the  servicemembers \u201creceive in their paycheck.\u201d Individual cash compensation  will vary significantly based on rank and other factors. Furthermore, the  value of benefits also varies significantly depending on individual  circumstances. Second, because agencies other than DOD provide  compensation to servicemembers, our estimate includes costs  appropriated to The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of  Education, and the Department of Labor as well as the lost tax revenue as a  result of special tax advantages received by military personnel among  others. Third, it does not represent the marginal cost of adding  servicemembers, because it does not include significant costs for acquiring  and training military personnel. Such costs are substantial: DOD officials  told us that the cost for training can be as much as $36,000 per person if a  broad range of training costs are included.", "Recently, other defense analysts have made attempts to estimate the cost of  compensation. While these estimates vary based on what costs are  included in their analyses, the trends are the same. For example, the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that in 2002 compensation  cost about $99,000 per active duty servicemember. DOD\u2019s Office of  Program Analysis and Evaluations calculated all military compensation  costs to be approximately $117,000 per servicemember in fiscal year 2004.", "Other DOD officials have done similar work which included compensation  costs; for example, officials in the Office of Secretary of Defense told us  they recently estimated DOD\u2019s cost to add an additional servicemember at  about $109,000 per servicemember. Navy officials have done detailed work  to estimate the cost of manpower to the Navy, and concluded that for  example, the standard programming rate for officers in pay grade O4 was  about $126,000 and about $79,000 for enlisted personnel in pay grade E-7;  however, these costs do not include health care accrual costs for retirees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Compensation Components Driving Total Cost", "paragraphs": ["Growth in military compensation is attributed, primarily, to increases in   (1) basic pay, (2) allowances for housing, and (3) health care cost.", "Basic pay, found in the military personnel budget, increased from   $38.4 billion to $47.4 billion from fiscal years 2000 to 2004\u2014an increase  of about 23 percent\u2014and is the largest component of the compensation  system. DOD has asked for and Congress has supported sizable   across-the-board raises in basic pay in order to address concerns that  military members may be underpaid compared to comparable educated  civilian counterparts.

This effort  was to encourage servicemembers to live off-base and is consistent with  DOD\u2019s policy that states it is the department\u2019s preference for  servicemembers to live in civilian housing.", "Health care costs, including the costs for active duty servicemembers  and their dependents as well as accrual costs for retirees and their  dependents, increased from about $13.8 billion to $23.3 billion between  fiscal years 2000 and 2004, an increase of about 69 percent. This  increase is attributable, in part, to the fiscal year 2002 expansion of  health care benefits to retirees over 65 years of age to cover them and  their dependents for life. DOD raised concerns about expanding  entitlements, such as health care, that do not provide them leverage  over readiness. Also contributing is the higher-than-average increase in  costs of medical care. A 2003 study by CBO projected that if DOD\u2019s  medical spending increases at the same rate as per capita medical  spending in the United States, as a whole, it could increase to possibly  as much as $52 billion, or $38,000 per servicemember in 2002 dollars, by  2020. These costs include (1) current appropriations from the  operations and maintenance, defense health program budget, for  current servicemembers and their dependents; and (2) estimated  accrual costs for retirees and their dependents from the DOD actuary.

Not only do people heavily discount the value of  future benefits, less than one in five in the military will receive the most  lucrative and costly benefits offered by the military, specifically active duty  retirement pay and health care benefits. This is because only 17 percent of  those who join the military will ultimately serve a 20-year career and thus  earn nondisability retirement pay and health care for life. Figure 4  illustrates that based on current actuarial assumptions, 47 percent of new  officers and 15 percent of new enlistees attain 20 years of active duty  service. Thus, a significant portion of the compensation budget\u2014about   17 percent\u2014is being allocated to provide for future retirement pay and  health care for current active duty members who will become eligible to  receive these benefits even though a relatively small percent of the force  will ultimately receive these benefits.", "Taking together the personal discount rate and the relatively few  servicemembers who earn retirement benefits, defense compensation  analysts have suggested that this is an inefficient allocation of the overall  compensation investment. This insight is not new, and is likely a key reason  why private sector companies have such a high proportion of cash in their  compensation mix. Thus, DOD\u2019s current approach to compensation raises  serious questions about the reasonableness and appropriateness of  continuing to weight compensation toward noncash and deferred benefits.  However, DOD officials told us they feel that this efficiency argument  about entitlements is often outweighed by the desire in DOD and in  Congress to \u201ctake care\u201d of servicemembers and their families. This makes  adjusting compensation extremely difficult for decision makers, especially  amid concerns of eroding benefits, as discussed later in this report. When  concerns have arisen, benefits have often been added with little  consideration of what they will cost, how they compare with overall  market data, whether costs are affordable and sustainable over the long  term, or their effectiveness and return in terms of recruiting or retention.  The cumulative effect of this approach raises serious questions about the  reasonableness, appropriateness, affordability, and sustainability of the  current military compensation system in light of 21st century trends and  challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Lack of an Effective Communication and Education Effort on Compensation Has Allowed Servicemembers\u2019 Misperceptions and Concerns about Their Compensation to Perpetuate", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD surveys and analysis of our focus group findings and  survey data, many servicemembers are dissatisfied, and in some cases,  harbor significant misperceptions about their pay and benefits in part  because DOD does not effectively educate them about the competitiveness  of their total compensation packages.

Servicemembers  offered suggestions as to how to improve education on compensation by  consolidating information into a single location to obtain information on all  pay and benefit elements, while assuring it is clearly accessible and easy to  understand. DOD officials acknowledge that generally servicemembers do  not realize the full value of their compensation and have misperceptions  about their compensation.

In general,  officers tended to be more satisfied with base pay than were enlisted  personnel. Six of the eight focus groups with senior enlisted  servicemembers expressed dissatisfaction with their pay especially  compared to junior officers, who the senior enlisted servicemembers  perceive as having less experience and relying on them for on-the-job  training. While members recognized that there have been improvements in  the housing allowance with DOD\u2019s recent effort to increase the allowance,  they complained that these increases have had little effect because they  perceive that landlords increase rent by the same amount. Additionally, 8 of  our 40 focus groups discussed how it is unfair that servicemembers with  dependents receive more housing allowance than single members.  Moreover, members had varying perceptions about special pays and  incentives. Some were dissatisfied with the amount of special pays and  thought they should be increased. Others were dissatisfied because it was  unclear to them why everyone does not receive special pays. This is  particularly true for senior enlisted pay grades that are ineligible for  reenlistment bonuses. Furthermore, health care was most frequently  discussed as a source of dissatisfaction as well as satisfaction. While  servicemembers were satisfied with the minimal to no cost of health care  for themselves and their family, 31 of our 40 focus groups commented on  their dissatisfaction with the quality and access to health care. Additional  reasons of why servicemembers most frequently reported these  components and others as sources of dissatisfaction are listed in figure 5.", "While officers were relatively satisfied with base pay,  both officers and enlisted personnel expressed concern  about how their pay compares to civilians and the  inadequacy of base pay for enlisted members.  Servicemembers expressed much concern with the  subsequent raises of their rent due to the recent  increases of their housing allowance and the inequity of  higher housing allowances for members with dependents  compared to ones without dependents.     While servicemembers have high dissatisfaction with the  subsistence allowance, many inaccurately thought the  allowance covered themselves and their family.  Overall, both enlisted personnel and officers were  dissatisfied with special pays because they do not  understand why some are eligible to receive pays and  how the amounts of the pays are set.

This was evident during our focus groups as well:  servicemembers were often more satisfied with their compensation overall  than they were with specific aspects of their compensation, like the  housing allowance.", "Despite their dissatisfaction with many aspects of their compensation,  servicemembers expressed a clear preference for cash when asked if they  would make any changes to the compensation system. In 35 of our 40 focus  group sessions, servicemembers were willing to decrease their noncash  benefits if those benefits were replaced with cash. For example,  servicemembers in our focus groups said that they prefer frequenting   off-base discount stores more than the commissaries and exchanges. Also,  servicemembers in our focus groups said they would prefer the cash  equivalent to their medical coverage in order to obtain their own health  care because of their dissatisfaction with the present choice.  Servicemembers, especially junior officers who said they do not intend to  stay in the military for a full 20-year career, told us that they would prefer  DOD to give them cash that they could invest toward their retirement.  Comments like these, which we heard frequently, seem to support past  studies indicating servicemembers have a strong preference for cash  compensation today. However, such personal preferences were offset by  other concerns. Specifically, during 16 of our 40 focus group sessions,  servicemembers expressed concern that if they were to receive an increase  in cash it would not equal the value of their current noncash or deferred  benefit.

With the  costs scattered across the federal budget, decision makers within the  administration and Congress have insufficient transparency over the total  costs to compensate servicemembers, particularly with respect to deferred  costs, such as TRICARE\u2014which is projected to experience explosive  growth in the future. Moreover, changes to the compensation system are  made in a piecemeal fashion with an imprecise understanding of how the  changes will affect the total cost of compensation or what return on  investment decision makers should expect in terms of recruiting and  retention. This lack of transparency is becoming a more urgent matter  today as DOD and all federal agencies face tough choices ahead managing  the serious and growing long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation. For  DOD, these trade-offs could become as fundamental as investing in people  versus investing in hardware\u2014tough choices for a military with aging  infrastructure and equipment that could have readiness implications in the  future. Compiling comprehensive information about the total cost of  compensation\u2014as well as how it is allocated to cash and benefits\u2014would  be a crucial first step for the department and Congress to lay a foundation  for future decisions. Without such information, decision makers at DOD  and Congress do not know what it is costing the government to  compensate servicemembers. Furthermore, DOD has not performed the  analysis necessary to determine whether its current allocation to cash and  benefits is reasonable or appropriate. With dramatic increases in  compensation costs and an expanding budget\u2014mostly resulting from  supplemental appropriations from Congress to fund activities and  operations related to the Global War on Terrorism\u2014it is highly  questionable whether the rising costs and current allocations are  affordable and sustainable over the long term, especially when  supplemental funding recedes. Again, because DOD\u2019s compensation system  lacks transparency over these issues, the decision makers in the  administration and Congress cannot adequately assess whether DOD\u2019s  current approach to compensation is most efficiently meeting its needs for  both today and tomorrow.", "DOD also faces a sobering marketing challenge\u2014convincing skeptical  servicemembers that their compensation is competitive, overall. The  department\u2019s efforts thus far have been ineffective, and military members  are still dissatisfied with key aspects of their compensation, and harbor  several misperceptions and concerns that their compensation is eroding, or  will in the future. Pay comparison studies conducted by DOD, however,  show that military compensation is quite competitive even without  considering benefits. Recent efforts to improve benefits for retirees have  done little to address dissatisfaction among current members. This  dilemma exists for two reasons: (1) while servicemembers do not want to  lose benefits, they value future benefits much less than current cash; and  (2) fewer than one in five of those servicemembers who begin military  service will ultimately receive those benefits. Without more emphasis on  marketing the value of the cash pay as well as the total compensation  received overall, DOD will be unable to improve servicemember  perceptions, which could have implications for future recruiting and  retention efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve transparency over total compensation; to ensure the  compensation system is reasonable, appropriate, affordable, and  sustainable; and to better educate servicemembers about the  competitiveness of their compensation, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense take the following three actions:  Compile the total costs to provide military compensation and  communicate these costs to decision makers within the administration  and Congress\u2014perhaps as an annual exhibit as part of the President\u2019s  budget submission to Congress.

As we noted in our report, lack of transparency over costs is  in part due to the sheer number of pays and benefits that make up the  military compensation system and the lack of a single source to show total  cost of compensation. By establishing transparency of total military  compensation costs, DOD would have a more complete picture of how its  military members are being compensated and be in the best position to  compile these costs for decision makers.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation and stated that it is  already engaged in multiple simultaneous efforts to assess the overarching  military personnel compensation strategy.

We believe, as discussed in our  report, that these official sources are not effective, because of the  continuing dissatisfaction with compensation. DOD said that it will explore  an information/marketing campaign that will improve understanding of the  system.", "DOD also raised technical concerns; specifically, it believed that we did not  adequately describe the impact of the increase in funding related to the  Global War on Terrorism as well as how we converted the costs to constant  year dollars. In its comments, DOD stated that the fiscal year 2004  compensation costs included over $17 billion in supplemental funding for  the war on terrorism, and much of this funding was used to pay for  mobilized reservists. While it is true that our estimates include  supplemental funding, we do not believe that the inclusion of this funding  changes our findings or conclusions. Supplemental funding represents real  costs to the federal government that we believe are appropriate to include  when calculating how much the federal government spends on  compensating military members. However, we took DOD\u2019s concerns into  account and added footnotes in our report to explain our approach. DOD  also raised concerns about our use of end strength instead of average  strength in our per capita calculations. We believe that end strength, which  represents only active population, is an appropriate denominator to  calculate per capita active duty costs because it provides a consistent  population to spread costs of cash, noncash benefits, and deferred benefits.  To use average strength, which includes mobilized reservists, would not  have been an accurate representation of active duty per capita costs for  noncash and deferred benefits. However, in response to this comment, we  added footnotes that indicate that the cash compensation for fiscal year  2004 includes costs for mobilized reservists and including those reservists  in our per capita calculations would have decreased cash compensation by  about $5,000 per servicemember. Finally, DOD raised concerns about our  adjustments for inflation in our data. We used the National Defense Budget  Estimates published by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller). According to the document, the deflators we used provide  inflation indexes in base years for each DOD appropriation title to be used  in converting total obligation authority from current to constant dollars. To  address DOD\u2019s concerns that the total cost data are not accounting for the  fact that the military pay raises have been larger than other civilian pay  raises, we added footnotes that compared military pay increases, which  averaged over 21 percent between fiscal years 2000 and 2004, to the all  urban workers Consumer Price Index and the Employment Cost Index for  civilian wages and salaries, which over the same period increased 9.7  percent and 13.3 percent, respectively.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense.

Only  military income was considered. Nonmilitary income, such as spousal  earnings or investment income, would likely increase marginal tax rates  and, thus, increase our tax expenditure estimates. A servicemember\u2019s  earnings and tax status were determined by rank, years of service, and  number of dependents. Allowances are determined by rank and number of  dependents, and we assumed servicemembers living on-base received the  average housing allowance of similar servicemembers living off-base. The  number of servicemembers in each group for each year was provided by  the DOD\u2019s Selected Military Compensation Tables.

However, health care costs for retirees under 65 years of  age and their dependents are budgeted through an annual appropriation to  the Defense Health Program (DHP). Because the DHP annual budget  includes health care costs for active duty servicemembers and their  dependents as well as retirees under 65 and their families, we had to  estimate the share of DHP costs associated with active duty  servicemembers and their dependents for the fiscal years 2000-2004. Using  similar methodology employed by the Congressional Budget Office, we  transformed DHP enrollee data (broken out by gender, age category, and  whether they were active duty personnel, family of active duty personnel,  retirees under 65, or family of retirees under 65) into equivalent demand  units, because enrollees do not all have the same underlying demand for  health care services\u2014average health care expenditures and reliance upon  DHP differ across the groups. The estimated share of DHP dollars due to  active duty service is the ratio of equivalent demand units for active duty  personnel and their families to the total number of equivalent demand units  in DHP. We first used the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) to  estimate the average total health care expenditures each year (2000-2004)  by gender and age category. Estimates of relative use were derived by  dividing all estimates by the average total health care expenditures for  males ages 18 to 44 (the comparison group).

To determine  the amount of the SBP, the maximum applicable rate of retired pay that would be due you will be used.  The only way retirees can guarantee their  survivors receive a share of their retired pay is to enroll in SBP before they retire.  The maximum annuity is equal to 55% of retired pay until the  spouse attains age 62.  At age 62, the annuity is reduced to 35% of retired pay unless the retiree purchases the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan  (SSBP), which restores the annuity to between 40 and 55%, depending on the amount selected.
