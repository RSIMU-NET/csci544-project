In this region, where national parks and wildlife refuges lie next to agricultural lands, urban areas, and Indian reservations, the boundaries between public and private lands and between federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions overlay the ecological boundaries created by the flow of water. Therefore, human activities that change the quality or flow of the water in one area of South Florida can affect the environment and local economy of other areas. During the last half century, engineering projects have altered the quantity and timing of the water\u2019s flow, agricultural runoff has altered the quality of the water, and urbanization has fragmented the region\u2019s ecosystem. As a result, South Florida\u2014including the Everglades (described by some as a river of grass, unique on earth) and Florida Bay (located at the southern tip of the Florida peninsula)\u2014is showing signs of environmental distress. These signs are cause for concern in the localities whose economies depend on tourism and commercial fishing.", "At the urging of the Secretary of the Interior, federal agencies began an effort in 1993 to coordinate environmental restoration activities in South Florida. These activities include efforts to (1) manage the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and protect its resources, (2) modify the effects of engineering projects that have diverted water from the Everglades, and (3) reduce agricultural pollutants in the water entering the Everglades. Federal funding for these activities totaled about $90 million in fiscal year 1995.", "In addition, the administration has identified South Florida as an appropriate site for testing a new approach to ensuring a healthy environment and managing the nation\u2019s lands and natural resources. This approach recognizes the interrelationship between natural systems and healthy, sustainable economies. It cuts across the boundaries of ownership and jurisdiction and is variously termed \u201cecosystem management,\u201d \u201cregional partnerships,\u201d \u201ccross-media problem solving,\u201d or \u201cthe next generation of environmental conservation.\u201d", "Central to the administration\u2019s new approach is the need for federal and nonfederal stakeholders to collaborate and build consensus on solutions to problems or issues of mutual concern. In response to two separate congressional requests, we identified (1) the processes used by federal agencies to involve nonfederal stakeholders in environmental restoration efforts in South Florida and (2) the lessons learned about federal and nonfederal collaboration and consensus-building in South Florida that may be applicable elsewhere.", "In reviewing federal agencies\u2019 involvement of nonfederal stakeholders, we examined the agencies\u2019 experience with or use of advisory committees chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Passed in 1972, FACA, among other things, seeks to prevent special interest groups from obtaining unfair access to federal officials. It requires federal agencies, under certain circumstances, when working with state, local, or other governmental agencies or other parties, to create an advisory committee to provide advice on issues of mutual concern. The advisory committee must be balanced in terms of the points of view it represents, and it must take a number of steps to ensure open public meetings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For centuries, the Everglades has provided habitat for many species of wading birds and other native wildlife, including the American alligator, which depend on the water flow patterns that existed before human intervention. With Florida Bay, the Everglades provides important nursery grounds for fin fish, shrimp, lobster, stone crab, and other commercial species. The wildlife, fish, and recreational opportunities in the Everglades and Florida Bay have made tourism and commercial fishing mainstays of the local economy.", "Before human intervention, freshwater moved south from Lake Okeechobee in a broad, slow-moving sheet and then emptied into Florida Bay. The quantity and timing of the water\u2019s flow depended upon rainfall patterns and natural processes that resulted in the slow release of stored water. Water stored throughout the vast area of the Everglades supplied water to wetlands even during dry seasons.", "During recent decades, engineering projects, agricultural activities, and urbanization have altered past ecological patterns. As figure 1 shows, agricultural, industrial, and residential development have reduced the Everglades to about half its original size.", "The Central and Southern Florida Project\u2014an extensive system of canals, levees, pump stations, and other structures\u2014was authorized by the Congress in 1948, initially to prevent flooding, provide drainage, and supply water in South Florida. Areas immediately south of Lake Okeechobee in the Everglades Agricultural Area, which is drained by the project, are now farmed\u2014primarily by sugar growers\u2014while the eastern part of the region is heavily urbanized. Canals carry water away from the Everglades Agricultural Area into levied water conservation areas or directly into the Atlantic Ocean, bypassing much of the former Everglades.", "These engineering changes have diminished the broad, slow flow of water and reduced the area where water can be stored for dry seasons. At the same time, agricultural practices are altering native plant communities. Phosphorus\u2014a plant nutrient\u2014is carried in runoff from sugar farms to the Everglades, where it supports the growth of cattails, which choke out the native grasses. Wildlife populations have declined significantly. For example, the number of wading birds, once in the millions, has fallen by 90 percent in recent decades.

The extent to which desired ecological and economic conditions can be maintained or restored will depend in large measure on the extent to which private landowners and government agencies can agree on the necessary or desired trade-offs among ecological and socioeconomic values and concerns, including those related to the conditions and trends of local economies and industries and the stability of communities.", "The federal interagency task force established to coordinate environmental restoration activities in South Florida and the environmental restoration efforts under the task force\u2019s umbrella have involved nonfederal stakeholders in their activities.

Among the task force\u2019s products are an annual report and a report (prepared by a science subgroup of the task force\u2019s working group) on the ecosystem\u2019s restoration needs\u2014including the need to acquire private lands in the Everglades Agricultural Area.", "Until April 1995, membership in the working group was limited to representatives of federal agencies. However, after legislation was enacted in March 1995 exempting certain meetings between federal officials and state, local, or tribal officials from FACA\u2019s requirements, the working group increased its membership to include state and tribal officials. In addition, most meetings of the task force and of the working group are open to the public, and the working group gives the public an opportunity to comment at each open meeting. The working group has also scheduled some of its meetings to coincide with meetings of the Governor\u2019s Commission on a Sustainable South Florida to facilitate the two groups\u2019 interaction and the public\u2019s participation.", "Still missing as formal participants in the working group and its subgroups, however, are local officials and representatives of diverse nongovernmental interests across South Florida, including landowners, farmers, sportsmen, commercial fishermen, developers, and environmental organizations. Precedent exists, however, for establishing a citizens\u2019 group to formally participate in the task force\u2019s effort and to promote public involvement and outreach. Moreover, in its fiscal year 1996 budget request for the Department of the Interior, the administration supported the public\u2019s involvement in an ecological restoration effort that, like the South Florida effort, affects a variety of interests. According to the budget request, the public will continue to have a major role in developing a long-range strategy to restore and protect the aquatic ecosystem of California\u2019s San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, in part through the creation of a citizens\u2019 advisory committee representing urban, agricultural, environmental, and other interests.

NOAA made a draft of the management plan available for public comment in April 1995.", "To develop the plan, NOAA was required by the act to work with relevant federal, state, and local agencies and to establish a citizens\u2019 sanctuary advisory council whose members could include representatives from local industries, commercial endeavors, conservation groups, the general public, and others. To implement these requirements, NOAA followed a newly developed strategic assessment approach that involved three groups of stakeholders: (1) a core group representing federal, state, and local agencies whose jurisdictions affect the sanctuary, (2) a citizens\u2019 sanctuary advisory council, chartered under FACA, representing local industries and businesses, user groups, local citizens, environmentalists, and scientists as well as some agency staff from the core group, and (3) a broader network of local scientists and management experts.", "In general, the core group identified issues, effects, causes, data needs, strategies, and alternatives for addressing management issues. Efforts by the core group were developed with, or reviewed by, local scientists and management experts. The sanctuary advisory council also reviewed and revised the work of the core group, often after conferring with constituents in the community, and contributed directly to the development of a key component of the plan establishing special-use zones within the sanctuary. NOAA staff facilitated each step in the process.", "Both the core group and the citizens\u2019 sanctuary advisory council recommended the same preferred management alternative to NOAA. This alternative, which consists of a combination of strategies, proposes to limit certain uses and activities to certain areas within the sanctuary to provide different levels of protection for natural resources.

During this period, the Corps has conducted various studies and experiments, identified or proposed modifications to the Central and Southern Florida Project, issued reports on its findings, and prepared environmental products required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).", "Over the years, the Corps has increased nonfederal stakeholders\u2019 involvement in its decision-making. At first, the Corps limited nonfederal involvement to the minimum requirements for public participation set forth in NEPA. This act involves nonfederal stakeholders primarily in reviewing and commenting on products drafted by the agency.", "However, because the environmental restoration of South Florida has commanded the attention of the public, political officials, and the media, the Corps has increased the opportunities for public input. For example, the Corps has (1) relied on a state committee established by the governor of Florida to identify problems, goals, and objectives for managing the east Everglades, (2) held meetings and workshops with representatives of the agricultural community, homeowners, conservation groups, and local government agencies to provide information and obtain their feedback on proposed alternatives, (3) used an interagency study team instead of relying solely on its own staff to formulate alternative plans and recommend further studies, and/or (4) obtained input through open meetings held at various stages in the process.

The effort began in 1988 when the federal government sued two state agencies for failing to enforce the state\u2019s water quality standards.

However, apart from NOAA, which was required to establish a citizens\u2019 advisory council by the act establishing the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, no federal agency has chartered an advisory committee under FACA to bring stakeholders together.", "Some federal officials cited the cumbersome steps that an advisory committee must take to ensure open public meetings as a primary reason for not chartering committees under FACA. These steps include publishing advance notice of meetings in the Federal Register, holding meetings in public, making detailed minutes of the meetings available to the public, and allowing interested persons to appear before it. This concern is consistent with concerns raised by other federal officials who believe that FACA\u2019s procedural requirements make it difficult for federal agencies to establish partnerships with stakeholders and involve the public in ecosystem activities. These officials believe that, in attempting to prevent special interest groups from obtaining unfair access to federal officials, the act has had the unintended consequence of isolating federal officials from public contact.", "Some federal officials cited concerns expressed by the Congress and the administration over the proliferation of advisory committees and their related costs as a primary reason for not chartering committees under FACA. These concerns culminated in Executive Order 12838, issued on February 10, 1993, which requires federal agencies to reduce the number of federal advisory committees and to limit the establishment of new ones.", "In addition, some federal officials and some nonfederal stakeholders expressed frustration to us about the difficulty of determining when federal parties can meet with nongovernmental parties without being required to charter an advisory committee under FACA. According to federal officials responsible for interpreting FACA\u2014including attorneys in the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division and officials in the General Services Administration\u2019s Committee Management Secretariat, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of FACA and monitoring advisory committees\u2019 activities\u2014it is often difficult to determine when an advisory committee is required to comply with the act, and the courts have not provided clear tests for such a decision. Whether federal parties can meet with nongovernmental parties without an advisory committee often depends on whether information\u2014rather than advice\u2014is exchanged, whether a consensus is reached among the parties, and how often meetings occur and who initiates them. Furthermore, these officials noted that the courts look at a combination of factors that affect the need for a committee in a given situation; few factors by themselves clearly indicate that a group must be chartered under FACA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned in South Florida", "paragraphs": ["Among the lessons learned so far in implementing environmental restoration efforts in South Florida is that nonfederal stakeholders would generally prefer to present their concerns, positions, and supporting documentation during rather than after the development of federal proposals to address environmental concerns. This lesson is drawn from the desires expressed by nonfederal stakeholders for greater involvement in the efforts to coordinate restoration activities and to modify the effects of engineering projects that have diverted water from the Everglades.", "Another lesson is that constraints imposed by external factors often dictate the extent to which federal agencies can involve nonfederal stakeholders in their activities. For example, federal members of the interagency task force\u2019s working group could still be found in violation of FACA for holding meetings with nongovernmental parties without the benefit of an advisory committee chartered under the act; nevertheless, these federal officials believe that they are precluded from expanding their membership to include nongovernmental stakeholders because Executive Order 12838 limits the establishment of new advisory committees under the act.", "A third lesson is that although consensus among federal and nonfederal stakeholders is desirable, restoration efforts are inherently contentious, and consensus on solutions that directly affect various interests may not be attainable. Consensus can begin to wane as a restoration effort moves from the planning to the implementation stage and stakeholders begin to feel the effects of public policy decisions. For example, decisions that change land-use patterns and affect property ownership\u2014such as the state\u2019s decision to acquire privately owned agricultural lands adjacent to the Everglades National Park to mitigate the effects of engineering projects that have diverted water from the Everglades\u2014may not be acceptable to all stakeholders.", "A fourth lesson is that dissatisfaction with the process for nonfederal involvement expressed by stakeholders directly affected by a public policy decision often cannot be dissociated from their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the process. For example, the dissatisfaction with the process for nonfederal involvement expressed by agricultural landowners whose properties are adjacent to the Everglades National Park and have been identified for acquisition by the state cannot be dissociated from their dissatisfaction with the state\u2019s decision to purchase their properties.", "In the final analysis, the most that a federal agency may be able to achieve is an open airing and full consideration of all views within the constraints imposed by external factors, and any conclusion about the extent to which an agency or effort meets this objective is highly subjective. For example, several parties\u2014smaller sugar growers in the Everglades Agricultural Area, the Miccosuke Tribe of Indians whose reservation and leased lands border the northern boundary of the Everglades National Park, and two environmental groups\u2014have criticized the process that resulted in Florida\u2019s Everglades Forever Act for not affording full consideration of their views and evidence. Officials from or representatives of these parties told us that they would have preferred an open airing of their views and evidence at an evidentiary hearing before an impartial hearing officer. (As previously noted, the act\u2019s passage abrogated the need for the hearing.)

Among these lessons is that nonfederal stakeholders would generally prefer to present their concerns, positions, and supporting documentation during rather than after the development of federal proposals to address environmental concerns.", "Federal agencies have involved nonfederal stakeholders in their efforts to restore the environment of South Florida, and some, including the Interagency Task Force on the South Florida Ecosystem and the Corps, are considering alternatives to increase public involvement. However, the executive order limiting the establishment of new advisory committees under FACA, coupled with the difficulty of determining when federal parties can meet with nongovernmental parties without being required to charter an advisory committee under the act, has limited formal participation by nongovernmental interests in federal restoration efforts. In particular, the Interagency Task Force on the South Florida Ecosystem has developed a strategy to collaborate with nonfederal stakeholders that does not include formal participation by local officials or representatives of diverse nongovernmental interests across the region. Since the extent to which desired ecological and economic conditions can be maintained or restored will depend in large measure on the extent to which private landowners and government agencies can agree on the necessary or desired trade-offs among ecological and socioeconomic values and concerns, the lack of formal participation by local officials or representatives of the region\u2019s nongovernmental interests could severely compromise the task force\u2019s effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Interagency Task Force on the South Florida Ecosystem to develop a strategy to extend formal participation in its working group and subgroups to local officials and representatives of South Florida\u2019s nongovernmental interests, including landowners, farmers, sportsmen, commercial fishermen, developers, and environmental organizations. One alternative would be to establish a citizens\u2019 advisory group to formally participate in the task force\u2019s effort and to promote public involvement and outreach.

Moreover, according to these officials, NOAA\u2019s process for developing a comprehensive management plan for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is not an appropriate model for the task force, since the task force is an operative and action-oriented body, not a \u201cmaster planning body.\u201d While we agree that the task force has developed a strategy to collaborate with nonfederal stakeholders, this strategy does not include formal participation in the working group and its subgroups by local officials and by representatives of South Florida\u2019s diverse nongovernmental interests. Moreover, we believe that NOAA\u2019s effort to manage the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is similar to the task force\u2019s effort to coordinate environmental restoration activities in South Florida in that both have developed a plan of action and are moving toward implementation.

Interior officials on the task force or working group believe that further involvement would have required chartering an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). According to some members, the working group did not charter an advisory committee under FACA primarily because of concerns shared by the Congress and the administration over the proliferation of advisory committees chartered under FACA and their related costs. These concerns culminated in Executive Order 12838, issued on February 10, 1993, which requires federal agencies to reduce the number of federal advisory committees and to limit the establishment of new ones.

This process allows for an evidentiary hearing before an impartial hearing officer to resolve disputed factual issues. Therefore, after the state issued its plan to implement the settlement agreement in March 1992, sugar growers in the Everglades Agricultural Area filed legal challenges to obtain an evidentiary hearing on the plan.", "In December 1992, the parties to the litigation entered into formal mediation to resolve the challenges using a nationally recognized mediator.

The mediation also included a series of technical discussions involving scientists representing the federal government, the state, large and small sugar growers, Indian tribes, environmentalists, and others. The result was a mediated technical plan based on the settlement agreement. Most of the parties generally supported the plan, but agreement was not unanimous on all of its provisions. In addition, support for the plan depended on the parties\u2019 reaching agreement on other issues, such as cost-sharing and land acquisition.", "Negotiations then moved to a second stage involving the parties who would share the cost of implementing the technical plan.

These negotiations, hosted by Interior primarily in Washington D.C., resulted in a statement of principles that adopted the mediated technical plan as the basis for water quality requirements and outlined the financial obligations of the various parties. Agricultural interests were to pay $322 million over 20 years, and taxpayers were to pay the remaining costs through several state programs and District taxes.

Moreover, Florida\u2019s Sunshine Act requires that all meetings involving state employees be open to the public. The draft report contained a proposed recommendation that the task force inform the General Services Administration\u2019s Committee Management Secretariat, which is responsible for drafting guidelines to implement the amendment, of the extent to which the amendment and guidelines allow the task force to share information, coordinate activities, and work routinely with state, local, and other governmental agencies without violating the act.

Interior officials commented that the task force had already developed a strategy to collaborate with nonfederal stakeholders that has worked well and represents a model for such partnerships around the country. Moreover, these officials believe that the process used by NOAA to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is not appropriate for the task force, since the task force is an operative and action-oriented body, not a \u201cmaster planning body.\u201d", "GAO\u2019s Response: While we agree that the task force has developed a strategy to collaborate with nonfederal stakeholders, this strategy does not include formal participation in the working group and its subgroups by either local officials or representatives of the diverse nongovernmental interests across South Florida. Moreover, we believe that the effort to manage the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is similar to the task force\u2019s effort to coordinate environmental restoration activities in South Florida in that both have developed a plan of action and are moving toward implementation. In addition, precedent exists for establishing a citizens\u2019 group to formally participate in the task force\u2019s effort and to promote public involvement and outreach (see app. I). Therefore, we have modified the recommendation to state that the task force should develop a strategy to extend formal participation in its working group and subgroups to local officials and representatives of South Florida\u2019s nongovernmental interests, including landowners, farmers, sportsmen, commercial fishermen, developers, and environmental organizations.

The draft report cautioned, however, that differences among the five efforts\u2014in the contentiousness of the issues and other influential factors\u2014suggest that no one process to involve nonfederal stakeholders would be appropriate for all efforts. Interior officials believed that the draft report\u2019s organization of the five efforts on a spectrum of public participation damages the records of some efforts by elevating others and fails to note the many differences that exist among the various efforts.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We agree with Interior that differences among the five efforts preclude comparisons. For example, efforts to coordinate activities, develop plans, or implement solutions to specific problems or issues should not be compared either explicitly or implicitly. Similarly, an effort that has already reached a difficult public policy decision\u2014to acquire private lands, for example\u2014should not be compared to one that has only begun to identify and evaluate options for solving a problem or issue. Finally, an effort to settle years of litigation that ultimately resulted in a public policy initiative (the Everglades Forever Act) should not be compared to other efforts to implement public policy initiatives that were required by law or begun at the urging of the Secretary of the Interior.

Hence, the draft report largely misses the point that the efforts are all part of an integrated ecosystem management approach to restore the environment of South Florida.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We agree that the efforts are all part of an integrated ecosystem management approach to restore the environment of South Florida and have identified linkages among them. However, the various efforts began at different times, under different authorities, and have progressed to different stages, ranging from planning to implementing solutions to specific concerns. Therefore, we believe that it is appropriate to address the efforts separately.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: The effort to settle litigation concerning the runoff of phosphorus from sugar farms in the Everglades Agricultural Area should not be covered in the report.", "Interior officials stated that the effort to settle the litigation should not be included in the report because the phase of the negotiations in which federal officials were involved that eventually failed to reach an agreement cannot be compared to any other public process.", "GAO\u2019s Response: While we agree with Interior that differences among the efforts preclude comparisons, we believe that the effort to settle the litigation should be included in the report because it is clearly under the task force\u2019s umbrella and is linked to other environmental restoration efforts. We note that the administration\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget request for Interior identifies the settlement as a major success of the task force.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: Consensus on solutions to problems or issues may not be attainable.", "Interior pointed out that although consensus among federal and nonfederal stakeholders is desirable, restoration efforts are, by their very nature, highly contentious. Moreover, consensus begins to evaporate as a restoration effort moves from the conceptual and planning stages to the implementation of solutions that directly affect various interests. Interior officials believe that the most an agency can hope to achieve is an open airing and full consideration of all views.", "GAO\u2019s Response: In the draft report we stated that, as the efforts in South Florida have shown, increased collaboration can help federal and nonfederal stakeholders build consensus on difficult public policy issues and decide on actions that are necessary to maintain or restore desired ecological conditions. However, decisions that change land-use patterns and affect property ownership, such as the state\u2019s decision to acquire privately owned agricultural lands adjacent to the Everglades National Park, may not be acceptable to all stakeholders. We have expanded this lesson to incorporate Interior\u2019s observations on the contentiousness of restoration efforts and on the instability of consensus in the face of direct threats to vested interests.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: Litigation limited public participation.", "The draft report stated that Interior had excluded all but a few stakeholders in reaching agreement over a strategy for improving the quality of the water entering the Everglades by turning to closed-door negotiations when mediation involving all stakeholders could not resolve key issues. In their comments, Interior officials pointed out that (1) there is no legal or policy rationale for letting a person who is not a party to a lawsuit participate in the negotiations to settle the lawsuit, (2) mediation to develop a technical plan provided an opportunity for parties to the lawsuit to voice their concerns, and (3) negotiations to reach agreement on sharing the cost of implementing the plan should be limited primarily to the parties who are going to incur the cost.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We revised the report to recognize Interior\u2019s reasons for limiting public participation in the effort to reach agreement over a strategy for improving the quality of the water entering the Everglades.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: Public participation occurred during the state\u2019s legislative process.", "The draft report stated that the agreements resulting from the closed-door negotiations involving federal officials formed the basis of the state\u2019s Everglades Forever Act, which the governor signed in May 1994. The draft report did not point out that the public participated in the state\u2019s legislative process leading up to the act\u2019s enactment. Interior believed that the report should identify this process.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We revised the report to recognize the public\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s legislative process.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: Small sugar growers, Indian tribes, and environmental groups were represented in the negotiations.", "The draft report stated that small sugar growers, Indian tribes, and environmental groups were excluded from the negotiations that resulted in a strategy for improving the quality of the water entering the Everglades. Interior officials took exception to this statement, saying that (1) representatives of small sugar growers were included, not excluded, from virtually all negotiations, (2) attorneys for the Miccosuke Tribe participated fully in developing the mediated technical plan and were kept informed of the cost-sharing negotiations, and (3) environmental groups that were parties to the sugar growers\u2019 lawsuits challenging the settlement agreement were represented by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in the negotiations that resulted in the statement of principles.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We revised the report to recognize (1) the disagreement between Interior and the small sugar growers concerning the extent to which these growers were involved in the negotiations, (2) the disagreement between Interior and the tribe, as well as the court order addressing this issue, and (3) the representation of some, but not all, environmental groups in the negotiations.", "Interior\u2019s Comment: Only a few stakeholders are dissatisfied with the Everglades Forever Act.", "According to the draft report, the enactment of the Everglades Forever Act did not end years of litigation as Interior had hoped, but instead provoked a new series of legal challenges and administrative appeals. Interior, in its comments, pointed out that the signing of the act concluded years of litigation and began the implementation of a strategy for restoring both the quality of the water entering the Everglades and the quantity and timing of the water\u2019s flow. Interior characterized the legal challenges and administrative appeals filed after the act was signed as attempts by a few disgruntled parties to derail restoration.", "GAO\u2019s Response: We revised the report to recognize both Interior\u2019s position and the difficulty inherent in distinguishing between a group\u2019s dissatisfaction with the process for nonfederal involvement and its dissatisfaction with the outcome of the process. However, the report continues to note that these groups would have preferred an open airing of their views before an impartial hearing officer and strongly believe that the process resulting in the act did not afford full consideration of their evidence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Natural Resources Management Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of General Counsel", "paragraphs": ["Alan R.
