Their most recent agreement, Chesapeake 2000, sets out an agenda and five broad goals to guide these efforts through 2010 and contains 102 commitments that the partners agreed to accomplish. GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which appropriate measures for assessing restoration progress have been established, (2) the extent to which current reporting mechanisms clearly and accurately describe the bay's overall health, (3) how much funding was provided for the effort for fiscal years 1995 through 2004, and (4) how effectively the effort is being coordinated and managed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Bay Program has over 100 measures to assess progress toward meeting certain restoration commitments and providing information to guide management decisions. However, the program has not yet developed an integrated approach that would allow it to translate these individual measures into an assessment of overall progress toward achieving the five broad restoration goals outlined in Chesapeake 2000. For example, while the Bay Program has appropriate measures to track crab, oyster, and rockfish populations, it does not have an approach for integrating the results of these measures to assess progress toward the agreement's goal of protecting and restoring the bay's living resources. The Bay Program has recognized that it may need an integrated approach for assessing overall progress in restoring the bay and, in November 2004, a task force began working on this effort. The State of the Chesapeake Bay reports are the Bay Program's primary mechanism for reporting the current health status of the bay. However, these reports do not effectively communicate the bay's current conditions because they focus on the status of individual species or pollutants instead of providing information on a core set of ecosystem characteristics. Moreover, the credibility of these reports has been negatively impacted because the program has commingled various kinds of data such as monitoring data, results of program actions, and the results of its predictive model without clearly distinguishing among them. As a result, the public cannot easily determine whether the health of the bay is improving or not. Moreover, the lack of independence in the Bay Program's reporting process has led to negative trends being downplayed and a rosier picture of the bay's health being reported than may have been warranted. The program has recognized that improvements are needed and is developing new reporting formats. From fiscal years 1995 through 2004, the restoration effort received about $3.7 billion in direct funding from 11 key federal agencies; the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District of Columbia. These funds were used for activities that supported water quality protection and restoration, sound land use, vital habitat protection and restoration, living resource protection and restoration, and stewardship and community engagement. During this time period, the restoration effort also received an additional $1.9 billion in indirect funding. The Bay Program does not have a comprehensive, coordinated implementation strategy to better enable it to achieve the goals outlined in Chesapeake 2000. Although the program has adopted 10 key commitments to focus partners' efforts and developed plans to achieve them, some of these plans are inconsistent with each other or are perceived as unachievable by program partners. The limited assurances about the availability of resources beyond the short term further complicate the Bay Program's ability to effectively coordinate restoration efforts and strategically manage its resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recognized by Congress as a national treasure, the Chesapeake Bay is the  nation\u2019s largest estuary, with its watershed spanning 64,000 square miles,  including parts of six states and the District of Columbia. The Chesapeake  Bay is also biologically diverse, providing habitat for more than 3,600  species of plants, fish, and shellfish. With the highest land-to-water ratio of  any estuary in the world, the bay is particularly susceptible to activities that  take place on surrounding lands. For example, urban sprawl significantly  affects the bay\u2019s ecosystem. From 1950 to 2000, the population in the  watershed nearly doubled, from just over 8 million to nearly 16 million.  By  2020, it is estimated that the population in the bay\u2019s watershed will reach  approximately 18 million.", "Concerns about the bay\u2019s overall health surfaced as early as the 1930s.   Signs of deterioration in the bay\u2019s condition\u2014declines in water clarity,  oyster populations, and underwater grasses that provide habitat for  shellfish\u2014became even more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s  and early 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that  excess nutrients from agricultural development, population growth, and  discharges from sewage treatment plants were the primary causes for the  decline in the bay\u2019s condition.", "Responding to the public outcry about the degraded state of the  Chesapeake Bay, the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; the  District of Columbia; the Chesapeake Bay Commission\u2014a tristate  legislative assembly representing Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and  EPA agreed in 1983 to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay.  Their  agreement established the Chesapeake Executive Council and resulted in  the Chesapeake Bay Program (Bay Program) a partnership that directs and  conducts the restoration of the bay. The Bay Program currently includes  partners at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as academic  institutions and nonprofit organizations. EPA\u2019s Chesapeake Bay Program  Office provides support to the Chesapeake Executive Council and, among  other things, is responsible for developing and providing information on  the environmental quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay  ecosystem. In addition, the Chesapeake Bay Program Office is responsible  for coordinating EPA\u2019s activities with other federal agencies and state and  local authorities participating in the restoration effort.", "Subsequent agreements in 1987, 1992, and 2000 reaffirmed the signatories\u2019  commitment to bay restoration. The most recent, Chesapeake 2000,  envisions a Chesapeake Bay watershed that includes abundant, diverse  populations of living resources and healthy, clean streams and rivers that  can sustain strong local and regional economies. Chesapeake 2000\u2014 identified by the Bay Program as its strategic plan\u2014sets out an agenda and  goals to guide the restoration and protection efforts through 2010 and  beyond. In Chesapeake 2000, the signatories agreed to 102 commitments\u2014 including management actions, such as assessing trends of particular  species, as well as actions that directly affect the health of the bay. These  commitments are organized under the following five broad restoration  goals:  Protecting and restoring living resources\u201414 commitments to restore,  enhance, and protect the finfish, shellfish and other living resources,  their habitats and ecological relationships to sustain all fisheries and  provide for a balanced ecosystem;   Protecting and restoring vital habitats\u201418 commitments to preserve,  protect, and restore those habitats and natural areas that are vital to the  survival and diversity of the living resources of the bay and its rivers;    Protecting and restoring water quality\u201419 commitments to achieve  and maintain the water quality necessary to support the aquatic living  resources of the bay and its tributaries and to protect human health;    Sound land use\u201428 commitments to develop, promote, and achieve  sound land use practices that protect and restore watershed resources  and water quality, maintain reduced pollutant loadings for the bay and  its tributaries, and restore and preserve aquatic living resources; and    Stewardship and community engagement\u201423 commitments to  promote individual stewardship and assist individuals, community- based organizations, businesses, local governments and schools to  undertake initiatives to achieve the goals and commitments of the  agreement.", "Over time, the Bay Program has been lauded as a model for  intergovernmental cooperation and for its extensive studies on the bay and  its problems. Recently, however, the Bay Program has come under  increasing scrutiny as some have questioned whether the Bay Program has  overstated the progress made in restoring the bay\u2019s health.", "In this context, you asked us to examine (1) the extent to which the Bay  Program has established appropriate measures for assessing restoration  progress, (2) the extent to which the reporting mechanisms the Bay  Program uses clearly and accurately describe the bay\u2019s overall health, (3)  how much funding was provided for restoring the Chesapeake Bay for  fiscal years 1995 through 2004 and for what purposes, and (4) how  effectively the restoration effort is being coordinated and managed.", "To determine the extent to which the Bay Program has established  appropriate measures for assessing progress and clearly and accurately  reporting on the bay\u2019s health, we obtained and analyzed documents on  measures the Bay Program uses to assess progress in restoring the bay\u2019s  health, and we reviewed Bay Program reports. In addition, we convened a  panel of nationally recognized ecosystem assessment and restoration  experts. The panel discussed (1) critical elements of an effective  assessment process, (2) how progress in restoring an ecosystem should be  assessed, and (3) key attributes of effective reports on ecosystem  health. To determine the amount of funding provided for the restoration  effort from fiscal years 1995 through 2004, we obtained and analyzed  financial information from key federal agencies, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Key federal agencies were identified  as those that participated in Chesapeake Bay Program committees or that  provided more than $250,000 annually, on average, in direct funding. For  the purposes of this report, we defined direct funds as those that are  provided exclusively for bay restoration activities (e.g., increasing the  oyster population) or those that would no longer be made available in the  absence of the restoration effort. To determine how effectively the  restoration effort is being coordinated and managed, we obtained and  analyzed planning documents and agreements from Bay Program  partners. In addition, to address all of our objectives, we interviewed a  wide range of program partners, including representatives of federal, state,  and local agencies; the Chesapeake Bay Commission; interest groups, such  as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay;  and academia. We also interviewed nonpartner groups, such as the  Maryland Watermen\u2019s Association. In addition, we reviewed associated  studies. A more detailed description of our objectives, scope, and  methodology is presented in appendix I.

However, the bay  is relatively shallow, averaging only 21 feet deep. Roughly half of the bay\u2019s  water comes from the Atlantic Ocean, and the other half is freshwater that  drains from the land and enters the bay through its many rivers and streams  in the watershed basin. The Susquehanna River, which flows through  Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania, provides about 50 percent of the  freshwater that enters the bay.  As shown in figure 1, the bay\u2019s watershed  covers 64,000 square miles and spans parts of six states\u2014Delaware,  Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia\u2014and the  District of Columbia.", "The Chesapeake Bay is also biologically diverse, providing habitat for a  wide variety of fish, shellfish, other animals, and plants. Blue crab, ducks,  herring, oysters, shad, and striped bass are just some of the resources that  live in or on the bay.", "Over time, the bay\u2019s ecosystem has deteriorated. The bay\u2019s \u201cdead zones\u201d\u2014 where too little oxygen is available to support fish and shellfish\u2014have  increased, and many species of fish and shellfish have experienced major  declines in population. The deterioration has occurred primarily because of  excess amounts of nutrients entering the bay, which damage species and  plant populations; the single largest source of these pollutants is  agricultural runoff. Overharvesting key species, such as oysters and crabs,  has also contributed to the deterioration of the ecosystem. In addition,  population growth and development have further stressed the ecosystem.   For example, in the past decade, the amount of land in the watershed  covered by impervious surfaces\u2014surfaces through which water cannot  flow\u2014increased by about 41 percent, increasing the amount of polluted  runoff that enters into streams and rivers and eventually runs into the bay.  With a very high land-to-water ratio, the bay is particularly sensitive to  activities on land. Figure 2 shows some of the land activities that contribute  to pollution in the bay\u2019s ecosystem.", "The decline in the bay\u2019s living resources has been cause for a great deal of  public and political attention. Efforts to manage the bay\u2019s ecosystem and  protect its living resources began as early as the 1930s and have continued  through the present. In 1980, Maryland and Virginia, later joined by  Pennsylvania, established the Chesapeake Bay Commission to serve as an  advisory body on the Chesapeake Bay to their state legislatures and as a  liaison to Congress. On December 9, 1983, the Governors of Maryland and  Virginia; the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania; the Mayor of the District  of Columbia; the Administrator of EPA; and the Chair of the Chesapeake  Bay Commission signed the first Chesapeake Bay agreement. Their  agreement resulted in the Chesapeake Bay Program, a partnership that  directs and conducts the restoration of the bay. The signatories to the  agreement reaffirmed their commitment to restore the bay in 1987 and  again in 1992. They signed the most current agreement, Chesapeake 2000,  on June 28, 2000.", "Chesapeake 2000 envisions an ecosystem with abundant, diverse  populations of living resources fed by healthy streams and rivers that  sustain strong local and regional economies and a unique quality of life.   The agreement has served as the Bay Program\u2019s strategic plan, and it  outlines five broad goals and 102 commitments for the restoration effort.   Appendix II lists the goals and commitments outlined in Chesapeake 2000.", "The Bay Program, led by the Chesapeake Executive Council, has many  partners, including federal agencies, states, academic institutions, and  others (see app. III for a list of partners). While the Chesapeake Bay  Program is a voluntary partnership among the states and the federal  government, some activities of the Chesapeake Bay Program are  implemented to meet the requirements of federal or state law. For example,  the responsibility to establish water quality standards is both a  commitment under the Chesapeake 2000 agreement and a requirement  under the federal Clean Water Act.", "The Bay Program has seven committees and eight subcommittees, which  form the organizational and planning structure for the restoration effort. In  addition, the subcommittees have many work groups that plan and  implement various aspects of the restoration effort. The organizational  structure of the Bay Program is shown in figure 3.", "As the only federal signatory to the Chesapeake Bay agreements, EPA is  responsible for spearheading the federal effort within the Bay Program  through its Chesapeake Bay Program Office. Amendments to the Clean  Water Act direct the Chesapeake Bay Program Office to provide support to  the Chesapeake Executive Council. Specifically, the Chesapeake Bay  Program Office is to, among other things,  develop and make available information about the environmental  quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem;   in cooperation with appropriate federal, state, and local authorities, help  the signatories to the Chesapeake Bay agreement develop and  implement specific plans to carry out their responsibilities; and  coordinate EPA\u2019s actions with those of other appropriate entities to  develop strategies to improve the water quality and living resources in  the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.", "In addition, the Administrator of EPA, in coordination with other members  of the Chesapeake Executive Council, must ensure that management plans  are developed and that the signatories implement the plans to achieve and  maintain, among other things, (1) the nutrient goals for the quantity of  nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed  and (2) the water quality requirements necessary to restore living resources  in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.

The number of  measures associated with each of these commitments varies; the more  complex the assessment the more measures the Bay Program has  developed and uses to assess progress. For example, assessing progress  toward the commitment of correcting the nutrient- and sediment-related  problems in the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries by 2010 under the  Water Quality Protection and Restoration goal is complex, requiring the  measurement of several pollutants and various aspects of water quality.   The Bay Program uses 17 measures to assess progress for this  commitment. In contrast, it is less complex to assess the commitment  under the Sound Land Use goal to, by 2010, expand by 30 percent the  system of public access points to the bay, its tributaries, and related  resource sites in an environmentally sensitive manner. For this  commitment, the Bay Program uses only one measure to track the number  of new and enhanced public access sites within the Chesapeake Bay  watershed. According to the Chesapeake Bay Program Office, because no  other restoration effort had developed measures that they could use, the  program had to develop nearly all of the underlying science and  methodologies for their measures. In addition, to ensure the  appropriateness of these measures, the Chesapeake Bay Program Office  requires a rigorous review of all of the measures before they are adopted.  For the most part, our expert panel agreed that the Bay Program has  established appropriate measures to assess specific aspects of the  restoration effort. Several members of the Bay Program\u2019s Scientific and  Technical Advisory Committee echoed this view.", "The remaining three quantifiable commitments, for which the Bay Program  has not yet established any measures, include the following:  By 2010, establish a goal of implementing plans to preserve key  wetlands while addressing surrounding land use in 25 percent of the  land area of each state\u2019s bay watershed.", "By 2010, the District of Columbia, working with its watershed partners,  will reduce pollution loads to the Anacostia River in order to eliminate  public health concerns and achieve the living resource, water quality,  and habitat goals of Chesapeake 2000 and past agreements.", "By 2003, develop partnerships with at least 30 interpretive sites to  enhance their presentation of bay-related themes.", "The Bay Program has also developed 55 other measures to provide  information it needs to make management decisions.  For example, under  the Water Quality Protection and Restoration goal, the Bay Program has  made a commitment to assess the effects of airborne nitrogen compounds  and chemical contaminants in the bay ecosystem and to help establish  reduction goals for these contaminants. To help inform decision making for  this commitment, the Bay Program has a measure for estimated vehicle  emissions compared with vehicle miles traveled.  In addition, for the  commitment under the Living Resource Protection and Restoration goal  to restore fish passage to more than 1,357 miles of river, the Bay Program  has two measures that provide information about fish population levels.   The Bay Program also uses three measures\u2014the number of residents in the  Chesapeake Bay watershed, the relationship between this population and  the amount of municipal wastewater flow, and the volume of river water  flowing into the Chesapeake Bay\u2014to track general information about the  Chesapeake Bay watershed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bay Program Lacks an Integrated Approach for Assessing Progress Toward Goals", "paragraphs": ["While the Bay Program has established measures to assess progress made  in meeting some of the individual commitments of Chesapeake 2000, it has  not developed an approach that can be used to assess progress toward  achieving the five broad restoration goals. For example, the Bay Program  has measures for determining  trends in individual fish and shellfish populations, such as crabs,  oysters, and rockfish, but it has not yet devised a way to integrate those  measures to assess the overall progress made in achieving its Living  Resource Protection and Restoration goal;   the acres of bay grasses in the bay, the acres of wetlands restored, and  the miles of forest buffers restored, but it has not developed an  approach for integrating those measures to assess the overall progress  made in achieving its Vital Habitat Protection and Restoration goal;  and     attributes of water quality\u2014such as levels of dissolved oxygen, water  clarity, and chlorophyll a\u2014but has not developed an approach for  combining these measures to determine progress toward achieving its  goal of Water Quality Protection and Restoration.", "According to our expert panel, in a complex ecosystem restoration project  like the Chesapeake Bay, overall progress should be assessed by using an  integrated approach. This approach should combine measures that provide  information on individual species or pollutants into a few broader scale  measures that can be used to assess key ecosystem attributes, such as  biological conditions. One such framework was developed in 2002 by EPA\u2019s  Science Advisory Board and can serve as a tool to assist Bay Program  officials in deciding what ecological attributes to measure and how to  aggregate measurements into an understandable picture of ecological  integrity.", "In developing such an approach, the Bay Program also faces the challenge  of finding a way to incorporate the results achieved in implementing the 81  nonquantifiable commitments contained in Chesapeake 2000 with the  results achieved in implementing the 21 quantifiable commitments. For  example, under the Water Quality Protection and Restoration goal, the  Bay Program has a nonquantifiable commitment to reduce the potential  risk of pesticides flowing into the bay by educating watershed residents on  best management practices for pesticide use. Not only does the Bay  Program currently have no method for measuring the progress made on  this commitment, but it also has no approach for integrating these results  with the results of the other 19 commitments listed under the water quality  goal. Consequently, the program cannot currently assess the progress made  in meeting the water quality goal.", "According to an official from the Chesapeake Bay Program Office, it is  difficult to assess progress made in restoring an ecosystem that is as  scientifically complex as the bay. The official also noted that the partners  have discussed the need for an integrated approach over the past several  years but have disagreed on whether the Bay Program could develop an  approach that is scientifically defensible, given their limited resources.   Recently, however, the partners are more optimistic that an integrated  approach can be developed that will provide a clearer sense of the overall  health of the bay, as well as restoration progress.", "In November 2004, a Bay Program task force began an effort to develop,  among other things, a framework for organizing the Bay Program\u2019s  measures and proposed a structure for how the redesign work would be  accomplished by the Bay Program\u2019s subcommittees. The Bay Program\u2019s  Implementation Committee adopted this framework in April 2005.

For example, monitoring  data on the blue crab population show that this population is at risk,  with below-average levels in all but 2 years since 1991. Similarly, water  clarity, which is critical to the health of underwater grasses that provide  important habitat for many bay animals, is degrading in 17 areas in the  bay and its tributaries, improving in only 1 area, and unchanged in 22  areas.

Generally, these data  tend to be more positive. For example, the 2004 State of the  Chesapeake Bay reported that the program is over half way toward  meeting its commitment to restore 25,000 acres of wetlands by  2010. In addition, the miles of forest buffers restored have increased  every year since 1996. These actions are important because they  contribute to the bay\u2019s health in the long term.

This plan, developed in 2000, describes a strategy of  restoring 2,500 acres per year through 2010.

For example,  the Toxics Subcommittee invested significant resources to develop a  detailed toxics work plan for achieving the toxics commitments in  Chesapeake 2000. Even though the Bay Program has not been able to  implement this work plan as planned because personnel and funding have  not been available, program officials told us that the plan is currently being  revised. It is unclear to us why the program is investing additional  resources to revise this plan when the necessary resources are not  available to implement it, and it is not one of the keystone commitments.  According to the Chair of the Toxics Subcommittee, the work groups are  generally responsible for developing strategies for achieving the  commitments in Chesapeake 2000 without knowing what level of  resources will be available to implement the strategies. Strategies are often  developed in this way because, according to a Bay Program official, while  they know how much each partner has agreed to provide for the upcoming  year, they do not know how much funding partners will provide in the  future.

For  example, the Bay Program has developed an oyster management plan for  its commitment to achieve, by 2010, a tenfold increase in oysters, based  upon a 1994 baseline. Maryland and Virginia have also developed state- specific plans for implementing the strategies laid out in the oyster  management plans.

Furthermore, it is not possible to meet the commitment of  removing the bay and its tributaries from the impaired waters list by  2010. According to several partners we spoke with, while point source  reductions called for in these strategies are achievable, nonpoint  sourcereductions are not. In addition, several partners told us that other  goals are also unachievable.

When there is good news to  report, we report it, but we have not been shy when reporting bad news as well.", "I am also concerned about the frequent allegation that the information presented by the  Program is not \u201ccredible.\u201d  The Report does not suggest that information presented by the  Program is not accurate, but rather that it is sometimes presented in an improper context, or in a  manner that confuses different types of data.  I hope that GAO will review its comments on  credibility with this observation in mind and that it will not leave the reader with the impression  that the public has been intentionally mislead or that the data presented by the Program meets  anything but the highest scientific standards.", "Finally, GAO recommends that the program develop a \u201ccomprehensive implementation  plan that takes into account available resources.\u201d  I would argue that that the tributary strategies  developed independently by each of the Bay partners (signatories and head water states), and the  implementation activities associated with them, will serve as the basis for the plan that GAO  proposes.", "I hope that readers of the report will understand that Virginia has begun implementation  of our tributary strategies.  For point sources, we have instituted a comprehensive regulatory  management program that will reduce and cap nutrient discharges from sewage treatment plants  and industrial facilities.  We have reinvigorated our grant program to assist municipal facilities  with the cost of upgrades.", "With respect to non-point sources, we are making significant strides in addressing urban  storm water management, and we are working closely with our farmers to reduce the adverse  impacts to water quality that result from a variety of agricultural practices.  We are also seeking  consistent funding for our agricultural grant programs.  Moreover, we fully recognize that our  tributary strategies are not static documents, and we are committed to making changes and  revisions to them in order to adapt to new circumstances and resources as we continue to  implement these strategies.", "The Commonwealth of Virginia certainly supports thoughtful and achievable  implementation plans developed through the Program partnership; however, we believe that the  states must be given the flexibility to operate within their own cultural, legal and political  environments.  The implementation path Virginia chooses must be accomplished in the context  of our state law and budgets, and any regional implementation plan must reflect this reality.", "I would also suggest that this recommendation highlights the significant role that the  federal government must continue to play in the Bay partnership.  In the current fiscal year the  Governor and the Virginia General Assembly, working together, made the largest appropriation  to the Water Quality Improvement Fund in our history.  Maryland has begun collecting the  Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fee, and Pennsylvania has passed Growing Greener II.  These  actions are resulting in multi-million dollar investments in water quality by the states at this time, and we will work to insure that it continues in the coming years.  We hope that our federal  partner will also step up its commitment to match this unprecedented level of state support.", "The restoration of the Chesapeake Bay will not be easy or cheap.  The partners are  engaged in a long-term enterprise that will only be successful through the full participation of  federal, state and local governments, as well as the private sector.", "I appreciate the time and thought that went into the development of the helpful  recommendations by GAO, and I look forward to the implementation of those recommendations.", "I also look forward to the positive results that can occur only with the continuation of the  partnership embodied in the Program.", "Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to comment on the Report.
