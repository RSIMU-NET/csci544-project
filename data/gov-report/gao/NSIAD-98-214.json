A company that participated in the Marine Corps and Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (MCLIST and JSLIST) programs raised concerns about the evaluation, claiming that it did not have an opportunity to submit an improved material for evaluation and that requirements changed in the transition from MCLIST to JSLIST. To assess the fairness of DOD\u2019s evaluation process, we determined whether, in the research and development context, DOD (1) provided sufficient notice to industry of the government\u2019s interest in identifying improved chemical defense materials, (2) provided industry sufficient opportunity to participate in the programs, and (3) changed requirements in the transition of MCLIST to JSLIST.

Starting in 1989, the Marine Corps\u2019 exploratory development efforts and subsequent MCLIST Advanced Technology Transition Demonstration program identified, evaluated, and field tested a number of chemical defense materials. During the same time period, the Army began an exploratory development effort to evaluate materials that offered less weight and bulk and enhanced protection, and the Air Force and the Navy began pursuing improved materials for their chemical protective uniforms.", "Separate from the MCLIST program, the Marine Corps fielded the Saratoga chemical and biological protective overgarment in 1991. The Saratoga garment, made from materials manufactured by Blucher, a German company, had an inner liner made with activated carbon spheres rather than the carbon-impregnated foam used by the military services at the time.", "All of the military services eventually combined their chemical defense material improvement efforts. Marine Corps, Army, Air Force, and Navy officials signed a memorandum of agreement, effective in November 1993, that defined the new JSLIST program and set forth the services\u2019 respective responsibilities for the development, production, and deployment of the next-generation chemical and biological protective suits. The Marine Corps Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Office was designated as the lead agency for the JSLIST program.", "The MCLIST and Army programs, which ultimately became JSLIST, were research and development activities. Research and development activities are generally conducted in a more flexible environment than acquisition programs and often involve informal communications with prospective participants. DOD used market research to seek out existing foreign and domestic technologies for testing. The minimum requirements that applied to DOD\u2019s efforts to identify improved chemical defense materials were published in a series of annual Broad Agency Announcements. These announcements described various areas of scientific or technical interest, provided specific points of contact, and included a statement that proposals would be evaluated based on merit and responsiveness to a government requirement.", "According to Marine Corps officials, the JSLIST program evaluated 57 material combinations (including liners, outershells, and combinations of both). The program evaluation was conducted in two phases. At the completion of phase I, 5 of the 57 material combinations were qualified to enter phase II for developmental and operational testing. At the completion of phase II in April 1997, only one of the five material combinations tested was determined to be acceptable for use in protective suits\u2014Blucher\u2019s Saratoga liner with a nylon and cotton outershell. (See app. I for further information on the JSLIST test program phases.) DOD is contracting for the suits through the National Industries for the Severely Handicapped and a company under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. The contracts require that the suits be made from the Blucher material combination. Appendix II contains additional information on the JSLIST contracts.", "The JSLIST acquisition strategy includes a pre-planned product improvement program. DOD announced this new competition in the Commerce Business Daily in June 1997. DOD is seeking additional materials to address JSLIST objectives that were not met in the initial evaluation, such as a chemical protective garment that lasts for 60 days and improved chemical protective gloves and socks. Production is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2000. Appendix III shows a timeline of key events in the MCLIST and JSLIST programs.", "Congress has raised concerns about the fact that the JSLIST material is produced by a sole-source company. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 conference report noted that DOD should consider taking actions necessary to qualify additional sources of supply for chemical protective garment materials. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to address this issue in DOD\u2019s next Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Annual Report to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Provided Adequate Notice to Industry", "paragraphs": ["Because the MCLIST and Army demonstrations were research and development activities, they were not subject to the formal notification requirements that apply to acquisitions. However, DOD provided adequate notice of its interest in identifying improved chemical protective materials through three different mechanisms. First, DOD conducted informal market research efforts and contacted industry directly to identify materials to include in the research and development programs. These efforts involved foreign as well as domestic suppliers. Officials from the Army\u2019s Natick Research, Development, and Engineering Center, which managed MCLIST for the Marine Corps, told us that they traveled worldwide to locate promising technologies.", "Second, ongoing exploratory development projects at Natick identified technologies that were subsequently included in the demonstration programs. Marine Corps officials told us that they directed certain new and promising materials from these projects into the MCLIST demonstration program.", "Last, notice of three Broad Agency Announcements, published in the Commerce Business Daily, alerted industry of the government\u2019s interest in developing new technologies for chemical defense materials. The dates of the announcements are shown in table 1.

However, reliance on informal communications\u2014common in a research and development environment\u2014resulted in some companies getting different information about deadlines for material submissions.", "Outside of the research and development programs, a company submitted an unsolicited proposal to the Marine Corps for an improved chemical defense material. The Marine Corps\u2019 subsequent rejection of the proposal was consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Participation in these programs resulted in 57 material combinations, submitted by 13 companies, being tested in JSLIST. However, because the MCLIST and Army programs operated separately, each had different timeframes and cutoff dates for submitting materials. For example, materials for the MCLIST program had to be submitted to Natick in time to make garments before field testing, which took place from April to June 1992. According to Marine Corps officials, industry was required to submit garments by September 30, 1992, for participation in the Army\u2019s demonstration, which was held in March 1993. If industry was submitting materials rather than fully constructed garments, the deadline was June 1992. The Army\u2019s program was industry\u2019s final opportunity to have materials entered in JSLIST.", "MCLIST participants were advised informally of the final date to submit materials to the Marine Corps program, but not all companies learned of the opportunity to submit materials to the Army program. For example, officials from the complainant company said that they were not told of the Army program\u2019s deadline for submission of materials until September 30, 1992, the last day submissions were allowed. Therefore, the company did not submit an improved material to Natick that could have been included in the Army\u2019s demonstration and JSLIST program. Officials from this company did not call the points of contact listed in the Broad Agency Announcement. Rather, they contacted a Natick official who had been involved with MCLIST but was not directly involved with JSLIST.", "In contrast, a company that fared poorly in MCLIST was advised by a Natick official who was also not named in the Broad Agency Announcements of its opportunity to submit an improved material for evaluation in the upcoming Army program. Because contacts between DOD officials and industry were informal and largely undocumented, we could not determine whether all companies that contacted the Natick officials named in the Broad Agency Announcements were told of the opportunity to participate in the Army\u2019s demonstration program.", "According to Marine Corps officials, the closing date of each Broad Agency Announcement represented the cutoff dates for material submissions to the demonstration programs. For example, the officials said that the closing date of the final announcement\u2014September 30, 1992\u2014was the deadline for entering materials in the Army\u2019s demonstration program. However, Natick officials told us that the Broad Agency Announcements were not connected to cutoff dates for material submissions to the demonstration programs. For example, the officials noted that the cutoff date for the MCLIST demonstration was simply tied to their need to receive materials and make garments in time for field testing.", "The three Broad Agency Announcements did not cite particular programs\u2014such as MCLIST or JSLIST\u2014or cutoff dates for material submissions and thus were not explicitly tied to the deadline for material submissions. Nothing in the third announcement sets it apart from the two previous announcements to indicate that September 30, 1992, was industry\u2019s last opportunity to submit a material to JSLIST via the Army\u2019s demonstration program. Furthermore, a fiscal year 1993 Broad Agency Announcement, issued a year after entry to JSLIST was closed, is nearly identical to the three previous announcements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marine Corps Rejected Unsolicited Proposal", "paragraphs": ["In June 1992, 3 months before the closing date of the fiscal year 1992 Broad Agency Announcement, the complainant company submitted an unsolicited proposal to the Marine Corps for an improved chemical defense material. The company had developed this improved material after its initial submission to the MCLIST program. The proposal\u2014submitted outside of the Advanced Technology Transition Demonstration process\u2014was for a competitive alternative to the Saratoga suits that the Marine Corps had begun to field in 1991. The company offered to absorb a substantial share of the testing costs if its product did not meet the Marine Corps\u2019 requirements.", "In April 1993, more than 6 months after the deadline for submissions to the Army\u2019s demonstration program, the Marine Corps rejected the unsolicited proposal, stating that it was duplicative in nature to an existing Marine Corps effort. The rejection letter noted that the Marine Corps had already initiated a research and development effort based on the carbon sphere technology identified in the proposal.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation provided that an unsolicited proposal be rejected when it resembled an ongoing acquisition or did not demonstrate an innovative and unique concept. The Marine Corps\u2019 actions in rejecting the proposal were therefore consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. However, we believe the Marine Corps missed an opportunity to refer the firm to the Army\u2019s demonstration program, which ultimately became part of JSLIST, before it was too late for entry. Because a joint program was already planned at that time, the Marine Corps could have informed the company that the Broad Agency Announcement was still open, thus allowing the firm\u2019s potential entry into the Army\u2019s demonstration program. We could not determine whether the outcome of the JSLIST program would have differed if the firm\u2019s material had been assessed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Basic Requirements Did Not Significantly Change", "paragraphs": ["The complainant company asserted that the transition to JSLIST had caused a significant change in requirements. The company was primarily concerned that the requirement for a single-use garment in MCLIST had changed to one that was launderable in JSLIST. Officials from the company stated that the changed requirements placed it at a disadvantage relative to the competition because it was not allowed to submit a different material under JSLIST. However, the basic requirements for a lightweight, launderable, chemical protective overgarment did not change during the transition.", "The requirements for MCLIST and JSLIST were based on assessments of the services\u2019 missions and the threat. DOD\u2019s basic requirement for both programs was to develop a lightweight, launderable, durable material that protected against chemical agent penetration and reduced heat stress. These fundamental requirements were reflected in the three Broad Agency Announcements issued from fiscal years 1990 to 1992. The latter two announcements added a requirement for protection from toxic aerosols. MCLIST and JSLIST both sought improved materials that could be laundered multiple times and reused, unlike the single-use garment that the Army, Air Force, and Navy were using at the time, which could not be laundered.", "Although the fundamental requirements did not change, each service added various service-unique requirements to the JSLIST program. For example, the Army required, in addition to the standard 30-day garment, a single-use, 7-day garment that would weigh less than the 30-day garment and provide the same level of chemical protection. In addition, the Air Force required chemical protection for liquid dispersed by air burst munitions or spray tanks. Although materials were tested that would accommodate these variations, the basic requirements for the overgarment did not change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Program May Identify Additional Sources of Supply", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 conference report urged DOD to consider taking actions necessary to qualify additional sources of supply for its chemical protective garment materials.

The conferees also directed the Secretary of Defense to address the issue as a special area of interest in DOD\u2019s next annual report to Congress on the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense program. However, the subsequent annual report to Congress, issued in February 1998, did not address the issue of qualifying additional sources of supply. A DOD official told us that the reporting requirement had been overlooked.", "In May 1998, DOD issued an addendum to its February 1998 report to address the congressional reporting requirement. The addendum cited DOD\u2019s ongoing pre-planned product improvement program as a potential mechanism for identifying additional sources of supply for the requirements that were not achieved in the JSLIST program.

DOD provided industry adequate notice of the government\u2019s interest in improved chemical defense garment materials and sufficient opportunity to participate in the programs. The basic requirement for a lightweight, less bulky overgarment that could be reused after laundering did not change in the transition from MCLIST to JSLIST, although each service added certain unique requirements.
