The reported advantages included generally obtaining facilities more quickly than through the appropriations process and installations receiving 100 percent of the value of negotiated payments received from a real-property interest as opposed to cash payments where only 50 percent of the value is guaranteed to be provided back to the installation. However, some services have implemented policy changes such as returning 100 percent of the value of the real-property interest back to the installation\u2014up to $1 million when accepting cash payments.

In-kind construction and renovation  projects, which DOD has allowed for more than 20 years, for purposes of  this report, are defined as projects resulting from certain host-nation  support programs or from transactions in which DOD provides goods,  services, real property, or an interest in real property (including, but not  limited to, a leasehold or easement) in exchange for compensation, and  in which any part of that compensation is provided in the form of  construction or renovation services. This definition of \u201cin-kind construction  and renovation projects\u201d is broader than the concept of \u201cin-kind  payments\u201d for residual value  or projects received in lieu of cash  compensation as part of a domestic agreement with a third party because  the definition includes host-nation support for installation facilities  overseas. Voluntary contributions made by a host nation for the purpose  of defraying costs to station, maintain, and train U.S. military forces in its  country do not constitute a payment or, in the absence of binding  international agreements, obligate a host nation to make payments to the  United States. Host-nation support provided in the form of direct  construction rather than a cash contribution is viewed by DOD as one of  three basic types of in-kind construction.", "At domestic locations, in-kind payment projects help installations to  complete renovation and construction projects that, according to agency  officials, usually do not compete well in the internal budget process and  consequently are not likely to be included in DOD\u2019s budget request. At  overseas locations, host nations may provide a facility or construction or  renovation services to help offset the U.S. costs of stationing military  forces overseas. For any overseas in-kind construction or renovation  projects, the selection is subject to relevant international agreements,  statutory authorities, and DOD policy. Certain international agreements  include efforts to relocate U.S. forces and consolidate infrastructure being  used by DOD. The Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have  statutory authority under sections 2667 and 2668 of Title 10 of the United  States Code to lease or issue an easement on real property under their  control or jurisdiction within the United States in exchange for in-kind  construction or renovation projects, subject to certain restrictions. In-kind  payment projects received for both leases and easements may include  alteration, repair or improvements to existing facilities or construction of  new facilities.", "In previous reviews, GAO and the DOD Inspector General reported  internal control weaknesses related to in-kind payment projects accepted   by DOD. In our 2011 review, we found that DOD\u2019s enhanced-use   lease program, which utilizes in-kind payment projects, did not have  procedures to regularly monitor and analyze program administration costs  and two of the services did not have clear guidance describing how the  fair-market value of the lease interest should be determined. We  recommended that the services develop procedures to regularly monitor  and analyze program costs to help ensure program costs are in line with  program benefits. Likewise, we recommended that the Army and the Air  Force review and clarify guidance describing how the fair-market value of  the real property interest should be determined and how the receipt of  fair-market value can best be ensured. DOD concurred with our  recommendations and the services have developed new procedures and  issued new guidance to address them.", "Section 2805 of the Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act  included a provision for us to report on construction or renovation of  DOD\u2019s facilities using in-kind payment projects that were begun during  the preceding two years, with annual updates to follow. In April 2014, we  issued the first report that described in-kind payment projects initiated in  fiscal years 2011 and 2012. This report identifies (1) the in-kind payment  projects that DOD reported it initiated during fiscal year 2013, and  discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages of accepting in- kind payment projects instead of cash for domestic real-estate  transactions and (2) the extent to which the military services have  developed and implemented guidance and procedures to value domestic  in-kind payment projects to ensure the receipt of fair-market value. The  act also provided that we report a listing of facilities constructed or  renovated with the use of in-kind payment projects, the value in U.S.  dollars of the construction or renovation project, the source of the in-kind  payment project, the agreement pursuant to which the in-kind payment  project was initiated, and a description of the purpose and need for the  construction or renovation project. The listing of facilities appears in  appendixes to this report.", "To identify the in-kind payment projects that DOD reported it initiated  during fiscal year 2013, we compiled information that DOD provided on  in-kind construction and renovation projects for fiscal year 2013, their  value in U.S. dollars, the source of the in-kind payment project, the  agreement or statutory authority, and their purpose and need from the  departments of the Army, Navy (which includes the Marine Corps), and  Air Force and their components. We corroborated the project data that  each DOD component submitted by requesting that the component  provide the supporting documentation where the data were obtained;  however, supporting documentation for some projects was not readily  available. For these projects, we asked DOD to describe, to the extent  possible, the source or calculation method for the estimated value of the  in-kind payment project, initiation date and the real-property system  classification code. By taking these steps, we determined that the  reported data for the payment projects located in the United States and  Germany were generally sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. However, limited supporting documentation was readily available  in English for various in-kind payment projects in Japan and Korea and,  according to DOD officials, the specific costs incurred by the  Governments of Korea and Japan for many projects was not required to  be disclosed to the United States. As a result, we were unable to  determine the reliability of much of the reported project data for Korea  and Japan. The report notes those instances where we were unable to  determine the reliability of the reported data for payment projects located  in these two countries. To describe the potential advantages and  disadvantages of accepting in-kind payment projects instead of cash in  exchange for interests in domestic real-property transactions, we  interviewed officials from the services\u2019 real-property management offices  to discuss the factors they consider in determining whether to accept  cash or in-kind payment projects, the rationale for preferring one type of  payment (cash or in-kind) over another, and the advantages and  disadvantages in terms of administration and costs of one type over  another.", "To identify the extent to which the military services have developed and  implemented guidance and procedures to value domestic in-kind payment  projects to ensure the receipt of fair-market value, we compared the  military services\u2019 guidance governing real-estate transactions to DOD\u2019s  guidance for establishing receipt of fair-market value of its real-estate  interest to ensure the service\u2019s guidance captured this requirement. We  then reviewed the military services\u2019 established policies where available  and the procedures on determining the value of in-kind payment projects  to determine if their procedures would ensure receipt of fair-market value.", "Furthermore, we obtained and analyzed the in-kind payment project  agreements and supporting documentation, such as the lease exhibits,  site and task work orders, and the real-estate appraisal for the 29  domestic in-kind payment projects initiated during fiscal year 2013, to  identify how the services determined the actual value of these specific in- kind payment projects to ensure fair-market value would be achieved.

Concerning cash payments received in exchange for leases  and easements, section 2667 provides that, generally, money rentals  must be deposited into a special account in the U.S. Treasury and must  be appropriated before they can be used. Once appropriated, section  2667 provides that at least 50 percent of the funds shall be available for  use only at the installation where the leased property is located.", "Overseas in-kind payment projects are subject to specific bilateral  agreements and statutory authorities. Bilateral agreements include efforts  to relocate U.S. forces and consolidate infrastructure being used by DOD.  There are also other agreements between the United States and host  nations to defray some of the costs of stationing U.S. forces overseas,  and to support installations that will continue to be used by the United  States\u2014known as enduring installations\u2014through the use of host-nation  resources.", "According to DOD real-property management officials, installation  personnel are generally responsible for selecting domestic in-kind  payment projects based on the needs of the installation and its chain of  command. Each installation has a list of unfunded construction and  renovation projects that were not included in the military services\u2019 budget  submissions to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The military  services generally allow each installation to decide which projects from  these lists should be considered for in-kind payment projects. The  responsibility for managing in-kind payment projects is generally shared  between installation personnel and the services\u2019 respective real-property  management offices or agencies. Within the Navy, the Secretary of the  Navy has delegated certain real-property management responsibilities to  Naval Facilities Engineering Command. Specifically, Naval Facilities  Engineering Command, subject to certain requirements, is authorized to  grant, execute, amend, administer, and terminate all instruments granting  the use of Navy-controlled real property, to include real-estate  transactions using in-kind payment projects. Within the Air Force, the  Secretary of the Air Force has delegated certain real-property  management responsibilities to the Air Force Civil Engineer Center. The  Air Force Civil Engineer Center is responsible for acquiring, disposing of,  and managing all Air Force-controlled real property. Within the Army, the  Chief of Engineers is the principal advisor to the Secretary of the Army for  policy formulation related to real property.

According to  officials of the Army Corps of Engineers, Air Force Civil Engineer Center,  and Naval Facilities Engineering Command, in-kind payment projects can  be advantageous because the value received does not need to be re- appropriated and can be immediately available to the installation. While  congressional notification is required if the estimated annual fair-market  value of a lease or easement exceeds $750,000, the law does not require  appropriation of the funding for in-kind payment projects, so the benefits  may be realized sooner. For example, in 2008 at Nellis Air Force Base,  Nevada, the Air Force entered into an agreement with the city of North  Las Vegas to allow construction of a wastewater treatment plant on 41  acres of land leased from Nellis. As part of its payment to the base, the  city agreed to fund the construction of a new $27 million fitness center.  According to Air Force Civil Engineer Center officials, the base had a  longstanding requirement for an updated fitness center but was unable to  secure funding for it. Once the agreement was signed, the city  immediately began construction and the base was able to open the new  fitness center in 2012. By contrast, if an installation receives cash  payments, section 2667 requires the immediate deposit of all cash into a  special account in the U.S. Treasury where it is subject to the  appropriation process before the installation can use it. Officials stated  that it can take up to a year between the deposit of the cash payments  and the funds being provided to the installation.", "The originating installation is more likely to receive100 percent of the  negotiated payments for the real property interest. According to Army  Corps of Engineers, Air Force Civil Engineer Center and Naval Facilities  Engineering Command officials, although the receipt of in-kind payment  projects is at the discretion of the respective military department  Secretary, the military department secretaries generally allow the  installations where the real-property is located to receive 100 percent of  any negotiated in-kind payments resulting from real property agreements.  Conversely, section 2667 states that, subject to appropriations,  installations are guaranteed to receive only 50 percent of any deposited  cash payments, and can receive the other 50 percent only at the  discretion of the respective military department secretary. In-kind  payments are not governed by similar restrictions, and, as such, are more  likely to result into the installation receiving 100 percent of the value  generated by its real estate transactions.", "Installations may have the opportunity to potentially receive infrastructure  improvements worth more than the fair-market value of the property  interest. Air Force Civil Engineer Center and Naval Facilities Engineering  Command officials stated that the nature of a potential developer\u2019s  business or expertise and economies of scale may allow the developer to  provide in-kind payment projects worth more than the fair-market value of  the property interest by obtaining construction materials or labor at a  below-market cost. For example, in 2004 the Navy entered into an  agreement with a real-estate development firm to redevelop the  Moanalua Shopping Center at the Pearl Harbor Naval Complex, Pearl  Harbor, Hawaii. As part of the agreement, the Navy conveyed the existing  shopping center to the developer as well as development rights for up to  another 15,000 square feet of new commercial market space. As  payment to the Navy, the developer was required to demolish over  40,000 square feet of existing space and to develop 40,000 square feet of  new administrative space to be used as a Navy community support  services center. A 2004 Navy analysis valued these demolition and  construction projects at about $21 million\u2014which was about $8 million  more than the appraised market value of the property conveyed by the  Navy.", "Installation officials generally have more flexibility in real-estate  transactions. According to officials of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center,  in-kind payment projects offer installation officials greater flexibility in  executing real-estate transactions, especially in cases where a developer  does not have cash readily available at the time the real-estate  transaction is executed. Also, allowing in-kind payment projects can  increase the potential pool of developers, the officials stated. For  example, in-kind payment projects may be the only way to secure  adequate value from non-profit or charitable organizations that may not  have adequate cash resources but have the ability to provide goods and  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Disadvantage", "paragraphs": ["These same military service officials reported that one common  disadvantage to accepting in-kind payment projects rather than cash  payments is the amount of additional administrative work and oversight  needed to execute the in-kind agreements. Army Corps of Engineers, Air  Force Civil Engineer Center, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command  officials identified three scenarios in which in-kind payment projects likely  will require additional work and oversight.", "Additional work and oversight to ensure that the transaction complies  with statutory requirements. Several statutes govern the receipt of in- kind payment projects, so installation personnel conduct reviews to  ensure that the transactions follow appropriate financial and  administrative procedures as required by law.", "Additional work and oversight to ensure that the developer is  complying with the terms of the transaction. For example, installation  personnel work to properly monitor construction and renovation  progress to ensure that the developer is adequately providing any  agreed-upon services over the terms of the agreement.", "Additional work and oversight to ensure that in-kind payment projects  are properly valued over time. Some transactions involving in-kind  payment projects, such as enhanced-use leases, can last as long as  50 years and the in-kind payment projects may continue over these  50 years. As a result, installation personnel will be responsible for the  extra work to value in-kind payment projects during the 50-year lease.  By contrast, cash value is known and requires no extra work to value.", "To address the disadvantage of accepting in-kind versus cash payments,  some of the military services have implemented policy changes for  accepting cash. For example, the Army has issued guidance stating that  cash payments are preferred over in-kind payment projects. According to  the Army memorandum, leases typically involve only cash payments  because procedures to properly value and assure receipt of in-kind  payment projects over a lease\u2019s terms can be administratively  burdensome. This memorandum was issued partly in response to our  2011 work that found problems with the adequacy of those procedures.  Army officials stated that in-kind payment projects may still be accepted,  however, if installation officials determine that accepting them is in the  best interest of the installation and they document the basis for that  determination. Approaching the disadvantage from a different angle, the  Air Force issued guidance that requires the return of 100 percent of the  net proceeds from cash payments\u2014up to $1 million\u2014to the originating  installation. This policy negates the advantage in-kind payment projects  have in assuring that the originating installation receives 100 percent of  the negotiated value of the in-kind payment projects for the real-property  interest since the originating installation receives the full amount of the  cash payment up to $1 million. According to Air Force officials, the policy  was implemented to not only eliminate some of the administrative burden  of accepting in-kind payment projects but also to reward installations for  finding ways to reduce infrastructure costs by identifying alternative  funding sources to military construction appropriations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Military Services Have Issued Guidance Regarding the Receipt of Fair- Market Value and Follow Similar Procedures for Valuing Domestic In- Kind Payment Projects to Ensure Receipt of Fair- Market Value", "paragraphs": ["Our review of various service policies governing real-estate transactions  identified that all three services have issued guidance requiring that the  cumulative value of in-kind payment projects reflect the fair-market value  of the real-property interest in real-estate transactions and follow similar  procedures to value domestic in-kind payment projects to ensure the  receipt of fair- market value. Based, in part, on prior GAO  recommendations, each of the services has issued guidance to require  the determination of fair-market value for real-property assets included in  real-estate transactions and have provided instructions on how to  determine the fair-market value. For example, to determine the fair- market value of the real-property interest, the Army, Air Force and Navy  use certified real-estate appraisers to determine the full market value of  their real-property interests and require that the appraisals be conducted  in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal  Practice prior to the finalization of any real-estate transaction. However,  our review of service-level guidance governing real-estate transactions  did not identify any specific steps to follow for valuing in-kind payment  projects. Officials from the offices of the Army Corps of Engineers, Air  Force Civil Engineer Center, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command  confirmed that no specific guidance is available, but described similar  broad procedures and documentation requirements that they used for  determining the value of their in-kind payment projects. Officials indicated  that installation public-works personnel, with the aid as needed of the  respective service\u2019s regional real-property management office, generally  were responsible for determining the value of the in-kind payment  projects. In some cases, installation personnel prepare formal  requirements documents, such as a DOD form 1391 or some other form  of a statement of work, or independent government cost estimate to  document the value of the in-kind work to be performed. In other cases,  installation personnel review and validate a contractor\u2019s cost estimates for  valuing certain projects instead of obtaining an independent cost  estimate. Once the cost estimate is developed, installation public-works  personnel, with the aid as needed of the respective service\u2019s regional  real-property management office, use the cost estimate to negotiate with  the lessee for the completion of the work. If the developer and installation  officials agree to the value of the work and that the value of the work is  within the range of fair-market value of the real-estate interest, the parties  execute the agreement to document the services to be performed as an  in-kind payment project in lieu of cash.", "Table 3 describes the 29 domestic projects and lists which type of  procedures the service used to document the value of the in-kind  payment projects.

To determine whether a project was an in-kind payment project,  we defined \u201cin-kind construction and renovation projects\u201d in this report as  those resulting from certain host-nation support programs or from  transactions (whether domestic or overseas) in which DOD provides  goods, services, real property, or an interest in real property (including,  but not limited to, a leasehold or easement) in exchange for  compensation, and in which any part of that compensation is provided in  the form of construction or renovation services. This definition of \u201cin-kind  construction and renovation projects,\u201d which was also used in our 2014  report, is broader than the concept of in-kind \u201cpayments\u201d for residual  value or received in-lieu-of cash compensation as part of a domestic  agreement with a third party because the definition includes host-nation  support for installation facilities overseas. Voluntary contributions made  by a host nation for the purpose of defraying costs to station, maintain,  and train U.S. military forces in its country do not constitute a payment or  obligate a host nation to make payments to the United States. We  excluded from our definition of \u201cin-kind construction or renovation  projects\u201d gifts, sustainment projects (e.g., regularly scheduled  maintenance and inspections), and cash sales or rent used to finance  construction or renovation. To determine that a project was initiated in  2013, we also re-used our 2014 report\u2019s definition for \u201cinitiated\u201d as that  point at which the party responsible for completing the construction or  renovation project received an official notice that allowed them to proceed  with the project. To summarize the purposes of the projects, we used the  real-property system classification code reported by DOD for each project  as part of their data submission to us. The first digit of the code  represents the facility class, and we used the facility class to represent  the purpose of the projects. We corroborated the project data that each  DOD component submitted by requesting that the component provide the  supporting documentation where the data was obtained. We attempted to  obtain supporting documentation for all the data elements for all of the  domestic and overseas projects. We were able to obtain corroborating  documentation for all of the domestic projects and the projects in  Germany. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations and Environment also reviewed the information the DOD  components provided to GAO on in-kind construction and renovation  projects for fiscal year 2013 for consistency and to ensure that the data  were for projects that we considered \u201cin-kind payment projects.\u201d Lastly,  after we compiled the project data, we provided each component with an  additional opportunity to review and confirm the data. By taking these  steps, we determined that the reported project data for the domestic  projects and the projects in Germany were generally sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. However, numerous projects in Korea and  Japan were executed under bilateral agreements or as part of voluntary  host nation programs where the host nation manages the programming  and execution processes and supporting documentation for these  projects was not readily available in English or the specific project costs  incurred by the Governments of Korea and Japan were, according to  DOD officials, not required to be disclosed to the United States.

We also  interviewed officials from the Army Corps of Engineers, Air Force Civil  Engineering Center, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command to  discuss the factors they consider in determining whether to accept cash  or in-kind payment projects, the rationale for preferring one type of  payment (cash or in-kind payment project) over another, and the  advantages and disadvantages in terms of administration and costs of  executing cash versus in-kind payment projects.", "To identify the extent to which the military services have developed and  implemented guidance and procedures to value in-kind payment projects  to ensure the receipt of fair-market value for domestic projects, we  compared the military services\u2019 guidance governing real-estate  transactions to DOD\u2019s guidance for leasing and obtaining fair-market  value of its real-estate interest. We then reviewed the military services\u2019  established policies and procedures where available to determine if their  procedures would ensure receipt of fair-market value. Furthermore, we  obtained and reviewed the in-kind payment project agreements and  supporting documentation, such as the lease exhibits, site and task work  orders, and the real-estate appraisal for the 29 domestic in-kind payment  projects initiated during fiscal year 2013 to review whether the military  services were following the established procedures they described for  valuing these specific in-kind payment projects. In addition to the  previously mentioned DOD offices, we also interviewed officials from the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and  Environment, Army Office Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management, Office of Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations,  Environment and Logistics), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Navy (Energy, Installations and Environment) to determine the  procedures and documentation requirements used by the services to  value in-kind payment projects.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2014 to September  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
