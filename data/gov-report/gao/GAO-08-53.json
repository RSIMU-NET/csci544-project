Specifically, it has developed procedures for identifying and collecting information about its business systems to support investment selection and control, and assigned responsibility for ensuring that the information collected during project identification meets the needs of the investment management process. However, the department has not established the management structures needed to support effective investment oversight. It also has not fully documented business system investment policies and procedures for directing Investment Review Board operations, selecting new investments, reselecting ongoing investments, integrating the investment funding and investment selection processes, and developing and maintaining complete business system investment portfolio(s). Department officials stated that they are aware of the lack of an Investment Review Board and the absence of documented policies and procedures in certain areas of project and portfolio-level management, and are currently working on new guidance to address these areas. According to these officials, the new policies and procedures are expected to be approved by March 2008. However, until the department assigns responsibility for overseeing project-level management and portfolio management to a departmentwide review board and fully defines policies and procedures for both individual projects and portfolios of projects, it risks selecting and controlling these business system investments in a way that is inconsistent, incomplete, and ad hoc, which in turn reduces the chances that these investments will meet mission needs in the most effective manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems.

This stage also involves developing the  capability to control projects so that they finish predictably within  established cost and schedule expectations and developing the capability  to identify potential exposures to risk and put in place strategies to  mitigate that risk. Further, it involves evaluating completed projects to  ensure they meet business needs and collecting lessons learned to improve  the IT investment management process. The basic management processes  established in Stage 2 lay the foundation for more mature management  capabilities in Stage 3, which represents a major step forward in maturity,  in which the agency moves from project-centric processes to a portfolio  approach, evaluating potential investments by how well they support the  agency\u2019s missions, strategies, and goals.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options.
