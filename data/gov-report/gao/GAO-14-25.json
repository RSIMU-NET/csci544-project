Improper  payments include overpayments, which are any payments that should not  have been made or were more than allowed. While states and certain  federal entities have had long-standing roles in program integrity  activities, such as identifying improper payments and recovering  overpayments, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) expanded  CMS\u2019s role. CMS subsequently established the National Medicaid Audit  Program (NMAP), which uses contractors to audit state Medicaid claims.
