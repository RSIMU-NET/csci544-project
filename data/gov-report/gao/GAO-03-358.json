Between fiscal years 1992 and 2002, U.S. agencies have funded more than $580 million in democracy-related programs in these countries.

These programs have primarily focused on promoting (1) the rule of law, (2) governance, (3) human rights, and (4) elections. U.S. assistance has helped bring about important reforms in criminal justice in five of the six countries, improved transparency and accountability of some government functions, increased attention to human rights, and supported elections that observation groups have considered free and fair. However, host governments have not always sustained these reforms by providing the needed political, financial, and human capital. For example, host countries often did not support training programs, computer systems, or equipment after U.S. funding ended. In other cases, U.S.-supported programs were limited and targeted, and countries have not adopted these programs on a national scale. Since host country resources for sustaining democracy programs are difficult to mobilize, it is crucial that the U.S. government and other donors manage available international resources as efficiently as possible for maximum impact and sustainability. Several management issues have affected democracy assistance programs. Poor coordination among the key U.S. agencies has been a long-standing management problem, and cooperation with other foreign donors has been limited. U.S. agencies' strategic plans do not outline how these agencies will overcome coordination problems and cooperate with other foreign donors on program planning and implementation to maximize scarce resources. Also, U.S. agencies have not consistently evaluated program results or shared lessons learned from completed projects, thus missing opportunities to enhance the outcomes of their programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report discusses the nature, impact, and factors that affect U.S.  democracy assistance to Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru as well as  the overarching management issues that have affected program planning and implementation.

Of the six countries in our study (Bolivia,  Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru), all but Colombia  and Nicaragua experienced a strengthening of democracy by these  standards between 1992 and 2002 (see table 1 and app. VI for more  information). Appendix V provides further information on the quality of life  and selected indicators for the selected countries.", "In September 2001, the 34 democratic members of the Organization of  American States (OAS) unanimously adopted the Inter-American  Democratic Charter, declaring that \u201cthe peoples of the Americas have a  right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote  and defend it.\u201d  This commitment goes beyond preserving elections to  ensuring the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms, popular  participation in government, the rule of law, the separation of powers, and  transparent and accountable government institutions. Despite this  commitment, many Latin American nations have yet to fully achieve these  conditions. According to the OAS charter, the hallmarks of democracy  include  respect for the rule of law on the part of all institutions and sectors of   constitutional subordination of all state institutions to the legally   access to and the exercise of power in accordance with the rule of law;   transparency in government activities and probity, responsible public  administration on the part of governments;  participation of citizens in decisions relating to their own development;  separation of powers and independence of the branches of government;  a pluralistic system of political parties and organizations;  freedom of expression and of the press;  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and  periodic, free, and fair elections based on secret balloting and universal  suffrage.", "Although the national governments of all six countries we visited have been  democratically elected since the 1990s, they face serious social, economic,  and political challenges that have made strengthening key democratic  institutions a difficult and long-term endeavor.  In South America,  Colombia continues to struggle with the escalation of a nearly 40-year  campaign to overthrow the government, with attendant economic and  social disruptions that affect thousands of its citizens each year, while Peru  is emerging from the shadow of authoritarian rule and the violent actions of  insurgent guerillas. Bolivia, which has had a relatively more stable political  environment, must now deal with a host of economic challenges and an  increasingly disillusioned and vocal indigenous class. In Central America,  El Salvador\u2019s and Guatemala\u2019s Peace Accords were signed in 1992 and 1996,  respectively, providing a framework for rebuilding those societies after  decades of civil war. Nicaragua, one of the poorest nations in the  hemisphere, still confronts political polarization and corruption, according  to U.S. officials.", "The United States has provided assistance to many of the countries of Latin  America and the Caribbean to aid in strengthening democracies. From  fiscal years 1992 to 2002, the six countries in our study, Bolivia, Colombia,  El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru, received about $580 million  in assistance (see fig. 2 for distribution of funding among these six  countries). Almost all U.S. funding for democracy assistance, authorized  under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, is appropriated to the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of  State. A significant amount of assistance has been allocated to the  Department of Justice through interagency fund transfers from USAID and  State. From fiscal years 1992 through 2002, USAID has administered $479.3  million of program funding for democracy activities in this region, while  the Justice Department has administered $101.3 million. The State  Department also administered democracy-related programs  during this  time period. However, the department could not readily provide  disaggregated data on the bulk of its democracy-related programs, such as  funding provided by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law  Enforcement Affairs (INL). Figure 3 shows the distribution among the  major implementing agencies of democracy assistance funding to the six  countries we reviewed. Other organizations with democracy-related  assistance activities funded by the U.S. government include the National  Endowment for Democracy, the Inter-American Foundation, and the  Department of the Treasury.", "These agencies provide assistance through a variety of means, primarily in  the form of goods and services to governmental and nongovernmental  organizations and individuals. For some projects, such as law enforcement  training, U.S. government agencies provide the assistance directly, or with  contract assistance, as needed. For other projects, such as institutional  development projects, the agencies distribute aid to beneficiaries primarily  through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts with  nongovernmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, and firms  located in the United States or overseas. Cash disbursements are generally  not provided directly to foreign governments.", "Democracy assistance efforts, if successful, can influence political stability  and economic growth. Economists have long demonstrated that countries  with stronger democratic institutions are more likely to experience  sustained economic growth. For example, the positive relationship  between the respect for property and contractual rights and the rate of  economic growth has been found to be especially strong. Law-respecting,  accountable governments tend to provide conditions that encourage long- term investments and innovation. As the standard of living improves, the  probability of further democratization of political institutions over time  increases substantially.", "Many other foreign donors have also provided democracy assistance to the  countries covered in our review. Multilateral donors, including the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank, the United Nations,  and OAS have been active in funding democracy-related activities. In  addition, many Western European countries, the European Union, and  private international donors have also financed projects similar to those  funded by the United States. We did not attempt to determine the total  amounts of funding and the outcomes associated with this assistance,  given the difficulty in identifying many different efforts, their costs, and the  paucity of studies documenting program outcomes.", "The United States has taken a broad approach to providing democracy  assistance. The assistance approach generally incorporates four elements:  (1) rule of law, (2) governance (3) human rights, and (4) elections. (See fig.  4 for an illustration of these elements.)", "Rule of Law:  These projects support constitutional and criminal code  reforms to make criminal justice more swift, transparent, and  participatory; establish new institutions and enhance existing ones to  improve management of the justice sector and to help safeguard the legal  rights of citizens; provide technical assistance, training, and management  information systems for judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and law  enforcement agencies to improve their capabilities and increase their  efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness; increase access to justice through  mediation, alternative dispute resolution, and other mechanisms; and  reform law school curricula to reflect modern methods and necessary skills  for practicing law.", "Governance:  These projects seek to improve the administrative, analytical,  and outreach capacity of legislatures; strengthen the administrative  capacity and accountability of municipalities and increase citizen  participation in local government; and foster a greater public awareness  about corruption and implement strategies to enable government  institutions to become more transparent and accountable.", "Human Rights:  These projects are intended to prevent human rights  abuses through greater public awareness, protect citizens against abuses,  and respond to past violations through legal action and public  reconciliation processes.", "Elections:  These projects are designed to improve election administration,  enhance voter access, and legitimize election results by supporting  domestic and international observers.", "USAID and the State and Justice Departments have not traditionally  accounted for funding data according to the four elements previously  described but have provided this information for fiscal years 2000 through  2002, as shown in figure 5. While assistance to civil society appears to be  relatively small in figure 5, important civil society support is also included  through the four programmatic areas we focus on in this report.", "While USAID funds and implements assistance projects in all areas covered  by this report, the State Department provides funding to the Justice  Department for law enforcement assistance. The State Department\u2019s  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor also provided a relatively  small amount of democracy-related assistance to some of the six countries  covered in our review, as did the department\u2019s Western Hemisphere public  diplomacy program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess the nature, impact, and sustainability of U.S. assistance programs  to strengthen democratic institutions in Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador,  Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru, we first interviewed headquarters  officials in Washington, D.C., at the departments and agencies providing  rule of law, governance, human rights, and election assistance, including  USAID, the State and Justice Departments, the National Endowment for  Democracy, and the Inter-American Foundation. We also interviewed  experts at nongovernmental organizations, including the National  Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the  Washington Office on Latin America, and Human Rights Watch. For all six  countries, we reviewed Mission Performance Plans, USAID country and  regional strategic plans and other planning documents, funding  agreements, contracts, and project evaluations. We obtained funding  information for fiscal years 1992 through 2002 from USAID headquarters  and country staff and the Justice Department (the Justice Department  administers funding provided by the State Department). The State  Department could not readily differentiate most of its democracy-related  assistance funding during this period from counternarcotics-related  funding, which we did not include in the scope of our review. We also  reviewed our prior reports on democracy assistance to Latin America.", "We conducted fieldwork in each of the previously identified six countries  between March and September 2002. In each of these countries, we met  with the U.S. Ambassador; the USAID Chief of Mission; political and  economic officers; senior U.S. officials representing agencies with rule of  law, governance, human rights, or elections programs; and numerous  program staff, including contractors responsible for implementing the  projects. We interviewed host country officials at supreme courts; law  enforcement organizations; legislatures; national ombudsmen; and  ministries covering justice, police, local governments, government  oversight, and elections. We visited training schools for judges,  prosecutors, and police; local justice centers; local government pilot  projects; and legislative outreach offices, as appropriate. We also met with  numerous representatives from nongovernmental organizations and other  groups representing a broad spectrum of civil society, including local  citizen groups involved with rule of law, governance, human rights, and  elections programs.", "To analyze the overarching management issues that have affected program  outcomes, we analyzed project documentation, interviewed knowledgeable  officials, and reviewed assistance activities on field visits to the six  countries. We then analyzed and synthesized information across the six  countries. To look for broader themes, we also interviewed experts in the  field, including those from nongovernmental organizations and academia,  and attended USAID\u2019s annual democracy officers\u2019 conference in 2001.", "We performed our work from August 2001 through December 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Rule of Law Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Reforming the criminal justice sector has been a critical area of concern in  Latin America. Nontransparent legal processes, corruption, and  incarceration of prisoners for months or years before trials can undermine  confidence that justice is being dispensed fairly. Surveys done in the region  have shown that high levels of crime and citizens\u2019 lack of trust in justice  institutions are positively correlated with reduced public support of  democracy. In the six countries we reviewed, USAID and the State and  Justice Departments have sought to (1) reform criminal justice systems by  helping establish new legal frameworks to make criminal procedures more  efficient and transparent and by strengthening the capabilities of justice  sector institutions, (2) increase the public\u2019s access to the justice system by  establishing public defense services for poor defendants and by supporting  construction of justice centers in poor communities, and (3) help law  enforcement institutions conduct criminal investigations and manage their  operations more efficiently and effectively. We found that although the U.S.  assistance had contributed to noteworthy progress in these areas in most  of the countries we reviewed, concerns remain about whether gains will be  sustained. Due to resource constraints and other implementation  difficulties, judicial and law enforcement institutions in these countries  continue to rely to a large degree on U.S. and other international assistance  for implementing justice sector reforms. U.S. officials also stated that  legislative restrictions on law enforcement assistance restrict their ability  to plan and carry out comprehensive justice sector reform programs  because they prohibit many types of police assistance.", "As seen in table 2, U.S. rule of law assistance has been provided to five of  the six countries we visited since the mid-1980s, beginning first with El  Salvador in 1984."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Criminal Justice Reforms Were Established but Not Fully Implemented; Sustainability Will Require Stronger Host Government Commitment", "paragraphs": ["A key component of U.S. rule of law assistance in five of the six countries  we reviewed has been support for criminal justice sector reforms  establishing new roles and responsibilities for judicial and law enforcement  institutions and introducing oral procedures and public trials.

Although the reforms each country has enacted have varied, U.S.  assistance has supported the necessary legal frameworks for oral,  adversarial criminal procedures and training for justice sector actors to  implement these procedures. The United States has assisted Latin  American countries\u2019 transitions from inquisitorial to adversarial systems to  help increase the transparency and efficiency of the judicial process.  Benefits of the adversarial system include shortened pretrial detentions,  the presumption of innocence, and the right to a defense.", "Host country officials commented that U.S. support has been critical to  building consensus for the development and enactment of these reforms.  USAID has supported constitutional and criminal procedures code reforms  that went into effect in Colombia (1991), Guatemala (1994), El Salvador  (1998), Bolivia (2001), and Nicaragua (2002).  In Bolivia, for example,  USAID\u2019s rule of law assistance since 1997 has focused primarily on support  for the passage and implementation of a new criminal procedures code.  USAID\u2019s assistance, provided in close coordination with the German  government, has supported reforms that provide the basis for oral,  accusatory procedures and public trials, which significantly changed the  roles and responsibilities of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the  police. In addition, U.S. and German assistance has supported  disseminating information on the code to the public, mainly through  nongovernmental organizations.", "Despite achievements in passing criminal justice reforms, these countries  have had varying degrees of success in implementing the reforms in  practice, and each has work remaining to fully put into practice the new  roles and responsibilities contained in the reforms. For example, Nicaragua  and Bolivia have only recently begun implementing newly enacted criminal  procedures codes, while reforms for criminal sentencing codes have not  yet been enacted. The Nicaraguan legislature also passed an administrative  litigation code in 2000, which created a mechanism for citizens to bring  legal cases against the government.  This code has not been implemented  because, according to a USAID official, the Supreme Court has raised  constitutional objections to them.", "Colombia and Guatemala enacted criminal justice reforms in the early  1990s but have made limited progress in implementing them. Colombia, for  example, has made little progress in establishing an adversarial criminal  justice system, including oral trials, despite enacting its constitutional  reform in 1991. Colombia\u2019s reforms established a legal structure for oral  trials and modernized criminal investigation and prosecutorial functions,  and the reforms were developed through a coordinated approach that  involved key justice sector institutions.  Following this promising start,  however, political support for these reforms waned during the 1990s, and  oral, adversarial procedures are still rare in Colombia, according to USAID  officials.", "Although Guatemala\u2019s reforms provided the basis for transitioning to an  adversarial criminal justice system in 1994, and Guatemala reorganized and  created the necessary justice institutions for implementing the reforms, the  Guatemalan justice system is still plagued by problems, particularly the  courts, prosecutor\u2019s office, and the police. During our visit to Guatemala,  the prosecutor\u2019s office and the police were still trying to resolve profound  differences in the roles that their respective institutions would have in  carrying out criminal investigations. U.S. assistance provided by the State  and Justice Departments and USAID has helped justice institutions  introduce important enhancements to their organizations and operations.", "Despite these improvements, the Guatemalan criminal justice system still  faces serious challenges in its efforts to fully implement these reforms.", "El Salvador appears to have made the most progress in reforming its justice  sector; for example, the Attorney General has instituted sweeping  personnel changes in the prosecutor\u2019s office to improve the quality and  integrity of its workforce. However, the judiciary in El Salvador has yet to  institute similar reforms, according to U.S. officials.", "According to the State Department\u2019s most recent human reports, the  judiciaries in each of the six countries we reviewed are continuing to face  problems, including inefficiency, corruption, and a climate of impunity. In  Bolivia, for example, State reported that judicial corruption and inadequate  case-tracking mechanisms are contributing to the incarcerations of persons  for months or years before their trials. In Colombia, State reported that  Colombia\u2019s large backlog of over 3 million cases has overburdened the  judicial system, and that prosecutors and judges are struggling to transition  from traditional, written procedures, to an oral, adversarial system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice Sector Institutions Were Established and Strengthened, but Pilot Programs Have Not Been Widely Replicated", "paragraphs": ["U.S. assistance also has supported the creation and strengthening of new  institutions to implement the new codes and other reforms, such as judicial  councils that participate in selecting, training, and disciplining judges and  independent prosecutor\u2019s offices to manage investigations and bring  criminal cases to trial. For example:  In Bolivia, USAID assistance supported creating a judicial council in  1998 that reviews the qualifications of judicial candidates, evaluates the  performance of sitting judges, and manages a training center for judges.", "In Nicaragua, USAID has supported establishing a prosecutor\u2019s office  that is independent of the executive branch that will implement the new  criminal procedures code.", "The United States also has provided assistance to strengthen and  modernize justice sector institutions\u2019 operational capabilities. For example,  USAID support helped establish a clerk of courts office in Guatemala City  that centralized case intake and management in one location for the city\u2019s  11 criminal courts. A USAID study showed that after this office was  established in 1999, the annual number of cases that were unaccounted for  decreased from more than 1,000 to 2. USAID and the Justice Department  also have assisted in the publication of operations manuals for judges,  prosecutors, and other legal operators to help clarify roles and  responsibilities and ensure uniform implementation of legal codes.", "Judicial and law enforcement institutions that the United States has  assisted face resource constraints that make it difficult to sustain or  expand U.S-supported pilot projects. For example, in Bolivia, the  government lacked the resources to maintain or replicate a U.S.-funded  model prosecutor\u2019s office, and the project ended with little impact. Also in  Bolivia, USAID supported a pilot case intake and management system for  judges. This system was designed to provide information on case  assignments and their progress through the judicial system. Originally  implemented in 1996, use of this system continues to be uneven due to  resource constraints, and the system has not been implemented on a  national level.", "In Colombia, USAID had funded 13 oral trial courtrooms, in addition to 13  such courtrooms opened by Colombia\u2019s judicial council. However, these  are the only oral trial courtrooms currently operating in the country, and a  major challenge will be to build similar courtrooms for the country\u2019s more  than 2,000 municipal, circuit, and special jurisdiction judges. In one  regional court we visited in Colombia, USAID had built an oral hearing  room and equipped it with new recording equipment to facilitate this  transition.

The school has  trained 600 judges to be trainers, allowing the training to be replicated  throughout the country. The Justice Department also has provided  extensive training to prosecutors and law enforcement personnel.", "However, training centers for judges, prosecutors, and public defenders  have faced severe budgetary constraints, and in most cases do not operate  independent of U.S. assistance. For example, in Colombia, the director of  the judges training academy told us that its budget has been eliminated,  and the future operation of this center is uncertain. Similarly, a USAID- supported training center within Colombia\u2019s Public Defender\u2019s Office lacks  a training budget. In Bolivia, the Attorney General told us that, without  international assistance, he could not afford to staff and adequately equip  his academy to train prosecutors to implement the country\u2019s new criminal  procedures code.", "USAID also has worked with some law schools in Bolivia, Colombia, El  Salvador, and Guatemala to revise their curricula to reflect new reforms  and provide more practical training in oral, public trials. For example,  USAID helped Guatemala\u2019s National University implement a revised  curriculum for new law students with greater emphasis on ethics and  including courses on constitutional law and human rights.", "Nonetheless, U.S. and host country officials in the countries we visited also  stated that legal education remains a major concern. Although law schools  in these countries have proliferated, officials stated that many schools do  not provide adequate legal training. In El Salvador, the validity of the  degrees and academic credentials of judges and attorneys has come into  question, as the Supreme Court has initiated an extensive review of justice  officials\u2019 academic backgrounds.

ICITAP also has provided equipment for  analyzing forensic evidence and has assisted in developing computerized  case management systems.

For example, a USAID official in Nicaragua stated that due  to this restriction, the agency could not include the police in its human  rights promotion programs or invite police officials to seminars and other  forums where their participation was considered to be critical to a  productive dialog on implementing justice sector reforms. These officials  stated that U.S. assistance providers should be able to plan their rule of law  assistance strategies on the basis of local country situations and not on  whether an exemption from the law can be justified.

USAID has a very decentralized organizational structure, and, according to  USAID officials, the agency has no central repository of implementation  reports and other program documents that can be accessed by the various  democracy program implementers to determine, among other things,  which activities have been more successful than others. Although USAID  maintains some documentation from its democracy programs, such as  scopes of work for projects, at its intranet site, the agency does not compile  contractors\u2019 technical manuals and final reports with information on  implementation and results. Such information could be very instrumental  in identifying approaches that are most appropriate for replication, while  avoiding developing similar materials in different countries at additional  expense. As we have previously reported, use of lessons learned is a  principal component of an organizational culture committed to continuous  improvement. Lessons learned mechanisms serve to communicate  acquired knowledge more effectively and to ensure that beneficial  information is factored into planning, work processes, and activities.  Lessons learned provide a powerful method of sharing good ideas for  improving work processes, program design and implementation, and cost- effectiveness.  USAID mission directors and other agency officials stated  that future assistance efforts would be more effective if they were designed  on the basis of concrete information and lessons learned from similar  programs in other countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Local resources for sustaining democracy programs are difficult to  mobilize given the serious economic problems in the countries we visited,  and funding shortages were often cited by program implementers and  beneficiaries as major obstacles to long-term program success. Therefore,  it is crucial that the U.S. government and other international donors  manage available international resources as efficiently as possible.  Achieving greater impact and responsibility in democracy assistance  projects may be more likely with a more strategic approach, including  closer coordination, and greater information sharing among U.S. agencies,  international donors, and other program implementers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that U.S. assistance activities designed to support and strengthen  democracies in Latin America have the maximum impact and sustainability,  we recommend that the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the  Administrator of USAID  develop more comprehensive interagency strategic plans at the regional  and country level for democracy assistance addressing how U.S.  agencies will cooperate with each other and other major donors to  achieve greater impact and sustainability in democracy programs;   establish a strategy for periodically evaluating democracy assistance  projects that is consistent across agencies, countries, and types of  programs; and  establish a systematic mechanism to share information on development  approaches, methods, materials, and results from all democracy  assistance projects among U.S. agencies and implementers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of State and Justice,  the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Inter- American Foundation for their comment. The Inter-American Foundation  did not comment on this report. The comments of the State and Justice  Departments and USAID, along with our responses to specific points, are  reprinted in appendixes II, III, and IV, respectively.", "In general, the State and Justice Departments and USAID acknowledged  that democracy assistance is a long-term challenge that requires host  country commitment and support for reforms, and that U.S.-supported  institutions and programs must ultimately be sustainable, as we discuss in  this report. Overall, the agencies basically agreed with the thrust of our  recommendations regarding how the management of program assistance  could be improved. They also noted that in some cases, activities are either  planned or under way that would address our recommendations.", "The State Department concurred with our recommendation that it work  with other agencies to develop comprehensive strategic plans for  democracy assistance at the regional and country levels. State agreed with  our recommendation that democracy assistance programs should be  evaluated but said that our recommendation was a \u201cbroad brush\u201d approach  that is not appropriate for the diversity of activities covered in the report.  State said that it is taking steps with USAID and the Justice Department to  improve evaluation, including recently agreeing to undertake joint  evaluations of justice programs. Such actions appear to meet the intent of  our recommendation. However, our recommendation is intended to  establish a basis for periodic overall assessments of democracy programs  as well as regular evaluations of specific components of democracy  assistance, such as rule of law, governance, and elections.", "While the State Department agreed that it would be desirable to have better  access to project information across the board, they noted that the  recommendation goes too far in suggesting the need for a centralized  record system containing all project materials. State also said that much  useful information is currently shared among programs on an informal  basis. Our recommendation is designed to address an important problem  we identified in this report, namely that much information is currently not  being shared among agencies or programs with similar goals, approaches,  and methods. The thinking behind this recommendation is the State  Department and other agencies that fund and implement democracy  assistance programs should maintain key program documents and  evaluations along with examples of materials used for core activities (e.g.,  training manuals so that groups implementing similar programs can benefit  from lessons learned). Given the advances in Web-based technology as a  way of sharing information, we believe this recommendation is not  unreasonable. The State Department also provided technical comments,  which we have incorporated in this report, where appropriate.", "The Justice Department endorsed our recommendation for better  coordination and planning among State, USAID, and Justice; agreed that  objective, regularized evaluation of assistance programs is needed to  consistently obtain useful information on program outcomes; and  supported the recommendation that agencies involved in democracy  assistance should establish effective information-sharing mechanisms. The  Justice Department also provided technical comments, which we have  incorporated in this report, where appropriate.", "USAID also agreed with our recommendations. Regarding our  recommendation on strategic planning, USAID said that it participates in a  number of planning activities but that such planning systems can always be  upgraded. It also agreed that periodic evaluations of program outcomes  and results are important, noting that evaluating democracy programs is a  challenge made difficult by the complexities and subtleties of local political  situations that influence democracy program implementation and  outcomes. USAID also agreed with our recommendation that agencies  need to do a better job of sharing information on development methods,  approaches, and materials, noting that a new bureau within the agency  should respond to these concerns. USAID also provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated throughout this report, where  appropriate.", "The State and Justice Departments both commented on our discussion of a  provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that restricts the use of  foreign assistance funds for training and financial support for police and  other law enforcement forces of foreign governments (section 660). In its  comments, State said that the Executive Branch should develop and  propose to the Congress new legislation on law enforcement assistance,  stating that the Executive Branch needs a clear statement of its authority to  provide law enforcement assistance abroad, coupled with whatever  specific prohibitions the Congress may wish to consider. The Justice  Department stated that it is concerned that section 660 may in some  instances adversely impact long-range planning and the development of  broad-based, practical police assistance programs. The Justice Department  also indicated that it will work with the State Department and USAID to  consider whether changes to section 660 would be appropriate. We believe  the approach suggested by the State and Justice Departments could be an  important and useful step in providing options for the Congress to consider  regarding potential amendments to section 660."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
