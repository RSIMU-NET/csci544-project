For example, agencies frequently collect and use SSNs to administer their programs, link data for verifying applicants' eligibility for services and benefits, and conduct program evaluations. In the private sector, certain entities, such as information resellers, collect SSNs from public sources, private sources, and their customers and use this information for identity verification purposes. In addition, banks, securities firms, telecommunication firms, and tax preparers engage in third party contracting, and consequently sometimes share SSNs with their contractors for limited purposes. Vulnerabilities persist in federal laws addressing SSN collection and use by private sector entities. In particular, we found variation in how different industries are covered by federal laws protecting individuals' personal information. For example, although federal laws place restrictions on reselling some personal information, these laws apply only to certain types of private sector entities, such as financial institutions. Consequently, information resellers are not covered by these laws, and there are few restrictions placed on these entities' ability to obtain, use, and resell SSNs for their businesses. Vulnerabilities also exist in federal law and agency oversight for different industries that share SSNs with their contractors. For example, while federal law and oversight of the sharing of personal information in the financial services industry are very extensive, federal law and oversight of the sharing of personal information in the tax preparation and telecommunications industries are somewhat lacking. Moreover, in our Internet resellers report, several resellers provided us with truncated SSNs showing the first five digits, though other information resellers and consumer reporting agencies truncate SSNs to show the last four digits. Therefore, because of the lack of SSN truncation standards, even truncated SSNs remain vulnerable to potential misuse by identity thieves and others. While we suggested that the Congress consider enacting standards for truncating SSNs or delegating authority to the Social Security Administration or some other governmental entity to do so, SSN truncation standards have yet to be addressed at the federal level."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss ways to better protect the Social  Security number (SSN), which was originally created as a means to track  workers\u2019 earnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits.

As a result, federal and state laws have been  enacted that to some degree protect individuals\u2019 personal information,  including SSNs. However, the continued use of and reliance on SSNs by  public and private sector entities, as well as the potential for their misuse,  underscore the importance of identifying areas that can be further  strengthened. GAO has issued a number of reports and testified before this  Subcommittee about the various aspects of SSN use in both the public and  private sectors.

Today, SSA  issues SSNs to most U.S. citizens, as well as non-citizens lawfully admitted  to the United States with permission to work.

This increased use, as well as increased electronic  record keeping by both sectors, has eased access to SSNs and potentially  made this information more vulnerable to misuse, including identity theft.", "Specifically, SSNs are a key piece of information used to create false  identities for financial misuse or to assume another individual\u2019s identity.  Most often, identity thieves use SSNs belonging to real people. However,  the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) identity theft victim complaint data  has shown that only 30 percent of identity theft victims know how thieves  obtained their personal information.

Broadly speaking, this act seeks to balance the government\u2019s need to  maintain information about individuals with the rights of individuals to be  protected against unwarranted invasions of their privacy. Section 7 of the  act requires that any federal, state, or local government agency, when  requesting an SSN from an individual, tell individuals whether disclosing  the SSN is mandatory or voluntary, cite the statutory or other authority  under which the request is being made, and state what uses it will make of  the individual\u2019s SSN.", "Additional federal laws also place restrictions on public and private sector  entities\u2019 use and disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information, including  SSNs, in specific instances. As shown in table 1, some of these laws  require certain industries, such as the financial services industry, to  protect individuals\u2019 personal information to a greater degree than entities  in other industries.", "In 1998, Congress also enacted a federal statute that criminalizes fraud in  connection with the unlawful theft and misuse of personal identifiable  information, including SSNs.

In our prior work, we identified 13 states\u2014Arizona,  Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,  Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia\u2014that have passed laws  similar to California\u2019s.  While some states, such as Arizona, have enacted  virtually identical restrictions on the use and display of SSNs, other states  have modified the restrictions in various ways.

Beginning with a 1943 Executive Order issued by President Franklin D.  Roosevelt, all federal agencies were required to use the SSN exclusively  for identification systems of individuals, rather than set up a new  identification system. In later years, the number of federal agencies and  others relying on the SSN as a primary identifier escalated dramatically, in  part, because a number of federal laws were passed that authorized or  required its use for specific activities. For example, agencies use SSNs  for internal administrative purposes, which include activities such as  identifying, retrieving, and updating records;  to collect debts owed to the government and conduct or support  research and evaluations, as well as use employees\u2019 SSNs for activities  such as payroll, wage reporting, and providing employee benefits;  to ensure program integrity, such as matching records with state and  local correctional facilities to identify individuals for whom the agency  should terminate benefit payments; and  for statistics, research, and evaluation.", "Table 2 provides an overview of federal statutes that address government  collection and use of SSNs. In some cases, these statutes require that state  and local government entities collect SSNs.", "Some government agencies also collect SSNs because of their  responsibility for maintaining public records, which are those records  generally made available to the public for inspection by the government.  Because these records are open to the public, such government agencies,  primarily at the state and local levels, provide access to the SSNs  sometimes contained in those records. Based on a survey of federal, state,  and local governments, we reported in 2004 that state agencies in 41 states  and the District of Columbia displayed SSNs in public records; this was  also true in 75 percent of U.S. counties. We also found that while the  number and type of records in which SSNs were displayed varied greatly  across states and counties, SSNs were most often found in court and  property records.", "Public records displaying SSNs are stored in multiple formats, such as  electronic, microfiche and microfilm, or paper copy. While our prior work  found that public access to such records was often limited to inspection of  the individual paper copy in public reading rooms or clerks\u2019 offices, or  request by mail, some agencies also made public records available on the  Internet.", "In recent years, some agencies have begun to take measures to change the  ways in which they display or provide access to SSNs in public records.

However, some of these resellers said they are more likely to rely on SSNs  obtained directly from their clients, who may voluntarily provide such  information, than those found in public records. In addition, in our prior  review of information resellers that offer their services through the  Internet, we found that their Web sites most frequently identified public or  nonpublic sources, or both, as their sources of information.

For example, in our  review of government uses of SSNs, we found that some federal, state, and  local agencies do not consistently fulfill the Privacy Act requirements that  they inform individuals whether SSN disclosure is mandatory or voluntary,  provide the statutory or other authority under which the SSN request is  made, or indicate how the SSN will be used, when they request SSNs from  individuals. To help address this inconsistency, we recommended that the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) direct federal agencies to review  their practices for providing required information, and OMB has since  implemented this recommendation.", "Actions have also been taken by some federal agencies in response to our  previous finding that millions of SSNs are subject to exposure on  individual identity cards issued under federal auspices.  Specifically, in  2004, we reported that an estimated 42 million Medicare cards, 8 million  Department of Defense (DOD) insurance cards, and 7 million Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiary cards displayed entire 9-digit SSNs.  While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with the largest  number of cards displaying the entire 9-digit SSN, does not plan to remove  the SSN from Medicare identification cards, VA and DOD have begun  taking action to remove SSNs from cards. For example, VA is eliminating  SSNs from 7 million VA identification cards and will replace cards with  SSNs or issue new cards without SSNs between 2004 and 2009, until all  such cards have been replaced.", "However, some of the vulnerabilities we identified in public sector SSN  protection have not been addressed. For example, while the Privacy Act  and other federal laws prescribe actions agencies must take to assure the  security of SSNs and other personal information, we found that these  requirements may not be uniformly observed by agencies at all levels of  government. In addition, in our review of SSNs in government agency- maintained public records, we found that SSNs are widely exposed to view  in a variety of these records. While some agencies reported taking actions  such as removing SSNs from electronic versions of records, without a  uniform and comprehensive policy, SSNs in these records remain  vulnerable to potential misuse by identity thieves. Consequently, in both  instances, we suggested that Congress consider convening a  representative group of federal, state, and local officials to develop a  unified approach to safeguarding SSNs used in all levels of government.  Some steps have since been taken at the federal level to promote inter- agency discussion of SSN protection, such as creation of the President\u2019s  Identity Theft Task Force in 2006 to increase the safeguards on personal  data held by the federal government.", "In April 2007, the Task Force completed its work, which resulted in a  strategic plan aimed at making the federal government\u2019s efforts more  effective and efficient in the areas of identity theft awareness, prevention,  detection, and prosecution. The plan\u2019s recommendations focus in part on  increasing safeguards employed by federal agencies and the private sector  with respect to the personal data they maintain, including decreasing the  unnecessary use of SSNs in the public sector. To that end, last month,  OMB issued a memorandum requiring federal agencies to examine their  use of SSNs in systems and programs in order to identify and eliminate  instances in which collection or use of the SSN is unnecessary. In addition,  the memo requires federal agencies to participate in governmentwide  efforts to explore alternatives to agency use of SSNs as personal  identifiers for both federal employees and in federal programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vulnerabilities Persist in Federal Laws Addressing SSN Collection and Use by Private Sector Entities", "paragraphs": ["In our reviews of private sector entities\u2019 collection and use of SSNs, we  found variation in how different industries are covered by federal laws  protecting individuals\u2019 personal information.

Consequently, information resellers are not covered  by these laws, and there are few restrictions placed on these entities\u2019  ability to obtain, use, and resell SSNs. However, recently proposed federal  legislation, if implemented, may help to address this vulnerability. For  example, the SSN Protection Act of 2007, as introduced by Representative  Edward Markey, would give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  rulemaking authority to restrict the sale and purchase of SSNs and  determine appropriate exemptions. The proposed legislation would  therefore improve SSN protection while also permitting limited exceptions  to the purchase and sale of SSNs for certain purposes, such as law  enforcement or national security.", "Vulnerabilities also exist in federal law and agency oversight for different  industries that share SSNs with their contractors. For example, while  federal law and oversight of the sharing of personal information in the  financial services industry is very extensive, federal law and oversight of  the sharing of personal information in the tax preparation and  telecommunications industries is somewhat lacking. Specific actions to  address these vulnerabilities in federal laws have not yet been taken,  leaving SSNs maintained by information resellers and contractors in the  tax preparation and telecommunications industries potentially exposed to  misuse, including identity theft.", "We also found a gap in federal law addressing SSN truncation, a practice  that would improve SSN protection if standardized.

As the Congress moves forward in pursuing legislation to  address SSN protection and identity theft, focusing the debate on  vulnerabilities that have already been documented may help target efforts  and policy directly toward immediate improvements in SSN protection. To  this end, we look forward to supporting the Subcommittee and the  Congress however we can to further ensure the integrity of SSNs. Related  to this, we have issued a report on the federal government\u2019s provision of  SSNs to state and local public record keepers, and we have also recently  begun a review of the bulk sale of public records containing SSNs,  including how federal law protects SSNs in these records when they are  sold to entities both here and overseas.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared testimony.
