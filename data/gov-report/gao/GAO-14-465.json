Under the Education for Homeless Children and Youth grant program, states and their school districts are required to identify homeless children and provide them with needed services and support. In fiscal year 2014, Education received about $65 million to administer this program. Education provided formula grants to states, which competitively awarded funds to school districts to help meet program requirements. GAO was asked to review program implementation and oversight.", "GAO examined (1) how districts identify and serve homeless students and challenges they face (2) how Education and states collaborate with other service providers to address student needs and any barriers, and (3) the extent to which Education monitors program compliance. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, guidance, and reports, and analyzed Education's state and school district survey data from school year 2010-11.

With regard to GAO's interviews, 13 of the 20 districts identified homeless students through housing surveys at enrollment, while all 20 relied on referrals from schools or service providers. However, officials in 8 of the 20 districts noted that the under-identification of homeless students was a problem. Districts GAO reviewed provided eligible students with transportation to and from school, educational services, and referrals to other service providers for support such as health care or food assistance. Among the challenges that officials in the 20 districts cited were limited staff and resources to provide services, the cost of transportation, student stigma associated with homelessness, and responding to students made homeless by natural disasters. Nationally, school districts surveyed most recently in school year 2010-11 by the Department of Education (Education) reported providing many services while facing similar challenges.", "Education's EHCY program manager and state program coordinators have collaborated with other government agencies and with private organizations by sharing information, participating in interagency councils on homelessness, and providing technical assistance to relevant staff. In addition, state EHCY program coordinators have provided training to school districts and helped connect local programs to ensure homeless students receive various services. However, federal and state officials frequently cited limited resources and differing federal definitions of homelessness as constraints to greater collaboration.", "Education has protocols for monitoring state EHCY programs, but no plan to ensure adequate oversight of all states, though monitoring is a key management tool for assessing the quality of performance over time and resolving problems promptly. Prior to fiscal year 2010, it had been Education's policy to monitor 50 states and 3 area programs at least once during a 3-year period, and it did so for fiscal years 2007 to 2009. Subsequently, the department adopted a risk-based approach in fiscal year 2010 and monitored 28 states over the next 3 years. In fiscal year 2013, Education again changed its approach to EHCY program monitoring and has monitored 3 state programs since then. Department officials cited other priorities and a lack of staff capacity as reasons for the decrease in oversight. As a result, Education lacks assurance that states are complying with program requirements. GAO found gaps in state monitoring of districts that could weaken program performance, reinforcing the importance of effective federal monitoring of states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education develop a plan to ensure adequate oversight of the EHCY program.

Homeless  children and youth may face a variety of barriers to continuing their  education, including frequent moves, a lack of transportation to and from  school, and a lack of adequate supplies and services, such as  counseling, that may be necessary to help them remain in school.  Research on homeless and highly mobile children suggests that they face  challenges with academic achievement and school completion. We  previously reported that students who change schools more frequently  tend to have lower scores on standardized reading and math tests and  drop out of school at higher rates than their less mobile peers. In  addition, according to a study of an urban school district from school  years 2005-06 to 2009-10, homeless and highly mobile children were  more likely to exhibit lower levels of academic achievement compared  with other students.", "The Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program,  initially authorized by Title VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless  Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento Act), helps address barriers to school  enrollment, attendance, and success for homeless children and youth.  The act requires state educational agencies to ensure that homeless  children and youth have equal access to the same free appropriate public  education, including a public preschool education, as provided to other  children. Congress appropriated about $65 million to carry out the EHCY  program in fiscal year 2014. The McKinney-Vento Act authorizes  Education to provide federal grants to states to administer and oversee  activities under the EHCY program. In turn, states award a majority of  these funds on a competitive basis to select school districts in their state  (grantee districts), based on factors such as the needs of homeless  children and youth within a particular district and the ability of the district  to meet those needs. Regardless of whether a school district receives  EHCY program funds, all districts must comply with certain program  requirements, which include ensuring that homeless children and youth  are appropriately identified, immediately enrolled in school, and receive  the educational and other services for which they are eligible, such as  transportation to and from school. In addition, as GAO has reported in the  past, collaboration presents an opportunity to increase the efficiency and  effectiveness of federal programs.can meet every need of students experiencing homelessness, and   Because no one system of services  funding for the EHCY program is set at relatively modest levels,  collaboration at the federal, state, and local levels is essential to address  the academic and non-academic needs of homeless students.

In addition, we sought  variation in the number of homeless students states identified in recent  years and the size of states\u2019 EHCY grants, among other factors. We also  selected two states that have recently experienced natural disasters to  see how they coped with sudden increases in the number of homeless  students. In each state, we interviewed state and school district officials.  In total, we spoke with school district officials from 20 different school  districts, nine of which were grantee districts. We selected these districts  with the assistance of state EHCY program coordinators to represent a  mix of urban, suburban, and rural districts, as well as grantee and non- grantee districts. In the states we visited, we also met with school officials  and youth or their families who have experienced homelessness.  Information obtained from these states and school districts is non- generalizable. To obtain generalizable and national-level information on  states and grantee school districts, we analyzed Education data from two  surveys covering school year 2010-11, which we found to be sufficiently  reliable. We assessed the reliability of the survey data by performing  electronic testing of the data elements, reviewing relevant documentation,  and interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We used  the survey data to examine how states and school districts implement the  EHCY program and how states monitor school districts, among other  things. All estimates obtained from the school district-level survey have  margins of error of no greater than six percentage points. To obtain  information on how Education administers the EHCY program and  collaborates with other agencies, we interviewed Education officials and  officials from other federal agencies, including the Departments of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development  (HUD), as well as the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness  (USICH).

Grants to districts are to be  awarded based on the need of the school district for assistance and the  quality of the application submitted. In determining which districts to  fund, states are required to consider certain factors, such as the needs of  homeless children and youth enrolled in the school district, the types of  services to be provided under the program, and the extent to which the  services will be coordinated with other services available to homeless  children and youth. Districts are authorized to use these funds to support  a range of activities for homeless students, such as tutoring,  transportation, and referrals to health care services, as well as to provide  professional development for educators and support coordination  between schools and other agencies.

Education conducts an annual risk assessment to evaluate which  states have the highest risk of noncompliance, according to the EHCY  program manager. The agency weighs the following four risk assessment  criteria equally: the state\u2019s academic proficiency levels for students  experiencing homelessness, the tenure of the state EHCY program  coordinator, whether there are multiple or recurring EHCY monitoring  findings, and a financial review of the state\u2019s EHCY grant expenditures.Education also considers the size of the state\u2019s EHCY grant allocation  and the length of time since a state was last monitored.

Under Education\u2019s ESEA flexibility  initiative, 44 of the 53 states currently have waivers from specific  requirements of the ESEA, as amended. In these states, Education has  conducted regular monitoring, but the monitoring only covers compliance  with the ESEA waiver requirements and does not include monitoring for  compliance with the EHCY program. As a result, the states with ESEA  waivers currently have little EHCY program oversight at the federal  level. Education officials cited the shift to a risk-based approach to  monitoring the EHCY program, the more recent need to focus on ESEA  flexibility waiver monitoring, and a lack of staff capacity as the primary  reasons why they have not been able to monitor the states as frequently  in recent years as in the past. Education officials said they intend to  continue to monitor the EHCY program in the future, but the agency has  not determined when or how it will do so.

Of the 22 states that  Education has not monitored since at least fiscal year 2009, 10 had been  required to take corrective actions following their last review to address  compliance concerns. While Education found these actions to be  sufficient, according to officials, Education is currently unaware of  whether these states have remained in compliance and it is possible that  they (or other states) may have new or recurring compliance issues.

According to Education\u2019s  survey of states in school year 2010-11, states use a variety of  approaches in monitoring districts. Most states (43 out of 50) monitored  grantees on-site and about half (26 out of 50) did so for non-grantees.  States also commonly use desk monitoring, with about two-thirds (34 out  of 50) using this approach for grantees and about half (26 out of 50) doing  so for non-grantees (see table 3).", "The majority of states in Education\u2019s survey also reported including the  EHCY program in the state\u2019s monitoring of other federal programs for  both grantee districts (33 out of 50) and non-grantee districts (29 out of  50).

For example, in one  state we visited, a review team monitors about 100 school districts per  year with a lengthy checklist for federal programs that includes the EHCY  program.", "States focused their monitoring on districts that had received an EHCY  grant from the state, resulting in limited oversight of many non-grantee  districts. NCHE\u2019s guidance indicates that states should monitor grantees  at least once during the grant cycle\u2014which can be up to 3 years\u2014and  non-grantees at least once every 3-to-5 years.

One state  coordinator reported monitoring all grantee school districts on-site  annually. Two state coordinators reported monitoring grantees annually  using a combination of on-site visits and desk reviews, in which grantees  are monitored via phone and email and must send data to the state for  review. The fourth state coordinator we interviewed reported conducting  quarterly fiscal and program reviews in lieu of formal on-site or desk  monitoring for all of the grantees since school year 2008-09.", "The four states we reviewed also varied with regard to how often they  monitor non-grantees. State coordinators in two of the four states we  reviewed regularly monitor all non-grantee districts within the 3 to 5 year  timeframe NCHE suggests. One state coordinator reported monitoring  non-grantees on a 3-year rotational basis. Another state coordinator uses  desk monitoring for all non-grantees annually and also uses a risk-based  approach to select non-grantees for on-site monitoring. state coordinators we interviewed do not regularly monitor non-grantees  within the suggested timeframe; however, one of these states annually  ensures that all districts have identified a homeless liaison.", "States may not focus monitoring efforts on non-grantee districts because  they lack tools to enforce compliance. One state coordinator explained  that the state can record a finding of noncompliance, but because there is  no direct fiscal action or penalty attached to it, the district may disregard  it. Another state coordinator said she has to accept a district\u2019s report of  zero homeless students, even if she suspects that the district may be  under-identifying them. In contrast, state coordinators we spoke with said  that states can hold districts with EHCY grant funding more accountable  because they have more direct leverage over them, in the form of the  grant. According to Education\u2019s survey of states, 3 of 39 states that  responded to this question reported that they withheld funds from  grantees that were out of compliance.", "This state\u2019s EHCY program coordinator reported annually reviewing each district\u2019s data  on homeless students and visiting those non-grantees with the highest risk of  noncompliance based on several risk factors, such as fewer than expected homeless  students identified given a district\u2019s poverty rates; trends in under-identification; a high  number of disputes with neighboring districts and/or complaints from parents; and the size  of the district, with larger districts assumed to have a higher risk of noncompliance. districts were aware of the availability of services through the regional  structure adopted by the state. This state uses a regional approach for its  grantee districts, whereby the grants are distributed to lead entities that  are in turn responsible for ensuring that all homeless students within the  region receive appropriate services. To do this, the grantee district may  provide funds and/or services, such as training, to other districts in its  region.

For example, in school year 2010-11,  Education began requiring states to report information on the academic  achievement of homeless students in reading and mathematics from non- grantee school districts, data that had been required from grantee districts  since at least the 2004-05 school year. In school year 2011-12,  Education added corresponding data elements in science for all districts  to the Consolidated State Performance Report. In school year 2012-13,  Education began requiring states to report information on the number of  homeless students enrolled in each district, by certain subcategories.Previously, Education had only required states to report this information  by subcategory for grantee districts; for non-grantee districts, states were  only required to report the total number of homeless students enrolled  and their primary nighttime residence.", "Education presents trends in data on homeless students over time in its  Consolidated State Performance Report; however, there are limitations  to the use of state-reported data to assess the program\u2019s results. For  example, the state data on the number of homeless students are likely  incomplete or unreliable due in part to the under-identification of eligible  students. In Education\u2019s survey of states, 13 of the 25 states that  responded to this question had found that at least one grantee was not in  compliance with the statutory requirement to identify homeless children  and youth. In one of the four states we reviewed, Education found the  data on the number of homeless students to be unreliable, which the  state EHCY program coordinator attributed to a 2009-10 transition to a  new, state-wide database system that led to undercounting homeless  students. Both Education and the state educational agency are taking  steps to address the state\u2019s data quality issues, according to officials from  both agencies. Education officials told us that the under-representation of  the number of homeless students in the data generally is an area of  concern, which they are addressing in multiple ways. In addition to  questioning states about this issue, an Education official said the agency  has worked with a contractor who analyzed school district-level data in  every state to help identify school districts that may have been under- identifying homeless students by comparing their rate of homeless  student identification to the percentage of students receiving free or  reduced-price lunch. The contractor has made presentations on the  results of this analysis to state EHCY program coordinators, and  Education plans to provide state EHCY program coordinators with  additional technical assistance on outreach and identification.", "Another limitation to the use of state-reported data is that, by design, the  data are difficult to compare across states. As GAO has previously  reported, states vary in how they measure student academic  achievement, as permitted by ESEA, to allow states to address their  unique circumstances. Education has acknowledged this inherent  limitation, as well as challenges in comparing data within states over time,  as many states have made changes to their state assessments that can  impact comparability. According to the Common Core State Standards  Initiative, a voluntary state-led initiative, 43 states and the District of  Columbia have chosen to adopt the Common Core State Standards\u2014 designed to define the knowledge and skills students should gain  throughout their K-12 education in order to graduate high school prepared  to succeed in entry-level careers, introductory academic college courses,  and workforce training programs. Most states have chosen to participate  in one of two state-led consortia working to develop assessments based  on these standards, expected to be available in school year 2014-15,  which may lead to greater comparability across states. Similarly,  according to agency officials, Education collects dropout and graduation  rate data, including disaggregated data for homeless students, but these  data are calculated differently in different states\u2014making comparisons  across states problematic. GAO has previously reported on the use of  different state graduation rates, and recommended that Education provide  information to all states on ways to account for different types of students  in graduation rate calculations and assess the reliability of state data used  to calculate interim rates, which it did.", "Aside from its annual data collection efforts, Education\u2019s latest study  (forthcoming in 2014), which covers school year 2010-11, will provide  some valuable information on program implementation, according to  agency officials.

The program  identified more than 1.1 million homeless students in school year 2011- 12\u2014students who, had they not been identified, might have faced greater  difficulties succeeding in school and preparing to graduate. To increase  the program\u2019s effectiveness, school districts, states, and the federal  government leverage existing resources to ensure that homeless  students are identified and their various academic and non-academic  needs are met. The EHCY program promotes efforts to leverage  resources, in part, by requiring coordination and collaboration among  various programs and service providers that also serve homeless  students. Collaboration can be particularly important for districts and  communities addressing significant increases in homelessness following  natural disasters.", "Appropriately identifying eligible students, in collaboration with other  providers, is key to ensuring that districts provide homeless students with  the services they need. However, challenges districts face in identifying  students coupled with potential financial disincentives to identify them due  to the cost of providing them with services such as transportation, can  lead to under-identification, which has several consequences. First, it can  result in barriers to homeless students\u2019 educational stability and  achievement. Homeless children and youth who are not identified may  have difficulty getting to and from their school as their nighttime residence  changes and may therefore be derailed in their attempts to obtain an  education without the assistance available through the EHCY program.  Second, under-identification complicates Education\u2019s ability to fully  assess program results due to concerns about the accuracy and  completeness of the data, which it has taken some steps to address.  Similarly, under-identification complicates the ability of the U.S.  Interagency Council on Homelessness to accurately assess progress  toward its goal of ending homelessness for families, youth, and children  by 2020.", "While it may not be possible to accurately determine the extent to which  districts may be under-identifying students\u2014and the extent to which these  children and youth may not succeed academically\u2014 monitoring states  and school districts is imperative to ensure compliance with the  requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act, particularly in light of the fact  that some states are implementing the program differently than described  in their state plans.

We also met with school district officials. In all, we spoke with  representatives from 20 school districts in the four states. We selected  school districts, with assistance from state EHCY program coordinators,  to represent a mix of urban, suburban, and rural districts, as well as  districts that received EHCY program funds (grantees) and those that did  not (non-grantees). In one state, we also met with representatives of two  regional educational entities that are responsible for providing EHCY- related services to several school districts within their respective regions  and receive EHCY program funds to do so. In the states we visited, we  also met with school officials at the elementary, middle, and high school  levels, and youth that have experienced homelessness, or their families,  about their educational experiences (12 youth and three families).  Information obtained from these states, school districts, youth, and  families is non-generalizable. We also attended the 2012 NAEHCY  Conference to obtain further insights into how school districts were  implementing the EHCY program and met with five additional state  coordinators at that conference to discuss how they collaborated with  various stakeholders.", "To obtain generalizable and national-level information from states and  grantee school districts, we analyzed Education data from two surveys  covering school year 2010-11. Education\u2019s surveys collected information  on services school districts provided to homeless children and youth;  state and local collaboration efforts with other Education programs; and  how states monitored school districts, including any differences in  monitoring among grantee and non-grantee districts. A total of 448 school  districts were included in the district-level survey sample, including the 50  largest school districts and a random sample of 401 other school districts  (3 districts were removed from the sample after the survey was released  because they had merged with other districts). The surveys were  conducted electronically, however, in a small number of cases (7 or 8)  districts that did not initially respond to the electronic survey were  administered the survey over the phone or on paper. The school district- level survey had a weighted response rate of 86 percent (96 percent for  the 50 largest districts and 85 percent for the remaining 398 districts).  The state survey was sent to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and  the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond  and was later removed from the scope of the survey. One additional state  provided incomplete survey answers, leaving 49 states and the District of  Columbia as the state survey population. We assessed the reliability of  Education\u2019s survey data by performing electronic testing of the data  elements, reviewing relevant documentation, and interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. We found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The responses of each  eligible sample member who provided a useable questionnaire were  weighted in the analyses to account statistically for all members of the  population. We created weights for each survey respondent to account for  unequal probabilities of selection and various unit response rates among  the survey strata. All estimates obtained from the school district-level  survey have margins of error of no greater than six percentage points.", "To obtain information on how Education administers the EHCY program,  we interviewed Education officials about how the agency monitors states  for compliance and collaborates with other federal programs. We also  interviewed officials from other federal agencies, including the  Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), as well as the U.S. Interagency Council on  Homelessness (USICH), to obtain their perspectives on collaborating with  Education on programs that serve homeless children and youth. We also  interviewed Education officials about the agency\u2019s monitoring efforts.  Additionally, we reviewed relevant documents\u2014including federal laws  and regulations, monitoring protocols, and policy memos\u2014and examined  Education\u2019s findings on homeless education from state monitoring  reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 through July 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
