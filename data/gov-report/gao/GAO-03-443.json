Recent changes in what the government buys, its contracting approaches and methods, and its acquisition workforce have combined to create a dynamic acquisition environment. Many of these recent changes enhance contracting efficiency and offer a number of benefits, such as reduced administrative burdens. However, GAO's past work has found that if these changes are not accompanied by proper training, guidance, and internal controls, agency procurements may be at greater risk. While effectively managing contracts is always a key management responsibility, this responsibility is more acute in those agencies that rely heavily on acquisitions to accomplish their missions. The goal of this report is to identify for Congress, the administration, and accountability organizations those procurement-related trends and challenges that may affect federal agencies. Specifically, GAO analyzed recent federal procurement patterns, the use of various procurement methods, and changes in the acquisition workforce."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies procured more than $235 billion in goods and services during fiscal year 2001, reflecting an 11 percent increase over the amount spent 5 years earlier. Further growth in contract spending, at least in the short term, is likely to increase given the President's request for additional funds for defense and homeland security, agencies' plans to update their information technology systems, and other factors. Overall, contracting for goods and services accounted for about 24 percent of the government's discretionary resources in fiscal year 2001. Federal agencies are taking advantage of the streamlined acquisition processes that were developed in the 1990s, including relying on contracts awarded by other federal agencies to obtain goods and services. The increase in the use of this acquisition method is driven largely by purchases of information technology and by professional, administrative, and management support services. Similarly, agencies are increasingly using purchase cards for many of their low dollar value procurements. Over the last decade, the federal acquisition workforce has had to adapt to changes in staffing levels, workloads, and the need for new skill sets. Procurement reforms have required contracting specialists to have a greater knowledge of market conditions, industry trends, and the technical details of the commodities and services they procure. A priority at most agencies we reviewed was attracting and retaining the right people with the right skills to successfully address the increasingly complex actions expected in the future. Many agencies have made progress with strategic human capital planning efforts. We reviewed 10 agencies that represent over 90 percent of the federal government's acquisition spending. All agencies provided comments on our report and concurred with our analyses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government, one of the largest and most complex organizations  in the world, is comprised of more than 60 agencies and about 1.7 million  civilian workers. The fiscal year 2002 federal budget included more than  $1 trillion in discretionary budget resources, which can be applied to fund  agency operations including the acquisition of goods and services.  Agencies acquire most of their goods and services through contracts that  specify the government\u2019s needs or requirements, the cost or price agreed  upon by the government and the supplier, and other terms and conditions.", "Beginning in the early 1990s, a number of factors emerged that created a  dynamic and challenging acquisition environment with ramifications that  are just beginning to be recognized. First, acquisition personnel  increasingly purchase services, such as information technology or  management support. Second, Congress passed several significant pieces  of reform legislation, including the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of  1994 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, to provide agency procurement  officials with greater flexibility and tools to acquire goods and services  more efficiently. Third, the end of the Cold War and efforts to reduce the  size of government led to significant acquisition workforce reductions in  many agencies, most notably the Department of Defense (DOD). These  reductions, coupled with procurement reforms, have placed increasing  demands on the acquisition workforce. For example, contracting  specialists must have a greater knowledge of market conditions, industry  trends, and the technical details of the commodities and services  they procure.", "This report is part of our effort to provide Congress, the administration,  and accountability organizations with insights into how these factors  contribute to the acquisition challenges federal agencies face. To do so, we  analyzed (1) recent federal procurement patterns, (2) the use of various  procurement approaches and methods, and (3) changes in the acquisition  workforce and contracting actions. Our analysis covers the 5-year period  that includes fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001, the latest year for  which complete data were available, and focuses on the 10 federal agencies  that spent the most on contracts during fiscal year 2001.", "We compiled this information from various sources, including the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Procurement Data System  (FPDS), which is the government\u2019s repository for federal contract  information; the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) MAX Budget  Information System, which is used to collect, validate, analyze, model, and  publish federal budget information; the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s  Central Personnel Data File (CPDF), which is the government\u2019s human  resources reporting system; agency officials; and Inspector General  reports.

More information on our scope and methodology may be found in  appendix I.", "This report does not reflect changes in agency missions, organizational  structures, budgets, contracting actions, or personnel resulting from the  creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This department,  established on January 24, 2003, combined 22 federal agencies specializing  in various missions, such as law enforcement, border security, biological  research, computer security, and disaster mitigation. With an anticipated  budget of almost $40 billion and an estimated 170,000 employees, the  department is expected to be the third largest federal agency, with the  potential for some of the government\u2019s most extensive acquisition  requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trends in Federal Procurement Spending Patterns", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies spent more than $235 billion in fiscal year 2001 to buy  goods and services ranging from weapon systems and medical equipment  to information technology services and the operation of government  facilities. This is an 11 percent increase over the amount spent in 1997. This  growth is expected to continue as federal agencies address emerging  threats and acquire enhanced information technology.", "The significance of contracting in the federal government is reflected by  the sheer magnitude and the degree to which contracting consumes  agencies\u2019 discretionary resources. Overall, contracting for goods and  services accounted for about 24 percent of the government\u2019s discretionary  resources in fiscal year 2001. However, contract spending consumed  between 34 percent and 73 percent of the discretionary resources available  to the four largest acquisition spending federal agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Growth in Federal Procurement", "paragraphs": ["Federal contracting increased by 11 percent during the 5-year period we  studied, from about $213 billion in fiscal year 1997 to over $235 billion in  fiscal year 2001. As shown in figure 1, DOD is the largest agency in terms  of contracting dollars spent, accounting for about two-thirds of the  government\u2019s total spending on goods and services. In fiscal year 2001,  DOD contracted for more than $152.6 billion of goods and services, or  more than twice the amount spent by the next nine largest federal agencies  combined. The three military departments\u2014the Air Force, Army, and  Navy\u2014individually spend more than the largest civilian agency, the  Department of Energy (DOE).", "From fiscal years 1997 through 2001, purchases of goods increased by  17 percent. This was due in large measure to DOD\u2019s increased spending on  weapon systems and other defense-related items. Overall, however,  agencies continued to purchase far more services than goods. Purchases  of services grew by about 11 percent, as agencies modernized their  information systems and obtained various professional, administrative, and  management support services. Nine of the 10 agencies we reviewed  increased their spending on services. The other agency, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), experienced a 4 percent  decrease, reflecting significant reductions in spending for research and  development and for professional, administrative, and management  support services. As shown in figure 2, agencies varied in the degree to  which they contracted for services. For example, DOE spent more than  98 percent of its contract dollars on services in fiscal year 2001, while the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) spending for services accounted for  only about 30 percent of its acquisition spending.", "The degree to which individual agencies contract for services underscores  the importance of ensuring that service acquisitions are managed properly.  For example, we noted in May 2001 that some service procurements were  not being conducted efficiently, putting taxpayer dollars at risk. Last year,  we reported that leading commercial companies had taken a strategic  approach to acquiring services, which in turn resulted in significant cost  savings and service improvements. Taking a strategic approach involves a  range of activities\u2014from developing a better picture of what the company  is spending on services, to taking an enterprisewide approach to procuring  services, to developing new ways of doing business. Based in part on our report, the National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2002  required that DOD develop enhanced data collection and management  processes for services acquisitions.

For four agencies included in our review\u2014DOE, NASA, GSA, and DOD\u2014 the acquisition function is central to accomplishing their mission-related  goals. About 76 percent of DOE\u2019s funds, for example, are spent on the  management and operation of over 30 government-owned laboratories and  other nuclear facilities. NASA contracts account for about 72 percent of its  discretionary budget resources, and one of GSA\u2019s primary missions is to  help federal agencies procure goods and services.

Additionally, the President\u2019s budget request reflects  increased investment in information technology both for new systems and  for related support.", "Further, the administration\u2019s emphasis on competitive sourcing could  increase agencies\u2019 reliance on services provided by the private sector.  Competitive sourcing in the federal government is conducted under  guidance provided in OMB Circular A-76, which outlines procedures for  determining whether to perform a commercial activity with government  employees or by contract. Additionally, the circular provides policy for  standardizing how and when an agency competes a commercial activity  with the private sector. OMB\u2019s current 2-year goal is to compete 15 percent  of the federal government\u2019s commercial-type positions. This effort could  result in significant increases in the number of service contracts, given that  in the past the private sector has won over half of the competitions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Emerging Trends in Procurement Methods and Approaches", "paragraphs": ["The past decade has seen the emergence of several procurement trends  that have changed the way the government acquires goods and services,  as Congress and the administration have sought ways to simplify the  acquisition process, shorten procurement times, reduce administrative  burdens and costs, and improve acquisition outcomes. In particular, federal  agencies are increasingly relying on contracts awarded by other federal  agencies to obtain goods and services and have turned to using government  purchase cards for many of their low dollar value procurements. The  growth in these procurement methods has been dramatic, and is apparent  in nearly every agency we reviewed. Additionally, agencies have begun to  increase their use of commercial contracting methods and performance- based acquisition approaches.", "As we have reported previously, taking full advantage of these methods and  approaches requires that agencies have adequate guidance and training, a  strong internal control environment, and data that can be used by agency  management to make informed decisions. Our work at selected agencies  has found that these conditions have not always been present, thereby  contributing to agencies missing opportunities to achieve savings, reduce  administrative burdens, and improve acquisition outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Use of Contracts Awarded by Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are increasingly using contracts and acquisition services  offered by other agencies, a fact that is most notably demonstrated in the  growth of GSA\u2019s Federal Supply Schedule and governmentwide acquisition  contracts (GWAC). These interagency contracts are being used in a  variety of situations, from those in which a single agency provides limited  contracting assistance to a more comprehensive approach in which  the provider agency\u2019s contracting officer handles all aspects of the  procurement. Agencies charge users of these contracts a fee to cover  administrative expenses. GSA\u2019s schedule program enables federal agencies  to quickly acquire goods and services, thereby helping them to, among  other objectives, reduce lead times and lower administrative costs. GSA  does this by awarding contracts to vendors and making these contracts  available for use by other agencies. GWACs are intended to facilitate  purchases of information technology-related products and services, such  as network maintenance and technical support, systems engineering, and  integration services.", "As shown in figure 4, sales under the schedule program have more than  tripled over the past 5 years, increasing from $4.3 billion in fiscal year 1997  to about $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2001. Agency officials at each of the  agencies we reviewed reported increases in their use of the schedules  program over the past 5 years, driven largely by increased purchases of  information technology and professional, administrative, and management  support services.", "As shown in table 1, DOD and GSA, the largest users of the schedules  program, accounted for about 75 percent of schedule sales in fiscal year  2001. GSA\u2019s increased share is largely attributable to the growth of GSA\u2019s  Federal Technology Service, which places orders under the schedule for  information technology services and equipment on behalf of other federal  agencies. However, orders placed by the Federal Technology Service are  counted as spending by GSA, rather than as spending by the federal agency  that will ultimately receive the service or equipment.", "Agency officials also reported that their use of GWACs increased  considerably over the 5-year period between fiscal years 1997 and 2001. For  example, USDA reported an increase from about $5.1 million to $44 million,  and Treasury reported an increase from $92 million to $155 million.  Officials at the other eight agencies we reviewed reported that they also  increased their use of GWACs; however, they could not provide detailed  GWAC information because this spending was not an integral part of their  management information systems. While GSA officials indicated that they  have not modified the FPDS to collect specific information on GWAC  spending, several officials at other agencies stated that they either are  collecting or will begin to collect additional information on their agencies\u2019  GWAC use.", "While use of these interagency contracting methods can allow agencies to  meet their needs quickly, our past work has shown that agencies are not  adequately adhering to guidelines on competition. Further, recent agency  Inspector General reports noted that DOD, VA, and NASA personnel did not  consistently follow procedures intended to promote competition or ensure  fair and reasonable prices when using these interagency contract methods  to acquire information technology services, medical equipment, or research  and development projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purchase Cards", "paragraphs": ["Purchase card spending has increased significantly governmentwide.  This program provides federal agencies a low-cost and efficient means  for quickly obtaining goods and services directly from vendors.", "Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the commercial purchase card is  now the preferred method of paying for micropurchases. The purchase  card may also be authorized to be used in greater dollar amounts and may  be used to make payments under existing contracts.", "As figure 5 shows, governmentwide purchase card use increased  from $5.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $13.8 billion in fiscal year 2001\u2014a  160 percent rise. Increases in purchase card use in the agencies we  reviewed ranged from 45 percent to 344 percent.", "As figure 6 shows, agencies used purchase cards to varying degrees.  DOD was the largest user of purchase cards, spending about $6.1 billion  in fiscal year 2001. VA was the largest civilian agency user of the  purchase card program, spending about $3.8 billion. VA officials noted  that due to VA\u2019s organizational structure and its continuous need for  disposable medical and surgical supplies, purchase cards are one of  VA\u2019s key procurement techniques and are used extensively as a payment  mechanism.", "During the past 2 years, we found that significant internal control  weaknesses in several agency purchase card programs allowed  cardholders to make fraudulent, improper, abusive, or questionable  purchases that resulted in lost, missing, or misused government property.", "Agencies are responding to the recommendations that we and others have  made regarding internal control weaknesses. For example, the Navy has  reduced the number of cardholders by more than 50 percent, from 59,000  in June 2001 to 25,000 by March 2002, thus improving the likelihood of  effective program management. Additionally, DOD has begun  implementing new training and approval processes. For example, DOD  implemented automated controls during fiscal year 2002 to help with  monitoring credit limits, cardholder reconciliation, and approving officials\u2019  review of monthly statements.

Many procurement  reform advocates have recommended that federal agencies purchase  commercial items to save money and reduce acquisition time, rather than  pay companies to develop unique items for the government\u2019s use. The  Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act established a preference for the  acquisition of commercial items. Because commercial items are subject  to competitive market forces, they may be acquired using streamlined  solicitation and evaluation procedures generally provided for under part 12  of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). For example, contracting  officers may reduce the time needed to solicit bids and award contracts by  combining certain steps in the solicitation process, using streamlined  evaluation techniques, and eliminating certain administrative requirements.", "In fiscal year 2001, the purchase of commercial items using FAR part 12  procedures accounted for 19 percent of the spending for goods and  services by federal agencies, up from 9 percent 5 years earlier. From  fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001, governmentwide use of part 12  procedures increased by 148 percent.

Under  performance-based approaches, the contracting agency specifies the  outcome or result it desires and lets the contractor decide how best to  achieve the desired outcome. Performance-based contracts offer  significant benefits, such as encouraging contractors to innovate and find  cost-effective ways of delivering services. In fiscal year 2001, agencies  reported that 24 percent of their eligible service contracts, by dollar value,  were considered performance based.", "There was wide variation in the extent to which agencies used  performance-based contracts. As figure 7 shows, 3 of the 10 agencies in our  review fell short of OMB\u2019s goal that 10 percent of their eligible service  contracts be performance based in fiscal year 2001.", "We recently found that some agencies achieved only mixed success  in incorporating four basic performance-based attributes into their  contracts. These attributes include describing desired outcomes rather  than how the services should be performed, setting measurable  performance standards, describing how the contractor\u2019s performance  will be evaluated, and establishing positive and negative incentives, as  appropriate. Our review raised questions as to whether agencies have an  adequate understanding of performance-based contracting and how to take  full advantage of this approach. Agency officials themselves pointed to the  need for better guidance on performance-based contracting and better  criteria for identifying which contracts should be called \u201cperformance  based.\u201d In response to our recommendations, the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy is developing new guidance to help agencies improve  their use of performance-based contracting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Acquisition Workforce and Workload Trends", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, the federal acquisition workforce has had to adapt  to changes in staffing levels, workloads, and the need for new skill sets.

Governmentwide data indicate that in fiscal year 2001 both the number of  acquisition workforce employees and the number of contract actions  declined slightly from fiscal year 1997 levels. However, the extent to which  these changes occurred varied from agency to agency. Ensuring that  agencies will have the right people with the right skills to successfully meet  the increasingly complex demands expected in the future has become a  priority at most of the agencies we reviewed.

As shown in table 3, our analysis indicates that while most agencies  are processing fewer smaller actions\u2014those valued at less than $25,000\u2014 most agencies are also managing an increased number of larger actions.  Agencies have made far greater use of purchase cards for making their  smaller dollar purchases, which accounts for the declining rate of smaller  dollar actions.

To accomplish  this, leading public organizations in the United States and abroad have  found that strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of  any serious change management initiative. Strategic management of  human capital is a key governmentwide initiative in the President\u2019s  Management Agenda.", "One aspect of strategic human capital planning is succession planning,  where an agency identifies its future needs in terms of workforce skills and  numbers. Our prior work has shown that when workforce reductions do  not consider future needs\u2014such as a staff reduction at DOD during the  1990s\u2014the result is a workforce that is not balanced with regard to  experience and skill sets. The need for planning is underscored by the fact  that, similar to human capital challenges across a variety of occupation  categories, all agencies face the prospect of losing many of their skilled  acquisition personnel over the next 5 years. As shown in figure 8, about  38 percent of acquisition personnel governmentwide are either already  eligible to retire or will be eligible by September 30, 2007. At DOD and  DOE\u2014the two largest contracting agencies in our review\u201439 percent of  the acquisition workforce will be eligible to retire by fiscal year 2008; at the  other eight agencies, between 30 to 36 percent of their current workforces  will be eligible to retire.", "Our recent reviews of how agencies are addressing their future acquisition  workforce needs found that all of the agencies we reviewed have made  progress. For example, the agencies have either published or drafted  human capital strategic plans for their overall workforces or for their  acquisition workforces, and some are revamping training, recruitment, and  retention programs to address future workforce needs. However, these  agencies have encountered challenges, in part due to shifting priorities,  missions, and budgets that make it difficult to predict with any certainty  the specific skills and competencies their acquisition workforces will need.  Further, many agencies simply lack good data on their workforces, such as  size and location, knowledge and skills, and attrition and retirement rates.

Other programs include  developing expendable launch vehicles, improving space communications and data systems, and providing  safety and mission support. HSF also provides for the design, repair, rehabilitation, and modification of  facilities and construction of new facilities. In fiscal year 2001, HSF accounted for 45 percent of NASA\u2019s  discretionary resources.", "NASA\u2019s discretionary resources decreased by about 6 percent from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001,  totaling $15.8 billion in fiscal year 2001. The amount spent through contracts decreased slightly, both in real  terms and as a share of NASA\u2019s discretionary resources. Nevertheless, NASA relies on contracts to achieve its  mission to a greater extent than most federal agencies.", "NASA contracts primarily for services. Of NASA\u2019s $11 billion spent on contracts over $25,000 in fiscal year  2001, about $9.6 billion\u2014or 86 percent\u2014were for services, including operating various government-owned  facilities, providing professional and administrative support, and conducting research and development  activities. Overall, NASA\u2019s spending for services declined by 7 percent between fiscal years 1997 and 2001,  though there were significant variations in individual service categories.", "NASA uses a variety of methods in carrying out its procurement functions.", "Due to the nature of the items and services needed to carry out its mission, NASA relies heavily on  cost-type contracts; 83 percent of contract obligations over $25,000 for fiscal year 2001 were made  under cost-type contracts.", "NASA spent slightly more than half of its contracts over $25,000 on competed contracts, a relatively lower  percentage than other federal agencies. For those contracts it competes, NASA receives two or more bids  nearly 90 percent of the time.", "NASA reports that 64 percent of eligible service contracts were performance based in fiscal year 2001.", "NASA\u2019s use of purchase cards grew since fiscal year 1997, but accounts for a small percentage of its budget   While NASA generally acquires government-unique items, it increased its purchases using FAR part 12  procedures from $225 million in fiscal year 1997 to about $794 million in fiscal year 2001.", "The size of NASA\u2019s workforce remained relatively stable from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001,  decreasing by about 4 percent. NASA\u2019s acquisition workforce, which represented about 7 percent of its total  workforce, experienced a similar trend.", "In fiscal year 2001, 56 percent of the acquisition workforce had 20 years or more of federal service, while  only 3 percent had fewer than 5 years of service.", "By fiscal year 2008, approximately 33 percent of NASA\u2019s acquisition workforce will be eligible to retire.", "Risk-based acquisition management: To reduce the incidence and severity of impacts arising from  unforeseen programmatic events, NASA recently developed this process to integrate risk principles when  developing the acquisition strategy, selecting sources, choosing contract type, structuring fee incentives, and  conducting contractor surveillance.", "Award term contracting: NASA is using this approach to reward contractor performance by enabling  contract extension for excellent performance and reduced costs. In addition to profit, a continuing  relationship becomes a prime motivator for the contractor.", "Evaluate and Improve Performance-Based Service Contracting: NASA has initiated an  agencywide awareness program and training sessions for government and contractor employees relating  to performance-based service contracting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "V.
