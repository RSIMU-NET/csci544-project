In related reports, GAO has recommended corrective actions to address those weaknesses. Each year, as part of the annual audit of IRS's financial statements, GAO makes recommendations to address any new weaknesses identified and follows up on the status of IRS's efforts to address the weaknesses GAO identified in previous years' audits.

This progress has been the result of hard work throughout IRS and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces financial management challenges. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2008 financial statements, 81 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them. During the fiscal year 2008 financial audit, IRS took actions that GAO considered sufficient to close 35. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control issues resulting in 16 new recommendations. In total, 62 recommendations remain open. To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 62 open recommendations by various internal control activities, which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control categories. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that IRS needs to overcome. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management and can help enable it to more effectively carry out its tax administration responsibilities. Most can be addressed in the short term (the next 2 years). However, a few recommendations, particularly those concerning IRS's automated systems, are complex and will require several more years to effectively address."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In its role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  enforce the nation\u2019s tax laws.

Because of its role and overall mission, IRS\u2019s activities affect virtually all  of the nation\u2019s citizens. It is therefore critical that the agency strive to  maintain sound financial management practices.", "IRS has made much progress in improving its financial management since  it was first required to prepare a set of financial statements and have them  in fiscal year 1992. This progress was reflected in its ability to obtain and  maintain a clean audit opinion on its financial statements each year  beginning in fiscal year 2000, to correct several material internal control  weaknesses over the years, and to make many other improvements in  internal control. At the same time, more remains to be done to address  long-standing internal control issues that continue to exist at the agency.  IRS continues to have weak or ineffective internal controls over  fundamental elements of its operations that leave it vulnerable to a greater  risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. This, in turn, has the  potential to affect the lives of the nation\u2019s taxpayers, as our audits over the  years have demonstrated. For example, IRS\u2019s continued failure to  promptly release federal tax liens could cause undue hardship and burden  to taxpayers who are attempting to sell property or apply for commercial  credit.", "An agency\u2019s internal control environment serves as the first line of defense  in safeguarding its assets and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud,  as well as in helping to effectively manage its stewardship over public  resources.

During our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2008 financial  statements, we continued to find material weaknesses in controls over    unpaid tax assessments, and   information systems security.", "In addition to the material weaknesses, we continued to identify a  significant deficiency involving IRS\u2019s control over tax revenue and  refunds, which hampers IRS\u2019s ability to optimize the use of its resources to  collect unpaid taxes and minimize payments of improper refunds. This  significant deficiency was downgraded from a material weakness in fiscal  year 2008 because IRS took significant steps to address the deficiencies  comprising the material weakness, such as enhancing its cost accounting  capabilities and performance measures.", "To assist IRS in strengthening its internal controls and improving its  operations, we have made numerous recommendations as part of our  annual financial statement audits and other financial management-related  work at IRS.

While we use all five  elements of internal control as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of  IRS\u2019s internal controls, our ongoing evaluations and tests have focused  heavily on control activities to identify internal control weaknesses and  offer recommendations for corrective action. Control activities are the  policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce  management\u2019s directives.

Internal  control in this important area should be designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets. We have grouped  together the four control activities in the internal control standards that  relate to safeguarding of assets (including tax receipts) and security  activities (such as limiting access to only authorized personnel):   (1) physical control over vulnerable assets, (2) segregation of duties,   (3) controls over information processing, and (4) access restrictions to  and accountability for resources and records.", "Internal control standard: An agency must establish physical control to secure and  safeguard vulnerable assets. Examples include security for and limited access to assets  such as cash, securities, inventories, and equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of  loss or unauthorized use. Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to  control records.", "IRS collects trillions of dollars in taxes each year, a significant amount of  which is collected in the form of checks and cash accompanied by tax  returns and related information. IRS collects taxes both at its own  facilities as well as at lockbox banks that operate under contract with the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Financial Management Service.  IRS acts as custodian for (1) the tax payments it receives until they are  deposited in the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and (2) the tax returns  and related information it receives until they are either sent to the Federal  Records Center or destroyed. IRS is also charged with controlling many  other assets, such as computers and other equipment, but IRS\u2019s legal  responsibility to safeguard tax returns and the confidential information  taxpayers provide on tax returns makes the effectiveness of its internal  controls with respect to physical security essential.", "While effective physical safeguards over receipts should exist throughout  the year, such safeguards are especially important during the peak tax  filing season. Each year during the weeks preceding and shortly after April  15, an IRS service center campus (SCC) or lockbox bank may receive and  process daily over 100,000 pieces of mail containing returns, receipts, or  both. The dollar value of receipts each SCC and lockbox bank processes  increases to hundreds of millions of dollars a day during the April 15 time  frame.", "The following 11 recommendations are designed to improve IRS\u2019s physical  controls over vulnerable assets.

This should  include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions, processing and  recording them, reviewing the transactions, and handling any related assets. No one  individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event.", "IRS employees process trillions of dollars of tax receipts each year, of  which hundreds of billions are received in the form of cash or checks, and  for processing hundreds of billions of dollars in refunds to taxpayers.  Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain appropriate separation of  duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff and protection of these  vulnerable resources so that no single individual would be in a position of  causing an error or irregularity, potentially converting the asset to  personal use, and then concealing it. For example, when an IRS field office  or lockbox bank receives taxpayer receipts and returns, it is responsible  for depositing the cash and checks in a depository institution and  forwarding the related information received to an SCC for further  processing. In order to adequately safeguard receipts from theft, the  person responsible for recording the information from the taxpayer  receipts on a voucher should be different from the individual who  prepares those receipts for transmittal to the SCC for further processing.  Also, for procurement of goods and services, the person who places an  order for goods and services should be different from the person who  receives the goods and services. Such separation of duties will help to  prevent the occurrence of fraud, theft of IRS assets, or both.", "Implementing the following three recommendations would help IRS  improve its separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen its controls  over tax receipts and refunds and procurement activities.

While IRS has undertaken several  actions to strengthen controls over this  area, such as updating guidance and  providing training related to manual  interest calculations, it has yet to  develop a sampling methodology to  monitor the accuracy of its manual  interest computation and assess the  effectiveness of its corrective actions.  Consequently, we did not test IRS  controls in this area as part of our  fiscal year 2008 audit, as both we and  IRS believed that the actions taken by  IRS thus far would not improve the  accuracy of the manual interest  calculations.
