EPA's IRIS Program, which produces toxicity assessments, has been criticized in the past for timeliness and transparency issues. In response, the IRIS Program committed to making program improvements starting in 2011, which the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recently commended.

Efforts to address timeliness include employing project management principles and specialized software to better plan assessments and utilize staff. To address the need for greater transparency in how the program conducts assessments, IRIS officials and the IRIS Program have implemented systematic review, which provides a structured and transparent process for identifying relevant studies, reviewing their methodological strengths and weaknesses, and integrating these studies as part of a weight of evidence analysis.", "Since the process improvements were implemented, the program made progress toward producing chemical assessments through May 2018. In June 2018, the EPA Administrator's office told IRIS officials that they could not release any IRIS-associated documentation without a formal request from EPA program office leadership. In August 2018, according to IRIS officials, program office leadership was asked to reconfirm which ongoing chemical assessments their offices needed. In late October 2018, these offices were asked to limit their chemical requests further, to the top three or four assessments. At the same time\u20144 months after IRIS assessments were stopped from being released\u201428 of approximately 30 IRIS staff were directed to support implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA), as amended, with 25 to 50 percent of their time, according to officials. Then on December 19, 2018, the Office of Research and Development released its IRIS Program Outlook, which provided an updated list of 13 assessments. Eleven of the 13 chemicals on the IRIS Program Outlook were requested by two EPA program offices. A memorandum issued earlier in December, gave no indication of when additional assessments could be requested or what the IRIS Program's workflow would be in the near term.", "EPA has demonstrated progress implementing TSCA, which was amended in June 2016, by responding to statutory deadlines. For example, EPA finalized rules detailing the general processes for prioritizing and evaluating chemicals, known as the Framework Rules, but three of the four rules have been challenged in court. Environmental organizations have argued, among other things, that TSCA requires EPA to consider all conditions of use in prioritizing and evaluating chemicals, rather than excluding, for example, uses that EPA believes are \"legacy uses,\" for which a chemical is no longer marketed. EPA argued that TSCA grants it discretion to determine what constitutes a chemical's conditions of use. Amendments to TSCA in 2016 increased EPA's responsibility for regulating chemicals and in turn, its workload. As such, EPA is required to prioritize and evaluate existing chemicals by various deadlines over an extended period and to make a regulatory determination on all new chemicals. Senior management told GAO that they were confident that ongoing hiring and reorganization would better position the office that implements TSCA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made recommendations previously to improve the IRIS Program and TSCA implementation.

Since   June 22, 2016, companies have manufactured more than 550 new  chemical substances that EPA approved for commerce. While chemicals  contribute to virtually every aspect of modern life, exposures to chemicals  can have negative health and environmental consequences. EPA\u2019s ability  to effectively implement its mission of protecting public health and the  environment depends on its credible and timely assessments of the risks  posed by chemicals.

These risk assessments in turn provide the foundation for  EPA\u2019s risk management decisions, such as whether EPA should establish  air and water quality standards to protect the public from exposure to  toxic chemicals. To prepare these risk assessments, some EPA program  and regional offices often rely in part on chemical assessments that the  IRIS Program, as part of ORD, prepares. IRIS assessments generally  include the first two steps of the risk assessment process seen in green in  figure 1: (1) hazard identification and (2) dose-response assessment.  Hazard identification identifies credible health hazards associated with  exposures to a chemical; dose-response assessment characterizes the  quantitative relationship between chemical exposure and each credible  health hazard. The program derives toxicity values through this  quantitative relationship. These toxicity values are combined with  exposure assessments (produced by other offices within EPA) to produce  a risk assessment. OCSPP, which oversees TSCA implementation, also  prepares chemical risk assessments, though it does not generally rely on  IRIS toxicity values. OCSPP\u2019s risk evaluations provide the foundation for  a risk management action under TSCA if a use is found to present  unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Risk  management actions under TSCA can include but are not limited to  restrictions or bans on a chemical or a condition of use, limitations on  processing or manufacture, or changes to product labeling.

Based on our  body of work on the IRIS Program, the program\u2019s importance has  increased over time as EPA program offices and regions have  increasingly relied on IRIS chemical assessments in making  environmental protection and risk management decisions. In addition,  state and local environmental programs, as well as some international  regulatory bodies, rely on IRIS chemical assessments in managing their  environmental protection programs. The IRIS Program uses a seven-step  process to produce chemical assessments, as shown in figure 3.", "The first step in the assessment development process is developing a  draft assessment. This begins with IRIS Program staff determining the  scope and initial problem formulation of an assessment in consultation  with EPA program and regional offices. This information is documented in  an IRIS Assessment Plan and released for agency and public comment.  After obtaining feedback on the IRIS Assessment Plan, IRIS Program  staff prepare an assessment protocol for public comment that describes  the methods that IRIS will use to conduct the assessment. During Step 1  (Scoping and Problem Formulation) IRIS Program staff conduct  preliminary searches of scientific literature and screen relevant studies to  understand the extent and nature of the available evidence. This informs  the level of effort, identifies areas of scientific complexity, and helps the  IRIS Program estimate time frames for conducting the assessment. The  program staff select and extract relevant data and analyze and integrate  the evidence into the draft assessment. The final step in preparing the  draft assessment is deriving chemical toxicity values. After these draft  development steps (step 1 in fig. 3), the draft assessment goes through  internal agency and interagency review, public comment, and peer  review, as shown in steps 2 through 4 in figure 3. After making revisions  to address comments received (step 5), the assessment goes through  another round of internal and interagency review (steps 6a and 6b), and  then the program finalizes and posts the assessment to the IRIS  website.", "According to IRIS officials, in order to prepare IRIS assessments, a group  of staff with specialized skills are required. On any given assessment,  approximately a dozen staff drawn from several different backgrounds  (e.g., toxicologists and epidemiologists) work on each assessment. While  some of the assessment preparation\u2014that is, setting up database  searches and performing initial search screenings\u2014can be performed by  any staff, other parts of assessment development require that the staff  have specific expertise.", "The IRIS assessment development process\u2014and the associated  implementation of systematic review processes\u2014has continued to evolve  since 2011, primarily as a result of NAS recommendations made in two  reports issued in 2011 and 2014. The 2011 report was a NAS peer review  of the IRIS assessment of formaldehyde. In that report, NAS  recommended several changes to the formaldehyde assessment and  also offered recommendations more generally about the IRIS assessment  development process. For example, NAS recommended methods for  identifying evidence to be included in IRIS assessments; assessing and  weighting that evidence in preparing the assessment; selecting studies  that are used for calculating toxicity; and documenting how those toxicity  calculations are carried out. A House appropriations committee report for  fiscal year 2015 directed EPA to implement the 2011 report\u2019s  recommendations and NAS to review the changes that EPA was making  (or proposing to make).

These changes were made in response  to program implementation challenges identified by governmental,  industry, academic, and non-governmental stakeholders in recent years.  For example, in its 2011 report, NAS identified timeliness and  transparency as issues. In our review of the 2011 and 2014 NAS reports  and other documentation as well as our interviews with IRIS officials and  leadership and officials in program and regional offices that use IRIS  assessments, we identified the key actions the IRIS Program has taken to  address lack of timeliness in producing assessments and lack of  transparency in how it produces assessments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The IRIS Program Has Made Changes to Address Timeliness", "paragraphs": ["Developing IRIS assessments has historically been a lengthy process.  Because of the rigor of the IRIS process and the amount of literature that  program staff must search and consider, producing an assessment  typically takes several years, as we found in December 2011.

IRIS officials said that by using  these tools, IRIS staff are able to view project tasks, timelines, and  milestones to manage their individual tasks and assessment work. For  example, IRIS officials said that as part of an EPA-wide initiative, they  began incorporating lean management techniques, which aim to improve  efficiency and effectiveness by reducing unnecessary process steps and  waiting time. Additionally, IRIS officials said that they have begun using a  staffing model that trains staff to be proficient in all phases of the  systematic review process (i.e., screening, data extraction, study  evaluation, and evidence synthesis). This modularity will make it easier  for staff to work across teams and on multiple projects, assisting with  systematic review needs while also contributing in their areas of  expertise, according to IRIS Program officials. In addition, the IRIS  Program began using both project management software and business  intelligence and visualization software in 2017. IRIS Program leadership  is using this software to generate resource allocation reports showing  staff assignments, enabling leadership to better manage staff workloads.", "According to IRIS officials, the recent adoption of specialized systematic  review software also enables program staff to perform more literature  searches faster, and the ability to filter search results allows staff to find  more quickly the most relevant information for an assessment. Use of  software tools with machine-learning capabilities facilitate program staff\u2019s  ability to screen studies for relevance more quickly compared to  approaches used before 2017. Prior to the adoption of these specialized  software tools, much of the development of an assessment was manual  (i.e., using a spreadsheet). For example, for one assessment developed  manually, contactors working on an IRIS assessment took over 200 hours  to screen and catalog 1,200 epidemiological studies, including carrying  out quality assurance checks. By comparison, using machine-learning  tools, EPA staff were able to screen almost 5,500 articles in about 30  hours. With the new tools, quality assurance was embedded into the  workflow by having two independent reviewers and a software-facilitated  process track and resolve screening conflicts.", "Additionally, an official from EPA\u2019s National Health and Environmental  Effects Research Laboratory said that the laboratory uses a similar  screening process. The laboratory worked with the IRIS Program to  identify similar constructs in their processes and used each other\u2019s results  to make changes and validate tools used by both. According to IRIS  officials, as a result, the use of these tools has created more efficient  workflow processes, leading to considerable cost and time savings. The  incorporation of systematic review software tools has greatly helped the  program more efficiently carry out tasks like screening literature,  evaluating study quality, extracting data, and developing visualizations,  according to IRIS Program officials we interviewed. Most importantly, the  software tools allow multiple staff members to work on tasks  simultaneously, rather than one at a time, facilitating concurrent  completion of key assessment pieces.", "The Program Tailors Assessments to Program and Regional Office  Needs  The second way in which the IRIS Program is reducing the length of time  it takes to produce assessments is by tailoring them to program and  regional office needs, called fit-for-purpose assessments. According to  IRIS officials, part of the reason assessments historically were time- consuming was because the program tried to synthesize and present all  possible information on the human health effects of a particular chemical,  including multiple exposure pathways (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, or  dermal) and reference doses, reference concentrations, and cancerous  and non-cancerous effects. This required large amounts of data  extraction and was very time intensive. Beginning in early 2017, the  program began implementing the fit-for-purpose approach to producing  assessments. IRIS officials said the idea is that instead of producing a  wide-ranging assessment, the program can produce assessments that  are more limited in scope and targeted to specific program and regional  office needs, reducing the amount of time IRIS staff needed to search for  information, synthesize it and draft, review, and issue an assessment. For  example, if the Office of Air and Radiation needed a chemical  assessment that examined only inhalation exposures, the IRIS Program  could limit its assessment to a single exposure pathway, which would  reduce the amount of data that staff review and extract and, with less text  to draft and less complex peer reviews, allow the assessment to more  quickly move through the process.", "IRIS officials said that if offices make subsequent requests for other  effects or exposure pathways, the IRIS Program can update the original  assessment. IRIS officials said that they expect time savings as a result  of moving to the fit-for-purpose model. As of November 1, 2018, the IRIS  Program had produced two fit-for-purpose assessments: a request for  correction on chloroprene and an update of the assessment on acrolein.  An assessment on perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) was also  released for public comment following peer review. PFBS are a member  of a class of man-made chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS)\u2014a groups that also includes perfluorooctane  sulfonate acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), GenX, and many  others. In addition, since 2017, the IRIS Program released scoping and  problem formulation materials for six IRIS chemical assessments  (nitrates/nitrites, chloroform, ethylbenzene, uranium, ammonia, and  naphthalene).", "Additionally, the program is examining ways to assist program and  regional offices with information that may not necessitate developing a full  assessment. For example, the Office of Air and Radiation was doing work  using a toxicity value for acrolein that the California Environmental  Protection Agency prepared in 2008, because that value was more recent  than the value in the IRIS database. However, a large number of studies  on acrolein had been released since 2008, so the IRIS Program searched  approximately 10,000 new studies and concluded that the study used by  California Environmental Protection Agency in 2008 was still the most  appropriate study for chronic toxicity value derivation. In addition, IRIS  staff developed an updated draft reference concentration for acrolein  based on this study. The screening and update process took  approximately 4 months, demonstrating how the IRIS Program\u2019s use of  new tools and a targeted scope resulted in more timely attention to  program office needs.", "The Program Is Streamlining the Peer Review Process  The third way the IRIS Program is addressing the length of time it takes to  produce assessments is by streamlining the peer review process as much  as possible without compromising the quality of the review. EPA  guidelines require peer review of all IRIS assessments. Smaller, less  complex assessments may be peer reviewed through a contractor-led  letter review or panel; more complex assessments are usually reviewed  by a full Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) or a NAS panel, though IRIS  leadership determines the most appropriate method of peer review based  on Office of Management and Budget and EPA Peer Review Handbook  guidelines. While the contractor-led letter or panel reviews are no less  robust than full SAB or NAS panel reviews, the contractor-led reviews are  usually smaller and completed in less time because they are reviewing  smaller, less complex IRIS assessments. The time savings occur  because the reviewers do not typically meet in person, or may meet only once, typically taking a few months to complete their reviews. In contrast,  SAB and NAS panels involve larger numbers of people who meet multiple  times, review longer and more complex assessments, and must reach  consensus on their reviews. As a result, SAB and NAS peer reviews can  take more than a year to complete. IRIS officials said that as they try to  produce more fit-for-purpose assessments that are smaller in scope, they  plan to utilize letter reviews as appropriate, to streamline the peer review  process. IRIS Program officials said they also hope that other changes  they recently implemented\u2014primarily, increased transparency and  systematic review\u2014will help speed up the peer review process by  producing a higher-quality overall draft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The IRIS Program Has Made Changes to Address Lack of Transparency", "paragraphs": ["Another major category of NAS recommendations that the IRIS Program  has addressed is the need for greater transparency in how the program  conducts assessments. For example, one industry representative  expressed concern in August 2018 about transparency before the  program began making changes, describing the IRIS Program as a \u201cblack  box\u201d because \u201cno one knew how the program created its methodologies,  weighted evidence, or produced assessments.\u201d In response, the IRIS  Program has in the past several years (1) implemented systematic  review, which provides a structured and transparent process for  identifying relevant studies, reviewing their methodological strengths and  weaknesses, and integrating these studies as part of a weight of evidence  analysis, and (2) increased outreach efforts with stakeholders and the  public, both in terms of the frequency and the depth of content about  assessment preparation.", "The Program Began Implementing Systematic Review as a Basis of  Its Assessments  The IRIS Program began addressing the need for greater transparency  by implementing systematic review as a basis for every assessment and  has been doing so for several years. A systematic review is a structured  and documented process for transparent literature review. It is a scientific  investigation that focuses on a specific question and uses explicit,  prespecified scientific methods to identify, select, assess, and summarize  the findings of similar but separate studies. The goal of systematic review  methods is to ensure that the review is complete, unbiased, reproducible,  and transparent. By using systematic review, the IRIS Program can  demonstrate that it considered all available literature in forming  conclusions and deriving toxicity values. Utilizing the new software tools  described above allows program staff to search more widely than before  and to identify the most relevant results faster and more accurately. The  IRIS Program is working with technical experts to increase the  applications of machine learning for carrying out systematic review.", "Additionally, new software allows the IRIS Program to save and publish  its search strings and to indicate why it selected certain studies over  others for review and inclusion. The software also allows multiple staff to  check searches and concur or not-concur with the initial assessment  about including a scientific article in the draft assessment. IRIS officials  told us that the transparency associated with systematic review and  clearer explanation of methodologies in assessments (as well as  releasing subsidiary documents, such as IRIS Assessment Plans and  Assessment Protocols) will improve stakeholders\u2019 understanding of how  the program arrives at its conclusions.", "The Program Has Made Changes to Communication Frequency and  Type  The IRIS Program also furthered transparency by increasing the  frequency, structure, and content of communications with EPA program  and regional offices about overall program priorities and individual  assessments. This allows EPA program and regional offices to know  when to expect assessments, as well as what those assessments will  cover. To prepare the 2015 Multi-Year Agenda, the IRIS Program  solicited requests from EPA program and regional offices about which  chemical assessments they needed; these requests were released in  December 2015. When new leadership joined the IRIS Program in early  2017, the new officials began reaching out to individual program and  regional offices to re-confirm their needs and priorities. IRIS officials said  this effort was in part to ensure that the IRIS Program was delivering what  the program offices needed, as well as to help the IRIS Program keep its  priorities up to date and ensure that resources (primarily staff) were  aligned with EPA-wide priorities. Based on these conversations with  program and regional office staff, the IRIS Program made some chemical  assessments higher priority and removed others from the program\u2019s  workflow, consistent with stated needs.", "In May 2018, the IRIS Program prepared a statement for posting on the  IRIS website outlining these changes to the program\u2019s workflow and an  updated list of assessments that were being developed with anticipated  completion time frames. However, EPA leadership in ORD\u2014the office  that oversees the IRIS Program\u2014did not approve this statement for  release because current EPA leadership in program and regional offices  had not formally requested these assessments. Nevertheless, officials  from program and regional offices that use IRIS assessments told us that  they received clear communication from the IRIS Program about priorities  and timelines for individual assessments. According to these officials,  some of this communication took place when IRIS Program leadership  reached out to program and regional office officials to confirm their needs,  and some took place during monthly telephone calls the IRIS Program  held to update stakeholders on assessment development timelines.  Program and regional office officials told us that they appreciated the IRIS  Program\u2019s recent efforts to understand program and regional office needs  and timelines; communicate the status of assessments more frequently;  and find ways to assist program offices that may not require developing a  full assessment, such as assessment updates or literature reviews.", "Since 2013, the IRIS Program has released preliminary assessment  materials\u2014including IRIS Assessment Plans and assessment protocols\u2014 so that EPA and interagency stakeholders and the public could be aware  of scoping and problem formulation for each assessment. Since 2017,  according to EPA, these documents had a new structure and better  demonstrate the application of systematic review, and they continue to  convey EPA\u2019s need for each assessment and frame questions specific to  each assessment. Officials in several program and regional offices that  use IRIS assessments told us that the release of IRIS Assessment Plans  and protocols was very helpful because it allowed them to offer early  input to the IRIS Program about the scope of an assessment, when it  could affect the direction of the assessment.

The IRIS Program also produced a report to  Congress on the program\u2019s work in January 2018 and took part in a NAS  review of the program in February 2018. The NAS review, which offered a  third-party assessment of the program\u2019s efforts, provided a supportive  assessment of ongoing transformations aimed at ensuring data quality,  new systematic approaches for data analysis and expanded stakeholder  engagement efforts, and increased the efficiency of assessments.  According to the report, NAS reviewers were impressed with the changes  being instituted in the IRIS Program since 2014, including substantive  reforms by new IRIS Program leadership, such as the development,  implementation, and use of systematic review methods to conduct IRIS  assessments. In addition, as of August 2018, the final IRIS assessment of  hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) was issued.

At the request of the Administrator, IRIS officials  prepared a survey of program and regional offices, asking them to re- confirm their needs for 20 assessments that were in development. This  survey was sent by memorandum in August 2018. Program office  responses were to be signed by the Assistant Administrator of each  program office to ensure that the re-confirmations were consistent with  the priorities of EPA program office leadership. While survey responses  were being compiled, EPA leadership in ORD instructed the IRIS  Program not to publically release any assessment documentation.

ORD\u2019s request did not provide  information on the basis for selecting priorities or the reason for the limit  of three or four chemical assessments from the original survey  submissions. The calls for advice from program office officials  represented the first time the IRIS Program heard about the requests for  a prioritized list, according to IRIS program officials.

Furthermore, four  assessments that were in the later stages of development and had not  been issued were not included in the December 2018 Outlook. The four  assessments were: acrylonitrile, n-Butyl alcohol, formaldehyde, and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The assessment of formaldehyde  was, according to the \u201cIRIS Assessments in Development\u201d website, at  Step 4 of the IRIS process (an assessment is drafted and was ready to be  released for public comment and external peer review). The absence of  these four assessments from the December 2018 Outlook could create  confusion for stakeholders interested in them. EPA provided no  information on the status of these four assessments or whether it planned  to discontinue working on them or restart them at another time. As we  have previously reported, an overarching factor that affects EPA\u2019s ability  to complete IRIS assessments in a timely manner is that once a delay in  the assessment process occurs, work that has been completed can  become outdated, necessitating rework throughout some or all of the  assessment process.

Our forthcoming 2019 high-risk  update will address actions taken by agencies on the list, including EPA,  since the last update in 2017. EPA said that to monitor progress, it had  put into place a rigorous program; as a regular practice, EPA stated that  Deputy Assistant Administrators from the Office of Chemical Safety and  Pollution Prevention conduct monthly Business Review meetings with the  Office Directors, Deputy Office Directors, lead region representatives, and  other key staff. EPA stated that during these meetings they discuss their  organizations\u2019 operations and performance, including TSCA  implementation status, using performance charts to track progress on  mission measures, identify and update countermeasures, and resolve  problems. However, over the year that we conducted our review, EPA  officials did not mention conducting such meetings and did not provide  documentation that such meetings took place.", "Further, in its written comments, EPA provided technical comments on  the draft report, which we address as appropriate. In one comment, EPA  stated that instead of noting that the agency has successfully  implemented many statutory requirements, the draft report stated that  EPA responded to deadlines. We believe the report correctly  characterizes steps EPA has taken to implement TSCA, and, as noted  above, whether EPA\u2019s response is legally sufficient is in litigation, and  GAO does not typically express a view on legal or factual matters in  dispute before a court. In another case, the technical comments  contradicted facts that we gathered during our review. For instance, while  EPA stated that the draft report incorrectly noted that most of the IRIS  staff had been working on TSCA activities, we provide further information  to support our original statement; we replaced the term \u2018most\u2019 with  specific data on the number of IRIS staff and the percentage of their time  that was devoted to TSCA activities.", "Also in its technical comments, EPA stated that our analysis highlighted  uncertainty resulting from the agency\u2019s recent activities to ensure IRIS  Program efforts were aligned with the highest priorities of the agency.  EPA acknowledged that this action did result in a delay but that in the  long term, it would ensure that EPA\u2019s program and regional office  priorities are being addressed and that each office is fully engaged in the  development of IRIS assessments that will strengthen the agency\u2019s ability  to address its mission for protecting human health and the environment.  However, as we state in our report, prior to releasing results from the  initial program and regional office survey, EPA leadership in ORD made a  second request for a prioritized list of chemical assessments. According  to officials from the IRIS office, who were queried for advice, the second  request was made verbally at a meeting and did not provide the offices  with information on the basis for selecting priorities or the reason for  limiting the number of assessments to three or four chemicals. In addition,  the ultimate priority list EPA issued in December 2018 reflected the  priorities of two program offices and did not provide evidence that other  EPA program offices had no interest in IRIS assessments. Because EPA  did not identify the basis for program offices to select priorities or the  reason for limiting the number of chemicals to assess, the process was  not transparent, leaving room for uncertainty.", "EPA also provided additional technical comments, which we have  incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  and other interested parties.
