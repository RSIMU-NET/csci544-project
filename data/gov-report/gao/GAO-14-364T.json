GAO's past work identified a variety of fiscal exposures\u2014responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either legally commit the federal government to future spending or create the expectation for future spending in response to extreme weather events. This testimony is based on reports GAO issued from March 2007 to November 2013 that address these issues.", "GAO is not making new recommendations but made numerous recommendations in prior reports on these topics, which are in varying states of implementation by the Executive Office of the President and relevant federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has opportunities to limit its exposure and increase the nation's resilience to extreme weather events. Since 1980, the U.S. has experienced 151 weather disasters with damages exceeding 1 billion dollars each. This testimony focuses on 4 areas where the government could limit its fiscal exposure.", "Property and crop insurance . The financial risks from two federal insurance programs\u2014the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)\u2014create a significant fiscal exposure. In 2012, the NFIP had property coverage of over $1.2 trillion and the FCIC had crop coverage of almost $120 billion. As of December 2013, FEMA's debt from flood insurance payments totaled about $24 billion. For various reasons, FCIC's costs more than doubled from $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2012. In 2007, GAO found that the agencies responsible for these programs needed to develop information on their long-term exposure to climate change. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 requires FEMA to use information on future changes in sea levels and other factors in updating flood maps used to set insurance rates. Private insurers are also studying how to include climate change in rate setting. GAO is currently examining the extent to which private and federal insurance programs address risks from climate change.", "Disaster aid . The federal government does not fully budget for recovery activities after major disasters, thus creating a large fiscal exposure. GAO reported in 2012 that disaster declarations have increased to a record 98 in fiscal year 2011 compared with 65 in 2004. Over that period, FEMA obligated over $80 billion for disaster aid. GAO's past work recommended that FEMA address the federal fiscal exposure from disaster assistance.", "Owner and operator of infrastructure . The federal government owns and operates hundreds of thousands of facilities that a changing climate could affect. For example, in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DOD) recognized the risk to its facilities posed by climate change, noting that the department must assess the potential impacts and adapt. GAO plans to report later this year on DOD's management of climate change risks at over 500,000 defense facilities.", "Provider of technical assistance to state and local governments . The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in infrastructure projects that state and local governments prioritize, such as roads and bridges. Total public spending on transportation and water infrastructure exceeds $300 billion annually, with about 25 percent coming from the federal government and the rest from state and local governments. GAO's April 2013 report on infrastructure adaptation concluded that the federal government could help state and local efforts to increase their resilience by (1) improving access to and use of available climate-related information, (2) providing officials with improved access to local assistance, and (3) helping officials consider climate change in their planning processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to discuss our work on opportunities for the  federal government to reduce the fiscal exposure and financial risks  posed by extreme weather events. According to the United States Global  Change Research Program (USGCRP), the impacts and costliness of  weather disasters\u2014resulting from floods, drought, and other events such  as tropical cyclones\u2014are expected to increase in significance as  previously \u201crare\u201d events become more common and intense due to  anticipated changes in the global climate system. Typically, climate  change is described as average annual changes in temperature or  precipitation, and is associated with shifts in the frequency and severity of  extreme weather that can impose substantial costs on society. The 151  weather disasters since 1980 with overall damages exceeding $1 billion  each illustrate these vulnerabilities.

For example, adaptation  measures may include raising river or coastal dikes to protect  infrastructure from sea level rise, building higher bridges, and increasing  the capacity of storm water systems. As stated in a 2010 National  Research Council (NRC) report, even though uncertainties exist  regarding the exact nature and magnitude of impacts, mobilizing now to  increase the nation\u2019s resilience can be an insurance policy against  climate change risks.", "My testimony today is based on reports we issued from March 2007 to  November 2013.

In 2012, the NFIP had property coverage of over $1.2 trillion and the  FCIC had crop coverage of almost $120 billion. NFIP has been on our  High Risk List since March 2006 because of concerns about its long-term  financial solvency and related operational issues. While Congress and  FEMA intended to finance NFIP with premiums collected from  policyholders and not with tax dollars, the program was, by design, not  intended to pay for itself. As of December 2013, FEMA\u2019s debt from flood  insurance payments totaled about $24 billion\u2014up from $17.8 billion  before Superstorm Sandy\u2014and FEMA had not repaid any principal on  the loan since 2010.

While these changes may help put NFIP on a path  to financial solvency, their ultimate effect is not yet known. In addition, the  program faces challenges in making the changes. For example,  implementation of certain changes was delayed by provisions in the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, and S. 1926, which passed the  Senate on January 30, 2014, would delay the implementation of certain  rate increases contained in the Biggert-Waters Act.

Even where good scientific  information is available, it may not be in the actionable, practical form  needed for decision makers to use in planning and designing  infrastructure. Such decision makers work with traditional engineering  processes, which often require very specific and discrete information.  Moreover, local decision makers\u2014who, in this case, specialize in  infrastructure planning, not climate science\u2014need assistance from  experts who can help them translate available climate change information  into something that is locally relevant.
