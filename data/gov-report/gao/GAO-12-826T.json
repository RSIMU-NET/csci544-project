DHS currently has several plans and efforts under way to  address the high-risk designation as well as the more specific challenges  related to acquisition and program implementation that we have  previously identified. For example, DHS provided us with its Integrated  Strategy for High Risk Management in June 2012, which includes  management initiatives and corrective actions to address acquisition  management challenges, among other management areas.

In addition, we  obtained updated information in June 2012 from TSA on the status of its  efforts to implement our recommendations from these reports. For our  past work, we reviewed program schedules, planning documents, testing  reports, and other acquisition documentation. For some of the programs  we discuss in this testimony, we conducted site visits to a range of  facilities, such as national laboratories, airports, and other locations to  observe research, development, and testing efforts. We also conducted  interviews with DHS component program managers and DHS Science  and Technology Directorate officials to discuss issues related to individual  programs. More detailed information on the scope and methodology from  our previous work can be found within each specific report. In addition,  this statement contains new information we obtained from TSA in June  2012 on the status of its CAT/BPSS acquisition. We reviewed key  acquisition documents\u2014including the mission needs statement  (September 2008), request for proposal (April 2011), operational  requirements document (August 2011), life cycle cost estimate  (November 2011), and acquisition program baseline (November 2011)\u2014 interviewed officials from TSA\u2019s Office of Security Capabilities, and  viewed a demonstration of the CAT/BPSS test units. We compared the  life cycle cost estimate with best practices from our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide to determine whether the official cost estimates were  comprehensive (i.e., include all costs), accurate, well documented, and  credible. We conducted all of our work in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives.

The goal of CAT/BPSS is to  deploy a computerized system that will read and analyze data and  embedded security features on every passenger\u2019s identification and some  boarding passes, and to identify fraudulent credentials and boarding  passes. In 2011, TSA conducted qualification testing of this system at its  System Integration Facility at Washington Reagan National Airport,  including testing the systems against more than 530 genuine and  fraudulent documents, such as state-issued driver\u2019s licenses, passports,  and military identification cards, according to TSA. The technology is  designed to automatically compare a passenger\u2019s identification with a set  of embedded security features to seek to identify indicators of fraud and  concurrently ensure that the information on the identification and boarding  pass matches. This system is intended to help ensure that identity  credentials and boarding passes presented at the checkpoint have not  been tampered with or fraudulently produced, and that the information on  the boarding pass matches that of the identity credential. According to  TSA, CAT/BPSS is to compare identity credentials with an internal  database of more than 2,400 templates for various types of credentials  and to check for certain embedded security features, then alert the  operator of any discrepancies.", "In September 2011, TSA awarded contracts for approximately $3.2  million, which included the purchase of 30 units from three different  vendors. In April 2012, TSA began deploying units to three airports\u2014 George Bush Intercontinental in Houston, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International  in San Juan, and Washington Dulles International\u2014in preparation for  initial operational testing. TSA officials said that those airports were  selected, in part, because of their high passenger volume and experience  with detecting fraudulent documents. In preparation for initial testing, TSA  tested the performance of its current process for comparison purposes.  TSA is also training personnel on the CAT/BPSS systems, collecting  preliminary data on system performance and availability, and assessing  the adequacy of the concept of operations and standard operating  procedures. According to TSA officials, these efforts will allow travel  document checkers at the three airports to test the three systems in an  operational environment and provide feedback on the systems\u2019  performance. During operational testing, TSA plans to assess the  systems\u2019 performance against key performance parameters for detection,  passenger throughput, and availability. Once operational testing is  complete, TSA plans to produce a system evaluation report and  recommend whether to move forward with the acquisition or make  modifications. Vendors that successfully exit the operational testing phase  will be eligible to compete for a contract to produce 1,400 units, according  to TSA.", "According to the life cycle cost estimate for the Passenger Screening  Program, of which CAT/BPSS is a part, the estimated 20-year life cycle  cost of CAT/BPSS is approximately $130 million based on a procurement  of 4,000 units. As highlighted in our Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide, a reliable cost estimate has four characteristics\u2014it is  comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. We reviewed  TSA\u2019s November 2011 life cycle cost estimate for the Passenger  Screening Program and compared it with the four characteristics. Based  on our assessment, the life cycle cost estimate is reasonably  comprehensive and well documented. Regarding accuracy, the cost  estimate assumes a 1 percent inflation rate from fiscal years 2015  through 2029, as compared with the historic inflation rates calculated for  fiscal years 2009 through 2014, which ranged from 3.3 to 4.5 percent. If a  larger inflation rate were used, costs would be much higher than what are  currently estimated. In addition, we cannot make a determination as to  the credibility of the life cycle cost estimate as it does not include a risk  and uncertainty analysis or an independent cost estimate. The risk  assessment would quantify risks and identify effects of changing key cost  driver assumptions and factors. In the cost estimate, TSA indicates that it  is pursuing the acquisition of risk analysis capability and plans on having  such capabilities in time for the next life cycle cost estimate. Likewise,  there is no evidence that an independent cost estimate was conducted by  a group outside the acquiring organization to determine whether other  estimating methods would produce similar results. TSA officials indicated  that the agency is updating its life cycle cost estimate to include a risk and  uncertainty analysis and independent cost estimate, but the document  has not yet been approved.", "The agency plans to expand the CAT/BPSS deployment schedule  following successful implementation and testing in the selected airport  environments. As of June 2012, TSA officials estimated that this could  occur as soon as the end of this calendar year, depending on the results  of the operational testing and evaluation phase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previously Identified Challenges TSA Faces in Overseeing Acquisition of Screening Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Our past work has identified three key challenges related to TSA\u2019s efforts  to acquire and deploy technologies to address homeland security needs:  (1) developing and meeting technology program requirements, (2)  overseeing and conducting testing of new screening technologies, and (3)  developing acquisition program baselines to establish initial cost,  schedule, and performance parameters.", "We have previously reported that DHS and TSA have faced challenges in  developing and meeting program requirements when acquiring screening  technologies, and that program performance cannot be accurately  assessed without valid baseline requirements established at the program  start. In June 2010, for example, we reported that more than half of the 15  DHS programs we reviewed awarded contracts to initiate acquisition  activities without component or department approval of documents  essential to planning acquisitions, setting operational requirements, or  establishing acquisition program baselines. We made a number of  recommendations to help address issues related to these procurements.  DHS generally agreed with these recommendations and, to varying  degrees, has begun taking actions to address them. We currently have  ongoing work related to this area and we plan to report the results later  this fall.fully follow DHS acquisition policies when acquiring advanced imaging   At the program level, in May 2012, we reported that TSA did not  technology (AIT), or body scanners, which resulted in DHS approving full  AIT deployment without full knowledge of TSA\u2019s revised specifications.", "As a result, we found that TSA procured and deployed a technology that  met evolving requirements, but not the initial requirements included in its  key acquisition requirements document that the agency initially  determined were necessary to enhance the aviation system. We  recommended that TSA develop a road map that outlines vendors\u2019  progress in meeting all key performance parameters. DHS agreed with  our recommendation and has begun taking action to address it.", "We have also reported on DHS and TSA challenges in overseeing and  testing new screening technologies, which can lead to costly redesign  and rework at a later date. Addressing such problems before moving to  the acquisition phase can help agencies better manage costs. For  example, in October 2009, we reported that TSA had deployed explosives  trace portals, a technology for detecting traces of explosives on  passengers at airport checkpoints, in January 2006 even though TSA  officials were aware that tests conducted during 2004 and 2005 on earlier  models of the portals suggested the portals did not demonstrate reliable  performance in an airport environment.  In June 2006, TSA halted  deployment of the explosives trace portals because of performance  problems and high installation costs. In our 2009 report, we  recommended that, to the extent feasible, TSA ensure that tests are  completed before deploying new checkpoint screening technologies to  airports. DHS concurred with the recommendation and has taken action  to address it, such as requiring more-recent technologies to complete  both laboratory and operational tests prior to deployment.", "GAO, Aviation Security: DHS and TSA Have Researched, Developed, and Begun  Deploying Passenger Checkpoint Screening Technologies, but Continue to Face  Challenges, GAO-10-128 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 7, 2009). cost and schedule can provide useful indicators of the health of  acquisition programs. For example, we reported in April 2012 that TSA  has not had a DHS-approved acquisition program baseline since the  inception of the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) more  than 8 years ago. Further, DHS did not require TSA to complete an  acquisition program baseline until November 2008. According to TSA  officials, they have twice submitted an acquisition program baseline to  DHS for approval\u2014first in November 2009 and again in February 2011.  An approved baseline would provide DHS with additional assurances that  TSA\u2019s approach is appropriate and that the capabilities being pursued are  worth the expected costs. In November 2011, because TSA did not have  a fully developed life cycle cost estimate as part of its acquisition program  baseline for the EBSP, DHS instructed TSA to revise the life cycle cost  estimates as well as its procurement and deployment schedules to reflect  budget constraints. DHS officials told us that they could not approve the  acquisition program baseline as written because TSA\u2019s estimates were  significantly over budget. TSA officials stated that TSA is currently  working with DHS to amend the draft program baseline and plans to  resubmit the revised acquisition program baseline before the next  Acquisition Review Board meeting, which is planned for July or August  2012. Establishing and approving a program baseline, as DHS and TSA  plan to do for the EBSP, could help DHS assess the program\u2019s progress  in meeting its goals and achieve better program outcomes.", "Our prior work on TSA acquisition management identified oversight  problems that have led to cost increases, delivery delays, and other  operational challenges for certain assets, such as EBSP, but TSA has  also taken several steps to improve its acquisition management. For  example, while we continue to find that some TSA acquisition programs  do not have key documents needed for properly managing acquisitions,  CAT/BPSS has a DHS-approved mission needs statement, operational  requirements document, and acquisition program baseline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Oversight Issues", "paragraphs": ["This hearing provides an opportunity for congressional stakeholders to  focus a dialogue on how to continue a sufficient level of oversight of the  CAT/BPSS acquisition and implementation and other key components of  the Passenger Screening Program.
