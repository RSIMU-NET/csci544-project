Under the demonstration project, DOL's process for investigating USERRA claims remains unchanged: DOL uses a nationwide network of over a hundred investigators from offices in every state. Under the demonstration project, OSC has instituted a centralized approach for investigating USERRA claims, with a single office of about half a dozen investigators and attorneys in its Washington, D.C., headquarters. Data for reporting outcomes were not reliable at either agency. At DOL, inaccurate data were included in the agency's annual report to Congress, which could adversely affect Congress's ability to assess how well federal USERRA claims are processed and whether changes are needed in the future. GAO also found that DOL did not consistently notify claimants concerning the right to have their claims referred to OSC for further investigation or to bring their claims directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Citing GAO's preliminary findings, in December 2006, DOL officials required each region to revise its guidance regarding notifying claimants in the closure letter of their rights. GAO found that for the period of its review--February 8, 2005, through September 30, 2006--DOL received a total of 166 unique claims, although 202 claims were recorded as opened in DOL's database. Duplicate, reopened, and transferred claims accounted for most of this difference. During a review of a random sample of DOL's case files to assess the reliability of DOL's data, GAO found the closed dates in DOL's database, which it uses to report to Congress on the number and percentage of claims it closes within 90, 120, and 365 days, were not reliable. From the start of the demonstration project, through September 30, 2006, OSC received 269 claims and took an average of 115 days to process these claims. The closed dates in OSC's case tracking system were sufficiently reliable. Three primary changes have occurred in federal employees' USERRA claims' processing since the demonstration project. First, two agencies now investigate claims from federal employees using two different models for investigations. Second, both DOL and OSC officials said cooperation and communication between the two agencies on claims has increased under the demonstration project, in turn raising awareness of issues related to servicemembers who are federal employees. Finally, technological enhancements have occurred, including an enhancement to DOL's database enabling the electronic transfer of information between agencies, which began in October 2006."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of  1994 (USERRA) protects the employment and reemployment rights of  federal and nonfederal employees who leave their employment to perform  military or other uniformed service.

USERRA further  prohibits employer retaliation against any individual who engages in  protected activity under USERRA, regardless of whether the individual has  performed service in the uniformed services.

If DOL\u2019s VETS cannot resolve the claim,  DOL is to inform claimants that they may request to have their claims  referred to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent  investigative and prosecutorial agency with the primary mission of  protecting the employment rights of federal employees and applicants for  federal employment.

Claims by individuals whose social  security numbers end in even numbers are to be investigated by VETS,  with the referral process to OSC for these claims remaining unchanged.  Under the demonstration project, OSC is also authorized to handle any  USERRA claim brought by the USERRA claimant where OSC has authority  to handle a related prohibited personnel practice claim.

VETS investigators also have responsibilities concerning a federal law  requiring that preference be given to veterans in federal hiring and  retention during reductions in force.

The  difference of 36 claims was a result of  reopened claims for the same claimant being recorded as separate  claims,   duplicate filings (i.e., filed by the same claimant within 3 days and then    claims transferred to OSC after being opened in VETS\u2019s database (i.e.,  those with odd social security numbers and allegations of prohibited  personnel practices),    claims originally opened prior to the demonstration project, and    one veterans\u2019 preference claim erroneously opened as a USERRA  claim.", "Of the 166 unique claims investigated by VETS from the start of the  demonstration project through September 30, 2006, it closed 155, or 93  percent of them. The remaining 11 claims were still being investigated as  of September 30, 2006.", "Because of our finding concerning the accuracy of the number of unique  claims in VETS\u2019s database during the demonstration project, we reviewed  the data DOL reported in its most recent USERRA annual report to  Congress for fiscal year 2005. We found that DOL overstated the number  of claims filed against federal executive branch agencies because it did not  account for duplicate, reopened, transferred, and erroneously opened  cases, resulting in an inaccurate number of investigations opened and  closed. Specifically, DOL reported that it opened 146 claims involving  federal employers, reflecting the number of claims in VETS\u2019s database for  fiscal year 2005. Our analysis, however, showed that of the reported 146  claims, 117 were claims actually investigated by VETS in fiscal year 2005.", "Additionally, during our review of a random sample of 54 VETS case files  to assess the reliability of VETS\u2019s data, we found the closed dates in  VETS\u2019s database did not match the date contained in the closure letter to  the claimant in 22 of 52 claims reviewed. According to VETS officials, the  date closed in VETS\u2019s database should agree with the date of the closure  letter, or if VETS requests additional information, the date by which the  claimant needed to provide the information to avoid, for example, a  determination of \u201cno merit.\u201d For those claims where there was not a  match, the difference in the number of days between the actual closed  date in the closure letter and in VETS\u2019s database averaged 67 days.  Moreover, in nearly all claims where the closed dates in VETS\u2019s database  did not match the date in the closure letter, the closed date in VETS\u2019s  database preceded the date in the letter. VETS\u2019s USERRA Operations  Manual is silent on the date to be used for the official closure of an  investigation in VETS\u2019s database, which could have contributed to some of  the inaccuracies we found in closed dates.", "Because DOL reports annually to Congress on the number and percentage  of claims it closed within 90, 120, and 365 days, such inaccuracies in the  number of claims reported and the closed dates also affect the quality of  information reported to Congress on the time it takes VETS to process  claims. VETS senior officials indicated that they had identified problems  similar to those we found in a particular region concerning inaccurate  closed dates. Citing our preliminary findings, in December 2006, one  region issued a memorandum instructing investigators to make the closed  date in VETS\u2019s database match the date of the closure letter to the  claimant.", "Because the closed dates entered in VETS\u2019s database were not sufficiently  reliable, we could not use the dates for the time VETS spent on  investigations in the database to accurately determine DOL\u2019s average  processing time. Instead, we used the correct closed dates from the case  files in our random sample and statistically estimated the average  processing time for VETS\u2019s investigations from the start of the  demonstration project through July 21, 2006\u2014the period of our sample.  Based on the random sample, there is at least a 95 percent chance that  VETS\u2019s average processing time for investigations ranged from 53 to 86  days.", "Additionally, during our review of case files, we found that the closed  code, which VETS uses to describe the outcomes of USERRA claims (i.e.,  claim granted, claim settled, no merit, withdrawn) was not sufficiently  reliable for reporting specific outcomes of claims.

For the 54 claims in our sample of VETS\u2019s case files, we  found that in the 28 claims VETS was not successful in resolving (i.e.,  claims not granted or settled), VETS failed to notify claimants of the right  to referral in the closure letter in half of these claims. VETS correctly  notified five claimants and notified others of only some of their options.  In addition, VETS incorrectly advised some servicemembers of a right  applicable only to nonfederal claimants\u2014to have their claims referred to  the Department of Justice or to bring their claims directly to federal  district court. Table 1 shows the extent to which claimants were notified  in the closure letter of their right to have their unsuccessful claims  referred.", "Two possible reasons for VETS\u2019s failure to notify servicemembers in  writing of their rights include VETS\u2019s lack of an internal review process  and the inconsistent guidance provided to investigators in its USERRA  Operations Manual.

For example, one  chapter instructs investigators to notify the claimants of their right to  referral if there is no voluntary compliance by the employer, regardless of  whether claim has merit, but in another instructs investigators to advise  claimants of their right only if the claimant does not concur with the  determination. Further, the sample closure letters to claimants contained  in the manual are not consistent regarding notifying claimants; those that  contain a notification advise claimants of a right to request referral to the  U.S. Attorney General, a right applicable to nonfederal claimants.  Additionally, VETS\u2019s USERRA Operations Manual does not instruct  investigators to notify claimants of their right to bring their claims directly  to MSPB. VETS senior officials indicated that they had identified problems  similar to those we found in a particular region concerning the lack of  consistent notification of the right to referral.

Citing our preliminary  findings, VETS officials required each region to revise its guidance  concerning the notification of rights. One region issued a memorandum  providing specific additional guidance to investigators to notify claimants  in the closure letter of their right to a referral or to bring their claims  directly to MSPB and provided revised sample closure letters for federal  and nonfederal USERRA claims, which other regions were to use as a  model.

Officials from each of the USERRA coordinating  agencies are also able to see such claim information as whether a case is  open or closed, which agency is currently addressing it, and how long it  took to resolve. As such, the database enhancement grants OSC limited  access to demonstration project data in VETS\u2019s database, including the  ability to view summary data for federal employer cases opened by VETS  during the demonstration project period (e.g., case numbers, employer,  open and closed dates, and issues concerning a case) and allows OSC to  enter case data for demonstration project cases OSC has opened since  October 1, 2006.  According to OSC\u2019s USERRA Unit Chief, to the extent  consistent with the consent provided by claimants, he has been entering  information on demonstration project claims into VETS\u2019s database.  Officials from each coordinating agency are able to produce a report  containing aggregate data on the claims over which they have jurisdiction.  For investigations opened by VETS, only VETS has visibility over a claim\u2019s  history, from its submission to VETS until it is resolved. The other  coordinating agencies have visibility over only those claims that were  opened by or referred to them. According to VETS officials, when the  enhancement was being developed, the Office of the Solicitor determined  that because of the sensitive nature of the information that the enhanced  VETS\u2019s database may contain, except for VETS, full access to all data  fields for a claim would be limited to those cases within each agency\u2019s  jurisdiction.", "Another technological enhancement by VETS is the implementation of  electronic filing. A VETS official told us that from July 18, 2005, the date  on which electronic filing of USERRA claims at VETS became available,  through September 30, 2006, about 39 percent of USERRA claims from  servicemembers employed by federal executive branch agencies were filed  with VETS electronically. As we said earlier, electronic filing of claims  directly enters the information into VETS\u2019s E-filing database first and then  into VETS\u2019s database, records the date the claim was received, and sends  an automatic response to the claimant. This eliminates the need for initial  data entry by staff and avoids the introduction of error when staff  manually enter data. Also, when a claimant files electronically, VETS\u2019s  database sends an automatic message to OSC to determine whether any  prohibited personnel practice cases have been filed by the claimant.", "In addition, according to OSC, although VBIA did not require that OSC  modify its existing system, OSC enhanced its case tracking system to  maintain demonstration project data that would be useful in tracking  USERRA claims.

Based on the random sample, we are 95 percent confident that  VETS\u2019s average processing time for conducting investigations was  between 53 and 86 days. Because our sample contained only one case that  received the two additional reviews at DOL after the VETS investigation  was closed, (i.e., by a VETS\u2019s regional office and the Office of the  Solicitor) before being referred to OSC, we could not reliably use this  same process to estimate the average processing time for all of DOL\u2019s  USERRA claims\u2019 processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL\u2019s Referrals to OSC", "paragraphs": ["We separately reviewed those claims that VETS investigated but could not  resolve and for which claimants requested referral of their claims to OSC.  From February 8, 2005, through September 30, 2006, for 16 claims in the  VETS\u2019s database, claimants asked VETS for referral to OSC. Of those 16  claims, 5 were reopened (i.e., claims brought by the same claimant), which  we combined with their original claims, and 5 were still being reviewed at  DOL. The other 6 claims had not been reopened. Thus, 11 unique claims  were to be referred to OSC. Of the 11 unique claims, 6 had been reviewed  by both a VETS regional office and the Office of the Solicitor as of  September 30, 2006 (3 of the reopened claims and 3 of the others). To  calculate the average processing time for DOL to process claims that were  referred through DOL to OSC using actual dates, we used the average  processing time of these 6 claims. We based this average on the number of  days that it took DOL to process a claim from the date that VETS opened  the investigation through the date that the Office of the Solicitor  completed its review and made a recommendation to OSC. Because we  found the closed dates of VETS investigations entered in VETS\u2019s database  were not sufficiently reliable for our purposes, we could not determine  how long it took the VETS regional office and the Office of the Solicitor to  process referrals following VETS investigations.", "For each of the three claims that were reopened, there were two open  dates. Because we determined that the closed dates in VETS\u2019s database  were unreliable, we could not accurately account for the time these claims  had been closed before they were reopened. To compensate for this, we  calculated the processing time for these three reopened claims in two  ways: (1) using the open date of the first claim and (2) using the open date  of the reopened, or second claim, in VETS\u2019s database. We then calculated  two averages using each of the processing time calculations for the three  claims. For the remaining three claims that were referred but not closed  and reopened, there was only one open date to use in calculating  processing time, which was used in both calculations of average  processing time for the six referrals. The difference in the average  processing time between these two calculations was about 31 days.
