Disagreements about tier rankings between the Trafficking Office and other parts of State, which have different priorities, are usually resolved at the working level, according to officials, with only a few elevated to the Secretary of State for resolution. The Secretary of State determines all final tier rankings. The Trafficking Office recommends whether to grant waivers for countries that otherwise would be automatically downgraded to the lowest tier. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) requires State to post a detailed description of the credible evidence used to support these waivers on its website annually, but State did not do so for the 2014 through 2016 reports until September 2016.", "State has made improvements to the Trafficking in Persons Report since 2006 but does not explicitly explain the basis for certain countries' tier rankings or, where relevant, why countries' tier rankings changed. GAO's analysis of the 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report found that, compared with GAO's previous report in 2006, there were fewer instances in which minimum standards and criteria were not mentioned in the narratives. However, most narratives for the highest-ranked, or Tier 1, countries in the 2015 and 2016 reports did not explicitly explain the basis for the tier rankings. The narratives sometimes included language that seemed contradictory to certain standards and criteria. In addition, GAO found that, for countries that changed tier from one year to the next, most narratives did not provide an explicit explanation as to why the rankings changed.

In addition to inflicting grave personal damage upon its victims,  trafficking undermines government authority, fuels organized criminal  groups and gangs, and imposes social and public health costs. In 2000,  Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) to  combat trafficking in persons. Congress reauthorized this act four times,  most recently in 2013. This act, as amended, requires, among other  things, that the Secretary of State report to Congress annually on foreign  governments\u2019 antitrafficking efforts according to the act\u2019s minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking. By statute, the report should  include lists of those countries arranged by the range of their  governments\u2019 compliance with the U.S. minimum standards.

We reviewed  185 country narratives in the 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report, as well  as 35 country narratives in the 2016 report for countries with the highest  ranking. We systematically compared the country narratives with the  minimum standards (as interpreted and applied by State) and determined  whether the narratives clearly explained State\u2019s assessment regarding  governments\u2019 compliance with them. We did not assess whether State  had placed countries in the appropriate tier. Each country narrative was  assessed independently by two analysts, using a detailed rules document  developed using State\u2019s guidelines and through discussions with State.  We also analyzed the narratives for the countries that changed tiers in the  2015 and 2016 Trafficking in Persons reports to assess whether the  narratives clearly explain why State decided to change a country\u2019s tier  ranking.

Many forms of trafficking\u2014including  sex trafficking and labor trafficking\u2014can take place anywhere in the world  and can occur without crossing country boundaries. As discussed in the  Trafficking in Persons Report, trafficking victims include Asian and African  women and men who migrate to the Persian Gulf region for domestic  labor but then suffer both labor trafficking and sexual abuse in the homes  of their employers. Some victims are children; for example, Pakistani  children as young as 5 are sold or kidnapped into forced labor to work in  brick kilns, some of which are owned by government officials. Other  victims are subjected to sexual exploitation; in some cases, women and  girls have been bought and sold as sex slaves by members of the Islamic  State; in others, adult men and women are forced to engage in  commercial sex, and children are induced to do the same. Individuals,  including men, are exploited in forced labor in a variety of sectors;  Burmese men, for example, have been subjected to forced labor 20 hours  a day, 7 days a week on fishing boats in Thailand.", "Reliable data on the scope of trafficking are limited due to a number of  factors. Trafficking is a clandestine activity, which limits the data  available on victims. Victims may live daily under inhumane treatment,  physical and mental abuse, and threats to themselves or their families.  Because of their vulnerable position, trafficking victims may be unwilling  or unable to report to, or seek help from, relevant authorities. They may  distrust the government and police because they are afraid of being  deported or because they come from countries where law enforcement is  corrupt and feared, or their traffickers made such threats to discourage  their reporting to law enforcement. Further, some governments do not  systematically collect data on victims or do not recognize some types of  trafficking, such as forced labor or the trafficking of men.", "In 2000, Congress enacted the TVPA and reauthorized it four times, most  recently in 2013. The act, as amended, defines severe forms of  trafficking in persons as (1) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act  is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to  perform such act is under age 18; or (2) the recruitment, harboring,  transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services,  through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection  to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. The TVPA  does not specify movement across international boundaries as a  condition of trafficking nor does it require the transportation of victims  from one locale to another. According to State officials, the TVPA  definition of trafficking is largely consistent with the definition set forth in  the UN Protocol on trafficking in persons.", "The TVPA, as amended, provides a framework for current U.S.  antitrafficking efforts, including the criteria for the Trafficking in Persons  Report. According to State officials, it is also consistent with the UN  Protocol on trafficking in persons in approaching this crime within a  framework known as the \u201cthree p\u2019s\u201d: prosecution, protection and  prevention. These include the prosecution and punishment of traffickers,  the protection of and assistance for victims of trafficking, and the  prevention of trafficking. The TVPA, as amended, also laid out minimum  standards for eliminating trafficking to be used in the Secretary of State\u2019s  annual assessment of foreign governments\u2019 antitrafficking efforts (see  app. II). The first three standards deal with countries\u2019 efforts to enact  laws to prohibit severe forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties for  trafficking. The fourth standard, as detailed by State, relates to  government efforts to implement those laws and includes 12 criteria that can be used to assess these efforts. For example, criteria for the fourth  minimum standard include whether a country\u2019s government has achieved  appreciable progress in eliminating trafficking\u2014including prosecuting  traffickers, protecting victims, and preventing trafficking\u2014compared to  efforts from the previous year and whether a country\u2019s government has  taken steps to protect and provide assistance, such as counseling and  shelter, to victims.", "The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (Trafficking  Office) was established in accordance with the TVPA of 2000. The office  is headed by an ambassador-at-large and is organized into four sections:  Reports and Political Affairs, International  Programs, Public Engagement,  and Resource Management and Planning. The Reports and Political  Affairs section prepares the congressionally mandated Trafficking in  Persons Report annually.

The Secretary of State is  authorized to waive the automatic downgrade if the Secretary determines  that a government has devoted sufficient resources (such as funding,  staffing, or in-kind or other resources) to a written plan that, if  implemented, would constitute making significant efforts to meet the  minimum standards and reports credible evidence of such to specified  congressional committees. Countries may receive such a waiver for two  consecutive years, after which time a country must either go up to Tier 2  or down to Tier 3.", "The TVPA, as amended, also established funding restrictions, such as  withholding nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance, that could be  applied against governments that are not in compliance with the minimum  standards and not making significant efforts to come into compliance (i.e.,  countries in Tier 3).

The guidelines include descriptions of the actions a government should  take to meet the various standards and applicable criteria. For example,  to determine whether a foreign government satisfies the minimum  standard for prescribing punishment for traffickers that is sufficiently  stringent, the guidance states that the country should include criminal  penalties to include a maximum sentence of at least 4 years deprivation  of liberty, or a more severe penalty.", "The Trafficking Office also gives similar guidance to its analysts to use in  preparing the Trafficking in Persons Report.

For example,  using the guidance, an analyst may write \u201cCountry X prohibits all forms of  trafficking and prescribes penalties that are sufficiently stringent and  commensurate with other serious crimes, such as rape.\u201d The guidance  also establishes standard language for certain criteria for the fourth  minimum standard on governments\u2019 efforts to implement its trafficking  laws, such as training diplomatic personnel, addressing official complicity  in participating in or facilitating trafficking, or not penalizing victims for  acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. For example, the  standard language for official complicity, in cases where a government  reported no efforts to combat official complicity in human trafficking and  where no complicity is documented or known, is \u201cThe government did not  report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government  employees complicit in human trafficking offenses.\u201d Additionally,  the  guidance document establishes standard language for some countries  downgraded from Tier 2 Watch List to Tier 3; for example, \u201cThe  government of X does not fully comply with the minimum standards for  the elimination of trafficking.

In some cases, the relatively short time the regional bureaus  have from when they get the drafts to when they have the report  consultations (around a week, in some cases) can make it difficult to gather more information from regional bureaus and U.S. missions to  make updates or corrections or to support resolution of tier ranking  disagreements. According to State, late submission of information by  governments or delays in providing edits on a draft can present similar  challenges. However, one regional bureau official noted that the  Trafficking Office generally sends the more controversial country  narratives earlier, giving the bureau more time to review them.

We examined the summary  paragraphs to determine whether they provided clear explanations as to  why countries were upgraded or downgraded in their tier ranking. The  only country narratives with an explicit explanation were for those  countries subject to the TVPA automatic downgrade provision. As  discussed earlier in this report, the TVPA, as amended, requires that  countries be automatically downgraded to Tier 3 after 2 consecutive years  on Tier 2 Watch List unless the country is granted a waiver based on  credible evidence that a waiver is justified because the government has a  written plan that, if implemented, would constitute making significant  efforts to comply with the TVPA minimum standards and is devoting  sufficient resources to implement the plan. The waiver can be issued for 2  consecutive years, bringing the total length of time a country can remain  on Tier 2 Watch List to 4 consecutive years.

Other narratives provided some  information for at least one of the three categories (prosecution,  protection, and prevention) that could help explain State\u2019s decision to  change the tier. For example, the most commonly cited negative finding  for countries that were downgraded was that the government did not  prosecute or convict any traffickers during the reporting period or that  such law enforcement efforts had decreased when compared with the  previous reporting period.

We interviewed officials from State\u2019s  Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (Trafficking Office)  and from all of State\u2019s regional bureaus: the bureaus of African Affairs,  East Asian and Pacific Affairs, European and Eurasian Affairs, Near  Eastern Affairs, South and Central Asian Affairs, and Western  Hemisphere Affairs. In addition, we interviewed State functional offices  and bureaus that have some involvement in the Trafficking in Persons  Report. These include the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs; the  Bureau of Political-Military  Affairs; the Office of Foreign Assistance; the  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; and the Bureau of  Population, Refugees, and Migration.  We also selected countries in each  of the tiers that had changed tier in 2015 and interviewed the relevant  officials from each of the U.S. missions and the corresponding country  desk officers. We selected 3 countries that were upgraded to a higher tier  (Portugal, Rwanda, and Uzbekistan) and 2 that were downgraded to a  lower tier (Slovenia and Belize). As much as possible, we selected  countries of different sizes and from different geographic regions. We also  interviewed officials from agencies that have some involvement in the  report process: the Departments of Defense (DOD) and the Treasury  (Treasury), and the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID).  In addition, we held a roundtable discussion with officials from 13  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), organized by an umbrella group  of NGOs focused on trafficking in persons. We did not select a  generalizable sample of officials to interview.", "To assess the process State uses to prepare country narratives and  decide tier rankings, we reviewed the TVPA, as amended; the Trafficking  in Persons Report; and State report preparation guidance documents. We also interviewed cognizant officials from State, DOD, Treasury, and  USAID, as well as from NGOs about the process, including how State  gathers information for the report and how decisions are made on waivers  to avoid automatic downgrades as well as waivers of funding restrictions  for countries in Tier 3.", "To assess the extent to which the country narratives in the Trafficking in  Persons Report clearly discuss the minimum standards to combat  trafficking as enumerated in the TVPA and interpreted by State, we  reviewed 185 country narratives in the 2015 Trafficking in Persons  Report. We also reviewed the 35 Tier 1 country narratives in the 2016  Trafficking in Persons Report. We systematically compared the country  narratives with the minimum standards (as interpreted and applied by  State) and determined whether the narratives clearly explain State\u2019s  assessment of the degree of governments\u2019 compliance with them. We  used the following coding system when assessing the country narratives  against State\u2019s interpretation of the minimum standards:  If the country narrative did not mention a standard or criterion, we  coded that as \u201cnot mentioned.\u201d", "If the country narrative did mention a standard or criterion, we  determined whether the narrative clearly described that the  government complied or did not comply with the standard or criterion  (as interpreted and applied by State).", "If we determined that the narrative included language that seemed  consistent with the standard or criterion, we coded that as \u201cmet.\u201d", "If we determined that the narrative included language that seemed  contradictory to the standard or criterion, we coded that as \u201cnot  met.\u201d", "In some cases, the narratives mentioned a standard or criterion,  but included ambiguous language that made it unclear if the  standard or criterion were met. We coded those cases as \u201ccannot  determine.\u201d", "In addition, for criterion 11 of minimum standard four, we examined the  first sentence of each of the prosecution, protection, and prevention  sections of the country narratives to determine whether they clearly  described that the government made appreciable progress in combating  trafficking when compared with the previous year\u2019s assessment.  Trafficking Office analysts said that governments should show overall  increasing efforts across the prosecution, protection, and prevention  categories to meet this criterion but that increasing efforts in each of  these categories is not necessarily required. We used the following  coding system when assessing the opening sentences:  If the sentence noted that the government made progress, or made  strong, improved, or increased efforts (or other similar words), we  coded that as \u201cmet.\u201d We then reported these as country narratives  that generally described increasing efforts.", "If the sentence noted that the government made no efforts or  progress, or made decreased or inadequate efforts, we coded that as  \u201cnot met.\u201d We also coded as \u201cnot met\u201d efforts described as weak or  negligible (or other similar words). We then reported these as country  narratives that generally described decreasing or inadequate efforts.", "If the sentence noted that the government sustained, maintained, or  continued its efforts, we coded that as \u201ccannot determine.\u201d We also  coded mixed efforts, or efforts described using words such as modest,  uneven, limited, or minimal as \u201ccannot determine.\u201d We then reported  these as country narratives that generally described mixed or  sustained efforts.", "We did not assess whether State had placed countries in the appropriate  tier. Each country narrative was assessed independently by two analysts,  using a detailed rules document developed from State\u2019s guidelines and  through discussions with State. We also analyzed the narratives for the  82 countries that changed tiers in the 2015 and 2016 Trafficking in  Persons reports to assess whether the narratives clearly explain why  State changed a country\u2019s tier.", "To assess the extent to which State assesses the effectiveness of the  Trafficking in Persons Report as a diplomatic tool to encourage countries  to address human trafficking, we interviewed officials from State, DOD,  the Treasury, USAID, and representatives of NGOs about the credibility  and effectiveness of the report and how it is used. We also reviewed  documents related to funding restrictions and waivers of funding  restrictions for countries in Tier 3.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to December  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  Department of State (State) interprets this to require that evidence of  trafficking investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences be  considered in State\u2019s assessment of whether governments are making  serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking. Our  analysis of the 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report found that the country  narratives generally mentioned such data, trends compared to previous  years, as well as details on the legal basis of law enforcement action and  the sufficiency of those laws and their implementation. However, it is  unclear what the data may mean relative to other factors, such as a  government\u2019s capacity or resources to address trafficking, the importance  of cases, or the significance of the data relative to the magnitude of the  trafficking problem in that county.", "State bureau officials noted that law enforcement data could be difficult to  interpret, unreliable, or may not provide a useful description of the  situation in the country. For example:  (1) Data may be difficult to interpret. Officials said data on prosecutions  and convictions may not accurately reflect the level of law  enforcement efforts. For example, it may be unclear whether  increased prosecutions and convictions means the trafficking situation  in the country is getting worse or that the government is doing a better  job of enforcing its anti-trafficking laws.  (2) Data may be unreliable. According to officials, it is unclear if the data  are accurate or reliable. For example, the data may not be public, and  countries may lack centralized systems, according to officials. Officials  also noted that an emphasis on increased prosecutions and  convictions might lead to a country arresting innocent people to  increase its numbers.  (3) Data may not provide a useful description of the situation. Officials  said that an emphasis on increased law enforcement numbers may  not accurately reflect a country\u2019s successes or tell the whole story. For  example, a country might have increased its law enforcement efforts  in ways that did not result in increased prosecutions. Further, a  country might be penalized for not having convictions when the cases being prosecuted are taking time to work through the judicial system,  or for not reporting data when lacking the systems needed to do so.", "State\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (Trafficking  Office) acknowledges that there are limitations to the law enforcement  data, but maintains that the data are a strength of the report. For  example, State can use the numbers on investigations, prosecutions, and  convictions, when they are too low relative to the trafficking problem,  according to the Trafficking Office, to push governments to do more. The  Trafficking Office also noted that it uses the same methodology every  year so the data are comparable from one year to the next, and that it  does not accept a government\u2019s data without efforts to verify the data, or  noting in the report when there are issues with the data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leslie Holen (Assistant Director),  Christina Werth, Julia Jebo Grant, and Esther Toledo made key  contributions to this report.
