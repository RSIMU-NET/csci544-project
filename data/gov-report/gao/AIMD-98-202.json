We met with officials from DISA and OASD/C3I to assess Defense\u2019s progress in developing a comprehensive inventory of telecommunications equipment and services. We met with representatives of the Joint Staff for Command, Control, Communication and Computers (J-6); the Department of Defense\u2019s Office of Inspector General; the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the Defense Commissary Agency to assess component efforts to develop inventories. When we learned that no comprehensive inventories of networks exist at the department or component level, we sent a questionnaire to the four military services requesting that, for every non-DISN long-haul network, they report: the name of the network; functional description; types of telecommunications services supported; estimated annual costs; whether the network was planned or operational, and if planned, its status, life-cycle costs, and whether it was scheduled to be replaced by DISN, and when. We did not independently verify the information provided by the Services. However, we consulted with them to confirm our understanding of their responses and to discuss and ask questions we had about information they provided. Appendix I details the results of our survey.", "To assess progress in reporting on telecommunications services acquired, trends, and costs, we reviewed applicable Defense directives, instructions, and memorandums and discussed Defense\u2019s implementation of these requirements with officials from ASD/C3I and DISA. We analyzed information on costs maintained by DISA and reviewed a recent contractor evaluation of DISA business processes.", "To assess Defense\u2019s progress in enforcing its policy mandate that Defense components acquire services from common-user networks, we reviewed applicable Defense directives, instructions, and memorandums and met with officials from ASD/C3I, DISA, and the Defense components. During these interviews we asked for documentation showing that existing policies on telecommunications management and the use of common-user networks were being implemented and enforced. We obtained and analyzed network plans, requirements, and other acquisition documentation to determine if Defense components were complying with telecommunications management policies.", "To assess Defense\u2019s progress in developing a waiver process to grant exceptions from using common-user networks, we reviewed applicable Defense directives, instructions, and memorandums. We met with officials from ASD/C3I and DISA to discuss their plans to implement an interim waiver process and to develop a strategy detailing how and when independent networks will be replaced by their common-user counterparts. Because the interim process began during our review, we met again with DISA officials in April 1998 to assess the agency\u2019s progress to date in granting waivers.", "To assess Defense\u2019s progress in developing performance measures for DISN, we met with officials from DISA and reviewed DISA\u2019s draft documentation on the issue, which consisted of draft performance measures for information technology acquisitions.

As a result, Defense components operate many stovepiped telecommunications systems that are not interoperable and cannot share information across functional and organizational boundaries. For example, between 1988 and 1992 Defense reported several interoperability problems including some arising during the Persian Gulf War. Defense components were unable to use their telecommunications networks and information systems to coordinate the issuance of air tasking orders, the use of air space, and the use of fire support for joint operations.", "To improve the interoperability of its military communications services as well as to reduce costs associated with operating redundant systems, Defense began in 1991 to plan and implement DISN to serve as the department\u2019s primary worldwide telecommunications and information transfer network. The DISN strategy focuses on replacing older data communications systems, using emerging technologies and cost-effective acquisition strategies that provide secure and interoperable voice, data, video, and imagery communications services. Under the DISN program, the military services and Defense agencies are still responsible for acquiring telecommunications services for their local bases and installations as well as deployed communications networks. DISA is responsible for acquiring the long-haul services that will interconnect these base-level and deployed networks within and between the continental United States, Europe, and the Pacific.", "Defense issued a number of policies and directives in 1991 aimed at ensuring that the department could identify and replace redundant networks with DISN and manage DISN efficiently and effectively. These policies directed components to develop comprehensive inventories of their telecommunications equipment and services, and DISA to develop a comprehensive Defense-wide inventory; directed DISA to report annually on telecommunications equipment acquisitions, trends, and associated costs; mandated the use of common-user networks; and directed DISA to develop a waiver process to grant exceptions from using common-user networks when these networks could not satisfy Defense components\u2019 requirements.", "In a previous review of the DISN program, we found that Defense was not doing enough to ensure that the program would be managed efficiently and effectively. Specifically, the department lacked performance measures that would help Defense track whether DISA was meeting its objectives, efficiently allocating resources, and learning from mistakes. In response, Defense agreed to establish measures for the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Does Not Know How Many Independent Networks It Is Operating", "paragraphs": ["In order for the DISN program to work, Defense needs to know how many networks are operating in the department and what functions they support. This is the foundation for identifying redundant and stovepiped networks and ensuring that they are replaced by DISN. However, Defense lacks the basic information necessary to determine how many networks are operating in the department, what functions they support, or what they cost. In order to estimate the number and cost of networks that are operating outside of DISN, we conducted our own survey, which identified 87 such networks operated by the military services alone. DISA initiated a similar data call to the military services and Defense agencies after we began our survey and identified 153 networks planned or operating throughout Defense. The results of our survey are presented in appendix I and summarized in table 1.", "To manage telecommunications cost effectively, Defense must know what networks are operating in the department. In 1991, Defense directed DISA to establish a central inventory of all long-haul telecommunications equipment and services in Defense, and directed the heads of Defense components to do likewise. However, the central inventory was never established and DISA staff are still discovering new networks as they process new telecommunications service requests from Defense components.", "Defense components have also failed to develop inventories of their own networks. During our initial meetings, Army, Navy, and Air Force officials stated that they could not readily identify all of their networks or describe what their functions are because they do not centrally manage their telecommunications resources. Our experience with the Navy illustrates the depth of this problem. The Navy\u2019s initial response to our survey only identified three independent long-haul networks. Other Navy networks known to exist, such as the Naval Aviation Systems Team Wide Area Network (NAVWAN), were not reported in the survey. Navy\u2019s headquarters telecommunication staff acknowledged that they were unable to identify all of the Navy\u2019s long-haul networks.", "Careful analysis is needed to determine whether any of the independent networks identified in our survey can or should be replaced by DISN common user services. However, on the basis of our interviews with the military services and our survey results, we were able to determine that overlaps exist between telecommunications services offered by independent networks and services offered by DISN. For example:", "NAVWAN offers its users data communications services using Internet Protocol (IP); similar services are provided by DISA on DISN\u2019s Unclassified but Sensitive (N-Level) IP Router Network (NIPRNET).", "The Army\u2019s Installation Transition Processing (ITP) Network also offers IP router services similar to those provided by DISN\u2019s NIPRNET.", "The Navy Sea Systems Command\u2019s Enterprisewide Network (NEWNET, now known as Smart Link) relies on asynchronous transfer mode-based data communications services; similar services are now offered by DISA on a limited basis.", "The Army\u2019s planned Regional Transition Network (ARTNET, now known as the Circuit Bundling Initiative) also relies on asynchronous transfer mode-based data services, similar to services offered by DISA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DISA Does Not Have Data to Develop Required Reports on Telecommunications Acquisitions, Trends, and Costs", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that a common-user network is efficiently and effectively managed, it is essential to closely monitor its acquisitions of telecommunications services, costs, and trends in usage, that is, the volumes and types of traffic it carries. This monitoring helps an agency ensure that the network is properly sized (i.e., neither oversized nor undersized) and offers cost-effective services. Since 1991, DISA has been required to report annually on telecommunications services acquired, trends (volumes and types of traffic), and associated costs throughout Defense. However, it has not done so, and it lacks the data needed to begin developing such reports.", "For example, as noted previously, DISA lacks a comprehensive inventory of telecommunications equipment and services across the department. Therefore, it cannot effectively report annually on acquisitions. In addition, DISA has not collected data that would help it identify trends in network traffic throughout Defense, which in turn would help it plan for future growth and identify the need for new telecommunications services. This would include data on the number of anticipated users, the nature of business functions requiring telecommunications support, and the potential costs and benefits of new technologies.", "Further, Defense managers lack reliable cost information on their networks. For example, senior Defense managers rely on Defense components to voluntarily report telecommunications resource requirements during annual budget preparations. But because communications resources are embedded in noncommunications budget items, this process does not allow Defense to identify costs by network or to identify costs for services obtained by users outside of DISA channels. In addition, DISA does not have a cost accounting system or any other effective means of determining DISN\u2019s actual operating costs.", "Until Defense managers have good data on status and trends in telecommunications equipment and services, acquisitions, and costs, they will not have a sound basis for making decisions on reducing telecommunications costs across the department, improving network operations, and reliably determining how efficiently and cost effectively to meet user needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Has Not Effectively Enforced the Use of Common User Networks", "paragraphs": ["Under Title 10 of the United States Code, the military services have wide latitude to expend resources to train and sustain their forces. Because the mandate to use DISN restricts this latitude, compliance will only be achieved if Defense institutes an effective enforcement process. Since it began the DISN program in 1991, Defense has never effectively enforced the use of common-user networks.", "While OASD/C3I staff stated that financial pressure could be brought to bear in the budget process to enforce the mandate, they were unable to articulate how this enforcement would occur. Further, even though the military services have implemented several major long-haul networks during the past 5 years, OASD/C3I staff were unable to identify a single instance in which they formally analyzed the military services\u2019 plans for acquiring long-haul networks and insisted that common-user networks be used instead.", "In May 1997, ASD/C3I issued a memorandum that reiterated Defense policy mandating the use of common-user networks for long-haul telecommunications and reaffirming DISA\u2019s role as the manager and sole provider of long-haul telecommunications.

For example, the guidance does not describe data that the required justifications should include or criteria DISA will use in evaluating them. In addition, it does not specify how DISA will determine if components\u2019 requirements can be cost effectively satisfied by DISN or FTS 2000/2001.", "To date, the Services and Defense agencies have largely ignored the interim waiver process.

For example, under FASA, the Secretary of Defense is required to establish and approve the cost, performance, and schedule goals for major defense acquisition programs and for each phase of the acquisition cycle. Under Clinger-Cohen, agencies must define mission-related performance measures before making information technology investments, and must determine actual mission-related benefits achieved from this information technology, to help ensure an adequate return on investment. For the DISN program, appropriate performance measures would be those that facilitate comparisons between DISN and the independent networks, as well as those that identify potential problems (for example, network reliability, network availability, and measures of customer service, including responsiveness to customer requests for maintenance or for new services).", "In our 1996 report on the DISN program, we recommended that Defense establish performance measures for DISN. Although it agreed to develop performance measures in response to that review, Defense has never developed measures for the DISN program.

As a result, Defense has not achieved its goals for an interoperable telecommunications environment, cannot support any claims that the long-haul networks it operates are cost-effective, and cannot determine which independent long-haul networks should be replaced by common user networks such as DISN or FTS 2000/2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence to ensure that existing policies are clearly defined, documented, and enforced.

As indicated in the reply, Defense does not maintain a comprehensive inventory of independent long-haul telecommunications networks, and therefore does not know how many networks are operating throughout the department or what functions they support.

Defense affirms in its comment what we state in this report, that DISA currently lacks well-defined steps for determining whether a long-haul telecommunications requirement can be most effectively satisfied by a common-user network. We note Defense\u2019s plan to develop and employ a standard requirements evaluation model. This model, if properly developed and implemented, could assist Defense in making cost-effective decisions on individual telecommunications requirements.
