The program includes policies related to compact management records--a subset of MCC's federal records. These policies also address the handling of other compact-related information generated by MCC partner governments' accountable entities, which typically manage compact implementation until the 5-year compacts close. MCC's policies require that the entities transfer their compact management records to MCC for storage before compact closure. MCC also requires that partner governments retain compact-related information not classified as records, such as survey data and data quality reviews, for at least 5 years after their compacts close, to facilitate audits and analysis of MCC assistance. However, MCC does not require, and has not conducted, periodic reviews to determine whether it has received all compact-management records from the accountable entities consistent with federal internal control standards. As a result, MCC cannot be sure that it is meeting the federal requirement that it preserve all records documenting its functions, activities, and other transactions.", "In reviews of five closed compacts--Armenia's, Benin's, El Salvador's, Ghana's, and Mali's--GAO found variation in the accountable entities' implementation of MCC document retention requirements and the partner governments' ability to retrieve requested compact-related information after the compacts closed. As required by MCC's compact closure guidelines, all five program closure plans that we reviewed contained some discussion of retaining and storing documents, but each accountable entity addressed the guidelines' requirements differently. MCC's guidelines do not provide a list specifying standard types of compact-related information that most compacts should retain. Such variation in approaches to retaining and storing compact-related information will make it more difficult for MCC to verify that standard compact information is retained in all partner countries after the compacts close. In addition, in a test of MCC's ability to retrieve documents from the partner governments after compact closure, GAO found that four of the five governments provided all or most requested documents within 30 days, but Mali's, which is involved in political turmoil, provided no documents. Political turmoil in Madagascar, another compact-recipient country, has also impeded MCC's ability to obtain compact information that may be needed to conduct future audits, evaluate project impact, or inform future compact designs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen MCC's records and information management program, MCC's Chief Executive Officer should (1) develop a policy requiring--and conduct--periodic reviews of MCC's compact-management records to ensure they are complete, (2) revise guidelines to include a sample document retention schedule specifying standard types of compact-related information compacts should retain, and (3) review MCC's policy of delegating storage of most compact-related information to partner governments.

Creating records schedules involves identifying and  inventorying records, appraising their value, determining whether they are  temporary or permanent, and determining how long they should be kept  before they are destroyed or turned over to NARA for archiving.  Scheduling records requires agencies to invest time and resources to  analyze the information that an agency receives, produces, and uses to  fulfill its mission.

Regarding MCC\u2019s  requirement that the partner governments make provisions for the form  and manner of document storage, we reviewed the compacts\u2019 program  closure plans to ensure that provisions for document storage were  included, but we did not verify that specific storage requirements\u2014such  as security and acclimatization\u2014were met.", "We also conducted a test of MCC\u2019s ability to retrieve compact-related  information from partner governments after compact closure. For this test,  we asked MCC to request that the partner governments for the case- study compacts provide copies of documents that the U.S. Agency for  International Development\u2019s (USAID) Office of the Inspector General  (OIG) had collected during the course of performance and financial audits  of the five countries.  We selected the audits from a list that the OIG  provided, and we drew from those audits a random sample of documents  that we requested from the partner governments. We used OIG files  because it has conducted audits in all 5 countries, whereas GAO has not.", "Selection of performance and financial audits. The OIG provided a  list of 10 performance and 4 financial audits that it considered relevant  to our case studies. We removed one performance audit from the list,  because the OIG had conducted the audit prior to any MCC  compact\u2019s entry into force and the audit therefore would not yield valid  documents. We then selected three performance audits and one  financial audit to review for each of the case-study compacts (except  Armenia\u2019s, for which the OIG did not conduct a financial audit).  Several of the performance audits on the OIG\u2019s list covered more than  one of the case-study compacts. Because Armenia and Benin\u2019s  compacts were both covered in two performance audits and Mali\u2019s  compacts was covered by three performance audits, we included all  of these audits in our sample. Because Ghana\u2019s and El Salvador\u2019s  compacts were each covered by more than three performance audits,  we randomly selected among the relevant audits. Because the OIG  conducted only one financial audit per compact (except Armenia\u2019s),  we selected all of the listed financial audits. See table 3 for a list of the  audits that we selected from which we randomly drew supporting  documents for our case studies.", "Random sample of audit documents. Each audit contained multiple  files, from which we randomly drew a sample of 93 documents: 20  documents for Benin\u2019s, Ghana\u2019s, and Mali\u2019s compacts; 18 documents  for El Salvador\u2019s compact; and 15 documents for Armenia\u2019s compact.  The number of documents that we sampled per compact varied for  two reasons: (1) because the OIG has not conducted a financial audit  for Armenia\u2019s compact, we were unable to select any financial-audit- related documents for our sample, and (2) the performance audit files  for El Salvador\u2019s compact contained only 18 appropriate documents.  Table 4 shows the number of documents we sampled per compact, by  type of audit (financial or performance).", "Requests for sampled documents. We provided a list of the  randomly sampled documents for each case-study compact to MCC.  We identified each document using, as appropriate, its title, date, and  other identifying information (e.g., contract number, payment order  number, beneficiary name, letter recipient). For Benin\u2019s, Ghana\u2019s, El  Salvador\u2019s, and Mali\u2019s compacts, we listed the document titles and  other information in the document\u2019s original language (English,  French, or Spanish). For Armenia, we translated the title and other  information into English when necessary. We asked MCC to share  these lists with the five partner governments and to request that they  send us copies of the documents, either electronic or paper, within 20  business days, in keeping with the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s  (FOIA) requirement. In response to an MCC comment that the  documents we requested would not, as \u201cnon-records,\u201d be subject to  the FOIA requirement, we have reported the numbers of documents  that the partner governments returned within 30 calendar days\u2014the  requirement stated in MCC\u2019s Program Closure Guidelines. However,  the numbers of documents returned within 20 business days were  identical to the numbers returned within 30 calendar days.", "Verification of requested documents. To verify that the partner  governments provided the documents we requested, we conducted  two separate comparisons of the documents we received with  corresponding electronic copies, which USAID\u2019s OIG had allowed us  to retain in our files.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2012 to June 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
