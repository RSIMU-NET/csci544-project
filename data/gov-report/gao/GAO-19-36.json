This interest dropped as a percentage of permanent appropriations since fiscal year 1994, due to lower interest rates that allow the government to borrow money more cheaply. However, interest rates are predicted to rise in the long term, which would increase the net interest costs on the debt.", "The second largest reported budget authority type was offsetting collections--a total of $421 billion in fiscal year 2015, more than double the fiscal year 1994 amount, adjusted for inflation.

For the purpose of this report, we refer to  the types of budget authority in these cases as spending authority and  permanent appropriations. These include permanent appropriations,  contract authority, borrowing authority, offsetting collections, and  monetary credits or bartering. These types of budget authority provide  some flexibility for agencies because they do not have to await  congressional action to incur obligations and make payments.

Using these line numbers, we pulled the  data by account and asked agencies to confirm the data and to confirm or  provide statutory references for each account.

A permanent appropriation may  have been made available through an annual appropriations act or  through laws other than the annual appropriations acts. We are including  both in our inventory based on the intent of the request for developing our  inventory.", "For some accounts, Congress provides spending authority and  permanent appropriations to allow agencies the flexibility to spend fee  revenue without further legislative action. Specifically, Congress has  authorized some agencies to establish working capital funds\u2014a type of  intragovernmental revolving fund\u2014in which an agency may deposit fees  from federal, and sometimes nonfederal, customers for performing  administrative services, or the sale of government products, within their  statutory authority. For example, in addition to appropriations and  reimbursements from federal agencies, the Department of Energy (DOE)  has a working capital fund with the authority to collect funds. Those  collections are then made available for DOE expenses necessary for the  maintenance and operation of common administrative services for  economy and efficiency, such as office space and communication  services. This and other working capital funds operate as a self- supporting entity conducting business-like activities for the agency.", "Spending authority and permanent appropriations may be subject to  further restrictions from Congress. For example, in one or more annual  appropriations acts, Congress could restrict the use of some or all of the  budget authority, thereby using the annual appropriations process to  control the use of spending authority and permanent appropriations. For  example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a permanent  appropriation which states that 10 percent of all receipts from the use and  occupancy of national forest system lands during each fiscal year are  available for maintaining roads and trails within the national forests. In  past annual appropriations acts, Congress has limited that permanent  appropriation by transferring all funds made available for that fiscal year  to the General Fund of the Treasury.

Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, refers to budget  authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts and the outlays  that result from such budget authority. Medicare is an example of a  program that is funded by mandatory spending. Discretionary spending,  on the other hand, refers to budget authority that is provided in and  controlled by appropriations acts. During the annual appropriations  process, Congress may choose to appropriate the amount in the  President\u2019s budget request, increase or decrease those levels, eliminate  proposals, or add other programs. For example, most defense and  education programs are funded with discretionary spending. As shown in  figure 2, mandatory spending as a share of all federal spending grew from  about 51 percent in fiscal year 1997 to about 63 percent in fiscal year  2017. Another form of federal spending is net interest, which is primarily  interest paid on debt held by the public.", "While the majority of the accounts in our inventory have mandatory  budget authority, not all mandatory spending fits our definition of  spending authority and permanent appropriations. For example, while  annually appropriated entitlement programs\u2014such as the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program\u2014are provided for in annual appropriations  acts, they are treated as mandatory spending because the authorizing  legislation entitles beneficiaries to receive payment or otherwise obligates  the government to make a payment. As annually appropriated  entitlements are subject to the annual appropriations process, they did  not meet our definition of spending authority and permanent  appropriations.

For example, our inventory  includes permanent appropriations made available in annual  appropriations acts.", "The increase in mandatory spending, and corresponding increase in  spending authority and permanent appropriations, has long-term  implications for the nation\u2019s fiscal outlook overall, including the growing  federal debt. The growth in mandatory spending drove federal spending  that outpaced revenue growth in fiscal year 2017 and, absent policy  change, is projected to continue to do so in the future given the aging  population and rising health care costs and their relation to large federal  budget accounts funding programs, such as Social Security and  Medicare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spending Limits and Sequestration", "paragraphs": ["Sequestration\u2014cancellation of budgetary resources under a presidential  order\u2014was first established in the Balanced Budget and Emergency  Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) to control the deficit. BBEDCA, as  amended, requires OMB to calculate the reduction to budgetary  resources required each year to reduce the deficit by at least an  additional $1.2 trillion, over a 10 year period. A percentage reduction, or  sequestration rate (calculated by OMB), is applied to nonexempt (subject  to sequestration) accounts to achieve the total reduction amount required  for the fiscal year. The sequestration rate varies from year to year based  on a formula outlined in BBEDCA. The annual reduction amount OMB  calculates is split evenly between the defense and nondefense  functions. The calculated amount is then allocated between  discretionary appropriations and mandatory spending in each function in  proportion to the share of total spending within the function.", "Prior to BBEDCA, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control  Act of 1974 (CBA) attempted to limit the creation of new contract authority  and authority to borrow. In 1990, Congress further sought to limit  spending authority by establishing controls over discretionary spending  and a system of controls over legislative changes in mandatory spending.  The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) amended both CBA and  BBEDCA. In addition to establishing dollar limits for total annual  appropriations, BEA contained a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d provision requiring that  any legislation that reduced taxes or expanded mandatory spending  programs be offset by mandatory spending cuts or revenue increases.  This provision was to be enforced through sequestration of nonexempt  mandatory spending programs at the end of the congressional session.  Both the discretionary limit and \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d rules were extended  through fiscal year 2002 and were not subsequently reauthorized. In  2010, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 reinstated a version of  the \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d requirement.

BCA established the Joint Select Committee on Deficit  Reduction (Joint Committee). The Joint Committee was tasked with  proposing legislation to reduce the deficit. Such legislation was not  proposed or enacted, which triggered the sequestration process provided  in section 251A of BBEDCA, known as the Joint Committee  sequestration. BBEDCA currently requires a sequestration of mandatory  spending in each year through fiscal year 2027 and a reduction of  discretionary spending limits in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. A  sequestration of discretionary spending could still occur in any year  through fiscal year 2021 if Congress and the President enact  appropriations that exceed discretionary spending limits established by  BBEDCA.

Entitlement  programs, such as Medicare and the Social Security Administration\u2019s  (SSA) Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance  programs, are funded through permanent appropriations, and are a  significant proportion of budget authority in our inventory, as discussed  below. Since many spending authorities and permanent appropriations  provide agencies budget authority based on program use and eligibility,  demographic and program demand changes can affect the amount of  budget authority. For example, since the Old-Age and Survivors  Insurance and Disability Insurance programs administer benefits based  on eligibility requirements and statutory formulas, the amount of budget  authority used for the programs increases as more people become  entitled. Higher income levels result in higher average benefit amounts  and cost of living adjustments increase monthly benefit amounts for  current beneficiaries.", "Other factors affected the growth in the use of spending authority and  permanent appropriations to a lesser extent.", "Enactment of new authorities. From 1995 to 2015, 329 new  authorities for spending authority and permanent appropriations were  enacted. For example, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of  2008 granted the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) the authority  to purchase any obligations and other securities issued by  government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae. According  to the act, Treasury was authorized to use this authority until  December 31, 2009, with certain actions permitted after that date.  This authority resulted in $200 billion in permanent appropriations  reported in both fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and another $46 billion in  fiscal year 2013.", "Amendment of existing authorities. Some existing authorities were  amended to allow for increased use\u2014permanently or temporarily.  Some authorities have amounts specified by statute\u2014such as  maximum amounts the agency can use or set amounts that the  agency can charge users. For these authorities, increases in the use  of an authority may be attributed to enacted increases in the specified  amounts.

Other authorities did not  experience statutory changes, but agencies increased the use of the  authorities at their discretion to meet program needs. When no  maximum amount is specified as a limit on the agency\u2019s authority,  variation in use is due to agency discretion in response to  circumstances. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation\u2019s (FDIC) Deposit Insurance Fund account began  reporting increased offsetting collections for amounts assessed  against depository institutions insured by FDIC, in fiscal years 2009  and 2010. The reported collections increased to highs of $26.5  billion in fiscal year 2009 and $57.3 billion in fiscal year 2010, after  reported budget authority levels of $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2006.  According to an agency official and as stated in the FDIC\u2019s 2009  Annual Report, this increase primarily resulted from its adoption of the  Deposit Insurance Fund Restoration Plan and the prepayment of  future risk-based deposit insurance assessments by depository  institutions to provide FDIC with the necessary liquidity to resolve  failed depository institutions during the financial crisis.
