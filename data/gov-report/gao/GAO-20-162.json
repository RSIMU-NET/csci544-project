This program does not fund graduate training for nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) who deliver many of the same services as physicians, such as diagnosing patients and performing certain procedures. Instead, a smaller portion of federal funding\u2014approximately $136 million in fiscal year 2019\u2014is available to train them. Stakeholders GAO interviewed said that one benefit of expanding Medicare GME is that Medicare GME funding would provide more stable funding for NP and PA training, compared to existing programs. Stakeholders said one challenge of such an expansion is that clinical training requirements for NPs and PAs are different than physicians; therefore, any change to Medicare GME to include NPs and PAs would need to consider how to allocate GME funding in light of these differences.", "GAO identified two estimates of costs for completing an NP or PA graduate school program; while the estimates provide some information about these costs, they are limited and incomplete. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) evaluation of its Graduate Nurse Education Demonstration estimated the total costs over the 2012-2018 demonstration period to be about $47,000 per NP student. While clinical and classroom training are required for NP students, CMS's demonstration only provided funding for clinical training, as specified by statute, and the estimate is not generalizable beyond the participating schools. The Physician Assistant Education Association estimated the total costs to be about $45,000 per PA student. The estimate is based on self-reported data from a 2018 survey of member PA programs and excludes in-kind contributions for clinical training.

We described  these cost estimates as they were reported by the sources, and we  identified some limitations that are applicable for determining the total  cost of NP or PA graduate training. However, we did not independently  verify the accuracy of the information or evaluate the methodology used  by these sources to calculate the cost estimates. Based on our interviews  with officials from CMS and the Physician Assistant Education  Association, we found the estimates to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives.

Physician GME, also known as residency, provides the  clinical training required for a physician to be eligible for licensure and  board certification to practice medicine independently in the United  States. Specifically, after completing medical school and receiving a  medical degree, physicians enter a multi-year residency training program  during which they complete their formal education as a physician,  primarily in teaching hospitals. Completion of a residency can take from 3  to 7 years after graduation from medical school, depending on the  specialty or subspecialty chosen by the physician. In some cases,  physicians may choose to pursue additional training\u2014referred to as  fellowships\u2014to become a subspecialist, such as a cardiologist.", "NPs and PAs. Since the first NP and PA training programs in the United  States were founded in 1965, these professions and their educational  requirements have evolved to allow them to furnish more care that was  traditionally provided by physicians, such as diagnosing patients,  prescribing medication, and performing certain procedures. The extent to  which they can provide care independently from physician supervision  varies by state.", "There are multiple pathways for students to become NPs. In general,  after completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree, a nurse may become an NP once  he or she achieves a master\u2019s or doctoral degree in nursing. Full-time  master\u2019s programs are generally 18 to 24 months and doctoral programs  are generally 3 to 5 years. Both programs include classroom and clinical  work. In addition, NP students may have varying amounts of hands-on  nursing experience before entering an NP program. NP programs  generally include the following focus areas: family practice, women\u2019s  health, acute care, adult/geriatric health, child health, neonatal health,  and mental health. NPs are trained according to a nursing care model,  which emphasizes providing comprehensive care for patients that  encompasses their physical and other needs.", "After completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree, students become PAs once they  earn a master\u2019s degree in physician assistant studies. The average full- time PA program takes about 27 months to complete, which includes  classroom education followed by clinical work conducted through  rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics,  obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and behavioral  medicine. In addition, PA students have varying amounts of hands-on  work experience in health care before entering a PA program. PAs are  trained to approach patient care according to a medical model focused on  assessing, diagnosing, and treating disease.", "Both NP and PA students are required to complete clinical work as part of  their graduate programs by providing care to patients under the  supervision of a preceptor\u2014an experienced and licensed health care  provider who provides instruction and supervision to the student during  their clinical rotations. Upon graduation and after passing a national  certification exam and obtaining a license in the state in which they  choose to work, both NPs and PAs can begin practicing.

Direct payments are for costs that include, for example, residents\u2019  salaries and benefits, compensation for faculty who supervise the  residents, and overhead costs. Indirect payments are for costs including  higher patient care costs that teaching sites are thought to incur as a  result of training residents, such as increased diagnostic testing and  procedures performed.

This  would be beneficial by allowing NP and PA programs to do better  long-range planning such as planning for the number of NP and PA  students that can be admitted. Officials from two of these stakeholder  organizations noted that a benefit of the Medicare GME program for  physicians is that funding is historically more stable than the funding  available to NPs and PAs through HRSA. Specifically, Medicare GME  funding is mandatory, while funding for NP and PA training programs  administered by HRSA is discretionary. During the annual  appropriations process, Congress may choose to appropriate the  amount requested by HRSA, to increase or decrease those levels, or  to not appropriate any funds. For example, Congress appropriated  $28.5 million in fiscal year 2018 for HRSA\u2019s Nurse Faculty Loan  Program, but then decreased this appropriation to $13.5 million in  fiscal year 2019.", "Potential opportunity to pay preceptors.

CMS and others  have also reported that schools of nursing have faced significant  challenges increasing enrollments, in part due to difficulty finding  preceptors willing to supervise students. Similarly, officials from two  PA organizations we interviewed noted that some programs may  choose not to fill their available enrollment slots because they are  concerned about finding enough preceptors to allow all their students  to graduate. Officials from four of the stakeholder organizations we  interviewed noted that supervising students can take time away from  the preceptor\u2019s productivity in seeing patients, and that some  practices and health care systems do not allow their health care  providers to serve as preceptors. Specifically, officials from two  stakeholder organizations we interviewed said that, historically, these  preceptors have volunteered as a way of \u201cgiving back\u201d to their  profession and have not been paid for their time. However, due to  difficulties finding a sufficient number of volunteer preceptors, some  graduate programs have begun reimbursing preceptors for their time  in order to encourage their participation.

For example,  officials from some of these organizations noted that the Medicare  GME program is structured to fund physician residency training, which  is required in order for physicians to practice, but NPs and PAs are  not required to complete a residency after completing a graduate  program in order to practice.

An official from  one of these stakeholder organizations said that there is currently not  enough funding to provide residency training for all qualified  physicians, and adding NPs and PAs to the existing pool of  underfunded residency candidates would worsen the funding  shortage.
