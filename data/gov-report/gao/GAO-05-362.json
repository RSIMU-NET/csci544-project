Most agencies recognize risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems associated with the use of contractors and other users with privileged access to federal data and systems. For example, malicious code can be inserted into agency software and systems. In addition, agencies also reported specific risks when contractors develop software or perform work at off-site facilities. Federal agencies reported additional risks to their operations posed by other users with privileged access to federal data and systems, such as lack of controlled network connections, poor access controls, and the introduction of viruses and worms. Agencies use contracts, policies, and self-assessments for ensuring information security oversight of contractors; however, each of these methods has limitations and needs further strengthening. Most agencies reported using contract language to establish information security requirements for contractors. However, agency-provided contract language generally did not address key elements of FISMA, such as annual testing of controls. In addition, the majority of agencies reported having information security policies for contractors and almost two-thirds of the agencies reported having such policies for other users with privileged access to federal data. Yet our analysis of agency-provided policies found that only 5 agencies had established policies that specifically addressed information security oversight of contractor-provided systems. Finally, the majority of agencies reported using the NIST self-assessment tool to assess contractor security capabilities. However, only 10 reported using the tool to assess the security implemented by other users with privileged access to federal data. The administration continues in its efforts to improve information security oversight of contractors, but challenges remain. For example, efforts to update the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to include the information security requirements of FISMA (which would be reflected in all relevant government contracts) have been under way since 2002, but are not yet complete. OMB continues to gather data about the number of agency systems, including those that are operated by contractors, and how many have been reviewed using a self-assessment tool. However, the data submitted showed that several agencies' chief information officers and inspectors general disagreed on the number of contractor or agency systems by as many as 100 systems or more. In addition, the data collected by OMB does not address other users with privileged access to federal data or the quality of the self assessments. Finally, NIST has developed guidance, parts of which are relevant to contractor security oversight.

However, without clear guidance on how to develop  effective information security oversight of contractors and users with  privileged access to federal systems and data, federal agencies may not  develop sufficient policies to address the range of risks posed by  contractors and key users. As a result, federal information and operations  can be placed at undue risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Contractors provide valuable services that contribute to the efficient  functioning of the government, but a range of risks from contractors and  other users with privileged access to federal data and systems must be  managed effectively. Contracts, policies, and security self-assessments can  be leveraged as valuable oversight tools for federal agencies in managing  oversight of contractors and other users. However, when not properly  implemented, each of these methods has limitations. For example, many  agencies are not incorporating FISMA requirements into their contract  language; accordingly, their strongest tool for establishing information  security requirements is limited. Additionally, many agencies have not  defined specific oversight policies for contractors and other users with  privileged access to federal data. Without clearly defined information  security oversight policies, agencies may be accepting significant risk to  their information and systems from both contractors and other users with  privileged access without having the appropriate controls to mitigate the  risks. Finally, agency reliance on self-assessment tools may not provide  them with the appropriate tools to ensure the security of their information.", "To address these complex challenges, a variety of administration efforts  have been started to further enhance federal agencies\u2019 efforts to improve  information security oversight of contractors, but challenges remain. For  example, the effort to update FAR guidance has not been completed. In  addition, continuing OMB FISMA oversight reveals challenges in  contractor oversight.

OMB officials told us that, as part of the capital asset plan and  business case development process, agencies are required to answer  several information security oversight questions related to contractor-  provided IT systems and services. These questions provide OMB important  information when assessing the business case for funding. Further, OMB  stated that their efforts to enhance oversight of contractors includes  requiring that the 25 E-Government initiatives be independently reviewed  to determine compliance with IT security requirements. OMB did not  disagree with the overall recommendations and recognized the need for  further agency action to address contractor security oversight.", "In written comments, which are reprinted in appendix II, the Deputy  Secretary of the Department of Commerce acknowledged the accuracy of  the report. In regard to our recommendation, Commerce stated that NIST  recognizes the importance of providing guidance to assist agencies in  ensuring that security requirements are applied by contractors.

In addition, we interviewed federal and private-sector  officials regarding the policies and procedures for overseeing contractor  security. We then developed a series of questions that were incorporated  into a Web-based survey instrument. We pretested our survey instrument at  one federal department and one federal independent agency. We also met  with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials to discuss OMB\u2019s  role in ensuring the security of contractor-provided systems and services.  For each agency to be surveyed, we identified the office of the chief  information officer, notified each office of our work, and, via e-mail,  distributed a link to each office. All 24 agencies responded to our survey.  We did not verify the accuracy of the agencies\u2019 responses; however, we  reviewed supporting documentation that agencies provided to validate  their responses. We contacted agency officials when necessary for follow- up.", "Although this was not a sample survey and, therefore, there were no  sampling errors, conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly  referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a  particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are  available to respondents, or in how the data are entered into a database or  were analyzed can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps in the development of the survey instrument, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For  example, a survey specialist designed the survey instrument in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject-matter expertise. Then, as  previously stated, it was pretested to ensure that the questions were  relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. When the data were  analyzed, a second, independent analyst checked all computer programs.  Because this was a Web-based survey, respondents entered their answers  directly into the electronic questionnaire. This eliminated the need to have  the data keyed into a database, thus removing an additional potential  source of error.", "To identify methods used by federal agencies to ensure security of  contractor-provided systems and services, we interviewed the FAR  Council, OMB, and NIST officials to discuss their guidelines and other tools  available to agencies.
