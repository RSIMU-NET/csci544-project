VA also planned to increase its fiscal year 2006 allocations for plan initiatives by $200 million above fiscal year 2004 levels--composed of $100 million for continuation of fiscal year 2005 initiatives and an additional $100 million identified in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request. GAO was asked to provide preliminary information on VA's allocation and use of funding for mental health strategic plan initiatives in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. A report on this work will be issued later in the fall of 2006. GAO reviewed VA reports and documents on mental health strategic plan initiatives and conducted interviews with VA officials from headquarters, 4 of 21 health care networks, and 7 medical centers.

VA allocated about $53 million directly to medical centers and certain offices based on proposals submitted for funding and other approaches targeted to specific initiatives. VA solicited submissions from networks for specific initiatives to be carried out at their individual medical centers through requests for proposals (RFPs). In addition, VA headquarters officials said that VA allocated $35 million for this purpose through VA's general resource allocation system to its 21 health care networks on a retrospective basis. VA made this decision several months after resources had been provided to the networks through the general allocation system. Moreover, VA did not notify network and medical center officials that these funds were to be used for plan initiatives. Health care network and medical center officials interviewed told GAO that they were not aware these allocations had been made. As a result, it is likely that some of these funds were not used for plan initiatives. Moreover, VA did not allocate the approximately $12 million remaining of the $100 million for fiscal year 2005 because, according to VA officials, there was not enough time during the fiscal year to do so. Medical center officials said they used the funds allocated directly to their medical centers for plan initiatives that included new mental health services and more of the services they already provided. For example, two medical centers used funds allocated to them through RFPs or other targeted approaches to increase the number of mental health providers at community based outpatient clinics. One of those medical centers also started a new 6-week PTSD day treatment program. However, some medical center officials reported that they did not use all funds allocated for plan initiatives by the end of fiscal year 2005, due in part to the length of time it took to hire new staff. In fiscal year 2006, as of September 20, 2006, VA headquarters had allocated $158 million of the $200 million planned for mental health strategic plan initiatives. VA allocated about $92 million of these funds directly to medical centers and certain offices to support new initiatives, using RFPs and other targeted funding approaches. VA also allocated about $66 million to support recurring costs of the continuing initiatives from the prior fiscal year. As of September 20, 2006, about $42 million of the $200 million for fiscal year 2006 had not been allocated. Officials from seven medical centers we interviewed reported that they had used funds for plan initiatives, such as the creation of a new intensive mental health case management program. Officials at some medical centers reported that they did not anticipate problems using all of the funds allocated to them through RFPs and other targeted approaches in fiscal year 2006. However, officials at other medical centers were less certain that they would use all of these funds for plan initiatives by the end of fiscal year 2006. GAO discussed the information in this statement with VA officials who agreed that the data are accurate, and provided updated data which are incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to have the opportunity to provide preliminary information  from our work on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) resource  allocation for mental health strategic plan initiatives for fiscal years 2005  and 2006 and how those funds were used by selected medical centers in  those 2 fiscal years. VA provides a range of inpatient and outpatient mental  health services to veterans with conditions such as depression, post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse disorders. In  November 2004, the Secretary of VA approved a mental health strategic  plan that identified additional services that VA planned to add to the  baseline of mental health services that it already offered to meet veterans\u2019  mental health needs. This mental health strategic plan was intended to  help VA\u2019s leadership identify the actions and resources needed to begin  eliminating the gaps between mental health services VA provided at the  time of the plan\u2019s formulation and those additional services VA anticipated  it would need in the future.", "VA indicated at a 2005 congressional hearing that it would provide   $100 million above fiscal year 2004 levels for mental health strategic plan  initiatives in fiscal year 2005 from available resources. In addition, in a  2005 executive decision memo VA indicated its intent to increase its fiscal  year 2006 funding levels to $200 million above fiscal year 2004 levels for  mental health strategic plan initiatives. This $200 million in funds for fiscal  year 2006 was to be composed of $100 million for a continuation of fiscal  year 2005 initiatives plus an additional $100 million included in the  President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2006, according to the executive  decision memo. However, these additional funds represented only a  portion of the overall funds available to support VA mental health services  in those 2 fiscal years. VA\u2019s appropriation for fiscal year 2006, for example,  included more than $31.5 billion for its medical programs, of which VA  expected to spend more than $2 billion on mental health services. VA  headquarters allocates most of these resources to VA\u2019s 21 regional health  care networks through a general resource allocation system and the  networks in turn allocate resources to their medical centers.", "VA officials have stated that funds for mental health strategic plan  initiatives are to be used to address priorities such as the expansion of  PTSD services, postdeployment mental health services for veterans  returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas\u2014 Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),  respectively, and expansion of programs for the treatment of substance  abuse disorders. Concerns have been expressed by members of Congress  and others regarding the adequacy of resources that VA is devoting to  provide mental health care for OIF and OEF veterans while also  continuing to provide services for veterans who are currently receiving  mental health care.", "In this statement we are providing preliminary information on VA\u2019s  spending for mental health strategic plan initiatives in fiscal years 2005  and 2006. We are currently examining the allocation and use of these  additional funds targeted to mental health strategic plan initiatives.  Therefore, we focus on the increase from fiscal year 2004 targeted on  these initiatives\u2014-$100 million in fiscal year 2005 and $200 million in fiscal  year 2006. In this statement we provide (1) information on how much of  the $100 million for mental health strategic plan initiatives in fiscal year  2005 was allocated and how those funds were used by selected medical  centers, and (2) information on how much of the $200 million for mental  health strategic plan initiatives in fiscal year 2006 was allocated and how  those funds were used by selected medical centers. A more detailed report  concerning these issues and how VA tracked the use of the funds allocated  will be issued later in the fall of 2006.", "To provide information on how much of the $100 million for fiscal year  2005 and $200 million for fiscal year 2006 for mental health strategic plan  initiatives was allocated to networks, medical centers, and certain offices,  we reviewed the plan itself as well as reports and other documents related  to the development, implementation, and funding of the mental health  strategic plan. We also conducted interviews with VA headquarters  officials with responsibilities related to mental health services, budgeting,  and the allocation of financial resources. We used a September 20, 2006,  cut off date for reviewing VA\u2019s allocation of the $200 million for  implementing the mental health strategic plan in fiscal year 2006. We took  steps to ensure that the data VA provided to us on the funding allocated in  fiscal years 2005 and 2006 were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  reviewed the data for internal consistency and compared the data to other  VA information as well as information we obtained through interviews  with VA officials. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the data.  To describe how funds were used by selected medical centers, in May and  June 2006, we conducted site visits to 2 of VA\u2019s 21 health care networks  and 3 medical centers located in those networks, and we also conducted  phone interviews with officials in 2 other networks and 4 medical centers  located in those networks. We selected these 4 networks because VA had  identified them as having gaps in substance abuse and/or mental health  services prior to the implementation of the mental health strategic plan,  and because they received varying levels of funding\u2014from relatively high  to relatively low\u2014in fiscal year 2005 for mental health strategic plan  initiatives. We interviewed clinical and administrative officials at these  networks and medical centers, and at 3 community based outpatient  clinics (CBOC) associated with these medical centers and 5 Vet Centers.  The findings from our site visits and phone interviews with network and  medical center officials cannot be generalized to other medical centers or  networks. We discussed the information in this statement with VA officials  who have responsibilities related to mental health services, budgeting, and  the allocation of financial resources. These officials agreed that the data  are accurate and they also provided updated data which we incorporated  as appropriate. We performed our work from January 2006 through  September 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "In summary, VA headquarters allocated $88 million of the $100 million VA  officials said would be used for mental health strategic plan initiatives in  fiscal year 2005 by using several approaches.

In addition, VA headquarters officials said that they  allocated $35 million for mental health strategic plan initiatives through  VA\u2019s general resource allocation system to its 21 health care networks,  which, in turn, could allocate these resources to individual medical  centers. VA\u2019s decision that $35 million of the funds allocated through its  general resource allocation system was for plan initiatives was a  retroactive decision. VA made this decision several months after resources  had been provided to the networks through the general allocation system.  Moreover, VA did not notify networks and medical centers that these  funds were to be used for plan initiatives.

Once funding decisions were made, VA  allocated funding directly to the medical centers for the mental health  strategic plan initiatives. VA also used other funding approaches targeted  to specific initiatives. For example, headquarters officials allocated  funding to medical centers to expand mental health services at CBOCs  that had fewer mental health visits than a standard VA identified for this  purpose.
