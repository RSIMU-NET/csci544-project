With several exceptions (the largest being the Department  of Defense), FMS makes disbursements for most federal agencies. FMS is  also responsible for administering the federal government\u2019s collections  system. In fiscal year 2000, the government collected over $2 trillion in  taxes, duties, and fines. In addition, FMS oversees the federal  government\u2019s central accounting and reporting systems used to reconcile  and keep track of the federal government\u2019s assets and liabilities. Financial  and budget execution information from these central systems is used by  FMS to publish financial reports that are available for use by the Congress,  the Office of Management and Budget, other federal agencies, and others  who make financial decisions on behalf of the U.S. government.", "FMS maintains multiple financial and information systems to help it  process and reconcile moneys disbursed and collected by the various  government agencies.

In response to our prior years\u2019 recommendation that FMS establish an  effective security program, FMS completed its Information Technology  Security Handbook for Major Application Systems in late 1999. During  fiscal year 2000, the FMS Information Technology Security Policy  Manual and Entity-Wide Information Technology Security Program  manuals were approved and distributed. In addition, FMS developed an  Entity-Wide Information Technology Security Program Implementation  Strategy in March 2001. This document discusses FMS\u2019s high-level strategy  for the full implementation of its security program by a target date of  September 30, 2002.", "In April 2001, FMS completed an internal assessment to determine the  effectiveness of its security program and its initiatives.

The Framework identifies five levels of  security program effectiveness\u2014Level 1, Documented Policy; Level 2,  Documented Procedures; Level 3, Implemented Procedures and Controls;  Level 4, Tested and Reviewed Procedures and Controls; and Level 5, Fully  Integrated Procedures and Controls. The five levels measure specific  management, operational, and technical control objectives. Each of the  five levels contains criteria to determine whether the level is adequately  implemented, with each successive level representing a more complete  and effective security program. FMS\u2019s assessment did not contain an  overall determination of the level of effectiveness of its security program.

Through its self-assessment, FMS has  identified areas within its existing security program that need  improvement in order to achieve a fully implemented Level 5 security  program. However, FMS has not yet developed a detailed plan that  describes the remedial actions; resources (physical, human capital, and  fiscal); target dates; and responsible agency officials needed to correct the  shortcomings of its security program. A Level 5 security program is  described as a comprehensive and integral part of an agency\u2019s  organizational culture. The components of a fully integrated Level 5  security program include an active entity-wide security program that achieves cost-effective  security,  integration of information technology security through all aspects of the  information technology life-cycle, understanding and management of security vulnerabilities, continual evaluation of threats and adjustment of controls to the changing  security environment,  identification of additional or more cost-effective security alternatives as  the need arises, measurement of the costs and benefits of security, and establishment of status metrics to assess the effectiveness of the security  program that are also met.", "FMS\u2019s entity-wide security control structure has yet to address many of  the weaknesses and related significant risks associated with its current  and evolving computing environment.

For example, at one data center, we found access  control weaknesses during our fiscal year 2000 audit that were the same as  or very similar to issues that we reported at other data centers in previous  years\u2019 audits. Although FMS took corrective actions to address the  individual prior years\u2019 weaknesses found at those specific data centers,  FMS did not determine whether these weaknesses also existed at their  other data centers that were using the same type of computing platform.  Another example involved a data center that performed security violation  and sensitive activity monitoring procedures over its legacy environments.  However, FMS did not apply these same procedures and requirements to a  new computing environment introduced during fiscal year 2000. Until FMS  takes a more disciplined and structured approach to computer security  through a fully implemented entity-wide security program, there is a  significant increased risk that controls will not be adequate, properly  implemented, or applied consistently across each of its data centers.", "Integral to all security programs is a continuous risk assessment process  for determining the sensitivity of information and systems, acceptable  levels of risk, and specific controls needed to provide adequate security  over computer resources and data. Our May 1998 best practices guide on  information security management practices at leading nonfederal  organizations found that organizations successfully managed their  information security risks through an ongoing cycle of risk management  activities. During our fiscal year 2000 audit, we found that FMS had not  developed a comprehensive entity-wide risk assessment to be used as a  basis for establishing appropriate security policies and selecting cost- effective techniques for implementing policies. Documents and  approaches that FMS had already developed could be used together to  form the foundation of an entity-wide risk assessment.

We believe the report adequately reflects such progress for actions  taken by FMS during fiscal year 2001. In particular, our report noted that  continued progress has been made in the replacement of FMS\u2019s key  financial application (which is used by federal agencies to account for  their disbursement and receipt activities) by a new version of the  application on a distributed computing platform. However, our work over  the past 4 years has continued to identify serious issues at FMS. As we  stated in our report, FMS\u2019s entity-wide security control structure has yet to  address many of the weaknesses and related significant risks associated  with its current and evolving computing environment. For example, we  found that FMS\u2019s corrective actions were not being implemented on an  entity-wide basis. Weaknesses found and corrected in prior years at  certain data centers were identified during the current year audit at  another data center. These weaknesses in FMS\u2019s computer security  controls not only affect the effectiveness of computer security over the  new applications recently moved to distributed environments, but also  FMS\u2019s other key financial applications that are used to collect from and  pay to the public billions of dollars annually.", "In its comment letter, FMS pointed out that the general consensus of the  members of the Treasury CIO Council is that a computer security program  that achieves Level 3 effectiveness (which is reached when computer  security procedures and technical controls are implemented) is an  appropriate standard and should be the department\u2019s objective. However,  we believe that an effective entity-wide security program is achieved at  Level 5 and is the appropriate level for Treasury given its government-wide  responsibilities as financial manager, central disburser, and collections  agency as well as accountant and reporter of financial information. The  need for Treasury to implement an effective and fully integrated entity- wide security program is further underscored by recent events and reports  that critical federal operations and assets continue to be highly vulnerable  to computer-based attacks. It is important to note that until an entity has  accomplished the Level 4 goal that requires the testing of security  procedures and technical controls, it does not have reasonable assurance  that the documented controls developed in Levels 1 through 3 have been  effectively implemented. A fully integrated Level 5 security program helps  to ensure that an organization has incorporated the fundamental activities  needed to manage information security risks cost-effectively and is not  reacting to individual problems on an adhoc basis only after a problem has  been detected. Since FMS\u2019s systems process and account for billions of  dollars in transactions, we are encouraged that FMS has a goal of  continuing to strive for a high level of security effectiveness. While its near  term goal of achieving Level 3 effectiveness is commendable, we cannot  overemphasize the need for FMS management to make a focused and  sustained commitment to accelerate the full implementation of an  effective entity-wide security program.", "We will follow up on these matters during our audit of the federal  government\u2019s fiscal year 2001 financial statements.

During the interim years, we focus our testing on the FISCAM  areas that we have determined to be at greater risk for computer control  weaknesses.", "The scope of our work for fiscal year 2000 included follow-up on  weaknesses discussed in our fiscal year 1999 report and a focused review at three data centers of the two general control areas  intended to protect data, files, and programs from unauthorized access,  modification, and destruction and  limit and monitor access to system software programs and files that  control computer hardware and secure applications; a focused review at a fourth data center of the three general control areas  intended to protect data, files, and programs from unauthorized access,  modification, and destruction; prevent the introduction of unauthorized changes to systems and ensure the recovery of computer processing operation in case of a  disaster or other unexpected interruption.", "We limited our work at another data center to a follow-up review of the  status of weaknesses discussed in our fiscal year 1999 report.", "We limited our testing of FMS\u2019s entity-wide security program to a  comparison of FMS\u2019s information security manuals with our executive  guide on information security management.", "We performed a full-scope application control review of one key FMS  financial application to determine whether the application is designed to  ensure that access privileges (1) establish individual accountability and proper  segregation of duties, (2) limit the processing privileges of individuals, and  (3) prevent and detect inappropriate or unauthorized activities; data are authorized, converted to an automated format, and entered into  the application accurately, completely, and promptly; data are properly processed by the computer and files are updated erroneous data are captured, reported, investigated, and corrected; and files and reports generated by the application represent transactions that  actually occur and accurately reflect the results of processing, and reports  are controlled and distributed to the authorized users.", "We limited our work over another seven key financial applications to a  follow-up review of the status of weaknesses discussed in our fiscal year  1999 report.", "To evaluate the general and application controls, we identified and  reviewed FMS\u2019s information system general and application control  policies and procedures; observed controls in operation; conducted tests  of controls, which included selecting items using a method in which the  results are not projectable to the population; and held discussions with  officials at selected FMS data centers to determine whether controls were  in place, adequately designed, and operating effectively. We performed  network vulnerability assessment testing at three data centers. Through  our network security vulnerability assessments, we attempted to access  sensitive data and programs. These attempts were performed with the  knowledge and cooperation of appropriate FMS officials. The scope of our  network vulnerability assessment testing was limited by a fourth data  center to a review of a redacted report prepared by other auditors.", "Because the FRBs are integral to the operations of FMS, we followed up  on the status of the FRBs\u2019 corrective actions to address vulnerabilities  discussed in our fiscal year 1999 report. We assessed general controls over  FMS systems that the FRBs maintain and operate, and we evaluated  application controls over two key FMS financial applications.", "To assist in our evaluation and testing of computer controls, we  contracted with the independent public accounting firm  PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP. We determined the scope of our  contractor\u2019s audit work, monitored its progress, and reviewed the related  working papers to ensure that the resulting findings were adequately  supported.", "During the course of our work, we communicated our findings to FMS  management.
