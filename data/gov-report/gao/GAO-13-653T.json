At the end of fiscal year 2011, DHS had about 41,400 personnel assigned to air, land, and sea POEs and along the borders, with a total security cost of about $11.8 billion. DHS has reported that these resources have contributed to stronger enforcement efforts on the border. However, challenges remain to secure the border. In recent years, GAO has reported on a variety of DHS border security programs and operations.", "As requested, this statement addresses some of the key issues and recommendations GAO has made in the following areas: (1) DHS\u0092s efforts to secure the border at and between POEs; (2) DHS interagency coordination and oversight of border security information sharing and enforcement efforts; and (3) DHS management of infrastructure, technology, and other assets used to secure the border. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from January 2008 through March 2013, along with selected updates conducted in April 2013. For selected updates, GAO reviewed DHS information on actions it has taken to address prior GAO recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has reported progress in stemming illegal cross-border activity, but it could strengthen the assessment of its efforts. For example, since fiscal year 2011, DHS has used the number of apprehensions on the southwest border between ports of entry (POE) as an interim measure for border security. GAO reported in December 2012 that apprehensions decreased across the southwest border from fiscal years 2006 through 2011, generally mirroring a decrease in estimated known illegal entries in each southwest border sector. CBP attributed this decrease in part to changes in the U.S. economy and increased resources for border security. Data reported by CBP's Office of Border Patrol (Border Patrol) show that total apprehensions across the southwest border increased from over 327,000 in fiscal year 2011 to about 357,000 in fiscal year 2012. It is too early to assess whether this increase indicates a change in the trend. GAO testified in February 2013 that the number of apprehensions provides information on activity levels but does not inform program results or resource allocation decisions. Border Patrol is in the process of developing performance goals and measures for assessing the progress of its efforts to secure the border between POEs, but it has not identified milestones and time frames for developing and implementing them, as GAO recommended. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and said that it plans to set a date for establishing such milestones and time frames by November 2013.", "According to DHS law enforcement partners, interagency coordination and information sharing improved, but challenges remain. GAO reported in November 2010 that information sharing and communication among federal law enforcement officials responsible for federal borderlands had increased; however, gaps remained in ensuring law enforcement officials had access to daily threat information. GAO recommended that relevant federal agencies ensure interagency agreements for coordinating information and integrating border security operations are further implemented. These agencies agreed, and in January 2011, CBP issued a memorandum affirming the importance of federal partnerships to address border security threats on federal lands. While this is a positive step, to fully satisfy the intent of GAO's recommendation, DHS needs to take further action to monitor and uphold implementation of the existing interagency agreements.", "Opportunities exist to improve DHS's management of border security assets. For example, DHS conceived the Secure Border Initiative Network as a surveillance technology and deployed such systems along 53 miles of Arizona's border. In January 2011, in response to performance, cost, and schedule concerns, DHS canceled future procurements, and developed the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (the Plan) for the remainder of the Arizona border. GAO reported in November 2011 that in developing the Plan, CBP conducted an analysis of alternatives, but it had not documented the analysis justifying the specific types, quantities, and deployment locations of technologies proposed in the Plan, which GAO recommended that it do. DHS concurred with this recommendation. GAO has ongoing work in this area, and among other things, is examining DHS's efforts to address prior recommendations, and expects to issue a report in fall 2013."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In prior reports, GAO made recommendations to DHS to strengthen its border security programs and efforts.

Other DHS components also play a role in border security.  CBP\u2019s Office of Air and Marine operates a fleet of air and marine assets  in support of federal border security efforts. DHS\u2019s U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for investigating cross-border  illegal activity and criminal organizations that transport persons and  goods across the border. In addition, other federal, state, local, and tribal  law enforcement agencies also expend resources for border security.

Our analysis of these data show that the  percentage of estimated known illegal entrants apprehended from fiscal  years 2006 through 2011 varied across southwest border sectors. The  percentage of individuals apprehended who repeatedly crossed the  border illegally declined by 6 percent from fiscal years 2008 through  2011. Further, the number of seizures of drugs and other contraband  across the border increased from 10,321 in fiscal year 2006 to 18,898 in  fiscal year 2011.

Border Patrol data showed that the  effectiveness rate for eight of the nine sectors on the southwest border  improved from fiscal year 2006 through 2011. Border Patrol  headquarters officials said that differences in how sectors define, collect,  and report turn back data (entrants who illegally crossed the border but  were not apprehended because they crossed back into Mexico) and got  away data (entrants who illegally crossed the border and continued  traveling into the U.S. interior) used to calculate the overall effectiveness  rate preclude comparing performance results across sectors. Border  Patrol headquarters officials stated that until recently, each Border Patrol  sector decided how it would collect and report turn back and got away  data, and as a result, practices for collecting and reporting the data varied  across sectors and stations based on differences in agent experience and  judgment, resources, and terrain. Border Patrol headquarters officials  issued guidance in September 2012 to provide a more consistent,  standardized approach for the collection and reporting of turn back and  got away data by Border Patrol sectors. Each sector is to be individually  responsible for monitoring adherence to the guidance. According to  Border Patrol officials, it is expected that this guidance will help improve  data reliability. Implementation of this new guidance may allow for  comparison of sector performance and inform decisions regarding  resource deployment for securing the southwest border.", "Border Patrol is in the process of developing performance goals and  measures for assessing the progress of its efforts to secure the border  between POEs and for informing the identification and allocation of  resources needed to secure the border, but has not yet identified  milestones and time frames for developing and implementing them.

Operational control\u2014also referred to as effective control\u2014was  defined as the number of border miles where Border Patrol had the  capability to detect, respond to, and interdict cross-border illegal activity.  DHS last reported its progress and status in achieving operational control  of the borders in fiscal year 2010. At that time, DHS reported achieving  operational control for 1,107 (13 percent) of 8,607 miles across U.S.  northern, southwest, and coastal borders. Along the southwest border,  DHS reported achieving operational control for 873 (44 percent) of the  about 2,000 border miles. At the beginning of fiscal year 2011, DHS  transitioned from using operational control as its goal and outcome  measure for border security. We testified in February 2013 that the  interim goal and measure of number of apprehensions on the southwest  border between POEs provides information on activity levels but does not  inform program results or resource identification and allocation decisions,  and therefore until new goals and measures are developed, DHS and  Congress could experience reduced oversight and DHS accountability.  Further, studies commissioned by CBP have found that the number of  apprehensions bears little relationship to effectiveness because agency  officials do not compare these numbers with the amount of cross-border  illegal activity.", "Border Patrol officials stated that the agency is in the process of  developing performance goals and measures, but has not identified  milestones and time frames for developing and implementing them.  According to Border Patrol officials, establishing milestones and time  frames for the development of performance goals and measures is  contingent on the development of key elements of its new strategic plan,  such as a risk assessment tool, and the agency\u2019s time frames for  implementing these key elements\u2014targeted for fiscal years 2013 and  2014\u2014are subject to change. We recommended that CBP establish  milestones and time frames for developing a performance goal, or goals,  for border security between POEs that defines how border security is to  be measured, and a performance measure, or measures, for assessing  progress made in securing the border between POEs and informing  resource identification and allocation efforts.

We have previously  identified vulnerabilities in the traveler inspection program and made  recommendations to DHS for addressing these vulnerabilities, and DHS  implemented these recommendations. For example, we reported in  January 2008 on weaknesses in CBP\u2019s inbound traveler inspection  program, including challenges in attaining budgeted staffing levels  because of attrition and lack of officer compliance with screening  procedures, such as those used to determine citizenship and admissibility  of travelers entering the country as required by law and CBP policy.Factors that contributed to these challenges included lack of focus,  complacency, lack of supervisory presence, and lack of training. We  recommended that CBP enhance internal controls in the inspection  process, implement performance measures for apprehending  inadmissible aliens and other violators, and establish measures for  training provided to CBP officers and new officer proficiency.

At that time, CBP also  established performance measures related to the effectiveness of CBP  interdiction efforts. Additionally, in June 2011, CBP began conducting  additional classroom and on-the-job training, which incorporated ongoing  testing and evaluation of officer proficiency.", "In December 2011, we reported that CBP had revised its training program  for newly hired CBP officers in accordance with its own training  development standards. Consistent with these standards, CBP  convened a team of subject-matter experts to identify and rank the tasks  that new CBP officers are expected to perform. As a result, the new  curriculum was designed to produce professional law enforcement  officers capable of protecting the homeland from terrorist, criminal,  biological, and agricultural threats.", "We also reported that CBP took some steps to identify and address the  training needs of its incumbent CBP officers but could do more to ensure  that these officers were fully trained. For example, we examined CBP\u2019s  results of covert tests of document fraud detection at POEs conducted  over more than 2 years and found weaknesses in the CBP inspection  process at the POEs that were tested. In response to these tests, CBP  developed a \u201cBack to Basics\u201d course in March 2010 for incumbent  officers, but had no plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. We  also reported that CBP had not conducted an analysis of all the possible  causes or systemic issues that may have contributed to the covert test  results. We recommended in December 2011 that CBP analyze covert  tests and evaluate the \u201cBack to Basics\u201d training course, and DHS  concurred with these recommendations. In April 2012, CBP officials  reported that they had completed an evaluation of the \u201cBack to Basics\u201d  training course and implemented an updated, subsequent training course.  Further, in November 2012, CBP officials stated that they had analyzed  the results of covert tests prior to and since the implementation of the  subsequent course. According to these officials, they obtained the results  of covert tests conducted before and after the course was implemented to  determine to what extent significant performance gains were achieved  and to identify any additional requirements for training. In April 2013, CBP  provided a copy of its analysis of the covert test results.

Further, in July 2012, CBP completed a comprehensive analysis of the  results of its document fraud covert tests from fiscal years 2009 through  2011. In addition, we reported that CBP had not conducted a needs  assessment that would identify any gaps between identified critical skills  and incumbent officers\u2019 current skills and competencies. We  recommended in December 2011 that CBP conduct a training needs  assessment. DHS concurred with this recommendation. In April 2013,  CBP reported to us that it is working to complete a training needs  assessment, but has faced challenges in completing such an assessment  because of personnel and budget issues, including retirements, attrition,  loss of contract support, sequestration, and continuing resolutions.

In September 2009, we  recommended that CBP determine the contribution of border fencing and  other infrastructure to border security. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and, in response, CBP contracted with the Homeland  Security Studies and Analysis Institute to conduct an analysis of the  impact of tactical infrastructure on border security.

SBInet was conceived as a surveillance technology to create a \u201cvirtual  fence\u201d along the border, and after spending nearly $1 billion, DHS  deployed SBInet systems along 53 miles of Arizona\u2019s border that  represent the highest risk for illegal entry. In January 2011, in response to  concerns regarding SBInet\u2019s performance, cost, and schedule, DHS  canceled future procurements.

In developing  the Plan, CBP conducted an analysis of alternatives and outreach to  potential vendors. However, CBP did not document the analysis justifying  the specific types, quantities, and deployment locations of border  surveillance technologies proposed in the Plan. Specifically, according to  CBP officials, CBP used a two-step process to develop the Plan. First,  CBP engaged the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute to  conduct an analysis of alternatives beginning with ones for Arizona.  Second, following the completion of the analysis of alternatives, the  Border Patrol conducted its operational assessment, which included a  comparison of alternative border surveillance technologies and an  analysis of operational judgments to consider both effectiveness and cost.  While the first step in CBP\u2019s process to develop the Plan\u2014the analysis of  alternatives\u2014was well documented, the second step\u2014Border Patrol\u2019s  operational assessment\u2014was not transparent because of the lack of  documentation. As we reported in November 2011, without  documentation of the analysis justifying the specific types, quantities, and  deployment locations of border surveillance technologies proposed in the  Plan, an independent party cannot verify the process followed, identify  how the analysis of alternatives was used, assess the validity of the  decisions made, or justify the funding requested. We also reported that  CBP officials have not yet defined the mission benefits expected from  implementing the new Plan, which could help improve CBP\u2019s ability to  assess the effectiveness of the Plan as it is implemented.", "In addition, we reported that CBP\u2019s 10-year life cycle cost estimate for the  Plan of $1.5 billion was based on an approximate order-of-magnitude  analysis, and agency officials were unable to determine a level of  confidence in their estimate, as best practices suggest. Specifically, we  found that the estimate reflected substantial features of best practices,  being both comprehensive and accurate, but it did not sufficiently meet  other characteristics of a high-quality cost estimate, such as credibility,  because it did not identify a level of confidence or quantify the impact of  risks. GAO and OMB guidance emphasize that reliable cost estimates are  important for program approval and continued receipt of annual funding.  In addition, because CBP was unable to determine a level of confidence  in its estimate, we reported that it would be difficult for CBP to determine  what levels of contingency funding may be needed to cover risks  associated with implementing new technologies along the remaining  Arizona border.", "We recommended in November 2011 that, among other things, CBP  document the analysis justifying the technologies proposed in the Plan,  determine its mission benefits, and determine a more robust life cycle  cost estimate for the Plan. DHS concurred with these recommendations,  and has reported taking action to address some of the recommendations.  For example, in October 2012, CBP officials reported that, through the  operation of two surveillance systems under SBInet\u2019s initial deployment in  high-priority regions of the Arizona border, CBP has identified examples  of mission benefits that could result from implementing technologies  under the Plan. Additionally, CBP initiated action to update its cost  estimate for the Plan by, among other things, providing revised cost  estimates in February and March 2012 for the Integrated Fixed Towers  and Remote Video Surveillance System, the Plan\u2019s two largest projects.

OAM issued various  plans that included strategic goals, mission responsibilities, and threat  information. However, we could not identify the underlying analyses used  to link these factors to the mix and placement of resources across  locations. OAM did not have documentation that clearly linked the  deployment decisions in the plan to mission needs or threats. For  example, while the southwest border was Border Patrol\u2019s highest priority  for resources in fiscal year 2010, it did not receive a higher rate of air  support than the northern border. Similarly, OAM did not document  analyses supporting the current mix and placement of marine assets  across locations. OAM officials said at the time that while they generally  documented final decisions affecting the mix and placement of resources,  they did not have the resources to document assessments and analyses  to support these decisions. However, we reported that such  documentation of significant events could help the office improve the  transparency of its resource allocation decisions to help demonstrate the  effectiveness of these resource decisions in fulfilling its mission needs  and addressing threats. We recommended in March 2012 that CBP  document analyses, including mission requirements and threats, that  support decisions on the mix and placement of OAM\u2019s air and marine  resources. DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it  plans to provide additional documentation of its analyses supporting  decisions on the mix and placement of air and marine resources by 2014.", "Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Tierney, and members of the  subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
