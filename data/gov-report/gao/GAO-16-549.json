In 2007, faced with a mounting backlog of required tests, DOE's NNSA announced plans to use its Enhanced Surveillance Program for a more cost-effective surveillance approach under its 2007 Surveillance Transformation initiative. Under this initiative, predictive models were to assess the impact of aging on weapons in the stockpile without having to dismantle them as the agency has done in the past.", "The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision that GAO review the status of the Enhanced Surveillance Program. This report assesses the extent to which NNSA implemented the vision for the Enhanced Surveillance Program from its 2007 initiative and developed a long-term strategy for the program. GAO reviewed NNSA plans and budget and other documents; interviewed agency officials; and discussed surveillance issues with members of a group of nationally known scientists who advise the government and who reviewed the program in September 2013."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) did not fully implement the Enhanced Surveillance Program as envisioned in the agency's 2007 Surveillance Transformation Project (2007 initiative) and has not developed a long-term strategy for the program. Surveillance is the process of inspecting a weapon through various tests of the weapon as a whole, the weapon's components, and the weapon's materials to determine whether they are meeting performance expectations, through dismantling the weapon or through the use of diagnostic tools. As called for in its 2007 initiative, NNSA took steps to improve the management of the overall surveillance program, which primarily tests dismantled weapons and their components, but the agency did not increase the role of the Enhanced Surveillance Program, as envisioned. The program develops computational models to predict the impact of stockpile aging; identifies aging signs; and develops diagnostic tools. Under the 2007 initiative, NNSA was to conduct more Enhanced Surveillance Program evaluations using computer models to predict the impacts of aging on specific weapon components\u2014especially nonnuclear components and materials\u2014and to assess the validity of more diagnostic tools. Instead of expanding the program's role, NNSA reduced program funding by more than 50 percent from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2015. NNSA also delayed some key activities and reduced the program's scope during this time. For example, NNSA did not complete its proposed evaluations of the impact of aging on nonnuclear components and materials. These evaluations, originally estimated to be completed by 2012, were dropped as program goals in fiscal year 2016, according to NNSA officials and contractor representatives.", "In fiscal year 2016, NNSA broadly refocused the Enhanced Surveillance Program on multiple nuclear weapon life-extension efforts and supporting activities but has not developed a corresponding long-term strategy for the program. Instead, program officials have focused on developing general long-term goals and managing the program on a year-to-year basis under reduced funding levels to maintain key stockpile assessment capabilities. These general goals, however, do not provide measureable outcomes or encompass the entirety of the program. In addition, as GAO's previous work has shown, managing longer term work, such as multiyear technology development projects, on an annual basis makes it difficult for Congress and other decision makers to understand up front what they are funding and what benefits they can expect. As a result, these projects may receive a lower priority and may not be consistently funded. GAO's body of work has identified a number of leading practices in federal strategic planning that include defining strategic goals, defining strategies and resources for achieving these goals, and developing and using performance measures to track progress in achieving these goals and to inform management decision making. A new strategy for the Enhanced Surveillance Program that incorporates outcome-oriented strategic goals, addresses management challenges and identifies resources needed to achieve these goals, and develops and uses performance measures to track progress in achieving goals would allow the agency to better inform long-term planning and management decision making for the program as well as help ensure that it complements NNSA's other efforts to assess the nuclear weapons stockpile."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the NNSA Administrator develop a long-term strategy for the Enhanced Surveillance Program that incorporates leading practices.

From 1945 to 1992,  the United States conducted both nuclear and nonnuclear testing to  ensure the reliability and performance of these weapons. Nuclear testing  was largely conducted through underground, underwater, and  aboveground explosions, and, since the 1960s, the United States has  supplemented underground tests with a program of weapons analysis  using nonnuclear laboratory and flight testing. Since 1992, the United  States has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing, with the result that  the United States must rely on other methods to ensure that the aging  weapons remaining in the nuclear stockpile are safe and reliable.", "In 1995, the President established an annual stockpile assessment and  reporting requirement to help ensure that the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons  remained safe and reliable without underground nuclear testing.  Subsequently, Congress enacted into law the requirement for an annual  stockpile assessment process. The National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the  Department of Energy (DOE), provides input to the annual assessment  on the basis of, in large part, a variety of tests that it conducts on  weapons returned from the stockpile and supplemental information  provided from aging studies under its stockpile surveillance program.  Surveillance is the process of inspecting individual weapons through  various tests of the weapon as a whole, the weapon\u2019s components, and  the weapon\u2019s materials to determine whether they are meeting  performance expectations. Through this program, NNSA obtains critical  information on the condition of the stockpile that, among other things,  informs the annual assessment process. According to NNSA\u2019s Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan, the stockpile surveillance program  comprises two key efforts\u2014the Core Surveillance program (Core  Surveillance) and the Enhanced Surveillance Program. While these  programs share the common goals of improving and reducing the cost of  surveillance, according to NNSA officials, NNSA has designed each effort  to conduct different types of activities. NNSA also provides separate  sources of funding for each effort.", "According to officials at NNSA, Core Surveillance has historically been  used to detect \u201cbirth defects\u201d of weapons\u2014the manufacturing defects or  signs of aging in current components and materials. These weapons and  weapons components are chosen, either randomly or specifically, from  the stockpile each year for evaluation. NNSA\u2019s national security  laboratories and NNSA production plants evaluate weapons and their  components largely by dismantling weapons to evaluate their condition  and obtain information on their reliability. According to agency  documents, NNSA\u2019s Enhanced Surveillance Program is intended to gain  a better long-term understanding of the impacts of aging on weapons. To  do so, the Enhanced Surveillance Program conducts lifetime  assessments and aging studies to predict where and when defects may  occur in weapons and their components in the future; builds  computational models; and develops diagnostic tools primarily for Core  Surveillance, as well as other stockpile organizations. The program also  assists in assessing the safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile and  evaluates weapons components and materials for NNSA weapons  programs focusing on component reuse or weapons life extension.", "In 2007, faced with budgetary constraints; a mounting backlog of Core  Surveillance\u2019s required weapons tests; and concerns raised by us,  Congress, the Department of Defense (DOD), and others, NNSA  developed an initiative to revise its approach to stockpile surveillance\u2014 the Surveillance Transformation Project (2007 initiative). According to  NNSA\u2019s implementation plan for the 2007 initiative, it would provide a  more cost-effective, flexible way to address the mounting backlog of  mandatory tests and to meet the future surveillance needs of an aging  stockpile. NNSA outlined key goals for transforming Core Surveillance  and the Enhanced Surveillance Program in its 2007 initiative project  plan. According to an NNSA official who was involved in the 2007  initiative and NNSA documents, one key effort was to develop capabilities  to predict the condition of the stockpile over its lifetime by increasing the  ability to understand and predict the impacts of aging, particularly on  nonnuclear components, without dismantling them, thereby reducing the  overall number of weapons and components required to be  disassembled. By, among other things, increasing the nondestructive  evaluations of nonnuclear components and materials\u2014work that was to  be largely conducted under the Enhanced Surveillance Program\u2014NNSA  sought to reduce Core Surveillance\u2019s backlog of mandated nonnuclear  laboratory tests requiring the dismantling of these components.", "Over the past several years, NNSA has budgeted less funding for the  Enhanced Surveillance Program. For example, in fiscal year 2015,  NNSA budgeted about 30 percent less funding than for the prior fiscal  year for the program. Outside experts and the directors of NNSA\u2019s three  national security laboratories have voiced concerns about the possible  impacts that Enhanced Surveillance Program cuts could have on the  agency\u2019s ability to fully assess the condition of the stockpile in the future.  Specifically, according to representatives of the JASON group, recent  changes to Enhanced Surveillance Program funding pose a risk that  NNSA may not have the tools it needs in the future to fully assess  whether the stockpile remains safe and reliable. Within NNSA, the  directors for the agency\u2019s three nuclear security laboratories, where the  majority of the Enhanced Surveillance Program activities are conducted,  have voiced similar concerns.", "The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision that we review, among other  things, the status of the Enhanced Surveillance Program, including  NNSA\u2019s long-term strategy for the program. This report assesses the  extent to which NNSA has implemented the vision for the Enhanced  Surveillance Program found in its 2007 initiative and the extent to which  NNSA has developed a long-term strategy for the program.", "To do this work, we reviewed stockpile surveillance program documents,  including the annual Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan,  Enhanced Surveillance Program Implementation Plan, and Surveillance  Transformation Project Plan. We also reviewed NNSA budgetary  documents, our prior reports, and DOE Office of Inspector General  reports on NNSA\u2019s stockpile surveillance program.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and  Russia, which entered into force on February 5, 2011, is to reduce the  operationally deployed stockpile even further by 2018. Weapons that  were originally produced on average 25 to 30 years ago are now well past  their original design life of approximately 15 to 20 years. In addition, no  new nuclear weapons have been developed since the closing days of the  Cold War.", "Before the end of the U.S. underground nuclear testing program in 1992,  developing and maintaining the nuclear stockpile were largely  accomplished by a continual cycle of weapon design, weapon testing,  and the incorporation of lessons learned in the next design. A critical step  in this process was conducting underground nuclear explosive tests.  Since 1992, the United States has observed a self-imposed moratorium  on nuclear explosive testing and has, instead, relied on a program of  nonnuclear testing and modeling to ensure the reliability, safety, and  effectiveness of the stockpile. While the United States maintains the  policy of no new nuclear testing or weapon designs, and the stockpile is  reduced in absolute numbers, confidence in the existing stockpile and the  effectiveness of the deterrent must remain high to meet U.S. national  security needs. For this reason, the United States is continuing to  modernize the existing stockpile through life-extension programs (LEP).  LEPs are modifications that refurbish warheads or bombs by replacing  aged components with the intent of extending the service life of weapons  by 20 to 30 years, while increasing safety, improving security, and  addressing defects.", "NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs is responsible for the manufacture,  maintenance, refurbishment, surveillance, and dismantlement of nuclear  weapons. Most modern nuclear weapons consist of three sets of  materials and components\u2014a primary, a secondary, and a set of  nonnuclear components. When detonated, the primary and secondary  components, which together are referred to as the weapon\u2019s \u201cnuclear  explosive package,\u201d produce the weapon\u2019s explosive force, or \u201cyield.\u201d  Some nonnuclear components\u2014collectively called \u201climited-life  components\u201d\u2014have shorter service lives than the weapons themselves  and, therefore, must be periodically replaced.", "There are two key efforts in the stockpile surveillance program\u2014Core  Surveillance and the Enhanced Surveillance Program. NNSA\u2019s Core  Surveillance, in one form or the other, has been in place for nearly 60  years.

The creation of the  Enhanced Surveillance Program in the mid-1990s came at a time when  concerns were growing (1) with an aging stockpile and (2) that Core  Surveillance tended to produce diminishing returns. More specifically, in a  2006 study, NNSA and the Sandia National Laboratories found that as  more is known about manufacturing and current aging defects\u2014the focus  of Core Surveillance\u2014fewer and fewer manufacturing-related defects are  discovered. This 2006 study suggested a different approach to  surveillance for aging weapons. According to NNSA officials, the  Enhanced Surveillance Program conducts three key activities:", "Aging studies. Enhanced Surveillance Program aging studies  support decisions on when and whether to reuse or replace weapons  components and materials. As part of these studies the program  identifies and develops new materials and components that can  substitute for materials that are no longer available; identifies  inadequately performing components; and assesses performance of  existing components to assist in weapons life-extension decisions. For  example, to assist in making decisions on the life extension of  weapons, the Enhanced Surveillance Program assessed the  feasibility of reusing certain components. Specifically, according to  NNSA documents, in fiscal year 2014, the Enhanced Surveillance  Program validated the reuse of a battery for one weapon through  aging studies, resulting in eliminating the need and cost to redesign  the part. In another example, according to NNSA officials, Enhanced  Surveillance Program aging models made it possible to certify the  potential reuse of a key part of the W80 warhead to allow life  extension of that weapon. NNSA also uses information from these  aging studies in LEPs to guide decisions on when future weapons  modifications, alterations, and life extensions need to occur to reduce  the risk of potential problems from future defects. Finally, NNSA uses  information from the aging studies in the national security laboratory  directors\u2019 annual assessment of the condition of the stockpile.", "Computational modeling. On the basis of its aging studies and other  data, the Enhanced Surveillance Program develops computational  models to predict the impacts of aging on weapons components and  materials. According to the Enhanced Surveillance Program\u2019s federal  program manager, computational predictive models primarily benefit  weapons systems managers at the three nuclear security laboratories.  The federal program manager noted that the models allow a  projection of the future performance of the systems and anticipate  failures with sufficient time to correct them.", "Diagnostic tool development.

The concerns date back to the mid-1990s. For example, our  July 1996 report on the surveillance program found the agency was  behind in conducting surveillance tests and did not have written plans for  addressing the backlog. A January 2001 internal NNSA review of the  surveillance program made several recommendations to improve  surveillance, including addressing the selection and testing approach for  weapons and components, developing new tools to allow for  nondestructive testing of the stockpile, improving aging and performance  models, and achieving closer coordination and integration of Core  Surveillance and the Enhanced Surveillance Program. Further, an April  2004 review of the Enhanced Surveillance Program by DOE\u2019s Office of  Inspector General found that NNSA experienced delays in completing  some Enhanced Surveillance Program milestones and was at risk of not  meeting future milestones. The report noted that such delays could  result in NNSA\u2019s being unprepared to identify age-related defects in  weapons and impact the agency\u2019s ability to annually assess the condition  of the stockpile. Finally, an October 2006 DOE Office of Inspector  General report found that NNSA had not eliminated its surveillance  testing backlog.", "Faced with this criticism, a growing backlog of Core Surveillance\u2019s  traditional surveillance testing, budgetary pressures, and an aging  stockpile, NNSA developed its 2007 initiative. According to its project  plan, the 2007 initiative sought to establish clear requirements for  determining stockpile surveillance needs and to integrate all surveillance  activities\u2014to include Core Surveillance and the Enhanced Surveillance  Program\u2014through a strengthened management structure. In addition,  NNSA sought to create a more flexible, cost-effective, and efficient  surveillance program by, among other things, dismantling fewer weapons  and increasing the understanding of the impact of aging on weapons,  components, and materials by being able to predict the effects of aging  activities. According to an NNSA official who previously oversaw  surveillance activities, because of the nature of its work, the Enhanced  Surveillance Program was intended to be a key part of this transformation  effort. More specifically, according to the 2007 initiative project plan, one  proposal was to increase evaluations of aging effects on nonnuclear  weapons components and materials. The 2007 initiative project plan  noted that more than 100 such evaluations would be undertaken at the  Sandia National Laboratories in fiscal year 2007, the first year of the  initiative\u2019s implementation.

In addition, the agency had implemented a governance  structure consisting of working committees to harmonize requirements  between Core Surveillance and the Enhanced Surveillance Program.  Furthermore, the agency had created a senior-level position to lead the  overall surveillance effort and better integrate Core Surveillance and the  Enhanced Surveillance Program.", "However, according to NNSA documents and officials, the agency did not  fully implement its envisioned role for the Enhanced Surveillance  Program. Instead of increasing the role of the program by conducting the  range of aging studies as envisioned, NNSA budgeted less funding to it,  delayed some planned work, and transferred work to other NNSA  programs. The amount of funding the agency budgeted to the Enhanced  Surveillance Program declined from $87 million in fiscal year 2007\u2014the  first year of the 2007 initiative\u2019s implementation\u2014to $79 million in fiscal  year 2008. NNSA has continued to budget less funding to the Enhanced  Surveillance Program. Funding dropped to approximately $38 million in  fiscal year 2015, a reduction of more than 50 percent from fiscal year  2007. While the Enhanced Surveillance Program has experienced  reductions in funding and scope since the 2007 initiative, Core  Surveillance funding has generally kept pace with required stockpile  testing, according to an NNSA official. After an initial funding reduction  from $195 million in fiscal year 2007 to $158 million in fiscal year 2009,  NNSA increased the budgeted funding to Core Surveillance in 2010 and  has stabilized its funding levels since then. Agency officials said they  believe the Core Surveillance program is now generally stable. Figure 1  shows funding levels for the two programs for fiscal years 2007 through  2015.", "NNSA also delayed some key Enhanced Surveillance Program activities  during this time. For example, NNSA did not complete the proposed  evaluations of the effects of aging on nonnuclear components and  materials that were to be largely carried out at the Sandia National  Laboratories. These evaluations\u2014which NNSA viewed as an important  part of the Enhanced Surveillance Program when it was being managed  as a campaign, according to an NNSA official\u2014were initiated in fiscal  year 2007 and originally estimated to be completed by 2012. However, a  2010 NNSA review concluded these evaluations had not occurred.  According to a contract representative at the Sandia National  Laboratories overseeing Enhanced Surveillance Program work, these  evaluations no longer have an estimated time frame for completion and  their systematic completion, as was once envisioned, is no longer a  program goal. Furthermore, while the program has developed some  diagnostic tools to aid Core Surveillance, such as high-resolution  computed tomography image analysis, NNSA officials and the NNSA  fiscal year 2016 budget request said that other efforts to develop  diagnostic tools had been deferred because of lack of funding.", "In addition, NNSA transferred some Enhanced Surveillance Program  work to other programs. For example, NNSA transferred experiments  (and related funding) to measure aging effects and to provide lifetime  assessments on the plutonium pits\u2014a key nuclear weapons  component\u2014from the Enhanced Surveillance Program to NNSA\u2019s  Science Campaign in fiscal year 2009.", "According to the Enhanced Surveillance Program\u2019s federal program  manager, NNSA has budgeted reduced funding because of competing  internal priorities. The federal program manager said that the Enhanced  Surveillance Program has to compete for funding with other internal high- priority activities, such as LEPs and infrastructure projects in a climate  of overall agency funding constraints caused by, among other things,  internal agency pressures to achieve budgetary savings to enable  modernization of the stockpile and other priorities. In addition, Core  Surveillance\u2019s importance in detecting \u201cbirth defects\u201d of weapons\u2014the  manufacturing defects or signs of aging in current components and  materials\u2014has increased, according to NNSA officials, as NNSA has  undertaken and completed more LEPs. In fiscal year 2016, NNSA shifted  the focus of some of its RDT&E efforts, including efforts in the Enhanced  Surveillance Program, to meet the immediate needs of its ongoing and  planned LEPs and related supporting efforts. According to NNSA officials,  the funding and scope reductions in the Enhanced Surveillance Program  reflect ongoing internal prioritization tensions within NNSA over meeting  immediate needs\u2014such as understanding current stockpile condition  using traditional surveillance methods\u2014and investing in the science,  technology, and engineering activities needed to understand the impacts  of aging on weapons and their components in the future.", "The Enhanced Surveillance Program federal program manager as well as  other stakeholders, such as the JASON group of experts, noted funding  changes may have a larger impact on the program than is immediately  apparent. NNSA officials said that the program plays a considerably  broader role in assessing the condition of the stockpile than its name  suggests and supports a wide variety of efforts, including the statutorily  required annual assessment process, weapons life extension and  modernization programs, and ongoing efforts to maintain weapons  systems. According to a 2014 NNSA analysis conducted by the  Enhanced Surveillance Program\u2019s federal program manager, slightly less  than 15 percent of the program\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget allocation  supported the development of diagnostic tools largely for Core  Surveillance. About half of the program\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget  allocation went to conducting aging studies, predictive modeling, and  component and material evaluation studies that may support Core  Surveillance but also benefit weapons life extension and modernization  programs and ongoing efforts to maintain weapons systems, according to  agency officials.

The  Enhanced Surveillance Program has general long-term goals, such as  \u201cdeveloping tools and information useful to ensure the stockpile is healthy  and reliable.\u201d However, the program\u2019s long-term goals do not provide  outcomes that are measurable or that encompass the entirety of the  program. NNSA officials told us they use annual goals, which help  manage work on a yearly basis. For example, the program\u2019s goals for  fiscal year 2015 included \u201cdevelop, validate and deploy improved  predictive capabilities and diagnostics to assess performance and lifetime  for nuclear and non-nuclear materials.\u201d By managing work on an annual  basis, longer-term work\u2014such as technology development projects  extended over several years\u2014may receive a lower priority and thus,  according to NNSA officials, may not be funded.", "In addition, NNSA funds the program\u2019s annual requirements as part of the  agency\u2019s annual budget formulation process and funds the program in  accordance with the agency\u2019s internal process for allocating its budget  authority. For fiscal year 2016, the agency budgeted funding for the  program at a slightly higher level to meet stockpile requirements, such as  surveillance, and the annual assessment process. However, without a  current long-term strategy for the program, NNSA cannot plan for any  management challenges that threaten its ability to meet its long-term  strategic goals or the resources needed to meet those goals.", "Moreover, NNSA program officials told us that the agency has not defined  specific quantifiable performance measures that could be used to track  the program\u2019s progress toward its long-term goals, as called for by  leading practices. The need for NNSA to develop clear, measureable  performance metrics for the Enhanced Surveillance Program has been  highlighted in past reviews, namely by DOE\u2019s Inspector General and by  the JASON group. For example, in a September 2012 report, the  Inspector General noted that NNSA\u2019s performance measure for the  program was based on the percentage of funding spent rather than on  work accomplishments. Furthermore, a July 2013 memorandum from  the director of the Office of Management and Budget to executive agency  heads noted that, in accordance with OMB Circular A-11 and GPRAMA,  agencies should describe the targeted outcomes of research and  development programs using meaningful, measurable, quantitative  metrics, where possible, and describe how they plan to evaluate the  success of the programs.", "We found in past work that effective long-term planning is needed to  guide decision making in programs, including laboratory research and  development programs, so that congressional and other decision makers  can better understand up front what they are funding and what benefits  they can expect. As NNSA refocused its research and technology  development efforts for the Enhanced Surveillance Program on LEPs and  related activities and as NNSA officials said that they recognized the need  for a new long-term strategy for the program, it is an opportune time to  incorporate sound federal strategic planning practices. A new strategy for  the program that incorporates outcome-oriented strategic goals,  addresses management challenges and identifies resources needed to  achieve these goals, and develops and uses performance measures to  track progress in achieving goals would allow the agency to better inform  long-term planning and management decision making for the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By seeking to increase the nondestructive evaluations of nonnuclear  components\u2014work that was to be conducted under the Enhanced  Surveillance Program\u2014NNSA sought to reduce Core Surveillance\u2019s  backlog of mandated system-level tests requiring the dismantling of these  components. However, NNSA did not fully implement its vision for the  Enhanced Surveillance Program in its 2007 initiative. For example, rather  than expanding the program, NNSA budgeted reduced funding for it, and  the program did not complete the proposed evaluations of the effects of  aging on nonnuclear components and materials. More recently, NNSA  directed its RDT&E programs to focus on LEPs and related activities. This  includes the Enhanced Surveillance Program. Enhanced Surveillance  Program personnel have focused on year-to-year management of a  program that has seen a nearly 50-percent funding reduction over the  past decade and have not yet sought to redefine a strategy for how the  program can best complement NNSA\u2019s other efforts to assess the  condition of the stockpile, including Core Surveillance. With funding  appearing to have been stabilized and with NNSA\u2019s adopting a different  approach for all of its RDT&E programs, it is an opportune time to  develop an Enhanced Surveillance Program strategy. A new long-term  strategy for the program that incorporates outcome-oriented strategic  goals, addresses management challenges and identifies resources  needed to achieve these goals, and develops and uses performance  measures to track progress in achieving goals would allow the agency to  better inform long-term planning and management decision making for  the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that NNSA can better inform long-term planning and  management decision making as well as to ensure that the Enhanced  Surveillance Program complements NNSA\u2019s other efforts to assess the  nuclear weapons stockpile, we recommend that the NNSA Administrator  develop a long-term strategy for the Enhanced Surveillance Program that  incorporates outcome-oriented strategic goals, addresses management  challenges and identifies resources needed to achieve these goals, and  develops and uses performance measures to track progress in achieving  these goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the NNSA Administrator for review  and comment.
