In addition, about $137 million in federal funding in four other major programs was directed to housing counseling, which can include elements of financial education. Since fiscal year 2010, at least four of these programs have been defunded and CFPB has received resources to fund its financial literacy activities.", "Federal financial literacy and housing counseling activities are spread across multiple agencies and programs. GAO has not identified duplication\u2014programs providing the same activities and services to the same beneficiaries\u2014but has found overlap\u2014multiple programs with similar goals and activities\u2014in areas such as housing counseling and the financial education of youth. Further, CFPB was charged with some financial education duties that overlap with those of other federal agencies, making it essential that their respective roles and responsibilities be clearly delineated to ensure efficient use of resources. Moreover, CFPB\u2019s creation may signal an opportunity for consolidating some federal financial literacy efforts, which would be consistent with federal goals of reorganizing and consolidating federal agencies to reduce the number of overlapping government programs.", "Federal agencies have made progress in recent years in coordinating their financial literacy activities and collaborating with nonfederal entities, in large part due to the efforts of the federal multiagency Financial Literacy and Education Commission. The commission\u2019s 2011 national strategy includes some useful elements\u2014such as plans to coordinate interagency communication, improve strategic partnerships, and promote evaluation. However, it does not recommend or provide guidance on the appropriate allocation of federal resources among programs and agencies, which GAO has found to be desirable in a national strategy. While the commission\u2019s governance structure presents challenges in addressing resource issues, without a clear discussion of resource needs and where resources should be targeted, policymakers lack information to help direct the strategy\u2019s implementation and help ensure efficient use of funds.", "The wide range of federal financial literacy activities and evaluation methods makes it difficult to systematically assess overall effectiveness or compare results across programs. Among the federal financial literacy programs that we reviewed, most included some evaluation component. Some measured the effect on participant behavior and others assessed changes in participant knowledge or tracked output measures, such as the number of consumers reached. Rigorous evaluation measuring behavior change is costly and methodologically challenging and may not be practical for all types of activities. However, CFPB and other federal entities have new efforts under way that seek to determine the most effective approaches and programs, which GAO believes to be positive steps toward helping ensure the best and most efficient use of federal financial literacy resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CFPB clearly delineate with other agencies respective roles and responsibilities, and that the Financial Literacy and Education Commission identify options for consolidating federal financial literacy efforts and address the allocation of federal resources in its national strategy.

Instead, financial literacy activities were often one element of a  broader effort that itself may or may not have had discrete funding. In  these cases, we asked agency staff to estimate the portion of program  costs that could be attributed to financial literacy activities. This typically  entailed estimating the cost for the portion of staff time devoted to  financial literacy, and sometimes also included the cost of contracts,  printing, or other resources related to financial literacy activities.

HUD also has  15 other active programs that have some housing counseling component or allow some portion of their funding to be used for housing counseling.In addition, NeighborWorks America, a federally chartered nonprofit  corporation, was appropriated $65 million for the National Foreclosure  Mitigation Counseling Program during fiscal year 2010, of which it  expended $59.4 million in grants for counseling, $3 million for training  counselors, and $2.6 million for administrative purposes, according to  agency staff.

That report, issued by  the RAND Corporation, was based on a survey conducted by Treasury  and the Department of Education that had asked federal agencies to self- identify their financial literacy efforts. However, our subsequent analysis  of these 56 programs found a high degree of inconsistency in how  different agencies defined financial literacy programs or efforts and  whether they counted related efforts as one or multiple programs. We  believe that our count of 16 significant federal financial literacy programs  or activities and 4 housing counseling programs is based on a more  consistent set of criteria. (See app. II for a crosswalk between the 56  programs cited in a previous report and the 20 programs highlighted in  this report.) We defined \u201csignificant\u201d financial literacy programs or  activities as those that were relatively comprehensive in scope or scale\u2014 that is, financial literacy was a key element rather than a minimal  component or tangential goal. We did not include programs or activities  that (1) provided financial information related to the administration of the  program itself\u2014such as information on applying for student financial aid  or evaluating Medicare choices\u2014rather than information aimed at  increasing the beneficiaries\u2019 financial literacy and comprehension more  generally; (2) were purely internal to the agency, such as information  provided to agency employees on their employment and retirement  benefits; or (3) represented individualized services or advice, such as  assistance with tax preparation. Apart from the programs cited in the  tables above, some additional federal agencies address financial literacy  on a smaller scale. For example, the website of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) includes such things as tips on banking  and protecting your money, and information on foreclosure prevention,  identity theft, and deposit insurance. In addition, the website of the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission provides information on fraud  awareness and prevention related to trading futures and options.", "Fragmentation of financial literacy programs has evolved over a number  of years, as a result both of statutory requirements and efforts undertaken at the initiative of federal agencies in addressing their missions.Congress directed the creation of some programs and initiatives,  examples of which include the following:", "The Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Retirement Readiness NOW  program and the development of a retirement financial literacy  strategy for federal employees were required by the Thrift Savings  Plan Open Elections Act of 2004.", "The Financial Education and Counseling Pilot Program was created  by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.", "The Financial Education for College Access and Success Program  was authorized under the Fund for the Improvement of Education  Program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965.", "The National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program was  authorized through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, which  sought to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis by providing  homeowner counseling and strengthening the nation\u2019s counseling  capacity.", "Pub.

For example, in line with the Securities and Exchange  Commission\u2019s (SEC) mission as the primary overseer and regulator of the  U.S. securities markets, the agency created the Office of Investor  Education and Advocacy, which gives investors information to evaluate  current and potential investments, make informed decisions, and avoid  fraudulent schemes. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC)  financial literacy efforts have stemmed from its responsibilities for  enforcing laws and regulations against unfair or deceptive acts or  practices and protecting consumers in the marketplace.", "Having multiple federal agencies involved in financial literacy efforts can  have certain advantages. Some agencies have deep and long-standing  expertise and experience addressing a specific issue area. For example,  HUD has long been a repository for information on housing issues, SEC  on investment issues, and the Department of Labor and Social Security  Administration on retirement issues. Some agencies also have deep  knowledge and ties to particular populations and may be the most  efficient and natural conduit to providing them with information and  services, as with the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) role in providing  financial information and counseling to servicemembers and their  families. In addition, providing information from multiple sources or in  multiple formats can increase consumer access and the likelihood of  educating more people. We have previously reported that different  populations respond to different types of delivery mechanisms, such as  one-on-one credit counseling, employer-provided retirement seminars,  and classroom-based education.", "At the same time, fragmentation increases the risk of inefficiency and  duplication of efforts. Our detailed review of financial literacy efforts  across the federal government has uncovered no duplication\u2014that is,  cases where two or more agencies or programs were engaging in the  same efforts and providing the same services to the same beneficiaries.  In our analysis of the 20 significant financial literacy and housing  counseling programs, we found that programs and efforts had differing  focuses in terms of subject matter, target audience, or delivery method.  This finding is largely consistent with prior reviews of the federal  government\u2019s financial literacy efforts. In 2006, the Financial Literacy and  Education Commission reported that it had studied federal financial  literacy programs or resources and said it found minimal overlap and  duplication among programs, noting that even when different agencies\u2019  programs sometimes appeared similar, closer inspection revealed  important differences in things like the target audience, delivery platform,  or specific content. In response to a recommendation we made that the  commission engage an independent third party to assess these issues,  two subsequent studies were conducted. The first study, contracted by  Treasury to assess federal programs, reported little evidence of  duplication of programs or resources based on comparisons of the  intended program goals and targeted audiences of the assessed  programs and major resources. The second study resulted in the  previously discussed 2009 report by the RAND Corporation, which sought  to create a comprehensive catalog of existing federal financial literacy  programs. It did not identify clear duplication, but it did note that multiple  areas of overlap in subject matter and target audiences warranted more  thorough investigation.", "Our review did identify cases of overlap\u2014that is, multiple agencies or  programs with similar goals and activities. For example, as shown earlier,  in fiscal year 2010 there were four discrete housing counseling programs  or activities, which were administered by HUD, NeighborWorks America,  and Treasury.wide range of housing counseling, including prepurchase and  postpurchase counseling and counseling related to foreclosure mitigation  and prevention of predatory lending, as well as counseling services for   HUD\u2019s Housing Counseling Assistance Program funded a  renters and homeless populations.Counseling Pilot Program had goals similar to HUD\u2019s program, although it  focused solely on prepurchase counseling and was intended, in part, to  establish innovative program models for organizations to carry out  effective counseling services. NeighborWorks also provided some  prepurchase counseling and administered the foreclosure mitigation  counseling program designed to help homeowners work with lenders to  cure delinquencies. HUD and NeighborWorks meet regularly and closely  coordinate activities to be complementary, according to HUD staff.", "Treasury\u2019s Financial Education and  Similarly, five different financial literacy programs were directed at youth  or young adults in fiscal year 2010. Three of these programs\u2014Money  Smart for Young Adults, Money Math, and the National Financial  Capability Challenge\u2014delivered information on similar topics, such as  saving, budgeting, and borrowing, largely via instructor-led lesson plans.  The Excellence in Economic Education Program and the Financial  Education for College Access and Success Program both supported the  development of personal finance instructional materials and teacher  training on personal finance. In addition, FTC addresses youth financial  literacy through an interactive website where youth can play games,  design advertisements, and learn about activities related to target  marketing, supply and demand, privacy protection, and bogus offers. The  website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System also  offers interactive games and classroom activities on its website for youth  and young adults. Treasury staff told us that while all of these programs  serve youth or young adults, there are significant variations among them  in approach and in content. The staff noted, for example, that the goal of  the National Financial Capability Challenge is to encourage the teaching  of financial topics, rather than to provide content, and that the curricula of  the Money Math and Money Smart for Young Adults programs differ  substantially from each other.", "Another example of overlap can be found in two federal financial literacy  programs designed specifically for adult women. The Department of  Labor\u2019s Wi$eUp program targeted Generation X and Y women\u2014women  generally born between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s\u2014and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Education and  Resource Center on Women and Retirement Planning targeted  traditionally hard-to-reach women, such as low-income women, women of  color, and women with limited English proficiency. Both programs cover  some of the same topic areas, such as retirement planning, investing, and  money basics such as budgeting, saving, and banking. However, staff at  the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human  Services noted that the programs target different users, have different  goals, and engage in different activities\u2014for example, Wi$eUp is an  online and classroom curriculum, while the National Resource Center  uses peer counselors and offers information through model programs,  workshops tailored to meet special needs, and print and web-based  publications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creation of CFPB May Provide Opportunities for Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["Additional overlap is evident with the activities of CFPB, which was  created by the Dodd-Frank Act and became a standing organization in  July 2011. The act established within CFPB an Office of Financial  Education and charged it with developing and implementing initiatives  intended to educate and empower consumers to make better informed  financial decisions. Specifically, the office was directed to provide  opportunities for consumers to access, among other things, financial  counseling; information to assist consumers with understanding credit  products, histories, and scores; information about savings and borrowing  tools; and assistance in developing long-term savings strategies and  wealth building.

Further, the Dodd-Frank Act charged CFPB with developing and  implementing a strategy on improving the financial literacy of consumers,  even though the Financial Literacy and Education Commission already  has its own statutory mandate to develop, and update as necessary, a  national strategy for financial literacy. CFPB staff told us that its own  national strategy for financial literacy will serve as an operating plan that  is distinct from, but broadly aligned with, the commission\u2019s national  strategy. Staff involved in financial literacy from Treasury and CFPB told  us that they meet regularly and that the two agencies are working closely  together to ensure collaboration and avoid duplication.", "CFPB also has other offices that are charged with financial literacy duties  that are in some ways similar to those of other federal agencies. For  example, the Dodd-Frank Act created within CFPB an Office of  Servicemember Affairs, which is responsible for, among other things,  developing and implementing initiatives intended to educate  servicemembers and their families and empower them to make better  informed decisions regarding consumer financial products and services,  monitoring complaints, and coordinating efforts among federal and state  agencies regarding consumer protection measures. These activities  potentially overlap with those of DOD, whose Personal Financial  Managers on military installations provide financial educational programs,  partnerships, counseling, legal protections, and other resources designed  to help servicemembers and their families. Staff of CFPB\u2019s Office of  Servicemember Affairs told us that the office has been actively reaching  out to servicemembers where they live in order to assess their needs, and  between January 2011 and May 2012, the office held 84 events attended  by more than 24,000 people and visited 37 military installations and  National Guard units. Staff also told us that they have taken several steps  to avoid duplicating DOD\u2019s Financial Readiness Program. For example,  they said they will be focusing on reaching servicemembers in the  Delayed Entry Program, a period prior to boot camp during which DOD  does not yet engage in financial education. In addition, CFPB staff said  they have been meeting monthly with DOD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy and his staff to  coordinate their activities to avoid duplication across agencies. CFPB and  DOD have also developed two Joint Statements of Principles, one on how  they are going to handle complaints and the other on educational efforts  and small-dollar lending.", "In addition, CFPB and several other agencies provide financial literacy  services that target older Americans. The Dodd-Frank Act created the  Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans within CFPB and  charged the office to develop goals for programs that provide financial  literacy and counseling to help seniors recognize the warning signs of  unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, and protect themselves from such  practices. These activities potentially overlap with those of FTC, which  also plays a role in helping seniors avoid unfair and deceptive practices.  For example, FTC has provided information to seniors on a range of  topics, such as obtaining credit over the age of 62, avoiding charity fraud,  recognizing and reporting telemarketing fraud, and avoiding scammers  who may pose as friends, family, or government agencies. In an effort to  work together and avoid duplication, CFPB and FTC finalized a  memorandum of understanding in January 2012 to help, among other  things, cooperate on consumer education efforts, promote consistency of  messages, and maximize the use of educational resources. The Dodd- Frank Act also charged the Office of Financial Protection for Older  Americans to develop goals for programs that provide one-on-one  financial counseling on long-term savings and later-life economic security.  As discussed earlier, the Department of Labor\u2019s Saving Matters  Retirement Savings Education Campaign also plays a role in educating  consumers on retirement issues and the Social Security Administration  had a special initiative, as part of an earlier strategic plan, to encourage  saving and to inform the public about its programs. In January 2012, staff  at CFPB told us that the Office of Financial Protection for Older  Americans had only recently become fully staffed and that the office had  begun working with other federal and state agencies to identify best  practices for educating and counseling senior citizens, identifying unfair  and deceptive practices targeting this population, and advocating on their  behalf.", "Other potential areas of overlap include CFPB\u2019s Office of Fair Lending  and Equal Opportunity, which plays a role in providing education on fair  lending, as do the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC, and  FTC. CFPB has also created an Office for Students to work with  complaints and questions regarding student loans. However, the  Department of Education already has a number of web-based tools in  place to help students understand financial aid and student loans. CFPB  staff told us that one key distinction is that CFPB addresses private  student loans, while the Department of Education addresses federally  supported student loans. They also noted that they are coordinating with  the Department of Education and have developed a memorandum of  understanding with the department, and have jointly designed a standard  student loan award letter and fact sheet.", "The Dodd-Frank Act gave CFPB a primary role in addressing financial  literacy, and the agency\u2019s Office of Financial Education\u2014staffed at 10 full- time equivalents as of June 2012\u2014has significant financial literacy  resources relative to many other agencies. Yet there are similarities in  mission between CFPB\u2019s statutory responsibilities and those of certain  other federal entities. As we have noted in the past, federal programs  contributing to the same or similar results should collaborate to help  ensure that goals are consistent and, as appropriate, program efforts are  mutually reinforcing. Collaborating agencies should work together to  define and agree on their respective roles and responsibilities and, in  doing so, clarify who will do what and organize their joint and individual  efforts.

Some of  these evaluations sought to assess the effect of the program on the  actual behavior of program participants and some assessed the effect of  the program on knowledge, attitudes, or anticipated behavior. As we have  reported in the past, in general the ultimate goal of financial education is  to favorably affect consumer behavior, such as to promote improved  saving and spending habits and wise use of credit.

Some financial literacy programs  and activities, such as those using broadcast media to disseminate  information, may also simply not be well-suited to outcome-based  evaluation because the program has no direct contact with the intended  audience. Further, given the many variables that can affect consumer  behavior and decision making, ascribing long-term changes to a particular  program is difficult. In addition, some program activities, such as posting  a webpage, may be too small in scope to warrant conducting an outcome  evaluation study, so tracking output measures\u2014such as the number of  individuals served or the volume of materials distributed\u2014may be the only  feasible option.

While we  uncovered no duplication, some agencies or programs do have  overlapping goals and activities, which raises the risk of inefficiency and  underscores the importance of coordination. The creation of CFPB adds a  new player to the mix. The agency will play a primary federal role in  addressing financial literacy, yet some of its responsibilities overlap with  those of other federal agencies. Effective collaboration among agencies  entails defining and agreeing on respective roles and responsibilities and  organizing collective efforts. CFPB appears to be making progress thus  far in coordinating with federal agencies that have overlapping financial  literacy responsibilities, but ensuring clear delineation of respective roles  and responsibilities will also be essential to ensure efficiency. Moreover,  the creation of CFPB may signal an opportunity for reconsidering how the  federal government\u2019s financial literacy efforts are organized. In particular,  some consolidation of these efforts could help ensure the most efficient  and effective use of federal financial literacy resources. While our  February 2012 report stated that we expected to suggest that Congress  consider options for such consolidation, the Financial Literacy and  Education Commission is better positioned to identify possible options  and this would be consistent with the commission\u2019s statutory  responsibility to propose means of eliminating overlap and duplication  among federal financial literacy activities.", "Overall, coordination among federal agencies with regard to financial  literacy has improved in recent years, and the commission has played a  critical role in this.

The commission faces the constraints of lacking its  own budget or legal authority over member agencies to take any action,  but, even so, it has the ability to provide recommendations or guidance to  Congress or federal agencies.

Treasury noted that the department has  already begun work with other members of the commission to define  specific and measurable objectives that will help agencies assess the  impact of their financial capability activities, which will provide a  framework for any resource allocation recommendations the commission  may have.", "The Department of Health and Human Services said in its response that it  disagreed that its National Education and Resource Center on Women  and Retirement Planning overlapped with the Department of Labor\u2019s  Wi$eUp program because the two programs have differing  methodologies, approaches, and target populations. We acknowledge the  differences between the two programs in our report. However, the  definition for overlap presented in this report is \u201cmultiple agencies or  programs with similar goals and activities,\u201d and we believe that this  accurately applies to these two programs, both of which are financial  literacy programs designed for adult women.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and to the heads of agencies that comprise the Financial  Literacy and Education Commission.

For the purposes of our analysis, we considered duplication to  occur when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same  activities and provide the same services to the same beneficiaries.  Overlap refers to when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals,  engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar  users. Fragmentation refers to circumstances in which more than one  federal agency is involved in the same broad area of national need. Our  report focuses largely on federal programs or activities that were relatively  comprehensive in scope or scale and included financial literacy as a key  component rather than a tangential goal. We generally excluded from our  review programs or activities for which financial literacy was only a  minimal component; that provided financial information related to the  administration of the program itself rather than information aimed at  increasing the beneficiaries\u2019 financial literacy and comprehension more  generally; that were purely internal to the agency; or that provided  individualized financial services or advice rather than education. Using  these criteria, we identified 16 significant financial literacy programs and 4  significant housing counseling programs in operation in fiscal year 2010.", "To address our first objective, we collected and reviewed the President\u2019s  Budget for fiscal years 2010, 2012, and 2013; budget justifications, as  needed; congressional appropriations; and other sources that included  cost information. For many federal agencies, financial literacy activities  were not organized as separate budget line items or cost centers. In  these cases, we asked agency staff to estimate the portion of program  costs that could be attributed to financial literacy activities for fiscal year  2010, which is the year for which we reported costs. This typically  entailed estimating the cost of that portion of staff time devoted to  financial literacy, as well as the cost of contracts, printing, or other  resources related to financial literacy activities. Because the methods for  estimating costs varied, these costs may not be fully comparable across  agencies. To assess the reliability of these estimates, we interviewed  agency staff about their cost estimation methodology, what their estimate  included, and what assumptions they used in making the estimate.  Although costs may not be comparable across the agencies because  agencies used differing methodologies, we determined that the data are  reliable for the purposes of generally estimating federal dollars spent on  financial literacy activities.", "To address our second and third objectives, we reviewed a 2009 report  by the RAND Corporation that cataloged federal financial literacy efforts;  reports from the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Financial Capability; the  national strategies and supporting documents of the Financial Literacy  and Education Commission; and other reports as appropriate. We also  reviewed the commission\u2019s MyMoney.gov website and the websites of  individual federal agencies related to financial literacy. In addition, we  reviewed federal agency strategic plans; performance and accountability  reports; budget justifications; memorandums of understanding between  agencies or with nonfederal entities; and laws related to financial literacy  activities or programs. Further, to assess the extent of overlap or  duplication, we collected and analyzed characteristics of federal financial  literacy programs and identified similarities and differences among  programs\u2019 purposes, subject matter content, targeted populations, and  delivery methods. We assessed the commission\u2019s 2011 National Strategy  for Financial Literacy, in part, by benchmarking it against our prior work  that identified the general characteristics of an effective national strategy.Those recommended characteristics for national strategies had been  developed by reviewing several sources of information, which included  the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993; legislative and  executive branch guidance for national strategies; general literature on  strategic planning and performance; and our prior work on issues related  to planning, integration, implementation, and other related subjects.", "To determine what is known about the effectiveness of federal financial  literacy activities, we collected evaluations, as well as any available  information on the outputs or outcomes of these activities. As applicable,  we reviewed output data such as information on numbers of program  participants or consumers reached, website visits, and copies of  publications or other materials distributed that were available through a  variety of sources. For example, as available, we reviewed results of  surveys of customer satisfaction, attitudes, or intention to change  behavior, and tests that measured changes in program participants\u2019  knowledge. In addition, we reviewed information on program effect that  appeared in agencies\u2019 strategic plans and performance and accountability  reports. We also reviewed the 2009 RAND report, which included self- reported information from federal agencies on methods they have used to  evaluate their financial literacy programs, and we updated this information  as necessary through interviews with agency staff. In addition, we  collected any available studies and evaluations that had been conducted  on the outcomes of federal financial literacy activities, which included  evaluations conducted by the agencies themselves or by external  researchers. Each of the studies and evaluations cited in our report was  reviewed for methodological reliability and determined to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "Finally, to address all four of our objectives, we interviewed staff who  address financial literacy issues at 17 federal agencies that we had  identified in prior work as potentially having significant involvement in  financial literacy\u2014the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Departments of  Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing  and Urban Development, Labor, and Treasury; Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation; Federal Trade Commission; Internal Revenue Service;  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Office of Personnel  Management; Securities and Exchange Commission; Social Security  Administration; and the U.S. Mint. We also interviewed staff at  NeighborWorks America (a federally chartered nonprofit corporation) and  representatives of the National Financial Education Network of State and  Local Governments, the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Financial  Capability, and two nonprofit organizations, the American Savings  Education Council and the National Endowment for Financial Education.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2011 to July 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Crosswalk between Federal Financial Literacy Programs Identified in the RAND Report and Programs Selected for Inclusion in this Report", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, the Departments of the Treasury and Education asked federal  agencies to self-identify their financial literacy efforts, which resulted in a  2009 report by the RAND Corporation that identified 56 federal financial  literacy programs among 20 agencies. We reported these results in a  2011 report, but our subsequent analysis of these 56 programs found a  high degree of inconsistency in how different agencies defined financial  literacy programs or efforts and whether they counted related efforts as  one or multiple programs. For the purposes of our current report, we  developed criteria for identifying significant federal financial literacy and  housing counseling activities and programs. We defined such activities or  programs as those that were relatively comprehensive in scope or scale  and for which financial literacy or housing counseling was a key objective  rather than a tangential goal. As appropriate, we defined a related set of  activities (such as a series of webpages from one agency) as a single  program. In addition, we excluded programs or activities (1) for which  financial literacy was only a minimal component; (2) that provided  financial information related to the administration of the program itself  rather that information aimed at increasing the beneficiaries\u2019 financial  literacy and comprehension more generally; (3) that were purely internal  to the agency, such as information provided to agency employees on their  employment and retirement benefits; and (4) that represented  individualized services or advice. We included as federal programs those  of NeighborWorks America, a government-chartered, nonprofit  corporation that receives federal funding for housing counseling, including  through an annual appropriation from Congress. Finally, the RAND report  was based on programs and activities in place in 2009, while our list  reflects programs and activities in place during fiscal year 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jason Bromberg (Assistant  Director), Kimberly Cutright, Mary Coyle, Jonathan Kucskar, Roberto  Pi\u00f1ero, Rhonda Rose, Jennifer Schwartz, and Andrew Stavisky made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
