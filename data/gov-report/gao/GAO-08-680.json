Additional factors, including rising global commodity prices and climate change, will likely further exacerbate food insecurity in the region. Agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, as measured by grain yield, is only about 40 percent of that of the rest of the world's developing countries, and the gap has widened over the years. Low agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa is due, in part, to the limited use of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizer and improved seed varieties, and the lack of modern farming practices. The efforts of host governments and donors, including the United States, to achieve the goal of halving hunger in sub-Saharan Africa by 2015 have thus far been insufficient. First, some host governments have not prioritized food security as a development goal, and, according to a 2008 report of the International Food Policy Research Institute, as of 2005, only a few countries had fulfilled a 2003 pledge to direct 10 percent of government spending to agriculture. Second, donors have reduced the priority given to agriculture, and their efforts have been further hampered by difficulties in coordination and deficiencies in measuring and monitoring progress. Third, limited agricultural development resources and a fragmented approach have impaired U.S. efforts to reduce hunger in Africa. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding to address food insecurity in Africa has been primarily for emergency food aid, which has been crucial in helping to alleviate food crises but has not addressed the underlying factors that contributed to the recurrence and severity of these crises. Also, the United States' principal strategy for meeting its commitment to halve hunger in Africa is limited to some of USAID's agricultural development activities and does not integrate other U.S. agencies' agricultural development assistance to the region."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["At the 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) in Rome, the United States and  more than 180 world leaders pledged to halve the total number of  undernourished people worldwide from the 1990 level\u2014a commitment  that they reaffirmed in 2000 when they established the Millennium  Development Goals (MDG), which included a target to halve the  proportion or the percentage of the world\u2019s population that is  undernourished by 2015.

Raising agricultural  productivity is vital to all elements of food security: food availability, food  access, and food utilization. Although imports can be used to supplement  domestic agricultural production in some countries, importing staple  foods may not be practical because some main staples, such as cassava,  are generally not traded in the international market. In addition, poor  infrastructure in many African countries makes it extremely costly to  transport imported foods to remote areas. Furthermore, because the  income of the majority of people in developing countries depends directly  or indirectly on agriculture, growth in this sector would have widespread  poverty-reducing benefits and improve food access for the poor. The  World Bank pointed out in its 2008 World Development Report that  agriculture\u2019s ability to generate income for the poor, particularly for  women, is more important for food security than its ability to increase  local food supplies. According to FAO, poverty is a main immediate cause  of food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture can also help enhance  diet quality and diversity through new and improved crop varieties,  thereby improving food utilization and nutritional status.", "Sub-Saharan Africa has lagged behind other developing countries in  improving agricultural productivity. Since the early 1960s, grain yield in  the rest of the world has increased almost 2.5 percent annually (see fig. 4).  In contrast, grain yield in sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated, with an annual  increase of only approximately 1 percent. As a result, yield of basic food  staples in sub-Saharan Africa, such as maize, is much lower than that of  other countries. For example, Zambia produces about 1,800 kilograms of  maize on a hectare of land, while China produces almost 3 times as much  on the same amount of land. Overall, the gap between the average grain  yield in sub-Saharan Africa compared with the rest of the world\u2019s  developing countries has widened over the years. By 2006, the average  grain yield in sub-Saharan Africa was only about 40 percent of the rest of  the world\u2019s developing countries. Research has also shown that the  expansion of food production has taken a very different course in Asia  than in sub-Saharan Africa, where increases in food staples were achieved  largely by expanding the area cultivated, not by increasing the yield on  existing acreage.", "Low agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa is partially due  to inadequate investment and the limited use of modern inputs and  farming practice. Panelists in all four countries we visited reported  difficulty in accessing critical inputs, such as land, seed, fertilizer, and  water, due to their high costs and limited availability. The panelists also  noted that farm management practices were weak in all four countries.  FAO data show that the investment per hectare of land in sub-Saharan  Africa is about one third of the world\u2019s average. Less than 1 percent of the  agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated, thereby making  agricultural production prone to natural disasters, such as droughts. Sub- Saharan Africa uses far less inputs, such as fertilizer and pesticide, than  other parts of the world. For example, its pesticide use is only about 5  percent of the world\u2019s average, which was 0.39 kilograms per hectare in  1998 to 2000 (see table 1). The World Bank reports that while scientific  plant breeding has improved agricultural production throughout much of  the world, sub-Saharan Africa lags behind in adoption of these new  varieties. For example, while at least 80 percent of the crop area in Asia  was planted with improved varieties of rice, maize, sorghum, and potatoes,  only about 20 percent to 40 percent of the crop area in sub-Saharan Africa  used new varieties in these categories. According to several USAID  officials, agricultural productivity has also lagged in sub-Saharan Africa, in  part because innovations in science and technologies, such as improved  seed and soil fertility systems, have not been transferred and adapted to  each country\u2019s unique agro-ecosystem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Rural Development", "paragraphs": ["Limited rural development has also been a primary factor aggravating food  insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.

For example, IFPRI reported that progress in paved roads is  almost nonexistent in sub-Saharan Africa, and the World Bank reported  that less than half of the rural population in this region lives next to an all- season road. The lack of adequate rural roads increases distribution costs,  adds to postharvest food spoilage, and inhibits the development of local  and regional markets as well as access to those markets. Many rural  households also do not have access to safe drinking water, electricity,  modern communication services, or good transportation. For example, in  Burkina Faso, Uganda, and Zambia, walking is the principal means of  transportation for 87 percent of rural residents. IFPRI concluded that it is  the poor households within the rural areas that have the least access to  infrastructure.", "Farmers\u2019 lack of access to credit also hinders rural development. The  World Bank noted that almost all countries in Africa have a large unmet  demand for agricultural credit and rural finance. With inadequate  financing in the short term, farmers find it difficult to buy inputs and  seeds. In the long term, they are unable to invest in land improvement,  better technology, or irrigation development. The International Monetary  Fund (IMF) noted that rural credit in sub-Saharan Africa is hampered by  land tenure systems that prevent the use of land as collateral, the absence  of physical collateral, the high risk associated with rain-fed agriculture and  sharp commodity price fluctuations, and poor transport and  communication facilities.

The World Bank notes that there is a two-way  relationship between malaria and agriculture. Specifically, on one hand,  when farmers become ill or die from malaria, agricultural production  decreases because of lost labor, knowledge, and assets. On the other hand,  some methods that farmers use to increase agricultural production, such  as increased irrigation, can increase the risk of malaria by increasing the  population of mosquitoes.

Economic growth in large countries, such as China and India,  has also raised demand for food\u2014through both increased incomes and  shifting dietary patterns.

Higher fuel import costs also limit available  foreign exchange for imports of food. USDA reports that official  development assistance has fallen well short of rising energy import bills.

Climate change affects agriculture in  several ways: higher temperatures shorten the growing season and  adversely affect grain formation; reduced precipitation levels limit the  availability of water to grow rain-fed crops; variable climates shift  production to marginal lands and intensify soil erosion; rising sea levels  threaten coastal agricultural land; and climate extremes, such as floods  and droughts, result in crop failure and livestock deaths. Accounting for  these effects, numerous studies seek to estimate the impact of climate  change on African agricultural yields. By 2060, for example, the United  Nations Environment Program projects a 33 percent reduction in grain  yield in sub-Saharan Africa, while FAO predicts that the number of  Africans at risk of hunger will increase to 415 million.

A study of the  United Kingdom National Audit Office reported that British country teams  are not sure about specific activities, geographical focus, and donors\u2019  comparative advantage due, in part, to the large number of donors and  projects ongoing at the country level. In addition, bilateral donor  assistance is often not adequately aligned with the strategies and programs  of international financial institutions and private foundations.

In  September 2007, the UN Secretary-General first convened the UN MDG  Africa Steering Group to identify strategic ways in which the international  community could better coordinate and support national governments\u2019  implementation of MDG programs, including the implementation of  agriculture and food security. The steering group met again in March 2008,  where it identified the unpredictability of aid, poor alignment with country  systems, and inadequate division of labor among donors as major  challenges to African food security. The group expects to publish its  recommendations for achieving MDGs in Africa by the end of May 2008.

First, FAO relies on total calories available from food  supplies and ignores dietary deficiencies that can occur due to the lack of  adequate amounts of protein and essential micronutrients. Second, FAO  underestimates per capita food availability in Africa, and, according to  several FAO officials in Rome, coverage of noncereal crops, such as  cassava\u2014a main staple food for sub-Saharan Africa\u2014has been inadequate.  Third, FAO estimates are more subject to changes in the availability of  food and less so to changes in the distribution of food, which leads to the  underestimation of undernourishment in regions with relatively better  food availability but relatively worse distribution of food, such as South  Asia. Even when food is available, poor people may not have access to it,  which leads to undernourishment. Lastly, FAO relies on food consumption  data from outdated household surveys to measure inequality in food  distribution. According to FAO, some of these surveys are over 10 years  old.", "Poor data quality and reliability: According to FAO officials, the quality  and reliability of food production, trade, and population data, which FAO  relies on for its estimates of undernourishment, vary from country to  country. For many developing countries, the data are either inaccurate or  incomplete, which directly impacts FAO\u2019s final estimate of  undernourishment. For example, FAO officials told us that the estimated  prevalence of undernourishment in Myanmar was 5 percent, but the  officials questioned the reliability and accuracy of the data reported by the  government of Myanmar. In addition, FAO lacks estimates of  undernourishment for some countries to which a substantial amount of  food aid has been delivered, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia. Since  data on production, trade, and consumption of food in some countries are  not available, FAO makes one undernourishment estimate for these  countries as a group and takes this estimate into account to determine  total undernourishment worldwide.", "Furthermore, FAO\u2019s undernourishment estimates are outdated, with its  most recent published estimates covering the 3-year period of 2001 to  2003.

FAO did not publish the  2007 SOFI report or contribute data for the Millennium Development  Report because it is presently revising the minimum caloric requirements,  a key component in FAO\u2019s methodology for estimating undernourishment  to measure progress toward the 2015 hunger goals.", "FAO has acknowledged that it needs to improve its methodology and  consider other indicators to accurately portray progress toward hunger  targets. As part of this effort, FAO sponsored an \u201cInternational Scientific  Symposium\u201d in 2002 for scientists and practitioners to discuss various  measures and assessment methods on food deprivation and  undernourishment.

However, USAID officials acknowledged that IEHA lacks  a political mandate to align the U.S. government food aid, emergency, and  development agendas to address the root causes of food insecurity.  Despite purporting to be a governmentwide presidential strategy, IEHA is  limited to only some of USAID\u2019s agricultural development activities and  does not integrate with other agencies in terms of plans, programs,  resources, and activities to address food insecurity in Africa. For example,  because only eight USAID missions have fully committed to IEHA and the  rest of the missions have not attributed funding to the initiative, USAID  has been unable to leverage all of the agricultural development funding it  provides to end hunger in Africa. This lack of a comprehensive strategy  has likely led to missed opportunities to leverage expertise and minimize  overlap and duplication. Our meetings with officials of other agencies  demonstrated that there was no significant effort to coordinate their food  security programs. A U.S. interagency working group that had attempted  to address food security issues since the mid-1990s disbanded in 2003.

Although host governments and donors share  responsibility for this failure, especially with regard to devoting resources  to support sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s agricultural sector, host governments play  a primary role in reducing hunger in their own countries. Without  adequate efforts by the host governments coupled with sufficient donor  support, it is difficult to break the cycle of low agricultural productivity,  high poverty, and food insecurity that has contributed to an increase in  emergency needs. The United States\u2019 approach to addressing food  insecurity has traditionally relied on the U.S. food aid programs. However,  in recent years, the resources of these programs have focused on the rising  number of acute food and humanitarian emergencies, to the detriment of  actions designed to address the fundamental causes of these emergencies,  such as low agricultural productivity. Moreover, IEHA does not  comprehensively address the underlying causes of food insecurity, nor  does it leverage the full extent of U.S. assistance to sub-Saharan Africa.  Consequently, the U.S. approach does not constitute an integrated  governmentwide food security strategy. In implementing its food security  efforts, the United States has not adequately collaborated with host  governments and other donors, which has contributed to further  fragmentation of these efforts. Finally, without reliable data on the nature  and extent of hunger, it is difficult to target appropriate interventions to  the most vulnerable populations and to monitor and evaluate their  effectiveness.

Although we recognize the limitations of FAO\u2019s  estimates (such as the lack of up-to-date information), they are the official  basis of the World Food Summit (WFS) and MDG targets and are largely  consistent with the trends reported by other sources, such as the U.S.  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) estimates on global hunger. We  discussed the reliability of FAO\u2019s undernourishment data with several  cognizant FAO officials and various U.S. government officials in  Washington and in sub-Saharan Africa. We determined that these  estimates are sufficiently reliable for our purpose, which is to show overall  trends over time at the aggregate level. We also analyzed FAO\u2019s data on  input use, grain production, and grain planting areas to compare  agricultural input use and productivity in sub-Saharan Africa with that of  other parts of the world. We determined that these data are sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. To assess the reliability of the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) data on commodity prices, we reviewed (1) existing  documentation related to the data sources and (2) documents from other  agencies reporting on commodity prices and found collaborating support.  Accordingly, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "We selected four countries for fieldwork\u2014Kenya and Tanzania in East  Africa, and Mozambique and Zambia in southern Africa\u2014on the basis of  geographic region, data on undernourished people, and U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) programs in-country. We selected  countries in east and southern Africa because those regions have high  prevalence rates of undernourishment and excluded countries with  current conflict. While this selection is not representative in any statistical  sense, it ensured that we had variation in the key factors we considered.  We do not generalize the results of our fieldwork beyond that selection,  using fieldwork primarily to provide illustrative examples.", "In addition, we reviewed economic literature on the factors that influence  food security and recent reports, studies, and papers issued by U.S.  agencies, multilateral organizations, and bilateral donors. We reviewed the  Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit  Plan of Action, which included 7 commitments, 27 objectives, and 181  specific actions. We recognize the multifaceted nature of factors affecting  food security, but some of them, such as conflict and trade reforms, were  beyond the scope of our study. We reviewed economic studies and recent  reports on the factors that influence food security. These included articles  from leading authors published in established journals, such as World  Development. We also included studies by such organizations as the  International Food Policy and Research Institute (IFPRI), FAO, IMF,  USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service, World Food Program (WFP), and the  World Bank. These sources were chosen because they represent a wide  cross section of the discussion on food security and are written by the  leading authorities and institutions working in the field. To summarize and  organize meaningfully the many factors and interventions that impact and  can address global food security, we created a framework. To ensure that  the framework was comprehensive and rigorous, we based it on relevant  literature and the input of practitioners and experts. Specifically, our first  step was to review relevant research on global food security from  multilateral institutions and academia and consider key policy documents,  such as the Rome Declaration. We presented the first draft of the  framework to a panel of nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and  government representatives in Washington, D.C., and subsequently used  the framework during our panels in the four African countries to help  stimulate discussion. We refined the framework on the basis of  preliminary analysis of the panel results and finalized it on the basis of the  input of a roundtable of food security experts in Washington, D.C.", "In the four African countries that we selected for fieldwork, we conducted  structured discussions with groups of NGOs and donors, organizing them  into 9 panels with about 80 participants representing more than 60 entities.  To identify the panelists\u2019 views on key recommendations for improvement  and lessons learned, we posed the same questions to each of the 9 panels  and recorded their answers. Subsequently, we coded their  recommendations and lessons according to the factors that were further  refined and are shown in figure 3. We also coded some recommendations  and lessons according to a few additional topics that occurred with some  frequency in the panels but that fell outside the scope of our framework,  such as donor coordination and the targeting of U.S. food aid. Two staff  members performed the initial coding independently and then met to  reconcile any differences in their coding. These lessons and  recommendations that we coded represent the most frequently expressed  views and perspectives of in-country NGOs, donors, and regional  representatives that we met with, and cannot be generalized beyond that  population.", "To examine the extent to which host governments and donors, including  the United States, are working toward halving hunger by 2015, we  analyzed data on official development assistance (ODA) to developing  countries published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD), Development Assistance Committee (DAC).  Specifically, we analyzed the trends in the share of ODA going to  agriculture and to emergencies from multilateral and bilateral donors,  from 1974 to 2006. The DAC Secretariat assesses the quality of aid activity  data each year by verifying both the coverage (completeness) of each  donor\u2019s reporting and the conformity of reporting with DAC\u2019s definitions  to ensure the comparability of data among donors. These data are widely  used by researchers and institutions in studying development assistance  resource flows. OECD\u2019s classification of agriculture may underreport  funding to agriculture. OECD\u2019s ODA to agriculture excludes rural  development and development food aid. For example, the International  Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) believes that some of its  multisectoral lending may not have counted as ODA to agriculture.  However, since OECD has consistently used the same classification, we  determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for our purpose, which is  to track trends over time. To determine whether African governments  have fulfilled their pledge to devote 10 percent of their budgets to  agriculture, we relied on the government expenditure data provided by  IFPRI, which is the same data source on which USAID relies. We  determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of a  broad comparison of countries\u2019 agricultural spending to the  Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) targets  in the aggregate. IFPRI recognizes that data on government sectoral  spending are weak in many developing countries and is working with  some of these countries to improve data quality. We also analyzed USAID  budget for the Presidential Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA). We  determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

U.S. policy as represented at the  summit advocated the following national policies and actions to improve  food security:    Governments should act as facilitators rather than intervenors.

Although the United  States was not prepared to commit increased resources for food security,  U.S. government representatives at the summit indicated that the United  States intended to play a major role in promoting food security around the  world. According to a U.S. position paper, the United States planned to  accomplish this objective by    enhancing U.S. government support for research and technology  development in agriculture and related sectors;   employing an integrated approach to sustainable development, with a  strong emphasis on those countries that show a good-faith willingness to  address policy reforms;   continuing support for food security through the use of agriculture  programs, development assistance, and food aid;   continuing support for international efforts to respond to and prevent  humanitarian crises that create a need for emergency food;   continuing efforts to encourage and facilitate implementations of food  security-related actions adopted at international conferences or agreed-to  conventions;   working within the multilateral system to enhance global approaches to    working with all countries to achieve freer trade and ensure that the  benefits are equitably realized, and urging all countries to open their  markets in the interest of achieving greater stability and participation in  the world market.", "An interagency governmentwide Working Group on Food Security that  was established to prepare for the 1996 summit continued to operate until  2003, issuing two annual reports on a U.S. Food Security Plan of Action in  1999 and 2000.

The factors listed in the  framework shown in table 2 are areas on which development efforts can  be focused. They include such areas as agricultural productivity and  development; rural development; governance; and health, education, and  social welfare. All of these factors contribute to food security. For  example, actions to improve agricultural productivity are most effective in  conjunction with rural development, good governance, and good health  and welfare. The framework also identifies actions or interventions that  can be taken to address these development factors. They include such  actions or interventions as increasing access to inputs, improving  infrastructure, and strengthening rural communities. Successful  agricultural development requires coordination of these interventions  across a range of activities. For example, farmers cannot buy inputs unless  there are functioning credit institutions. Also, farmers cannot access  markets if there are no roads. Given that achieving food security is an  extremely difficult and complex process and that there are many different  ways in which to categorize these factors, this list should not be construed  as exhaustive.

They can be facilitated by encouraging private  investment and establishing private/public partnerships and developing  the capacity of agrobusiness and processing focused on value-added  production. As an early action under CAADP, an Alliance for Commodity  Trade in East and Southern Africa is being developed to open up national  and regional market opportunities for staple foods produced by millions of  smallholder farmers. Agribusiness, in particular, has an economic interest  in a vibrant agricultural sector. For this reason, USAID supports private  agribusiness development in Africa, working directly with about 900  public/private partnerships to build capacity and leverage additional  resources in 2006. These include producers, exporters, and their  associations, such as the East African Fine Coffees Association, which is  linking buyers from companies like Starbucks in the United States with  producers and exports of high-value coffee, and the African Cotton and  Textile Industry Federation, which is improving the links of African  farmers to the U.S. market through the African Growth and Opportunity  Act.

Despite the inherent inefficiency of monetization, there are some  examples of the successful use of monetized Title II funding for food  security. An external evaluation of IEHA\u2019s use of food aid noted that Title  II monetization proceeds have a large realm of possible uses, including  financing small business start-ups; paying the costs of training programs;  locally purchasing commodities, rather than using imported food in  particular situations, where there is a particularly high potential for  disincentives for local producers; and providing start-up capital for  initiating farmer association-based thrift and savings societies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interventions to Invest in and Improve Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously noted, improving infrastructure, such as roads and  power, is key to helping rural farmers.

Although some African countries have had robust economic growth in  recent years, to achieve the WFS and MDG-1 goals, the growth,  especially in agriculture, needs to be sustained. As we note in our  report, concerted efforts and sustained growth are needed for many  years to overcome the numerous challenges facing host governments  and donors to halve hunger in sub-Saharan Africa by 2015.  2.  While GAO recognizes the various ongoing coordination efforts at the  international and U.S. government level, our work revealed that  coordination on improving food security in sub-Saharan Africa has  thus far been insufficient. In May 2008, following the release of a draft  of this report, USAID initiated the creation of a sub-Principals  Coordinating Committee on Food Price Increases and Global Food  Security to help facilitate interagency coordination. In addition to  USAID, USDA, State, and Treasury, participating agencies include the  Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Commerce, MCC, the  National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the  Peace Corps, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the U.S.  Trade Representative.  3.  As we note in our report, while IEHA has undertaken a variety of  efforts to address food insecurity in Africa, these efforts have thus far  been limited in scale and scope. IEHA does not integrate with other  agencies in terms of plans, programs, resources, and activities. In  addition, many IEHA projects are limited in their impact because they  may not necessarily address the root causes of food insecurity. For  example, projects distributing treadle pumps benefit only the farmers  who receive them, but do not address the larger issue of the  underdevelopment of agricultural input markets.  4.  While we recognize that clean water and sanitation are important to  nutrition and food utilization, these issues were outside the scope of  our study.  5.  We recognize the importance of emergency assistance. However, to  break the cycle of poverty, food insecurity, and emergencies,  agricultural development needs to increase in priority. We agree with  USAID that a shift in focus from relief to development should not  translate into reduced emergency food aid in the short term.  6.  We disagree with USAID\u2019s comment that a report such as the annual  progress report on IEHA (which is not congressionally required),  instead of the congressionally required International Food Assistance  Report (IFAR), be used to report on USAID\u2019s and other agencies\u2019  implementation of our first recommendation. Public Law 480, section  407 (f)(codified at 7.U.S.C. 1736a(f) requires that the President prepare  an annual report that \u201cshall include\u2026an assessment of the progress  toward achieving food security in each country receiving food  assistance from the United States Government.\u201d Expanding the scope  of current reporting to include progress on achieving food security  would enhance the usefulness of IFAR, while making it unnecessary to  recommend the promulgation of a separate report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["Following is GAO\u2019s comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture letter  dated May 14, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comment", "paragraphs": ["1.  We acknowledge the role that USDA plays in meeting short- and long- term food needs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Finally, although USDA administers  food assistance programs, including food aid programs for  development, we note in this report that these are not included in  IEHA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["Following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State letter dated  May 16, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We maintain that U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to coordinate food security  programs have thus far been insufficient. Efforts to date are focused  primarily on food aid, as opposed to food security, and there is no  comprehensive U.S. governmentwide strategy for addressing food  insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.  2.  A major reason for food spoilage and poor market delivery is poor  infrastructure, as we note in our discussion of rural development.  3.  As we note in our discussion of our objectives, scope, and  methodology (see app. I), although we recognize the multifaceted  nature of factors affecting food security, we excluded some factors,  such as international trade, from the scope of our study. While  international trade is important to global food security, its relative  importance to sub-Saharan Africa is considerably lower. Many  smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are not in a position to  benefit from international trade due to high transaction costs, and they  generally produce products, such as cassava, that are not traded  internationally.  4.  We did not generate data from FAO\u2019s original estimates of  undernourishment. We relied on FAO\u2019s estimates to assess progress  toward the WFS and MDG goals. As we note in our previously  mentioned objectives, scope, and methodology, we discussed the  reliability of FAO\u2019s undernourishment estimates with cognizant FAO  and U.S. government officials in Washington and in sub-Saharan  Africa, and we determined that these estimates are sufficiently reliable  for our purpose, which is to show overall trends over time at the  aggregate level.  5.  FAO\u2019s estimates are the official indicators used to track progress  toward the WFS and MDG-1 goals. In addition, they are the only  estimates available to assess undernourishment at the global level.  Other UN agencies, such as WFP, conduct assessments and collect  other data on food supply and nutrition for their respective missions.  However, they do not do so at the global level, and their data cannot  replace FAO\u2019s estimates on undernourishment to track long-term  progress toward the WFS and MDG-1 goals.  6.  We added language in appendix IV to reflect the recent experiences in  southern Sudan.  7.  As we previously mentioned in our objectives, scope, and  methodology, although we recognize the multifaceted nature of factors  affecting food security, some factors, such as conflicts, were excluded  from the scope of our study. We disagree with State\u2019s assertion that we  did not adequately address host government issues. Our report points  out that host government policy disincentives are a main factor in food  insecurity. We also note that the lack of the sufficient investment in  agriculture by the host government is one of the challenges hindering  progress to halving hunger by 2015.  8.  In May 2008, the President announced a $770 million initiative that  aims to (1) increase food assistance to meet the immediate needs of  the most vulnerable ($620 million); (2) augment agricultural  productivity programs, especially in Africa and other key agricultural  regions, to boost food staple supplies ($150 million); and (3) promote  an international policy environment that addresses the systemic  causes of the food crisis.
