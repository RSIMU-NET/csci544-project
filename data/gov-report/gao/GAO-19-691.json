The Department of Defense (DOD) issued a proposed Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) rule in December 2018 and expects the rule to be finalized by the end of fiscal year 2019.

The proposed FAR rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register in September 2019.

Of this amount, about  $350 billion\u2014or 63 percent\u2014was obligated under competitively awarded  contracts. When awarding a contract competitively, agencies have a  number of source selection processes they can use to evaluate firms\u2019  proposals. One process is a best value, lowest price technically  acceptable (LPTA) process. In the LPTA process, an agency awards the  contract to the firm presenting the lowest evaluated price that is  technically acceptable, and no trade-offs are permitted. Alternatively, an  agency can use a best value trade-off process, in which it can vary the  relative importance of cost or price to other factors such as a firm\u2019s  technical capability or past performance. In these cases, the agency may  award a contract to a firm offering other than the lowest priced proposal if  it determines that this is in the best interest of the government.", "Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017, as amended, required the Department of Defense (DOD) to  revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)  to allow the use of the LPTA process only when eight criteria are met.  For example, one criterion is that defense contracting officials must  determine that little or no value would be gained from a proposal  exceeding the solicitation\u2019s minimum technical requirements.  Subsequently, Section 880 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 required the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to be revised to allow civilian  agency use of the LPTA process only when six similar criteria are met.  For the purposes of this report, we refer to Section 813 of the NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2017, as amended, as \u201cthe defense provisions\u201d and Section  880 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 as \u201cthe civilian provisions.\u201d Both  provisions also placed limitations on the use of the LPTA process in  procurements for certain categories of products and services, such as  personal protective equipment and information technology services, by  requiring agencies to avoid use of the LPTA process in these  procurements to the maximum extent practicable.

We have previously issued two reports in  response to this provision.

In such cases, agencies can determine that cost  or price should play a dominant role in the source selection. When using  the LPTA process, the agency specifies the evaluation factors that  establish the requirements of acceptability in the solicitation. Firms submit  their proposals and the agency determines which of the proposals meet  those requirements. No trade-offs between cost or price and non-cost  factors (for example, technical capabilities or past performance) are  permitted. Non-cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable  basis. The award is made based on the lowest priced, technically  acceptable proposal submitted to the government.", "In contrast, agencies may elect to use the trade-off process in  acquisitions where the requirement is less definitive, more development  work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In  these instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source  selection process. Trade-offs between price and non-cost factors allow  agencies to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.

Contracting officials stated that the LPTA  process was used in these instances, in part, because the requirements  were well-defined, noncomplex, or recurring.

We found that DOD  used the LPTA process to buy equipment, fuel, information technology  services, and construction services, among other things. We also found  that contracting officials used the LPTA process for reasons consistent  with the criteria in the defense provisions. Specifically, contracting officials  associated with the 14 contracts and orders we selected used the LPTA  process, in part, because they determined there was no trade-off  available or determined that DOD would not derive any benefit from  paying a premium for offers that exceeded the minimum capabilities.  Finally, we found that some contracting officials were confused about how  to apply two of the criteria included in the defense provisions. Specifically,  contracting officials were confused regarding how to assess life cycle  costs associated with their procurements (shown as criterion 6 in table 1)  or whether the products and services they were acquiring would be  considered expendable in nature (criterion 8). Absent clarification on how  to consider these two criteria, we found there was potential for increased  risk that DOD contracting officials would not consistently apply the criteria  of the defense provisions. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD  address how contracting officials should apply these two criteria when  using the LPTA process.
