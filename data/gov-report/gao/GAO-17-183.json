Specifically, GAO found that the measures for the eight initiatives reviewed did not generally include key attributes of successful performance measures. For example, for six initiatives there were no baseline and trend data associated with the measures. While DOD's 2014 and 2015 Strategy for Improving DOD Asset Visibility ( Strategies ) called for performance measures to be identified for the initiatives, the Strategies lacked complete direction on how to develop performance measures that would allow DOD to assess the progress of the initiatives toward their intended outcomes. GAO also found that after-action reports for the initiatives did not always include key information needed to determine the success of the initiatives in achieving the goals described in the Strategies . Without improved performance measures and information to support that progress has been made, DOD may not be able to monitor and show progress in improving asset visibility.", "DOD has made progress and meets the criteria related to capacity and its corrective action plan but needs to take additional actions to monitor implementation and demonstrate progress to meet GAO's two remaining criteria for removal from the High Risk List, as shown in the figure. For the capacity criterion, in its draft update to the 2015 Strategy , DOD provides guidance on how to document cases where the funding for the initiatives is embedded within the overall program funding. Also, for the action plan criterion, DOD included matrixes in its 2015 Strategy to link ongoing initiatives to the Strategy 's goals and objectives. DOD has also taken steps to monitor the status of initiatives. However, the performance measures for the selected initiatives that GAO reviewed generally cannot be used to track progress and are not consistently incorporated into reports to demonstrate results.

DOD\u2019s goal and challenge are to deliver the right  items in the right quantities to the right place at the right time\u2014and at the  right cost. Supply chain management encompasses the processes and  systems for accomplishing this goal and includes inventory management,  materiel distribution, and asset visibility. According to DOD, to achieve a  seamless and effective supply chain, DOD needs to have end-to-end  visibility of its assets from acquisition to disposal. DOD defines asset  visibility as the ability to provide timely and accurate information on the  location, quantity, condition, movement, and status of items in its  inventory, including assets in transit. Maintaining visibility of these assets  is critical to ensure that DOD provides support to the warfighter. Because  of long-standing weaknesses in DOD\u2019s supply chain management, in  1990 we designated it as a high-risk area. In 2005, we added asset  visibility to the supply chain management high-risk area. In 2011, we  reported that limitations in asset visibility made it difficult for DOD to  obtain timely and accurate information on the assets that are present in  the theater of operations.", "In our February 2015 biennial update to the High-Risk Series, we  reported that DOD had made progress addressing weaknesses in its  supply chain management, which is comprised of three issue areas:  inventory management, materiel distribution, and asset visibility. With  respect to asset visibility, we reported that the department had met one of  our five criteria\u2014leadership commitment\u2014for the removal of asset  visibility from the high risk list, and partially met the other four criteria\u2014 capacity, corrective action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress.  We reported that DOD had made considerable progress from 2013 to  2015 in addressing the four remaining criteria through actions such as  developing the department\u2019s framework for improving asset visibility,  known as its 2014 Strategy for Improving DOD Asset Visibility (2014  Strategy). The 2014 Strategy outlined initiatives intended to improve  DOD\u2019s asset visibility. Furthermore, we reported that to fully address the  remaining four high-risk criteria DOD needed to take a number of actions,  such as linking the goals and objectives in the 2014 Strategy with the  initiatives intended to implement the Strategy. We also reported that DOD  needed to assess and refine, as appropriate, existing performance  measures to ensure that these measures assessed the implementation of  individual initiatives as well as progress toward achieving the Strategy\u2019s  goals and objectives.", "In December 2015, we reported that DOD had updated its 2014 Strategy  in October 2015 (2015 Strategy), and had taken numerous actions to  address weaknesses in its 2014 Strategy. For example, the 2015  Strategy addressed steps DOD was taking to facilitate collaboration with  industry to capture best practices with respect to asset visibility. Like its  predecessor, the updated 2015 Strategy states that it is intended to  create a framework whereby the DOD components can work  collaboratively to enhance asset visibility in a manner that provides  accurate, reliable, and timely data to track assets throughout their life  cycles. According to the 2015 Strategy and Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) officials, the Asset Visibility Working Group\u2014comprised of representatives from the components and other government agencies,  as needed\u2014facilitates collaboration across the components, identifies  opportunities for improvement, and monitors the implementation of the  initiatives.", "We initiated this review under the authority of the Comptroller General to  address issues of broad interest to Congress.

Thirty initiatives have been  included in the Strategies, but 3 of these were halted, for a variety of  reasons. To develop a non-generalizable sample from the remaining 27  initiatives, we selected 8\u2014at least one from each of the components\u2014to  review and assess, including analyzing the performance measures  associated with each initiative. The results from this sample cannot be  generalized to the other 19 initiatives. In our selection of initiatives to  review, we used several sampling criteria to ensure that we had a range  of initiatives\u2014from some just beginning to some that had already been  completed. We surveyed program managers and other cognizant officials  (hereafter referred to as component officials) responsible for the asset  visibility initiatives we selected. We included questions in our survey  related to the development and closure of the initiatives and took several  steps to ensure the validity and reliability of the survey instrument. We  also reviewed the Strategies to identify performance measures necessary  to monitor progress of the 8 initiatives we selected. We assessed whether  (1) DOD had followed the guidance set forth in the Strategies and (2) the  measures for the initiatives included selected key attributes of successful  performance measures (for example, are the measures clear, quantifiable  (i.e., have measurable targets and baseline and trend data), objective,  and reliable).", "Additionally, we reviewed the after-action reports for all of the initiatives  that had been closed\u201420 of 27 initiatives, which included 5 of the 8  initiatives we reviewed in detail\u2014by the Asset Visibility Working Group as  of October 31, 2016. We assessed these after-action reports to determine  whether they were completed for the initiative, documented whether  measures were obtained, and identified challenges and lessons learned.  Furthermore, we interviewed component officials and officials at the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain  Integration (hereafter referred to as OSD) to clarify survey responses and  to discuss plans to develop the initiatives, including any efforts to monitor  progress and demonstrate results.", "To determine whether DOD had addressed the five criteria\u2014leadership  commitment, capacity, corrective action plan, monitoring, and  demonstrated progress\u2014that would have to be met for us to remove  asset visibility from the High Risk List, we reviewed documents such as  the 2014 and 2015 Strategies and charts that track the implementation  and closure of asset visibility initiatives. We included questions in our  survey to collect additional information from officials on their efforts to  address the high-risk criteria. For example, we asked how the component  monitored the implementation of the initiative and whether there had been  any demonstrated progress in addressing the opportunity, deficiency, or  gap in asset visibility capability that the initiative was designed to address.  We evaluated DOD\u2019s actions to improve asset visibility against each of  our five high-risk criteria for removing this dimension from the high-risk  list. Additionally, we interviewed component officials and OSD officials  to clarify their survey responses and to discuss their plans to continue to  make progress in improving asset visibility.

The 2014 Strategy  notes that for more than 25 years, the department has been using  technologies, starting with linear bar codes and progressing to a variety of  more advanced technologies, with the goal of improving asset visibility.  Specifically, the Strategies state that, based on lessons learned from  years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the department introduced  technology capabilities to improve its ability to track assets as they  progress from posts, camps, and stations.

For example, an after-action report for the U.S.  Transportation Command (U.S. TRANSCOM) active radio frequency  identification (RFID) migration initiative stated that U.S. TRANSCOM had  successfully tracked the use of old and new active RFID tags on military  assets and updated an active RFID infrastructure to accommodate the  new tags."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Components Have Identified Performance Measures for the Eight Initiatives We Reviewed, but Limitations in the Measures and Related Status Reports Affect DOD\u2019s Ability to Assess the Success of the Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["DOD components have identified performance measures for the 8  initiatives we reviewed, but the measures do not generally include the key  attributes of successful performance measures (i.e., the measures were  not generally clear, quantifiable, objective, and reliable).

We identified \u201cto reduce the time required to  issue uniforms\u201d as the name of the measure. However, the  definition we identified for this measure, which is to improve cycle  times and reduce customer wait time, did not include the  methodology for computing the measure. Therefore, for the clarity  attribute, we could not determine if the definition of this measure  was consistent with the methodology used to calculate it.

For example, a performance measure for a Marine Corps  initiative is to increase non-nodal visibility and the delivery status  of materiel in transit within an area of responsibility, but the  component did not provide a quantifiable goal or other measure  that permits expected performance to be compared with actual  results so that actual progress can be assessed.", "Measures for 3 of the 8 initiatives partially included the key  attribute of objectivity.

However, when OSD updated the 2014  Strategy it did not include in the 2015 Strategy an example of the types of  expected outcomes and key performance indicators for components to  use when developing performance measures. The lack of direction on  successful performance measures may have resulted in measures that  lacked key attributes, such as clarity, measurable target, objectivity,  reliability, baseline and trend data, and linkage, as we previously  discussed. While OSD officials stated that they believed the performance  measures for the selected initiatives were sufficient to report on the status  of the initiatives, our review of these measures determined that they could  not be used to effectively assess the performance of the initiatives to  improve asset visibility.

Furthermore,  DOD\u2019s 2015 Strategy called for the components to consider items such  as manpower, materiel, and sustainment costs when documenting cost  estimates for the initiatives in the Strategy, as we recommended in our  January 2015 and February 2015 reports. For example, DOD identified  and broke down estimated costs of $10 million for implementing an  initiative to track Air Force aircraft and other assets from fiscal years 2015  through 2018 by specifying that $1.2 million was for manpower, $7.4  million for sustainment, and $1.4 million for one-time costs associated  with the consolidation of a server for the initiative. Additionally, DOD  broke down estimated costs of $465,000 for implementing an initiative to  track Marine Corps assets from fiscal years 2013 through 2015 by  specifying $400,000 for manpower and $65,000 for materials.", "However, in December 2015 we found that the 2015 Strategy included  three initiatives that did not include cost estimates. To address this issue,  in December 2016, a DOD official provided an abstract from the draft  update to the 2015 Strategy that provides additional direction on how to  explain and document cases where the funding for the initiatives is  embedded within overall program funding. The draft update notes that  there may be instances where asset visibility improvements are  embedded within a larger program, making it impossible or cost  prohibitive to isolate the cost associated with specific asset visibility  improvements. In these cases, the document outlining the initiatives will  indicate that cost information is not available and why. However, if at  some point during implementation some or all costs are identified,  information about the initiative will be updated. According to OSD officials,  DOD plans to issue the update to the 2015 Strategy, but a release date  has not been determined.", "DOD Has Fully Met Our High-Risk Criterion for a Corrective Action  Plan  Our high-risk criterion for a corrective action plan calls for agencies to  define the root causes of problems and related solutions and to include  steps necessary to implement the solutions. The Fiscal Year 2014  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required DOD to submit to  Congress a comprehensive strategy and implementation plans for  improving asset tracking and in-transit visibility. The Fiscal Year 2014  NDAA, among other things, called for DOD to include in its strategy and  plans elements such as goals and objectives for implementing the  strategy. The Fiscal Year NDAA also included a provision that we assess  the extent to which DOD\u2019s strategy and accompanying implementation  plans include the statutory elements. In January 2014, DOD issued its  Strategy for Improving DOD Asset Visibility and accompanying  implementation plans that outline initiatives intended to improve asset  visibility. DOD updated its 2014 Strategy and plans in October 2015. The  2014 and 2015 Strategies define the root causes of problems associated  with asset visibility and related solutions (i.e., the initiatives). In our  October 2014 management letter to a senior OSD official and our January  and February 2015 reports, we found that while the 2014 Strategy and  accompanying plans serve as a corrective action plan, there was not a  clear link between the initiatives and the Strategy\u2019s goals and objectives.  We recommended that DOD clearly specify the linkage between the goals  and objectives in the Strategy and the initiatives intended to implement  the Strategy. DOD implemented our recommendation in its 2015  Strategy, which includes matrixes that link each of DOD\u2019s ongoing  initiatives intended to implement the Strategy to the Strategy\u2019s  overarching goals and objectives.

DOD has taken steps to monitor the status of asset visibility  initiatives, but we found that it has only partially met our high-risk criterion  for monitoring. In our February 2015 High-Risk update, we referred to a  2013 report in which we had found that DOD lacked a formal, central  mechanism to monitor the status of improvements or fully track the  resources allocated to them. We also reported that while DOD\u2019s draft  2014 Strategy included overarching goals and objectives that addressed  the overall results desired from implementation of the Strategy, it only  partially included performance measures, which are necessary to enable  monitoring of progress.", "Since February 2015, DOD has taken some steps to improve its  monitoring of its improvement efforts. As noted in the 2015 Strategy, DOD  has described and implemented a process that tasks the Asset Visibility  Working Group to review the performance of the component\u2019s initiatives  during implementation on a quarterly basis, among other things. The  Working Group uses status reports from the DOD components that  include information on resources, funding, and progress made toward  implementation milestones. DOD also identified performance measures  for its asset visibility initiatives. However, as previously discussed, the  measures for the 8 initiatives we reviewed were not generally clear,  quantifiable (i.e., lacked measurable targets and baseline and trend data),  objective, and reliable. Measures that are clear, quantifiable, objective,  and reliable can help managers better monitor progress, including  determining how well they are achieving their goals and identifying areas  for improvement, if needed. In December 2016, a DOD official provided  an abstract from the draft update to the 2015 Strategy that noted that  detailed metrics data will be collected and reviewed at the level  appropriate for the initiative. High-level summary metrics information will  be provided to the Working Group in updates to the plan outlining the  initiatives. The extent to which this planned change will affect the  development of clear, quantifiable, objective, and reliable performance  measures remains to be determined.", "Additionally, as discussed previously, while the Asset Visibility Working  Group has closed 20 initiatives, it generally did not have information  related to performance measures to assess the progress of these  initiatives. Specifically, after-action reports from 11 of 20 initiatives\u2014 which are added to the status reports for completed initiatives\u2014did not  include performance measures that showed whether the initiative had met  its intended outcomes in support of the department\u2019s Strategies.

DOD has made progress by developing and  implementing its Strategies for improving asset visibility. In our October  2014 management letter to a senior OSD official and our January and  February 2015 reports, we noted that in order to demonstrate progress in  having implemented corrective measures, DOD should continue the  implementation of the initiatives identified in the Strategy, refining them  over time as appropriate. DOD reports that it has closed or will no  longer monitor the status of 20 of the 27 initiatives and continues to  monitor the remaining 7 initiatives. Additionally, in October 2016, DOD  officials stated that they plan to add about 10 new initiatives in the update  to the 2015 Strategy. For example, the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s  new initiative, Military Service Air Manifesting Capability, is expected to  promote timely, accurate, and complete in-transit visibility and effective  knowledge sharing to enhance understanding of the operational  environment. OSD officials have not yet determined a date for the release  of the update to the 2015 Strategy.", "As discussed previously, we found that DOD cannot use the performance  measures associated with the initiatives to demonstrate progress,  because the measures are not generally clear, quantifiable (i.e., lack  measurable targets and baseline and trend data), objective, and reliable.  Additionally, we found that DOD has not taken steps to consistently  incorporate information on an initiative\u2019s performance measures in  closure reports, such as after-action reports, in order to demonstrate the  extent to which progress has been made toward achieving the intended  outcomes of the individual initiatives and the overall goals and objectives  of the Strategies. Without clear, quantifiable, objective, and reliable  performance measures and information to support that progress has been  made, DOD may not be able to demonstrate that implementation of these  initiatives has resulted in measurable outcomes and progress toward  achieving the goals and objectives in the Strategies.

Long-standing management weaknesses related to DOD\u2019s asset  visibility functions hinder the department\u2019s ability to provide spare parts,  food, fuel, and other critical supplies in support of U.S. military forces. We  previously reported on several actions that we believe DOD should take  in order to mitigate or resolve long-standing weaknesses in asset visibility  and meet the criteria for removing asset visibility from the High Risk List.  We believe that DOD has taken the actions necessary to meet the  capacity and action plan criteria by providing additional direction to the  components on formulating cost estimates for the asset visibility  initiatives. Additionally, DOD linked the 2015 Strategy\u2019s goals and  objectives with the specific initiatives intended to implement the Strategy.  However, DOD\u2019s efforts to monitor initiatives show that the performance  measures DOD components currently use to assess these initiatives lack  some of the key attributes of successful performance measures that we  have identified. To the extent that these measures lack the key attributes  of successful performance measures, they limit DOD\u2019s ability to  effectively monitor the implementation of the initiatives and assess the  effect of the initiatives on the overall objectives and goals of the  Strategies. Developing clear, quantifiable, objective, and reliable  performance measures can help DOD better assess department-wide  progress against the Strategies\u2019 goals and clarify what additional steps  need to be taken to enable decision makers to exercise effective  oversight.", "An important step in determining what effect, if any, the asset visibility  initiatives are having on the achievement of the Strategies\u2019 goals and  objectives will be to develop sound performance measures and  incorporate information about these measures into the after-action reports  when evaluating and closing initiatives.

DOD stated that it recognizes the need for performance measures to  ensure the success of an asset visibility improvement effort but noted that  the level of complexity and granularity of the metrics we suggest may not  be suitable for all initiatives. DOD also stated that the purpose of the  Strategy is to create a framework whereby the components can work  collaboratively to coordinate and integrate department-wide efforts to  improve asset visibility, not to provide complete direction on how to  define, implement, and oversee these initiatives. Additionally, DOD stated  that the next edition of the Strategy will encourage the adoption of our six  key attributes for asset visibility initiatives to the extent appropriate, but  will not mandate their use. As discussed in our report, use of the key  attributes in measuring the performance of asset visibility initiatives would  help DOD to better assess department-wide progress against the goals in  its Strategy and clarify what additional steps need to be taken to enable  decision makers to exercise effective oversight. Encouraging adoption of  the key attributes, as DOD plans to do, is a positive step, but we continue  to believe that DOD needs to use these key attributes to refine its  performance measures to monitor the initiatives in the future.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that it  incorporate into after-action reports information relating to performance  measures for the asset visibility initiatives when evaluating and closing  these initiatives to ensure that implemented initiatives will achieve the  goals and objectives in the Strategies. DOD stated that it is important to  capture and review performance data prior to a component closing an  asset visibility initiative, but that the Strategy after-action report is not  intended to be used to evaluate the success of an asset visibility initiative  or to determine if an initiative has met its intended objectives. According  to DOD, documentation and information to support the evaluation of  initiatives is defined by and executed in accordance with component-level  policy and procedures. DOD agreed to update its Strategy to clarify the  purpose and use of the after-action reports and to ensure that the  Strategy specifies roles and responsibilities for evaluating and closing  initiatives. DOD\u2019s response, however, did not state whether and how  these updates to the Strategy would result in more consistent  incorporation of information relating to performance measures when  closing initiatives in the future. As we noted previously in this report,  according to the 2015 Strategy, the after-action report for closed  initiatives should include information on the objectives met, problems or  gaps resolved, and measures of success obtained.

From the remaining 27 initiatives, we selected a  non-generalizable sample of 8 initiatives. We selected at least one from  each of the components to review and assess, including analyzing the  performance measures associated with each initiative. In our selection of  8 initiatives to review, we also considered the stage of implementation of  the initiative, to ensure that our review encompassed initiatives at  different stages, from some that were just beginning to some that had  already been completed. Specifically, we made selections based on the  status of the initiatives as of December 2015 to include the earliest  completion dates by component. In order to cover a range of initiatives\u2014 from some just beginning to some already completed\u2014we selected for  review 3 initiatives from the 2014 Strategy that had been closed, 2  ongoing initiatives that had been included in both Strategies, and 3 new  initiatives that were included for the first time in the 2015 Strategy. The  results from this sample cannot be generalized to the other 19 initiatives.  We did not assess the initiatives to determine if they (1) met milestones,  (2) lacked resources, or (3) had performance issues. Instead we  assessed the initiatives to determine what progress DOD had made  toward meeting the criteria for removing an area from our High Risk list.", "We surveyed program managers and other cognizant officials (hereafter  referred to as component officials) responsible for the respective asset  visibility initiatives we selected. We included questions in our survey  related to the development and closure of the initiatives and took several  steps to ensure the validity and reliability of the survey instrument. We  also reviewed the Strategies to identify performance measures necessary  to monitor the progress of the 8 initiatives we had selected. Two analysts  independently assessed whether (1) DOD had followed the guidance set  forth in the Strategies and (2) the measures for the initiatives included  selected key attributes of successful performance measures (for example,  are the measures clear, quantifiable \u2014i.e., have measurable targets and  baseline and trend data\u2014objective, and reliable); any initial  disagreements in assessments were resolved through discussion.
