Through various revolving funds, GSA buys goods and services from private vendors and resells them to agencies. GSA has four major components\u2014the Public Buildings Service, FSS, FTS, and its Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP)\u2014to carry out its various programs and activities.", "FSS provides contract arrangements for commercial products and services worth over $17 billion per year through its four business lines: supply and procurement, vehicle acquisition and leasing, travel and transportation, and personal property management. As previously indicated, we did not focus on the travel and transportation and personal property management business lines. FTS provides reimbursable services for local and long- distance telecommunications. It also assists agencies with acquiring, managing, and using IT systems. FTS accomplishes this through two business lines: network services, for its telecommunications activities; and IT solutions, for its IT systems-related activities.", "In carrying out their duties, FSS and FTS are to follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is the uniform set of policies and procedures executive agencies are required to follow in procuring goods and services. The FAR implements various statutory requirements intended to advance national social and economic goals, such as giving preferential treatment in awarding contracts to certain groups, such as the blind and severely handicapped, small and disadvantaged businesses, and the federal prison work program. Governmentwide procurement policy is overseen by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OFPP is responsible for prescribing policy and coordinating the development of governmentwide procurement standards. OGP within GSA has a supporting role by creating networks of agency procurement representatives and by providing guidance and policy related to specific areas, such as vehicles, aircraft, and electronic commerce.

Through its supply and procurement business line, FSS offers federal agencies a choice of more than 4 million commercial products and a range of technology-oriented, financial, environmental, management, and administrative services. FSS\u2019 three methods of supply are (1) the stock program, (2) special order sales and (3) federal supply schedules. In the stock program, FSS stores approximately 19,000 common-use items for resale to agencies in 4 major distribution centers, 3 smaller centers, and 19 government stores located throughout the country and overseas. This program had sales of $817 million in fiscal year 1998. The special order program, which had sales of $477 million in fiscal year 1998, provides products for special needs or when stocking is not desirable, such as office furniture and appliances. The federal supply schedules program is similar to a commercial catalog business and provides agencies with access to over 6,800 contracts to obtain various goods and services. In addition to covering a vast range of commercial items, the schedules cover IT products and services. FSS prenegotiates terms, conditions, and ceilings on price with vendors; agencies deal directly with the vendors to negotiate final prices and establish deliveries. Supply schedule sales were about $8 billion in fiscal year 1998.", "The vehicle acquisition and leasing business line in FSS provides agencies with one-stop shopping for purchasing vehicles or leasing them from the FSS-managed interagency fleet. FSS is the federal government\u2019s mandatory source for the purchase of new, nontactical vehicles. Although leasing vehicles through the interagency fleet is not mandatory, agencies that choose this option get scheduled replacement, full-service management, and a fleet services card for fuel and repairs, for a fixed monthly fee, as well as a cost per mile charged by vehicle type. In fiscal year 1998, the vehicle acquisition and leasing business line purchased about 56,800 vehicles worth about $1 billion; one-half of the vehicles were for the interagency fleet, with the rest reflecting vehicle purchases for agencies. The interagency fleet comprised over 160,000 automobiles, passenger vans, trucks, buses, ambulances, and special-purpose equipment in fiscal year 1998.

The network services business line in FTS provides customer agencies with telecommunication services, including global voice, data, and video services, supporting both the local and long-distance needs of the federal government. According to FTS officials, the network services business line had revenues of about $1 billion in fiscal year 1998. Until the end of 1998, FTS long-distance services\u2014under its FTS2000 arrangements with AT&T and Sprint\u2014were a mandatory source for federal agencies. Under the FTS2001 arrangements with MCI and Sprint that were recently awarded, agencies are able to select their own service provider. According to FTS officials, these are the largest non-Defense government contracts, valued at between $5 and $8 billion over 8 years. FTS local telecommunications services also used to be mandatory; however, FTS now offers a range of nonmandatory services in this area, where revenue totaled $266 million in 1998.", "The IT solutions business line in FTS provides agencies with a range of assistance related to acquiring, managing, and using IT. In fiscal year 1998, the IT solutions business line had revenues of about $2.4 billion. FTS prides itself in this area on being an objective and trusted third party that can provide independent assistance to agencies. For a fee, FTS acts as a consulting agent for agencies in the acquisition of large IT systems and related services, systems integration, software definition and design, and office systems development. It also supports federal systems through risk analysis and information security support. Its Federal Acquisition Services for Technology (FAST) program is intended to provide quick procurement assistance for IT products and services. The FAST program had revenues of $973 million in fiscal year 1998. According to FTS officials, FTS services differ from the IT products and services offered by FSS under the supply schedules in that FTS is involved as a third party. Agencies deal directly with vendors under the FSS schedules. An FTS official added that FTS views its role as that of a value-added reseller of telecommunications and IT.

More recently, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (FAIR) required executive agencies to identify functions they perform that are not inherently governmental and could be performed by the private sector.", "This environment of reform has affected FSS and FTS. GSA, as a whole, has gone from 39,000 employees in 1971 to fewer than 14,000 employees in 1999. It also realigned itself organizationally to mirror the private sector and incorporated commercial practices to improve the level of service provided to agencies and to enhance its relationships with the private sector. These changes were evident in FSS and FTS with the establishment of the aforementioned business lines. The changes also manifested themselves in the shift from being a mandatory to nonmandatory source for agencies in such areas as supply procurement, vehicle leasing through the interagency fleet, telecommunications services, and IT acquisition. Also, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 increased FSS\u2019 and FTS\u2019 focus on performance measurement as a vital component of operating in a more business-oriented environment.", "Despite the changes that occurred, FSS and FTS believe that several barriers still exist that impede their ability to compete in this new environment and operate in a businesslike manner. Barriers cited by FSS were the inability to recruit and train top-level staff because of various federal personnel requirements, prohibitions on its ability to enter into cooperative purchasing arrangements, the extensive bid protest processes available to federal contractors, and its inability to deal effectively with poor-performing vendors. FTS also cited personnel-related barriers but had more concerns about financial-related barriers, such as the inability to consider accounts receivable the same as cash in managing the Information Technology Fund. An FTS official said this limits FTS\u2019 ability to commit to new business opportunities because payments to FTS from some agencies can take up to 90 days. Another barrier FTS cited was that federal rules related to disposal of property can make agencies less efficient because they cannot exchange the equipment they own for like services. FTS also cited being prohibited from using the standard of \u201cadequate\u201d competition as an alternative to \u201cfull and open\u201d competition, which is required by law, in certain multiple award contracting situations as another barrier to operating effectively.", "In the past, Congress has amended laws to allow agencies to overcome various barriers when they were shown to impede effective performance. For example, government corporations, including the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and dozens of others, serve public functions of a business nature and were given some flexibility related to the applicability of federal statutes to overcome barriers caused by the laws and implementing regulations. Congress authorized TVA, a government corporation, as well as federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to adopt alternative personnel systems. Congress also gave FAA authority to implement a streamlined procurement system so FAA could more easily deploy new technologies. Agencies have also outsourced a wide range of functions that typically were done in-house. For example, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) now contracts for investigative services, which were formerly done in-house until OPM privatized its investigative unit.", "The United States is not alone in its efforts to make its agencies more businesslike and to address barriers to efficient and streamlined government. Governments around the globe have reassessed the role of government and have made organizational and operational changes to improve the level of service to citizens.

GTIS also provided some services in the IT area, where it assisted mostly smaller agencies in defining their needs, but it was primarily involved in the procurement of telecommunications services, like FTS.

Employing about 11,800 people, PWGSC, among other things, managed approximately 63,000 contracts and was responsible for purchasing some 17,000 categories of goods, services, and construction, with a total annual value in excess of $8 billion Canadian (about $5.5 billion U.S.). This amount is more than one-half of the total amount of all federal government contracting in Canada.

It also banked and dispersed government funds and maintained the government\u2019s accounts.", "The Treasury Board sets contracting authority levels for departments in the Canadian government. As a central procurement agency, PWGSC had much higher authority than other departments. In addition, the Public Works and Government Services Act of 1996 gave PWGSC exclusive responsibility to purchase goods on behalf of the Canadian government and also for delegating purchase authority for goods to other departments. PWGSC\u2019s standard delegation of authority for goods to other departments was $5,000 Canadian ($3,425 U.S.) and according to an official with TBS, some departments had authority of $25,000 Canadian ($17,123 U.S.). Each department could procure services within its own authority, although the departments could ask PWGSC to do the procurement for them. Departments had authority to purchase services up to $2 million Canadian (about $1.4 million U.S.) if they used the government\u2019s electronic tendering service. Purchases above contracting authorities set by the Treasury Board required approval by the Treasury Board.", "Government policy in Canada requires that contracting be conducted in a manner that will, among other things, ensure competition and the preeminence of operational requirements. According to TBS officials, government policy also seeks to advance certain national objectives, including regional development and award of some contracts to aboriginal populations.

Standing offers provide goods and services to departments at prearranged prices, under set terms and conditions, without specifying delivery schedules or quantities required up front. Standing offers are employed when one or more purchasers repetitively order the same good or service. Common products offered under the standing offers are food, fuel, plumbing supplies, tires, stationery, and office equipment. Services include repair and overhaul of equipment and temporary help services. Supply arrangements are nonbinding agreements between SOS and suppliers to provide a range of goods or services on an as-required basis. With supply arrangements, departments solicit bids from a pool of prescreened vendors based on their specific scope of work; in this way supply arrangements differ from standing offers, under which departments accept a portion of a requirement already defined and priced. Many supply arrangements include ceilings on prices, which allow departments to negotiate the price downward on the basis of the actual requirement or scope of work.", "Although we did not do a comprehensive comparison of the supply activities of SOS and FSS, they were similar in that they aim to simplify the buying process for the government purchaser by prenegotiating terms, conditions, and sometimes prices with suppliers. We also noted that like FSS, SOS had on-line catalogues that purchasers could use to find products and services. There was, however, a difference in SOS and FSS supply operations in that SOS no longer operates a stock program with distribution centers or government stores as FSS does. According to SOS officials, the government had operated distribution centers at one time, but they were considered inefficient and the government stopped operating them several years ago. SOS\u2019 current supply activities rely primarily on direct delivery from the vendor. According to these officials, the government also used to operate government stores that at one time were found in most of the major federal buildings. However, for ideological reasons, the government decided that it should not be in competition with the private sector and privatized the stores several years ago. Another difference we noted was that SOS can be a mandatory source of supply if the purchase amount exceeds the buyer\u2019s threshold. FSS, in contrast, is a nonmandatory source of supply, regardless of the purchase amount.", "In the vehicle area, SOS\u2019 activities were similar to FSS\u2019 activities in that departments were required to use SOS for nontactical vehicle acquisition. According to TBS officials, the Canadian government purchases over 2,250 vehicles each year. The most common method of supply for vehicles is standing offers, whereby manufacturers provide prices for different models with different option combinations. For urgent requirements, departments could access SOS\u2019 inventory of vehicles that were already purchased by SOS through standing offers and were being held by manufacturers until needed. The least common method, which required special approval by the Treasury Board because it was the most expensive, was direct purchase from dealer stock. Departments could also lease vehicles from the private sector through SOS.", "According to SOS officials, departments generally managed their own fleets and had arrangements with dealerships and private garages for vehicle servicing. Under this framework, SOS differed from FSS in that it did not manage a central fleet like FSS\u2019 interagency fleet. As with most other goods and services in which PWGSC was involved, SOS acted as the contract authority on behalf of the buyer and was not involved in delivery of the goods and services.", "Like FSS\u2019 schedules, SOS contracts also covered IT goods and services. However, SOS had a role in the IT area that went beyond what FSS offers through its IT schedules and more closely resembled what FTS offers in assisting agencies with the acquisition of IT systems and related services. SOS had a branch called the Science, Informatics, and Professional Services Sector (SIPSS) that managed the IT goods and services contracts mentioned earlier. These contracts included consulting services for IT systems design, research and development, and training as well as goods, such as IT systems infrastructure, electronic data processing systems, hardware, and software. In addition to managing these contracts, which was similar to what FSS does through its IT schedules, SIPSS provided direct assistance to departments with major IT systems acquisitions, similar to what FTS does.

According to GTIS officials, the telecommunications industry in Canada has undergone a great deal of change since the mid-1990s. In 1995, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission deregulated large segments of the telecommunications industry. According to these officials, prior to this time, the Stentor alliance of regional carriers was the dominant service provider; Bell Canada was the largest provider of services in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The deregulation resulted in a more competitive environment and required GTIS to develop a competitive telecommunications supply arrangement.", "In general, most departments procured local and long distance service through GTIS, although its services were not mandatory. GTIS officials said it was more convenient and less expensive for departments to use GTIS. At the time of our review, however, GTIS officials were evaluating the ongoing impact of deregulation on their optional status and governmentwide bargaining position as departments began procuring services directly from the private sector.", "GTIS also provided services related to IT systems acquisition that were similar to services offered by FTS. Small agencies or agencies that did not have IT expertise could get assistance from GTIS in defining their needs and procurement objectives.

Arising from recognition by the Canadian government that one of the major reasons IT projects fail is that the procurement process is too inflexible, BDP is an alternative to traditional approaches. According to Canadian procurement officials, under traditional procurement approaches, departments could spend months, even years, developing a detailed requirement that, when completed, is often outdated and did not reflect changes that have taken place in the organization. Instead, the BDP approach is to ask the private sector to deliver certain agreed-upon results rather than follow a blueprint with detailed specifications. The private sector is also invited to submit ideas on what sort of project should be undertaken before a formal request for proposals is issued.", "Another key feature of BDP is up-front planning to remove or mitigate potential problems in the procurement process. Both the front-end planning and the management of the entire acquisition are based on four elements: (1) a solid business case, (2) risk analysis, (3) clear delineation of accountabilities, and (4) a compensation structure tied closely to the contractor\u2019s performance.

These standards include achieving value for money; emphasizing fair competition; incorporating best practices; and carefully assessing and managing business cases, risks, and contracts. HM Treasury officials told us that their procurement system was generally not used to advance any social objectives. However, UK officials pointed out that in the procurement area, the UK cannot act unilaterally and is required to implement laws compatible with directives promulgated by the European Community, such as ensuring that relevant contracts are awarded objectively.", "As part of the trend toward decentralization and getting government to run more like business, the government separated its service delivery and policy formulation functions. In February 1988, the government launched the \u201cNext Steps\u201d initiative, referring to the next steps in improving government management. Under the initiative, the government identified areas of departmental work that could be grouped together into operational units under single officials who would be accountable directly to their ministers for delivering specific objectives, services, and results. The government looked critically at its service delivery functions and determined whether each should be retained, reengineered, privatized, contracted out, or abolished. As a result of this process, several next steps agencies were established.", "Next steps agencies operate within a framework with targets set by ministers for the task to be done, the results to be achieved, and the resources to be provided. The day-to-day responsibility for running the organization is delegated by ministers to a chief executive, who is to have the management tools and freedoms needed to do the job. Each next steps agency has a public framework document, so that everyone can know the framework within which the agency operates. It includes the aims and objectives of the agency, its financial and accounting processes, and its approaches to pay and personnel issues. The frameworks for each agency vary; however, they generally are intended to provide the chief executive with much greater flexibility than if the units were operating within a traditional government department. As of October 1997, there were about 120 next steps agencies with staff numbering about 362,000, or about 77 percent of the civil service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Buying Agency Is a Supply Procurement Source", "paragraphs": ["TBA was established in 1991 as a next steps agency and is part of the Cabinet Office, which is the UK\u2019s central department for policy formulation, government management, and the civil service.

Unlike FSS, however, TBA could retain its revenue after covering operating costs and other financial obligations. In contrast, FSS generally had to return excess revenue to the U.S. Treasury after recovering its costs. TBA also had the authority to commit to capital expenditures or asset disposals up to \u0001250,000 ($403,226).

For example, in the UK, the government organizations that performed activities similar to FSS and FTS were different in that they had more flexibility to manage personnel and financial matters than traditional government departments. New Zealand sold its central procurement agency to the private sector, and agencies now could use the private sector business that was created to help meet their procurement needs. Also, there were similarities and differences in the programs and policies these countries used in the procurement of supplies, vehicles, telecommunications, and IT.", "Amending laws and regulations under which agencies operate and reforming procurement processes are not new concepts in the United States. For example, Congress authorized TVA, a government corporation, and some federal agencies such as VA and FAA to adopt alternative personnel systems. In addition to modifying requirements to help agencies accomplish their missions, the U.S. government has also reformed its procurement practices. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was enacted in part to promote efficiency and economy in contracting. In recent years, agencies have outsourced, or contracted for, a wide range of functions that had been done in-house. For example, the investigative unit of OPM was privatized and OPM now contracts for investigative services. To identify future candidates for privatization or outsourcing, the FAIR Act of 1998 requires agencies to identify functions they perform that are not inherently governmental. These reforms and streamlining efforts in the United States, as well as those in the four countries, were designed to make government operate more efficiently, improve service delivery, and focus on government\u2019s core mission.", "In considering the merits of the approaches used by the countries and their applicability to FSS and FTS, it is important to recognize that such factors as differences in political and economic environments, the role of social objectives in the procurement process, and the volume of contracting activity would have to be considered. Furthermore, although the officials we interviewed in the four countries were generally satisfied with the reforms and believed their governments were better off with them in place, performance data on the effectiveness of the various reforms were generally unavailable or were in the early stages of development.

BDP was first developed to solve problems with major IT acquisitions; but according to Canadian government officials, the concept has a broad application and is relevant to a wide range of complex, high- risk acquisitions.", "According to information on BDP from Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), Canada\u2019s central procurement agency, major IT projects, which are among its most complex procurement projects, have a history of failure. Research done in the United States and Canada support this assertion.  For example, in 1990, the President\u2019s Council on Management Improvement cited the \u201cunwieldy procurement process\u201d as a reason IT projects often failed.  Other reasons cited in this report included lack of top management commitment, inadequate planning, inadequate user input, and flawed technical approaches. In 1997, KPMG Consulting conducted a survey of IT projects in Canada and reported that the reasons for failure among IT projects were poor planning, a weak business case, and lack of top management involvement.  A study by the Standish Group in the United States showed that 31.1 percent of U.S. IT development projects were cancelled before completion; about 53 percent of the projects were likely to cost 189 percent of their original estimates; and only 16.2 percent of software development projects were completed on time and within budget.", "Concerned about problems with IT acquisition, the Treasury Board of Canada developed a framework of management policies in 1996 that comprised best practices, principles, methodologies, and tools and standards aimed at ensuring a better success rate. Part of this framework addressed the procurement process, which the Treasury Board described as \u201ctoo inflexible\u201d and \u201cnot conducive to cooperation.\u201d  BDP evolved as a response to this Treasury Board framework."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The BDP Philosophy", "paragraphs": ["BDP focuses on the big picture\u2014the overall desired outcomes\u2014rather than on detailed project requirements. The traditional approach to procurement in a complex IT project was for an organization to spend months, even years, developing a detailed requirement\u2014thousands of pages of specifications to present to the private sector. However, according to Canadian officials, the specifications may be outdated before they are complete, can be out of step with the latest technology, and the organization\u2019s goals may even have changed during the long, drawn-out process of developing specifications. Finally, according to these officials, the private sector may know the project is not feasible, but may present bids anyway in order to obtain work.", "As a result, the traditional approach tends to be too lengthy, rigid, prescriptive, and costly in terms of time and human resources that have to be dedicated to each project, according to Canadian officials. BDP attempts to address this problem by asking the private sector to deliver certain agreed-upon results rather than follow a government blueprint with detailed specifications. The private sector is also invited to submit ideas on what sort of project should be undertaken before a formal request for proposals is issued. Another feature of BDP is that it is to incorporate rigorous up-front planning to remove potential problems in the procurement process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of the BDP Process", "paragraphs": ["Both the front end planning and the management of the entire acquisition life cycle are based on four elements: a business case; risk analysis; clear delineation of accountabilities; and, a compensation structure closely tied to the contractor\u2019s performance. Under BDP, a department is to prepare a business case justifying the project at the highest level and identifying the outcomes and benefits to be achieved. The business case is also to look at such issues as how much the project will cost, whether there are cheaper ways to realize goals, and what the benefits will be to the taxpayer. According to Canadian officials, under traditional methods, a project was often launched prematurely without a determination of whether it was really needed, whether it fit with the organization\u2019s long-term goals, and without having the support of top management.", "Risk analysis is used to identify what could go wrong with the project and how to deal with the consequences. The goal is essentially to minimize risk and be prepared with contingencies for containment when problems do arise. Departments are to conduct risk assessments not just during the planning phase, but also throughout implementation.  This helps ensure that projects with little chance of success are cancelled or modified as early as possible.  Delineation of accountabilities is used to protect the client department from service delivery problems by identifying the specific risks each party assumes.  For example, if the contract states that the supplier is responsible for delivering a certain outcome, or level of service, by a certain date but fails to do so, the supplier could be required to bear the cost of the delay. Relatedly, BDP encourages the use of a compensation structure closely tied to the contractor\u2019s performance.  For example, bonus payments may be made for finishing earlier than expected. A nonmonetary incentive could be intellectual property rights to a technology developed under government contract.", "Although BDP has been used primarily in the IT area, PWGSC and Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) officials told us they anticipated greater usage of BDP in other areas in the future.

Under a PFI project, the private sector finances the capital assets and the government or users pay for the services. Similar to what are commonly referred to as public-private partnerships in the United States, PFI contracts require the private sector to invest in, manage, and operate a capital asset necessary to deliver a defined level of service. By way of example, in a PFI project to fill the need for a highway, the government would pay for the service of having a fully maintained and functional highway instead of constructing and maintaining the highway itself. In the IT area, the government would seek an arrangement in which the private sector would meet a department\u2019s IT needs through services, instead of having the government own and manage an IT system and software. An example where the user of the services and not the government pays for the service would be a privately financed bridge that is paid for directly by tolls from motorists using the bridge.", "The thinking behind PFI includes transfering the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the private sector, along with the need for capital funding. According to HM Treasury officials, it requires government to consider not only whether it can afford to pay for the capital asset, but also to rigorously consider the long-term financial implications of the asset being properly maintained and operated over a period of, frequently, 25 years or more.  PFI also aims to allocate procurement risks more appropriately between the supplier and the government customer to ensure that the risks rest with the appropriate party. For example, in a construction project, the risk of delay or cost overruns would rest with the private sector supplier.  Alternatively, the risk of changes in legislation that could affect the contract would rest with the government customer, who is better placed to influence any such changes.", "Under PFI projects, the government also believes it can also potentially benefit from the innovation and skills of the private sector. By concentrating on the end service required, the government allows the private sector supplier to determine innovative ways of delivering the service\u2014the government customer specifies the outputs but leaves the inputs to the supplier. To ensure value for money under PFI projects, the government customer is to demonstrate that the PFI method of procurement is likely to be better value for money than alternative means of supply\u2014in particular, conventional means of procurement.

Related to the vehicle acquisition and fleet area, two projects involved MOD\u2019s \u201cwhite fleet\u201d of  nontactical, administrative, and support vehicles.

This year, MOD planned to expand this project to include all of the white fleet vehicles in the British military.", "The white fleet PFI project had its origins in 1994, when MOD began a study to identify methods for encouraging greater commercial involvement in vehicle funding and management. The study concluded that there were both the capacity within the private sector and the potential for financial and operational benefits for MOD to expose the support vehicle fleet to industry competition. It was recognized that adopting a PFI approach to the supply of the white fleet would involve the private sector providing complete vehicle service, not just the funding for a substitution of new assets. MOD believed that through PFI, it would be exposed to private sector innovation and management skills and progressively would benefit from the latest commercial techniques in vehicle management.", "MOD selected two portions of the white fleet to test the PFI approach: the support vehicles for British forces in Germany and a stratified group of RAF support vehicles in the UK.  According to MOD officials, preliminary data showed that both of these projects were delivering efficiencies in terms of the number of vehicles operated and the cost of operation.  At the time of our review, MOD officials estimated that in Germany, savings of 27 percent were being realized compared to in-house operation; and in the UK, savings under PFI were estimated to be about 15 percent.  In both cases, MOD believed it was getting a newer and more reliable fleet, along with a better information system and commercial fleet management expertise.", "According to MOD officials, they drew on the experience gained from these two test efforts, did detailed research, and held extensive discussions with the leading service providers to develop a strategy for subjecting the rest of the white fleet to competition. Five regional projects covering approximately 12,000 vehicles were developed inside defined boundaries to cover all the requirements of all three services (Royal Navy, Army, and RAF). Each project covered the full range of vehicles in the white fleet and encompassed short and medium term needs.  Under the PFI arrangements, MOD staff were to assess fluctuating vehicle needs, and the industry providers are to be under contract to meet all levels of demand, even on short notice. This was a departure from the traditional procurement philosophy MOD had in the fleet area, in which vehicle holdings were to be matched to anticipated maximum usage requirements. Instead, MOD would be paying for vehicle services as an alternative to owning and operating them.", "As of October 1998, the time of our discussions with MOD officials, the projects had been advertised and MOD had received expressions of interest and proposal outlines from a number of leading vehicle suppliers who were backed by international financial institutions. Binding bids were to be obtained by the early part of 1999, which would lead to the selection of a preferred supplier and detailed negotiations before projected contract signings in September 1999.  Implementation of the contracts would then commence and would be completed in 6 months.", "To ensure value for money, MOD has established an in-house cost benchmark that reflected the best of several other in-house options MOD has considered for managing the fleet.  Should the bids MOD receives be above the in-house benchmark, MOD officials said they would instead implement the in-house alternatives.

According to NAO officials, the merits of the PFI initiative will be judged on the success of individual projects.  To date, these officials said that some projects could have benefited from better up-front planning; as a result, it was questionable whether some projects were achieving value for money. On the other hand, other projects have represented clear value for money and other benefits to the government.

The initiative was to cover everything from the large mainframe computers agencies operated to the equipment for over 140,000 desktop computers across the government. According to officials with the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing, this infrastructure had an estimated value of between $6 and $7 billion Australian (between about $4 and $4.6 billion U.S., assuming that $1 U.S. = $1.51 Australian).  Under the initiative, the government committed to achieving best value for money for its information technology dollar in order to support the delivery of services at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.", "This major announcement had its origins in 1996, when the government tasked the former Office of Government Information Technology (OGIT) with studying the potential savings that could accrue through consolidation of systems and potential outsourcing. The resulting study indicated that a very strong case for outsourcing existed and led to a decision that agencies should undertake extensive market testing. Potential savings of $1 billion Australian (about $662 million U.S.) were estimated over 7 years if agencies shifted to outsourcing. The April 1997 announcement reflected the government\u2019s commitment to apply the outsourcing concept for IT across government, with the exception of some systems related to national security. In November 1997, IT outsourcing functions managed by OGIT were transferred to the Office of Asset Sales, which was renamed OASITO.", "OASITO was given responsibility for leading and managing the implementation of the initiative, with the aim of delivering savings, developing the Australian IT industry, and improving service delivery. The initiative had clear objectives related to the Australian IT industry. That is, OASITO was committed to ensuring substantial and sustainable development of the domestic IT industry, encouraging the industry to achieve a global focus, and assisting regional development and the creation of jobs. OASITO\u2019s executive coordinator told us that in addition to the Australian IT industry, firms from overseas, including the United States, had been, and would likely continue to be, active participants in the initiative.", "OASITO was managing the initiative through a multi-year, phased process where agencies\u2019 IT needs were being grouped together and the requirements offered to the private sector for bids. The government originally estimated that the initiative would be completed by mid-1999. At the time of our review, the schedule for outsourcing had to be adjusted to accommodate the capacity of agencies to prepare for outsourcing and the capacity of industry to absorb the requirements. OASITO was responsible for identifying the groupings and structuring them to maximize the benefits of outsourcing. It also provided guidance and assistance to agencies and managed the sequence and timing of the offerings to maximize competition. In addition, OASITO was the central coordinator for development of project documentation and was to oversee the financial evaluation of the offers. After contracts were signed, OASITO planned to remain involved to ensure that issues affecting the overall success of the initiative were effectively addressed.", "In close consultation with OASITO, each agency was responsible for defining its business and technical requirements, assisting with the evaluation of bids, participating in negotiations, and otherwise preparing the agency for transition to an outsourcing relationship and subsequent contract management. At each step of the process, agencies were expected to ensure that sufficient resources were dedicated to the process to enable the project timetable to be met. Agencies were also expected to implement strategies for internal matters, such as human resource transition, and to execute the change to the new operating environment. The government anticipated that IT professionals within government would transfer to the private sector, thus enhancing their skills and furthering their career opportunities.", "OASITO\u2019s executive coordinator told us that the government undertook this initiative because of a belief that agencies should focus on their core missions and allow the private sector to perform government activities of a business nature. Further, he said that in meeting their IT needs through purchasing IT services, agencies, and the government as a whole, would also benefit from access to the latest technologies and current commercial expertise in information management.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
