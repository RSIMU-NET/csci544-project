HSA-eligible plan enrollees generally had higher incomes than comparison groups, but data on age differences were inconclusive. In 2004, 51 percent of tax filers reporting an HSA contribution had an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or more, compared with 18 percent of all tax filers under 65 years old. Two of the three employers GAO reviewed, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and a national broker of health insurance also reported that HSA-eligible plan enrollees had higher incomes than traditional plan enrollees in 2005. Just over half of all HSA-eligible plan enrollees and most employers contributed to HSAs, and account holders used their HSA funds to pay for medical care and accumulate savings. About 55 percent of HSA-eligible plan enrollees reported HSA contributions to the Internal Revenue Service in 2004, and about two-thirds of employers offering HSA-eligible plans contributed to their employees' HSAs. About 45 percent of tax filers reporting 2004 HSA contributions also reported that they withdrew funds in that year, and 90 percent of these funds were withdrawn for qualified medical expenses. The other 55 percent of those reporting HSA contributions did not withdraw any funds from their HSA in 2004. HSA-eligible plan enrollees who participated in GAO's focus groups generally reported positive experiences, but most would not recommend the plans to all consumers. Few participants reported researching cost before obtaining health care services, although many researched the cost of prescription drugs.

In  this report, we examined enrollees\u2019 experiences with health savings  accounts (HSA) and the high-deductible health insurance plans that are  eligible to be coupled with them. Since tax-advantaged HSAs were made  available in 2004, this new type of consumer-directed health plan has been  attracting interest among employers and enrollees. HSA-eligible plans now  constitute a small but growing share of the private health insurance  market. The number of enrollees and dependents covered by an HSA- eligible plan increased from about 438,000 in September 2004 to about   3 million in January 2006. Both employers and plan enrollees may  contribute to tax-advantaged HSAs, and enrollees can use the accounts to  pay for their health care expenses. The high-deductible health plans  typically have lower premiums than other types of health plans because  high-deductible health plan enrollees bear a greater share of the initial  costs of care.", "The novel structure of HSA-eligible plans has raised questions regarding  how the plans and HSAs will affect enrollees\u2019 health care purchasing  decisions and costs. Proponents of HSA-eligible plans believe that the high  deductibles will encourage enrollees to become more astute health care  consumers and thus restrain health care spending increases. However,  some critics contend that the plans may attract a disproportionate share of  wealthier enrollees who seek to use the HSA as a tax-advantaged savings  vehicle, or healthier or younger individuals who use fewer health care  services. If this occurred, premiums for traditional health insurance plans,  such as preferred provider organizations (PPO), could rise faster than  they otherwise would because of the disproportionate share of enrollees  with higher health care expenses remaining in those plans.", "My remarks today will focus on (1) the financial features of HSA-eligible  plans in comparison with those of traditional plans, (2) the characteristics  of HSA-eligible plan enrollees in comparison with those of traditional plan  enrollees or others, (3) HSA funding and use, and (4) enrollees\u2019  experiences with HSA-eligible plans. These remarks are based on  information contained in our August 2006 report.", "In conducting our work, we analyzed data regarding HSA-eligible and  traditional plans and enrollees from two national employer health benefits  surveys; three selected large employers; and eHealthInsurance, a large,  national broker of individual and small business health insurance. To  illustrate the potential health care costs faced by HSA-eligible and  traditional plan enrollees, we estimated the total annual costs incurred by  enrollees of the three employers\u2019 2005 HSA-eligible and PPO plans,  considering different levels of health care utilization. We compared  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data for tax filers reporting HSA  contributions with corresponding data for all tax filers under 65 years old.  We also conducted focus groups with employees of the three employers. A  detailed explanation of our scope and methodology is included in the  report\u2019s appendix I. This report is the most recent of several related  reports GAO has issued within the last year. The work done for these  reports was performed from November 2004 through July 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found that HSA-eligible plans had lower premiums, higher  deductibles, and higher out-of-pocket spending limits than did traditional  plans in 2005, but both plan types covered similar services, including  preventive services.

HSA-eligible plans are  required to meet certain statutory criteria. The plans must have a  minimum deductible amount\u2014$1,050 for single coverage and $2,100 for  family coverage in 2006\u2014and a maximum limit on enrollee out-of-pocket  spending\u2014$5,250 for single coverage and $10,500 for family coverage in  2006. Preventive care services may be exempted from the deductible  requirement, but coverage of most other services, including prescription  drugs, is subject to the deductible. After meeting the deductible, the HSA- eligible plan pays for most of the cost of covered services until the  enrollee meets the out-of-pocket spending limit, at which point the plan  pays 100 percent of the cost of covered services.", "A savings account to pay for health care expenses. There are several  types of savings accounts that may be associated with consumer-directed  health plans, with HSAs being among the most prominent. An HSA is a tax- advantaged savings account established for paying qualified medical  expenses. Individuals are eligible to open an HSA if they are enrolled in  an HSA-eligible plan and have no other health coverage, with limited  exceptions. HSAs are owned by the account holder, and the accounts are  portable\u2014individuals may keep their accounts if they switch jobs or enroll  in a non-HSA-eligible health plan. Both employers and individuals may  contribute to HSAs, and individuals may claim a deduction on their federal  income taxes for their HSA contributions. HSA balances can earn interest;  roll over from year to year; and be invested in a variety of financial  instruments, such as mutual funds. HSA-eligible plan enrollees who  choose to pay for medical expenses from their HSA may access their  account funds by check, by debit card, or by authorizing insurance carriers  to allow providers to directly debit their account funds. HSAs are subject  to annual contribution limits. In 2006, contributions were limited to   100 percent of the deductible, but not more than $2,700 for single coverage  or $5,450 for family coverage. Contributions, earned interest, and  withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are not subject to federal  income taxation. A financial institution, such as a bank or insurance  company, typically administers the account.", "Decision-support tools. HSA-eligible plans typically provide enrollee  decision-support tools that include, to some extent, information on the  cost of health care services and the quality of health care providers.  Experts suggest that reliable information about the cost of particular  health care services and the quality of specific health care providers would  help enrollees become more actively engaged in making health care  purchasing decisions. These tools may be provided by health insurance  carriers to all health insurance plan enrollees, but are likely to be more  important to enrollees of HSA-eligible plans who have a greater financial  incentive to make informed decisions about the quality and costs of health  care providers and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Features of HSA-Eligible Plans Differed From Those of Traditional Plans, but Covered Services Were Similar", "paragraphs": ["HSA-eligible plans had lower premiums, higher deductibles, and higher  out-of-pocket spending limits than traditional plans in 2005.

Because  healthier individuals who use little health care could incur lower costs  under HSA-eligible plans than under traditional plans, when given a choice  they may be more likely to select an HSA-eligible plan than will less  healthy individuals who use greater amounts of health care. It will be  important to monitor enrollment trends and assess their implications for  the cost of health care coverage for all HSA-eligible and traditional plan  enrollees.", "Few of the HSA-eligible plan enrollees who participated in our focus  groups researched cost before obtaining health care services. This may be  due in part to a reluctance of consumers to question health care providers  about the cost of their services and the dearth of information provided by  insurance carriers to their enrollees about the cost of health care services  under their plans\u2014a limitation that insurance carriers are beginning to  address. According to proponents, an increase in such health care  consumerism can help restrain health care spending increases under the  plans. Such an increase will likely require time, education, and improved  decision-support tools that provide enrollees with more information about  the cost and quality of health care providers and services.", "Finally, while HSA-eligible plan enrollees we spoke with were generally  satisfied with their plans, it is notable that these enrollees each had a  choice of health plans and voluntarily selected the HSA-eligible plan. Their  caution that HSA-eligible plans may not be appropriate for everyone  suggests that satisfaction may be lower when employees are not given a  choice or when employer contributions to premiums or accounts do not  sufficiently offset the potentially greater costs faced by HSA-eligible plan  enrollees.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
