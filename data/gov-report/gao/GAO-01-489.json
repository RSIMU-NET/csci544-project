As a result, District managers did not have fundamental financial information necessary to help control spending and costs and to estimate budget and cash needs. Given the long-standing problems with the District\u2019s financial management, we recommended that the Authority study the accounting and financial management information needs of the District.", "Subsequently, the Authority and the District requested and the Congress approved funds to assess the need for implementing a new financial management system. The 1996 District of Columbia Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-134) authorized the District of Columbia government to spend $28 million of its revenues to implement a replacement for its existing financial management system. Of the $28 million, $2 million was provided for a needs analysis and assessment of the existing financial management environment. Public Law104-134 made the remaining $26 million available to procure the necessary hardware; install new software; and perform system conversion, testing, and training after the needs analysis and the assessment were received by the Congress.", "The District is now in its fourth year of implementing its new financial management system.

However, a number of key initiatives have still not been completed or have been placed on hold, and some are still being revised. For example, the District has yet to complete implementation of SOAR, the personnel and payroll system, the procurement system, and the tax system. The District is also in the process of reengineering its budget process before deciding whether to implement a new budget process and fully integrate the budget data within SOAR. In addition, the District has not yet implemented the fixed asset module of SOAR.", "The original implementation schedule indicated that SOAR would be fully implemented by September 30, 1998, and the external feeder system and the related interfaces were scheduled for completion by April 1999. The SOAR implementation, however, has been marked by delays. As we noted in our April 1998 report, we found severe weaknesses in critical implementation processes, including lack of requirements development and project management. For example, the District did not have an organizational policy for establishing and managing software-related requirements and no clear assignment of responsibility for requirements development and management. As a result, the District did not have assurance that the new financial management system or any other software acquisition project undertaken would be conducted in a disciplined manner. Further, studies have shown that problems associated with requirements management are key factors in software projects that do not meet their cost, schedule, and performance goals and that these systems can cost many times more than expected if done improperly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance Budgeting Module Put on Hold", "paragraphs": ["The Performance Budgeting module included in SOAR was expected to facilitate the management of the entire budget formulation process, from budget submission to final review and approval. One of the primary objectives of the Performance Budgeting module is the automation of the annual budget development process to replace the present cumbersome, manual process.

District officials anticipated that the performance measures feature in the module would be able to provide comparative and cost information for all levels of programs throughout the District. Comparative and accurate cost information would enable stakeholders to make more informed decisions, eventually providing better service to the citizens of the District. District officials anticipated that performance measures, once they were developed for programs in the District, could be maintained and tracked easily and accurately in the module.", "At the time of our review, the District had decided to suspend the implementation of the Performance Budgeting module. District officials told us that in addition to the need for reengineering the budget process, the current design of the Performance Budgeting system does not fully support the District\u2019s information needs. Specifically, the Performance Budgeting module is not a fully integrated product of the core accounting system and will require multiple and frequent updates to the two systems in order to maintain a fully integrated system as updates or upgrades occur to one or both systems; the current, nonintegrated design of the Performance Budgeting module limits both agency budget staff and the Office of Budget and Planning (OBP) from fully using information from the core accounting system; and inadequate reporting tools within the Performance Budgeting module prevent OBP from generating essential budget reports on a timely basis to the stakeholders.", "In addition to the above financial system issues, District officials stated that use of the Performance Budgeting module at this time presents a number of other technical support system challenges and the current condition of the District\u2019s financial support systems needs to be stabilized before implementation. For example,   The lack of a stable unified Wide Area Network (WAN) precludes District agencies from accessing the system and developing their fiscal year 2002 budgets. However, according to the SOAR Project Plan, the necessary infrastructure analysis was completed on January 6, 1998.", "Current client server resources prevent agency budget staff from concurrently accessing the Performance Budgeting module during peak budget season, which can result in users being locked out or knocked off the system.", "In addition to the above factors, further review by OBP has resulted in a decision by the District to reengineer the budget formulation process and develop a requirements definition for the new process and then select a new software solution to deliver the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fixed Assets Module Has Not Been Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The Fixed Assets module was intended to track the acquisition, transfer, disposition, and maintenance of the District\u2019s capitalized assets (such as personal property, equipment, and buildings) and support accounting, management, and control over these assets, which totaled a reported $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2000. The District\u2019s implementation schedule for this module has continually been revised. For example, originally scheduled to be implemented in February 1999, the Fixed Assets module is now planned to be implemented by the end of fiscal year 2001\u2014over 2 years after the initially planned implementation. According to the SOAR Program Management Office (PMO), the delay was the result of multiple competing priorities such as the Year 2000 conversion and the production of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) combined with the problem of limited personnel resources. Currently, fixed assets are recorded by each agency using a variety of methods, including manually updated ledger books and off-line automated tools. Such methods, however, are error-prone and could lead to incorrect recording and reporting of assets.

The SOAR PMO was unable to provide an explanation as to why the status report was not being updated more frequently even though work was ongoing. In our July 1997 report, we raised concerns about the District\u2019s failure to focus more broadly on its financial requirements, such as those stemming from the need to integrate SOAR with feeder systems. We noted that the District had not defined how the interfaces would work or what data would be provided for each feeder system. In addition, as we reported in October 1997, the District\u2019s time frames for implementing its systems seemed to be ambitious in light of the complex nature of the District\u2019s financial management structure and the lack of identified and confirmed requirements for several key systems, such as the feeder systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses and Uncertainties Surround Personnel/Payroll System", "paragraphs": ["The District acquired and developed a new personnel and payroll system in order to improve the quality of its business processes and to replace an aging legacy system. As we noted in a 1995 testimony, personnel information on the District\u2019s 40,000 employees has long been error-prone and inconsistent. Beginning in 1991, the District created an action plan to acquire an automated human resources management information system, called the Comprehensive Automated Personnel and Payroll System (CAPPS). CAPPS was estimated to cost about $13 million to develop and was expected to be deployed by December 1999. The District had anticipated that CAPPS would provide more robust human resources capability than the prior legacy system, such as providing on-line funding data at the agency level, budgetary and spending controls at the position level, and accurate accounting of expenses, such as overtime.", "However, as we reported in December 1999, the District did not effectively plan for CAPPS. We noted that the District did not develop a project management plan and a risk management plan; obtain agreement from the acquisition team, system users, and the contractor on detailed requirements for CAPPS; or establish a configuration control process to control the changes that were made to data tables connected to the software package that the District acquired for CAPPS. By not implementing these critical management processes, the District lacked the means to establish realistic time frames for CAPPS, track development along those time frames, and ensure that changes being made to CAPPS were consistent and in line with business requirements. In fact, since beginning the CAPPS initiative in 1991, the District has had to continually revise its CAPPS implementation deadline.", "As a result of these delays, some District agencies are using the CAPPS system, while others continue to use the old personnel and payroll system, the Unified Personnel and Payroll System (UPPS), until a plan for a new payroll processing system can be developed. DC Public Schools, the Fire Department, and a few smaller agencies are using CAPPS to process payroll, while the remaining District agencies process their payroll through UPPS. Relying on dual systems in this manner leads to lack of standardization and creates unnecessary effort and inefficiencies. In addition, CAPPS is not electronically integrated with SOAR, and both CAPPS and UPPS data must undergo a conversion process before interfacing with SOAR, creating further inefficiencies in processing and reporting payroll-related costs.", "Furthermore, the District is in the process of determining whether it will continue with CAPPS or whether an entirely new system is needed. In an August 11, 2000, letter to the Mayor, the District CFO stated that \u201cthe new CAPPS system, for a number of reasons, is compromised beyond repair. While it continues to pay people accurately, it has been customized to the point that its basic architecture has been destroyed. Underlying calculations necessary to make retirement computations and W-2s are likely fatally compromised.\u201d This combination of weaknesses and uncertainties surrounding CAPPS further call into question the District\u2019s ability to resolve implementation issues and its ability to pay its employees accurately and on time and account for their retirement and benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integrated Tax System Is Not Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["According to a District official, the Integrated Tax System (ITS) is intended to be a complete reengineering of the Office of Tax and Revenue\u2019s (OTR) business process, at an estimated cost of about $63 million.

As a result, various offices rely on different systems to process procurements. OCP has spent at least $14 million since it began the process of implementing a new procurement system 13 years ago. A July 2000 DC Office of Inspector General report stated that PRISM/OCP Express and SOAR had interface problems and that procurement data were being maintained in both systems. Furthermore, reports generated with procurement data must be developed with the coordination of the responsible agencies and after reconciliation of data from both systems. According to a District official, this situation makes it difficult for them to track procurements and payments, and the use of both systems has produced inefficiencies, duplication, and waste within the District. An OCP official told us that they recently hired a contractor to review OCP Express capabilities and determine what modifications, if any, could be made to enhance its functionality.

OBP officials stated that, as a result of the GFOA recommendations, they have made a number of staffing and organizational changes, which were consistent with many of the initiatives for change they had already started. OBP officials stated that they have taken the following actions:   created the position of Chief Operating Officer to increase overall program efficiency and accountability in three programs: data management, organization management, and communications; realigned the Associate Deputy CFO (ADCFO) position to sharpen OBP\u2019s quality of forecasting and long-term fiscal planning ability with ADCFO assuming responsibility for the functions of economic analysis, budget execution and reporting, and legislative affairs, which are three new branches;   assigned the Economic Analysis Branch the lead on improving performance-based budgeting for the District;   designated the Legislative Affairs Branch as the leading provider of legislative support to OCFO and other stakeholders, providing legislative, legal, and policy analysis to ensure that the goals of District stakeholders are achieved;   gave the Organizational Management Branch responsibility for supervising and coordinating general office operations and building morale and reducing attrition through reform, orientation, recruitment, outreach efforts, training, and career development; and reorganized the Operating and Capital Budget divisions, which under the old structure functioned independently of each other with little or no collaboration or interaction, into a two-pronged division that strategically links operating and capital budget operations.", "According to District OBP officials, the above changes have improved budget forecasting activities as well as provided greater control over budget execution and fiscal oversight.", "We agree that OBP needed to address personnel and related organizational issues in order to better align its operations and facilitate and enhance its ability to carry out its budgetary and financial responsibilities.

A concept of operations\u2014 the panorama of a system\u2019s purpose and the environment in which it will function\u2014is the basis on which specific requirements\u2014 functions the system must be able to perform\u2014are developed. With a complete set of well-defined requirements based on a clear concept of operations, District leaders could make an accurate analysis of how well available alternatives would meet the needs of the government and its citizens.", "In April 1998, after the District had contracted for and begun development of its new system, a more detailed study led us again to the conclusion that the District\u2019s process, while strong in some areas, was undisciplined and immature. Our conclusion was based on a well- recognized model of software process assessment, the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model (SA-CMM). In our recommendations, we stressed the need for written policy and documentation, the development of a management plan, the assignment of responsibility for areas of planning and development, and requirements development in the key process areas of software acquisition planning, requirements development and management, project management, contract tracking and oversight, evaluation, and acquisition risk management.", "Although the processes spelled out in the SA-CMM model and our recommendations are detailed, rigorous, and time-consuming, they are, in the long run, cost-effective and vital elements of success. Unfortunately, in its efforts to meet an overly ambitious time schedule, the District has spent considerably more money than planned to acquire a system that\u20146 years after we began our review and started making recommendations\u2014 now serves as yet another cautionary example of the risks entities run when they choose to short-cut a disciplined approach to the planning, acquisition, and management of a financial management system.", "Another key component of successful financial management for the District is conducting a comprehensive assessment of its human capital needs for its financial management functions. In our Executive Guide: Creating Value Through World-class Financial Management, we outlined three critical elements for developing first-rate financial management staff teams. These elements were: (1) determining required skills and competencies, (2) measuring the gap between what the organization needs and what it has, and (3) developing strategies and detailed plans to address current or expected future deficiencies. We reported that having staff with appropriate skills is key to achieving financial management improvements, and managing an organization\u2019s employees is essential to achieving results. Entities that focus on valuing employees and aligning their policies to support organizational performance goals start with a human capital assessment. The results of such an assessment could help to determine the resources needed to successfully implement financial management improvements. And, as we reported in September 2000,performing a self-assessment of human capital needs helps organization leaders understand the strengths and limitations of their human capital information systems. These data can help an organization develop a profile of its human capital. Further, because human capital information can spotlight areas of concern before they develop into crises, gathering these data is an indispensable part of effective risk management. Without a formal assessment of its requirements and needs, and a strategy for addressing them, the District\u2019s efforts can become piecemeal, incomplete, and ineffective. The challenges the District already faces in implementing its financial management system could be exacerbated by its lack of a human capital assessment for its financial management functions. By not identifying staff with the requisite skills to implement such a system and by not identifying gaps in needed skills and filling them, the District has reduced its chances for successful implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most of Our Prior Recommendations Related to the Financial Management System Have Not Been Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In reports dating back to 1995, we have reported on the District\u2019s financial situation and efforts to improve its financial management, including the implementation of SOAR. For example, in 1995, we recommended that the Mayor clean up existing data in the financial systems and place special emphasis on ensuring that basic accounting policies and procedures are followed and that the Authority study the accounting and financial management information needs of the District. In a July 9, 1997, status report, we noted that the District had not completed three key elements of its system acquisition: concept of operations, requirements definition, and alternatives analysis. We also noted that the time frames for completing several of these important tasks were unknown and that the District had adopted an overly ambitious schedule.", "On April 30, 1998, we reported that the District\u2019s software acquisition processes, while having some strengths, were not mature when compared to standards established by the Software Engineering Institute. Weaknesses noted in the report included: (1) requirements definition problems; (2) project management and oversight weaknesses; (3) lack of an effective evaluation process; (4) lack of a formal risk management process; and (5) failure to meet some milestones. In that report, we made six recommendations for strengthening the processes that relate to the SOAR project and improving future software acquisition efforts. As discussed earlier, in our December 1999 report on the CAPPS system, we noted that by not implementing critical management processes, the District lacked the means to establish realistic time frames for CAPPS, track development along those time frames, and ensure that changes being made to CAPPS were consistent and in line with business requirements. We made six recommendations to the District that focused on the need to implement effective management controls and processes for maintaining, operating, and protecting CAPPS.", "Together, those reports established a framework for actions the District needed to take in order to (1) improve its financial management and (2) avoid costly failure when acquiring a new financial management system that would successfully meets its needs. In our reports, we indicated that major improvements in the District\u2019s financial management and other management information can only be realized if they are part of an overall assessment of processes, people, and equipment.", "As of April 3, 2001, the District had implemented 3 of the 16 recommendations we made since 1995, and critical recommendations have yet to be fully addressed.

The current mix of components involves duplication of effort and requires cumbersome manual processing instead of automated interfaces. Staff members who use the system are inadequately trained. In its current state, the system is unable to produce relevant, useful, timely, and reliable information adequate to the needs of government officials for assessing the costs of programs, measuring program performance, and making well- informed decisions in forming the city\u2019s budget and in providing city services.", "With a system that is still incomplete more than 2 years after the planned date for citywide implementation, the District has already spent over 50 percent more than originally planned for SOAR implementation. The project continues to experience implementation delays, and the final cost of the complete financial management system cannot yet be determined.", "Disciplined acquisition and implementation processes are designed to prevent the types of problems experienced by the District in its financial management systems implementation. The key to a disciplined system development effort is the use of disciplined processes in multiple areas, including requirements management, project planning, project tracking and oversight, quality assurance, configuration management, and risk management. These key areas have been the focus of our recommendations in reports dating back to 1995. The District has not yet completed action on most of these recommendations and has failed to institute the disciplined approach needed to ensure the successful implementation and management of a financial management system.", "The District\u2019s difficulties reflect the experience of other entities that have attempted to build a financial management system without first laying a solid foundation. Essential to that foundation is the definition of requirements. A system cannot be counted on to fill needs that have not been clearly defined. When those needs are later identified, retrofitting software can cost significantly more than the same work done during original development. The District continues to develop its system without clearly defined user requirements.", "Although the District recently received its fourth consecutive unqualified or \u201cclean\u201d audit opinion on its financial statements, the financial information needed by decisionmakers to measure and manage performance requires greater precision and more timely access than that needed to satisfy a financial audit. Furthermore, to continue achieving clean opinions without the support of an efficient financial management system, officials and staff will be forced each year to devote extraordinary effort at the expense of other city government operations. As the city moves toward greater financial independence, the weakness of its financial management system may become increasingly difficult to overcome.", "As we recently reported in our Executive Guide, to provide meaningful information to decisionmakers, entities must develop systems that support the partnership between finance and operations. Entities must ensure that the systems accurately measure the program costs and that they provide decisionmakers and line managers with timely, accurate financial information on the quality and efficiency of business processes and performance. Entities must also identify their human capital needs by conducting a human capital assessment in order to develop human capital strategies to address current and future risks faced by the entity. Such an assessment is critical to helping entities establish the systems and processes needed to successfully improve financial management and accountability.", "District officials need to take time now to assess the current status of the city\u2019s financial management system, to identify problems, and to establish a disciplined process to address these problems through the completion of its financial systems implementation. As we discussed in our Executive Guide, financial management improvement needs to be an entitywide priority\u2014in this case, the District\u2014overseen by leadership that is in control of the process and accountable for its success. Financial and program managers need to be able to rely on the system for adequate, timely cost and performance information needed to manage costs, measure performance, make program funding decisions, and analyze outsourcing or privatization options.

With respect to the CFO\u2019s comments on SOAR, the results of our work showed that the CFO\u2019s characterization of the progress made to date was overly optimistic. The CFO\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II. A representative from the Mayor\u2019s Office also reviewed this draft, along with the CFO\u2019s comments, and stated that the Mayor\u2019s Office had no further comments.", "In regard to implementing our prior recommendations, the CFO stated that the District is taking action as described in a March 12, 2001, letter to us. This letter was in response to our recent request that the District provide us an update on the actions it had taken to address recommendations from our December 1999 report. As part of our ongoing work in the District, we will be evaluating these actions to determine whether they satisfactorily address our prior recommendations.", "Concerning our recommendation that the District assess its human capital needs, the CFO noted that the District had taken the initial step in conducting a human capital assessment by engaging a professional services firm to help review the District\u2019s organizational structure and identify performance measures and best practices. However, as the CFO noted, the professional services firm review provides the groundwork for the first phase of the CFO\u2019s financial management performance measures program. A complete human capital assessment will be an essential part of the CFO\u2019s improved financial management leadership and support.", "Although the CFO agreed with our recommendation that the District complete the reengineering of the budget process in conjunction with the implementation of a budget and project costing system, the CFO took exception to certain statements pertaining to our finding. Specifically, the CFO disagreed with our statement that the fiscal year 2002 budget formulation process did not have the benefit of an \u201cimplemented financial system gathering and formulating its budget data\u201d and that it would not have \u201cadequate program-level cost and budget results data for fiscal year 2001.\u201d The CFO stated that the fiscal year 2002 budget process did in fact integrate data from several financial systems: CAPPS, UPPS, and SOAR. However, this reliance on compiling data generated from multiple, nonintegrated systems contributed to our finding that the District relies on a cumbersome process to generate financial information. Instead of relying on one unified system to reliably and routinely provide information as needed, the District must compile information from various different systems, which creates inefficiencies and rework.", "The CFO also stated that the District has an updated timetable and comprehensive plan for fully implementing the SOAR system. However, at the time we had finalized our report, the District had not provided us with a plan. In addition, as discussed in our report, the District\u2019s performance budget module has been put on hold and the fixed asset module is incomplete. Both of these modules are key components of the SOAR system. Further, the implementation of systems that feed into SOAR\u2014 personnel and payroll, procurement, and tax \u2014is incomplete and the systems lack electronic interfaces with SOAR. Also, it is uncertain whether the currently envisioned successor to the personnel and payroll system\u2014 CAPPS\u2014will be retained or whether an entirely new system is needed, and we were unable to obtain updated timetables and comprehensive plans for the implementation of these key feeder systems. As we recommended, the District needs to formulate a comprehensive plan that includes details of estimated dates, actions needed, and assignment of responsibilities for the completion of these modules and related systems.", "The CFO also stated that the District\u2019s annual financial statements are an output of the SOAR system and thus reliable, auditable financial data is available from SOAR and the Executive Information System. However, as we noted in our report, the financial information needed by decisionmakers to measure and manage performance requires greater precision and more timely access than that needed to satisfy a financial audit. Financial and program managers need to be able to rely on the system for adequate, timely cost and performance information needed to manage costs, measure performance, make program funding decisions, and analyze outsourcing or privatization options.", "The CFO also stated that the core SOAR implementation was delivered on schedule and performs as intended. He further noted that the increased costs of the SOAR implementation were directly associated with changes in scope not cost overruns. As we noted in our report, however, the District\u2019s performance budget module has been put on hold and the fixed asset module is incomplete. Both of these modules are key components of the SOAR system. Further, as discussed above, the implementation of systems that feed into SOAR\u2014personnel and payroll, procurement, and tax\u2014is incomplete and the systems lack electronic interfaces with SOAR.
