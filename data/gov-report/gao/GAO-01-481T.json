These 42 million people represent a heterogeneous population.  As we noted in our testimony before your Committee earlier this week, the majority of the uninsured are working, often for small businesses or in certain industries such as agriculture or construction that are less likely to offer health insurance, or are low- income persons who are ineligible for or not enrolled in public programs. A disproportionate share of young adults, Hispanics, and residents of southern or western states are uninsured.  But the uninsured population also includes people employed by larger-sized firms and other industries as well as those of all income levels, ages, races and ethnicities, and geographic locations.  Given the heterogeneity of this population, a variety of approaches have been proposed in the Congress and by proponents to increase private or public health insurance coverage in ways that may match the needs of different uninsured persons and maximize the potential impact for expanding coverage.", "Several recent congressional efforts represent important steps toward increasing the availability of health insurance for workers and low-income families, including improving the availability of private health insurance for individuals changing jobs or with preexisting health conditions, increasing the percentage of health insurance premiums that self- employed individuals can deduct from their taxable income, giving additional flexibility to states to expand Medicaid eligibility to a larger group of low-income children and their parents, and establishing the new federal-state State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which had already enrolled more than 3 million low- income children in 2000.", "These steps help millions of Americans, and the full effect of some of these actions likely has not yet been realized.  Despite these efforts, however, millions of Americans remain uninsured.", "To assist the Committee as it considers the variety of proposals offered to expand coverage to the uninsured, my remarks today will provide an overview of potential approaches for increasing private or public coverage and considerations that could impact their effectiveness in reaching significant numbers of the uninsured.  Specifically, I will focus on proposed additional tax incentives, such as deductions or credits, to encourage individuals to purchase private health insurance or employers to offer coverage; proposed expansions to public programs, including expanding Medicaid and SCHIP to additional low-income children and adults, and allowing near-elderly individuals not yet 65 to \u201cbuy in\u201d to Medicare; and the potential for unintended consequences of private and public coverage expansions on existing private health insurance coverage.", "My comments are based on our prior and ongoing work on the uninsured population, private health insurance, Medicaid, and SCHIP, as well as other published research.  We reviewed key elements of major proposals that have been introduced in the 106th and 107th Congresses, as well as several put forth by various proponents. some analysts conclude is not large enough to induce most low-income uninsured individuals to begin purchasing health insurance.  Some proposed credits for small employers or those with many low-wage workers would be provided for a limited period of time, which may make affected employers hesitant to begin offering coverage or increasing their premium contribution if the continued availability of the credit is uncertain.", "Other proposals would expand eligibility for existing public programs to more low-income children and adults.  These include giving states the option of increasing income eligibility limits under Medicaid or SCHIP; expanding these public programs to persons who are not now eligible, such as most childless adults for the Medicaid program or the parents of children eligible for SCHIP; and allowing near-elderly individuals who are not yet Medicare-eligible to pay premiums and thereby buy in to Medicare.", "The success of these efforts in reducing the number of uninsured is contingent upon (1) the willingness of states to pursue options to expand Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility and (2) the effectiveness of outreach to enroll eligible individuals, since at present many eligible individuals are not participating.", "Proposed approaches to expand insurance coverage may result in some individuals or employers dropping current coverage in order to take advantage of a new tax subsidy or public program that would reduce health insurance costs associated with individual or employment-based coverage.  While some steps may be taken to reduce the potential for this phenomenon\u2014known as \u201ccrowd-out\u201d\u2014some level of such displacement of existing private coverage may be an inevitable cost of efforts to decrease the number of uninsured Americans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["deductible as a business expense; this subsidy also is not considered taxable income for employees.  In addition, tax benefits are available to individuals who purchase nongroup private insurance directly from insurers (referred to as \u201cindividual insurance\u201d) if the person is self- employed or has premium and medical expenses combined that exceed 7.5 percent of his or her adjusted gross income.", "However, private insurance is not accessible to everyone.  Some workers, including those working for small firms or in certain industries such as agriculture or construction, are less likely to be offered employment-based health coverage.  Health insurance may also be expensive and potentially unaffordable for those paying the entire premium individually rather than receiving employment-based coverage where employers typically contribute to some or all of the cost.  In addition, while all members of a group plan typically pay the same premium for employment-based insurance regardless of age or health status, in most states individual insurance premiums are higher for older, sicker individuals than for young, healthy individuals, potentially making them unaffordable.", "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) provided several important protections to improve the availability of private health insurance, particularly for individuals changing jobs or with preexisting health conditions.  HIPAA included guaranteed access to coverage for those leaving group coverage and for small employers; however, it did not address issues of affordability.  In addition, many states have enacted reforms that guarantee access to health insurance for certain high-risk individuals and small groups and that sometimes limit the premiums these persons and groups pay.  While these federal and state private insurance market reforms provide important protections for certain individuals and groups, recent research finds little, if any, effect from these reforms on overall private insurance coverage rates. higher eligibility standards as long as they are within federal guidelines. SCHIP was established in 1997 to give states the choice of receiving enhanced federal funding to cover additional low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid, generally those in families whose incomes are up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.  Unlike Medicaid, SCHIP is not an entitlement program, and states can halt enrollment once budgeted funds are exhausted.  As of September 2000, HCFA reported that 3.3 million children were enrolled in SCHIP.  Although Medicare primarily insures most Americans 65 years or older, it also provides coverage for some nonelderly individuals who are disabled or have end-stage renal disease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Proposed Tax Incentives Will Depend on Their Size and Timing", "paragraphs": ["Additional tax incentives proposed to encourage people to purchase health insurance vary in terms of who would be eligible, whether the tax incentive is provided to individuals or employers, and whether the incentive is a deduction that reduces taxable income or a credit that reduces total tax liability.  The proposals share challenges that will affect their success in covering newly insured individuals.  These challenges include (1) making the reduction in premiums large enough to induce uninsured persons to purchase health insurance or to encourage employers to offer coverage or increase their contributions to premiums, and (2) timing a subsidy to be available for low-income individuals at the time they pay their premiums, rather than after the end of the tax year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tax Deductions", "paragraphs": ["their taxable income\u2014potentially important if the employee must pay most or a large share (more than half) of the plan\u2019s premium, since these employees are more likely to turn down employment-based coverage.", "A tax deduction may be limited in its ability to induce uninsured individuals to purchase private insurance because most uninsured individuals do not earn enough for a deduction to make any or a significant difference in their net health insurance costs.  In 1999, about 40 percent of the uninsured either did not file income tax returns or were in the 0 percent marginal tax rate and would not benefit from the deduction if they purchased individual insurance.  Nearly 50 percent of the uninsured were in the 15 percent marginal tax rate, which, if they purchased qualifying health insurance, would allow them a 15 percent net reduction in their insurance cost.  Analysts have generally agreed that this level of reduction would encourage few additional uninsured individuals to purchase health insurance.  The remaining 10 percent of the uninsured, based on their marginal tax rates, would be eligible for a 28 to nearly 40 percent net reduction in the cost of their health insurance.  While this level of reduction in net premiums may induce some individuals in higher tax brackets to purchase health insurance, it is less than some analysts have concluded would be necessary to lead to a widespread increase in coverage.  For example, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that tax subsidies \u201cwould have to be fairly large\u2014approaching the full cost of the premium\u2014to induce a large proportion of the uninsured population to buy insurance.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Credits", "paragraphs": ["higher-income individuals could be eligible for a partial credit or no credit. Because more than half of uninsured individuals would not have had enough income tax liabilities in 1999 to receive the full credit amount, some proposals would make the credit refundable so that more low- income tax filers and a number of those who would not otherwise file could receive a larger portion or all of the amount.", "The number of individuals eligible for a tax credit would vary depending on the income thresholds specified in a proposal.  For example, we estimate that in 1999 22 million uninsured Americans were in families that potentially would have been eligible for a tax credit available to single tax filers with $30,000 in taxable income and joint or head-of-household tax filers with $50,000 in taxable income.  A recent study estimated that a tax credit of $1,000 for single coverage and $2,000 for family coverage with these taxable income thresholds could enable about 4.2 million\u2014or nearly 20 percent of eligible individuals\u2014to become newly insured.  If income eligibility levels were twice as high, we estimate that 3 million additional uninsured individuals would have been in families potentially eligible for the tax credit, and the study estimated that a credit at this higher income eligibility level would result in another 0.5 million newly insured. a high premium of $7,154 for a 60- to 64-year-old smoker in urban Illinois.", "Thus, in some states, a $1,000 tax credit could represent all or most of the premium for a young, healthy male or for someone purchasing a plan with a high deductible or limited benefits.  On the other hand, a $1,000 credit could represent a small proportion of the premium for a comprehensive health plan for an older person or someone with existing health conditions.  For many individuals, a $1,000 tax credit would likely represent less than half of a typical premium.", "A tax credit\u2019s ability to induce uninsured individuals to purchase coverage will also depend on the timing of the credit.  Some low-income individuals who want to take advantage of a credit to purchase health insurance may find it difficult to do so if they must pay the premiums up front but cannot receive the credit until the following year after filing their tax return.  To alleviate this problem, some proposals would allow advance funding of a credit, so that eligible individuals could receive the credit at the time they purchase the health insurance.  There is limited experience with advance payments of tax credits for individuals, and establishing an effective mechanism could be administratively challenging.  Procedures and resources to assess eligibility based on partial-year income information would need to be available nationwide.  In addition, efficient and equitable procedures for end-of-year reconciliations and recovery of excess payments would be necessary. insurance because they are required to spend money up-front to get the tax credit, whereas EITC is an addition to income, not a reimbursement for an expense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Incentives for Small Employers or Those With Many Low-Wage Workers", "paragraphs": ["To encourage more employers to offer coverage, some proposals would provide a tax subsidy to small firms or those with low-wage workers that often do not offer health insurance to their employees.

Also in 1998, among private establishments in which half or more of the workers were low-wage, only 31 percent offered health insurance to their employees, while other private establishments were nearly twice as likely to offer health insurance. that in 1996 37 percent of workers earning less than $7 per hour were offered coverage but turned it down, while only 14 percent of workers earning $15 or more per hour turned down coverage.", "Many proposed or already available state-offered tax credits for employers provide only a temporary subsidy for the first few years an employer offers coverage.  This may limit their potential for inducing employers to initiate and keep offering coverage.  Experts we have consulted in our private insurance work told us that small employers are not likely to begin offering health insurance if they do not believe they will be able to do so permanently.", "Some proposed employer tax credits are linked to small employers obtaining health insurance through a purchasing cooperative.  We reported last year that several existing cooperatives gave small employers the ability to offer a choice of plans, but typically at premiums similar to those available outside of the cooperative.  We also reported that most current cooperatives represented a small share of their local small group market (5 percent or less) and several had recently been discontinued or faced declining insurer or employer participation.  Some analysts suggest that small employer purchasing cooperatives could be more effective in making coverage more affordable if they represented a larger share of the market.  A significant employer tax credit linked to a small employer purchasing cooperative might stimulate participation and create larger market share, making them better able to secure lower-cost coverage for participants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Success of Public Program Expansions Depends on State Responsiveness and Outreach", "paragraphs": ["not currently eligible (such as childless adults) or raise income and asset eligibility standards.

While there was disagreement among analysts about the extent of crowd-out of private health insurance resulting from the Medicaid expansions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, concern led the Congress to include a requirement in SCHIP that states devise methods to avoid such crowd-out.  While several approaches may offset the extent of crowd-out, some degree of crowd-out may be an unavoidable cost of expanding private or public coverage to insure those that are currently uninsured.  For example, CBO analysts suggested that some displacement of private insurance is inevitable, particularly since some low-income families move in and out of private insurance coverage and public programs can allow these low-income families to achieve more stable insurance coverage. federal cost per newly insured person since much of the subsidy goes to those already covered.

Similarly, even if employers continued sponsoring coverage, some employees\u2014especially those who are young and healthy\u2014may be able to purchase lower-cost insurance in the individual market, which could over the long-term increase the costs for some remaining in the group employment-based market.
