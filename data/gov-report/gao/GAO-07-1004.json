An effort of this  scope has not been attempted since the end of the Apollo program, which  was designed to land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back to  Earth, and the start of the Space Shuttle Program more than three decades  ago. In 2004, the President established a new exploration policy\u2014  A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The President\u2019s Vision for U.S. Space  Exploration (Vision for Space Exploration).

A  major component of this transition involves NASA\u2019s workforce, which  comprises about 18,000 civil servants at various centers across the  country. To meet its future needs, NASA is seeking to maintain certain  critical skills in space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics  research. The agency needs to take action to align its workforce to the  new mission and goals in a timely fashion to help the safe operation of the  shuttle through retirement and a smooth transition to exploration  activities.

To do so, they must engage in strategic workforce planning, including  systematic assessments of current and future human capital needs and the  development of long-term strategies to fill any gaps. We recently reported  that human capital management is a governmentwide high-risk area  because federal agencies typically lack a strategic approach to human  capital management that integrates human capital efforts with their  missions and program goals.", "Given the importance of NASA\u2019s ability to sufficiently recruit, develop, and  retain the staff it needs to execute the agency\u2019s missions, you requested  that we examine the extent to which NASA (1) has aligned its human  capital planning framework with its strategic mission and programmatic  goals and (2) is recruiting, developing, and retaining critical science and  engineering personnel needed to address future workforce requirements.  To assess the alignment of NASA\u2019s human capital framework with its  strategic mission and programmatic goals, we analyzed a range of policies,  planning, and implementation documents; reviewed budget documents  and performance and accountability reports; and interviewed cognizant  officials in NASA\u2019s Office of Human Capital Management, mission  directorates, and various field centers. To assess NASA\u2019s efforts to recruit,  develop, and retain critical science and engineering personnel, we applied  our five strategic workforce planning principles (see figure 4).

According to Langley Research Center officials, for example, enhanced  annual leave under the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004 is used to recruit  senior executives from outside of the federal government, members of the  Senior Executive Service, and senior-level employees so that they can  accrue more vacation time. The Johnson Center uses retention bonuses to  recruit and retain personnel in hard-to-fill positions that can have  undesirable hours, such as mission operations controller positions and  physicians. For example, it developed the Gemini flight controller  initiative, which has improved retention of controllers. Gemini flight  controllers are certified in three systems and work nights and weekends to  maintain the International Space Station. The Center had difficulty  recruiting and maintaining employees in this area, so it piloted a 2-year  program that offered additional training and retention bonuses with 1-year  service agreements. To help the Johnson Center retain its medical officers,  a Physician\u2019s Comparability Allowance is used to make the center more  competitive with the private medical community.

For example, the Langley Research Center offers  appointments to all new hires of 2 to 4 years; according to Johnson Space  Center officials, it offers appointments to all new term hires for 6 years,  but usually converts them to permanent after 2 years; depending on a  continuing need for the position and proven performance of the employee  on the job; Glenn Space Center converts cooperative program students to  6 year appointments. NASA has increased the used of term appointments  for recent science and engineering hires. The use of such appointments for  all new hires at NASA has increased from 6 percent in 2002 to 67 percent  in 2006, and for entry-level science and engineering positions, from less  than 2 percent in 2002 to 42 percent in 2006.

Currently NASA is mapping the  shuttle workforce to Constellation Program work in a document that will  reflect the planned migration of the employees, phased to correspond to  key milestones in both programs. According to NASA, the first mapping is  scheduled to be completed in September 2007 and will be revised as the  shuttle flight manifest schedules are updated and Constellation Program  needs are further defined.

However, NASA does expect to use prime contractors in the development  of major systems such as launchers, upper stages, and crew vehicles. It  sees its role as the manager of the interfaces between major systems. In  order to accomplish this, NASA will develop strategic workforce plans to  align its workforce with the current and planned work of the agency.

NASA must realign where necessary  and plan for a workforce that will not be quite as large after the retirement  of the Shuttle Space Program. Technology funding must be redirected to  major development activities, programs canceled, aeronautics program  funding reduced, the science program restructured and planned funding  reduced. All these redirections, restructurings, and cancellations will  contribute to NASA\u2019s \u201cuncovered capacity\u201d problem.

The  agency recently requested Congress to amend the National Aeronautics  and Space Act of 1958, as amended, and the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004  to authorize NASA to use additional human capital flexibilities so that the  workforce might be reduced without having a reduction in force.", "NASA is also attempting to ensure that its field centers can accomplish  their missions through a focus on required core capabilities, to be  accomplished by directing all research, technology development, and  programs and projects, to the maximum extent possible, to the centers.  While improving workforce planning to better prepare for challenges in  the future is definitely an agencywide priority, some senior center officials  told us that they are currently focused on implementing immediate human  capital programs. To the agency\u2019s credit, some centers have created  knowledge management programs. For example, the Johnson Space  Center recently appointed a Chief Knowledge Officer who is developing  efforts to capture the experiences and knowledge of senior employees in  engineering, management, and administration who may retire in the near  future. In addition, the Johnson Space Center has an active Oral History  Program that captures the experience of those individuals who first  developed the technologies used in previous space flight programs,  including life sciences and astromaterials. Participants include managers,  engineers, technicians, doctors, astronauts, and other employees of NASA  and aerospace contractors who occupied key roles during the Mercury,  Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle programs. The Glenn Research  Center\u2019s Knowledge Management Working Group, has piloted programs  that record interviews with their senior managers to retain some of their  work experiences, and the center uses the Advancing Careers and  Employee Success mentoring program and shadowing of senior engineers  by recently hired engineers to transfer knowledge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["NASA has placed considerable emphasis on human capital management  and addressing challenges that the agency has been facing in recruiting,  retaining, and developing critical personnel.

At the center level, this has involved the  application of new ways to attract and develop staff. Taken together, these  actions represent credible progress in enhancing the workforce and  preparing for the future. However, there are challenges ahead for NASA  that will test its ability to sustain its progress\u2014notably the retirement of  the shuttle program and the expansion of exploration activities. The  magnitude of these changes and their implication for future workforce  needs will require NASA to accurately measure its progress, identify gaps  or obstacles that need to be addressed, and sustain a high degree of  coordination with its centers and work is just getting under way.

Specifically, we interviewed NASA Center  managers about the supply and demand for critically skilled workers,  examined NASA\u2019s efforts to develop a \u201cpipeline\u201d for recruiting these  personnel and reviewed its application of new flexibilities and authorities  under the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004. Also, we interviewed NASA  officials responsible for workforce and strategic human capital planning to  determine how NASA plans to address future challenges in managing its  science and engineering workforce. We also analyzed and compared  NASA\u2019s science and engineering workforce and strategic human capital  planning efforts with GAO\u2019s principles of effective human capital  management. In addition, we interviewed NASA officials responsible for  workforce and strategic human capital planning to determine how NASA  plans to address future challenges in managing its science and engineering  workforce.

Specifically, to assess the potential for retirements in  the next few years in NASA\u2019s science and engineering workforce, we  analyzed CPDF data on NASA employees\u2014as of September 30, 2006. We  limited our analysis to science and engineering occupational categories  that comprise NASA\u2019s science and engineering workforce. We analyzed  CPDF separations and demographic data (on the ages and years of  service) and NASA\u2019s WICN data for scientists and engineers in order to  identify the extent to which NASA\u2019s experienced science and engineering  workforce is eligible for and thus has the potential for retiring in the near  future. We did not independently verify the CPDF data on NASA\u2019s science  and engineering occupation series employees for the year we reviewed.  However, we previously reported that data from the CPDF for key  variables used in this study\u2014occupation, agency/subagency, birth date,  and service computation date\u2014were 99 percent accurate. Moreover, we  compared the CPDF results for NASA employees to data from NASA\u2019s  WICN system. CPDF data is limited to federal Executive Branch civilian  employees, and excludes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve,  intelligence agencies, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Office of the  Vice President, Postal Rate Commission, Tennessee Valley Authority, U.S.  Postal Service, White House Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation,  Public Health Service\u2019s Commissioned Officer Corps, Non-appropriated  fund employees and foreign nationals overseas, and the Judicial Branch.  Legislative Branch CPDF data is limited to the Government Printing  Office, U.S. Tax Court, and selected commissions.
