The FDI Act requires GAO to review each determination made. For the three determinations made to date, this report examines (1) steps taken by FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Treasury to invoke the exception; (2) the basis of the determination and the purpose of resulting actions; and (3) the likely effects of the determination on the incentives and conduct of insured depository institutions and uninsured depositors. To do this work, GAO reviewed agency documentation, relevant laws, and academic studies; and interviewed regulators and market participants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve collaborated before the announcement of five potential emergency actions that would require a systemic risk determination. In each case, FDIC and the Federal Reserve recommended such actions to Treasury, but Treasury made a determination on only three of the announced actions. Although two recommendations have not resulted in FDIC actions to date, their announcement alone could have created the intended effect of increasing confidence in institutions, while similarly generating negative effects such as moral hazard. However, because announcements without a determination do not trigger FDI Act requirements for documentation and communication, such as Treasury consultation with the President and notification to Congress, such de facto determinations heightened the risk that the decisions were made without the level of transparency and accountability intended by Congress. Further, uncertainties can arise because there is no requirement for Treasury to communicate that it will not be invoking a systemic risk determination for an announced action. Two of Treasury's systemic risk determinations--for Wachovia and Citigroup--were made to avert the failure of an institution that regulators determined could exacerbate liquidity strains in the banking system. A third determination was made to address disruptions to bank funding affecting all banks. Under this latter determination, FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which guaranteed certain debt issued through October 31, 2009, and certain uninsured deposits of participating institutions through December 31, 2010, to restore confidence and liquidity in the banking system. While there is some support for the agencies' position that the statute authorizes systemic risk assistance of some type under TLGP facts and that it permits assistance to the entities covered by the program, there are questions about these interpretations, under which FDIC created a broad-based program of direct assistance to institutions that had never before received such relief--\"healthy\" banks, bank holding companies, and other bank affiliates. Because these issues are matters of significant public interest and importance, the statutory requirements may require clarification. Regulators' use of the systemic risk exception may weaken market participants' incentives to properly manage risk if they come to expect similar emergency actions in the future. The financial crisis revealed limits in the current regulatory framework to restrict excessive risk taking by financial institutions whose market discipline is likely to have been weakened by the recent use of the systemic risk exception. Congress and regulators are considering reforms to the current regulatory structure. It is important that such reforms subject systemically important financial institutions to stricter regulatory oversight. Further, legislation has been proposed for an orderly resolution of financial institutions not currently covered by the FDI Act. A credible resolution regime could help impose greater market discipline by forcing participants to face significant costs from their decisions and preclude a too-big-to-fail dilemma."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In late 2008, the federal government took unprecedented steps to stabilize  the financial services sector by committing trillions of dollars of taxpayer  funds to assist financial institutions and restore order to credit markets.  One of these steps was the use of the \u201csystemic risk\u201d exception contained  in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), which Congress enacted  as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of  1991 (FDICIA). Under the systemic risk exception, the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can provide certain emergency assistance  authorized in the provision if the Secretary of the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), in consultation with the President and upon written  recommendation of FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), determines that compliance with  certain cost limitations would result in serious adverse effects on  economic conditions or financial stability and that such assistance could  mitigate these systemic effects. Such a determination exempts FDIC from  the FDI Act\u2019s least-cost rule, which requires FDIC to use the least costly  method when assisting an insured institution and prohibits FDIC from  increasing losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by protecting creditors  and uninsured depositors of an insured institution.", "On September 29, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury invoked the systemic  risk exception for the first time since the enactment of FDICIA. This first  determination authorized FDIC to provide assistance to facilitate a sale of  Wachovia Corporation\u2019s (Wachovia) banking operations to Citigroup Inc.  (Citigroup). At the time, Wachovia was the fourth-largest banking  organization in terms of assets in the United States. On October 14, 2008,  the Secretary of the Treasury again invoked the systemic risk provision, in  order to allow FDIC to provide certain assistance to insured depository  institutions, their holding companies, and qualified affiliates under the  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). Under TLGP, FDIC has  guaranteed newly issued senior unsecured debt up to prescribed limits for  insured institutions, their holding companies, and qualified affiliates and  provided temporary unlimited coverage for certain non-interest-bearing  transaction accounts at insured institutions. TLGP\u2019s debt guarantee  program ceased issuing new guarantees on October 31, 2009, and TLGP\u2019s  transaction account guarantees remain in effect for insured institutions  participating in an extension expiring on December 31, 2010. A third  systemic risk determination, on January 15, 2009, permitted FDIC to  provide assistance to Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. banking organization  by asset size at the end of the third quarter of 2008. FDIC and the Federal  Reserve also made two other recommendations to Treasury\u2014to authorize  FDIC to provide open bank assistance to Bank of America Corporation  (Bank of America) and to support the Public-Private Investment Program\u2019s  (PPIP) proposed Legacy Loans Program (LLP)\u2014neither of which had  resulted in a systemic risk determination as of this report\u2019s issuance date.  Treasury is no longer considering making a systemic risk determination  for the announced assistance to Bank of America as Treasury, FDIC, and  the Federal Reserve agreed with Bank of America to terminate the term  sheet with respect to this assistance. Under LLP, FDIC would provide  certain guarantees on the financing used by public-private investment  funds to purchase distressed loans and other troubled assets from  financial institutions to help restore their balance sheets.", "The FDI Act requires GAO to review and report to Congress on each  systemic risk determination made by the Secretary of the Treasury. For  the three systemic risk determinations made as of March 2010, this report  examines (1) the steps taken by Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC  to invoke the systemic risk exception; (2) the basis for each determination  and the purpose of actions taken pursuant to each determination; and (3)  the likely effects of each determination on the incentives and conduct of  insured depository institutions and uninsured depositors.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed and analyzed documentation of  Treasury\u2019s systemic risk determinations and the supporting  recommendations that FDIC and the Federal Reserve made. We also  reviewed FDI Act requirements for transparency and accountability with  respect to the use of the systemic risk exception and analyzed the  implications of announcements that are not followed by a Treasury  determination that would trigger these requirements. In addition, we  collected and analyzed various data to illustrate financial and economic  conditions at the time of each determination and the actions taken  pursuant to each determination. We reviewed and analyzed the research  reports of one credit rating agency and studies identifying the likely effects  of each determination and the actions taken on the incentives and conduct  of insured depository institutions and uninsured depositors. We also  reviewed prior GAO work on the financial regulatory system. In addition  we interviewed three economists, one banking industry association, and a  banking analyst as well as officials from Treasury, FDIC, the Federal  Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to gain  an understanding of their collaboration prior to making systemic risk  determinations, the basis and authority for each determination, and the  purpose of the actions taken under each determination. To perform our  review of whether the legal requirements for making determinations and  providing assistance under the systemic risk exception were met with  respect to TLGP, we reviewed applicable statutes, regulations, guidance,  and agency materials and obtained the legal views of agency officials,  practitioners, and academics.", "The work upon which this report is based was conducted in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Some institutions found  themselves so exposed that they were threatened with failure, and some  failed because they were unable to raise capital or obtain liquidity as the  value of their portfolios declined. Other institutions, ranging from  government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to large securities firms, were left holding \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgages or mortgage- related assets that became increasingly difficult to value, were illiquid, and  potentially had little worth. Moreover, investors not only stopped buying  private-label securities backed by mortgages but also became reluctant to  buy securities backed by other types of assets. Because of uncertainty  about the liquidity and solvency of financial entities, the prices banks  charged each other for funds rose dramatically, and interbank lending  conditions deteriorated sharply. The resulting liquidity and credit crunch  made the financing on which businesses and individuals depend  increasingly difficult to obtain. By late summer of 2008, the ramifications  of the financial crisis ranged from the continued failure of financial  institutions to increased losses of individual savings and corporate  investments and further tightening of credit that would exacerbate the  emerging global economic slowdown.", "Treasury and federal financial regulators play a role in regulating and  monitoring the financial system. Historically, Treasury\u2019s mission has been  to act as steward of U.S. economic and financial systems. Among its many  activities, Treasury has taken a leading role in addressing underlying  issues such as those precipitating the recent financial crisis. The key  federal banking regulators include the following:    The Federal Reserve, an independent agency that is responsible for  conducting the nation\u2019s monetary policy by influencing the monetary and  credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment,  stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates; supervising and  regulating bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are  members of the Federal Reserve System; and maintaining the stability of  the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in  financial markets through its role as lender of last resort;    FDIC, an independent agency created to help maintain stability and public  confidence in the nation\u2019s financial system by insuring deposits, examining  and supervising insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the  Federal Reserve System, and resolving failed or failing banks;    OCC, which charters and supervises national banks; and the    Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises savings associations  (thrifts) and savings and loan holding companies.", "In 1991, Congress enacted FDICIA in response to the savings and loan  crisis. FDICIA enacted a number of reforms, including some designed to  address criticisms that federal regulators had not taken prompt and  forceful actions to minimize or prevent losses to the deposit insurance  funds caused by bank and thrift failures. Among other things, FDICIA  amended the FDI Act by establishing a rule requiring FDIC to follow the  least costly approach when resolving an insured depository institution.  Specifically, under the least cost rule, FDIC must resolve a troubled  insured depository institution using the method expected to have the least  cost to the deposit insurance fund and cannot use the fund to protect  uninsured depositors and creditors who are not insured depositors if such  protection would increase losses to the fund. To make a least-cost  determination, FDIC must (1) consider and evaluate all possible resolution  alternatives by computing and comparing their costs on a present-value  basis, and (2) select the least costly alternative on the basis of the  evaluation. Under the least-cost requirements, FDIC generally has resolved  failed or failing banks using three basic methods, which do not constitute  open bank assistance. These are: (1) directly paying depositors the insured  amount of their deposits and disposing of the failed bank\u2019s assets (deposit  payoff and asset liquidation); (2) selling only the bank\u2019s insured deposits  and certain other liabilities, and some of its assets, to an acquirer (insured  deposit transfer); and (3) selling some or all of the failed bank\u2019s deposits,  certain other liabilities, and some or all of its assets to an acquirer  (purchase and assumption). According to FDIC officials, they have most  commonly used purchase and assumption, as it is often the least costly  and disruptive alternative.", "FDICIA also amended the FDI Act to create an exception to the least-cost  requirements, known as the systemic risk exception, that allows FDIC  assistance without complying with the least cost rule if compliance would  have \u201cserious adverse effects on economic conditions and financial  stability\u201d\u2014that is, would cause systemic risk\u2014and if such assistance  would \u201cavoid or mitigate such adverse effects.\u201d FDIC may act under the  exception only under the process specified in the statute. The FDIC Board  of Directors and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  each must recommend use of the exception by a vote of not less than two- thirds of their respective members and deliver a written recommendation  to the Secretary of the Treasury. Based on a review of the FDIC and  Federal Reserve recommendations, the Secretary of the Treasury, in  consultation with the President, may make a systemic risk determination  authorizing FDIC to take action or provide assistance that does not meet  the least-cost requirements. For example, under a systemic risk  determination, FDIC is not bound to identify and follow the least-cost  resolution strategy and may provide assistance (such as debt or deposit  guarantees) that protects uninsured depositors and creditors, who  otherwise might suffer losses under a least-cost method such as a  purchase and assumption or depositor payoff. Until recently, the systemic  risk exception required FDIC to recover any resulting losses to the  insurance fund by levying one or more emergency special assessments on  insured depository institutions. Congress amended this requirement in  May 2009 to also authorize assessments on bank holding companies, and  savings and loan holding companies. Finally, the systemic risk exception  includes requirements that serve to ensure accountability for regulators\u2019  use of this provision. The Secretary of the Treasury must notify Congress  in writing of any systemic risk determination and must document each  determination and retain the documentation for GAO review, and GAO  must report its findings to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentation Evidences Interagency Collaboration, but Announcements of FDIC Actions That Did Not Result in a Systemic Risk Determination Create Accountability and Transparency Concerns", "paragraphs": ["On five occasions, collaboration among high-level officials at Treasury,  FDIC, and the Federal Reserve resulted in the announcement of  emergency actions that would require a systemic risk exception.

In each case, a liquidity  crisis\u2014either at a single institution or across the banking industry\u2014 triggered discussions among FDIC, Federal Reserve, and Treasury officials  about whether to invoke the systemic risk exception. According to  regulators, these discussions generally occurred among high-level officials  at the three agencies over a period of a few days, through e-mail,  memorandums, telephone calls, and emergency meetings. The regulators  shared and analyzed information, such as data describing the liquidity  pressures facing financial institutions, to help them understand the  financial condition of the troubled institutions and the potential systemic  implications of complying with the least-cost resolution requirements. In  the second section of this report, we discuss in detail publicly available  information about the financial condition of the institutions that received  emergency assistance, the basis for each decision to invoke the systemic  risk exception, and the actions that FDIC took under the provision.", "Following these collaborations, FDIC and Federal Reserve staff submitted  documentation of their analyses and recommendations to support  invoking the systemic risk exception to their respective Boards.

In two cases, Wachovia and TLGP, Treasury made a  determination before regulators finalized the terms of the assistance.  According to Treasury, FDIC, and Federal Reserve officials, they publicly  announced emergency assistance prior to a Treasury determination in  these cases to reassure the markets that the government was committed to  supporting financial market stability. In the Citigroup case, the public  announcement preceded Treasury\u2019s determination by about 2 months.", "Specifically, on November 23, 2008, Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal  Reserve jointly announced an agreement-in-principle to assist Citigroup.

In May 2009, Bank of America  requested a termination of the term sheet for the announced guarantee of  up to $118 billion in assets by the U.S. government and in September 2009,  the parties to the agreement-in-principle executed a termination  agreement in which Bank of America agreed to pay $425 million to  Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC. Similarly, on March 23, 2009,  FDIC and Treasury announced the creation of the PPIP\u2019s LLP, but  Treasury has not yet made a determination.

An announcement alone  could have given rise to some of the benefits of a systemic risk  determination, while similarly generating the potential for negative  incentives such as moral hazard. For example, although FDIC did not  provide assistance to Bank of America, the announcement of the planned  Bank of America guarantees signaled regulators\u2019 willingness to provide  such assistance and may have achieved to some degree the intended effect  of increasing market confidence in Bank of America. The agreement  requiring Bank of America to pay a $425 million termination fee  recognized that although the parties never entered into a definitive  documentation of the transaction, Bank of America received value from  the announced term sheet, including benefits in terms of market  confidence in the institution.", "Although the effects of announcements and determinations can be similar,  determinations must be conducted under procedural and documentation  requirements that do not apply to announcements. Under the  determination process, Treasury must consider recommendations from  FDIC and the Federal Reserve, consult with the President before making a  determination, and document its reasons for making a determination and  retain the documentation for later review. Treasury must also notify  Congress in writing of each systemic risk determination. None of these  requirements applies when a determination is not made.", "We acknowledge that Treasury is not required to make a determination  within a set period and recognize the need for some flexibility during crisis  situations. However, absent a determination, the agency is not required to  follow the formal process put in place by Congress to ensure transparency  and accountability in the application of the systemic risk exception.  Therefore, when a determination is not made along with the announced  actions, Congress cannot be assured that Treasury\u2019s reasoning would be  open to the same scrutiny required in connection with a formal systemic  risk determination because Treasury does not have to act upon the FDI  Act\u2019s documentation and accountability measures. For instance, Congress  cannot be assured that the documentation required to support a  determination will be or has been generated, even when the  announcement by the agencies can have some of the same effects a  systemic risk determination would have. Furthermore, uncertainty in de  facto determination situations can arise because Treasury is not required  to communicate that it will not make a systemic risk determination for an  announced action. For example, since the announcement proposing the  creation of the PPIP\u2019s LLP in March 2009, it has not been clear whether  Treasury intends to make a systemic risk determination, raising questions  about whether Treasury will make a determination to authorize the  program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Systemic Risk Determinations Authorized FDIC Guarantees That Regulators Determined Were Needed to Avert Adverse Effects on Financial and Economic Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of the Treasury\u2019s three systemic risk determinations  authorized FDIC guarantees that FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and Treasury  determined were needed to avoid or mitigate further serious adverse  effects on already deteriorating financial and economic conditions.

At the time, the failures and near-failures of several large  institutions had increased stress in key funding markets. As noted earlier,  by late summer 2008, the potential ramifications of the financial crisis  included the continued failure of financial institutions and further  tightening of credit that would exacerbate the emerging global economic  slowdown that was beginning to take shape. In this environment, many  financial institutions, including Wachovia, were facing difficulties in  raising capital and meeting their funding obligations. In its  recommendation, FDIC said that the rapidly deteriorating financial  condition of Wachovia Bank, N.A.\u2014Wachovia\u2019s largest bank subsidiary\u2014 was due largely to its portfolio of payment-option adjustable-rate mortgage  (ARM) products, commercial real-estate portfolio, and weakened liquidity  position. Over the first half of 2008, Wachovia had suffered more than $9  billion in losses due in part to mortgage-related asset losses and investors  increasingly had become concerned about the firm\u2019s prospects, given the  worsening outlook for home prices and mortgage credit quality. In  addition, during the week preceding Treasury\u2019s determination, Wachovia\u2019s  stock price declined precipitously and the spreads on credit default swaps  that provide protection against losses on Wachovia\u2019s debt widened,  indicating that investors considered a Wachovia default increasingly  likely. FDIC consulted with Treasury and the Federal Reserve in  conducting an analysis of Wachovia\u2019s liquidity and determined that  Wachovia would soon be unable to meet its funding obligations as a result  of strains on its liquidity, particularly from projected outflows of deposits  and retail brokerage accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Determined a Least-Cost Resolution of Wachovia Would Likely Exacerbate Market Strains", "paragraphs": ["In considering actions to avert a Wachovia failure, Treasury determined  that a least-cost resolution of Wachovia\u2019s bank and thrift subsidiaries,  without protecting creditors and uninsured depositors, could\u2014in light of  conditions in the financial markets and the economy at the time\u2014weaken  confidence and exacerbate liquidity strains in the banking system. FDIC  could have effected a least-cost resolution of Wachovia Bank, N.A. through  a depositor payoff or purchase and assumption transaction following  appointment of FDIC as the receiver of the bank\u2019s assets. FDIC and the  Federal Reserve projected that either of these least-cost resolution options  would have resulted in no cost to the deposit insurance fund, but that  either option likely would have imposed significant losses on subordinated  debtholders and possibly senior note holders. In addition, Treasury, the  Federal Reserve, and FDIC expected these resolution options to impose  losses on foreign depositors, a significant funding source for several large  U.S. institutions. Their concerns over the possible significant losses to  creditors holding Wachovia subordinated debt and senior debt were  reinforced by the recent failure of Washington Mutual, a large thrift  holding company. According to Treasury\u2019s determination, under the least- cost resolution of Washington Mutual, senior and subordinated  debtholders of the holding company and its insured depository  subsidiaries suffered large losses. Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve  expressed concern that imposing similarly large losses on Wachovia\u2019s  creditors and foreign depositors could intensify liquidity pressures on  other U.S. banks, which were vulnerable to a loss of confidence by  creditors and uninsured depositors (including foreign depositors), given  the stresses already present in the financial markets at that time.  According to FDIC and Federal Reserve documents, Wachovia\u2019s sudden  failure would have led to investor concern about direct exposures of other  financial institutions to Wachovia. Furthermore, a Wachovia failure also  could have led investors and other market participants to doubt the  financial strength of other institutions that might be seen as similarly  situated. In particular, the agencies noted that a Wachovia failure could  intensify pressures on other large banking organizations that, like  Wachovia, reported they were well capitalized but continued to face  investor concerns about deteriorating asset quality. At the time of the  Wachovia determination, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act had  not yet been passed and, thus, the authorities under that law to create the  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) were not available to help mitigate  these effects. Furthermore, a least-cost resolution of Wachovia, N.A.  could have negatively affected the broader economy, because with banks  experiencing reduced liquidity and increased funding costs, they would be  less willing to lend to businesses and households.", "In recommending a systemic risk determination, the Federal Reserve and  FDIC described the extent of Wachovia\u2019s interdependencies and the  potential for disruptions to markets in which it played a significant role.  The Federal Reserve listed the top financial entities exposed to Wachovia,  noting that mutual funds were prominent among these counterparties. In  addition, FDIC expressed concern that a Wachovia failure could result in  losses for mutual funds holding its commercial paper, accelerating runs on  those and other mutual funds.

In particular, they determined that authorizing FDIC  guarantees to protect against losses to Wachovia\u2019s uninsured creditors  would avoid or mitigate the potential for serious adverse effects on the  financial system and the economy by facilitating the acquisition of  Wachovia\u2019s banking operations by Citigroup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDIC Loss-Sharing Agreement Intended to Avert Likely Additional Market Strains from a Least-Cost Resolution", "paragraphs": ["On September 29, 2008, pursuant to Treasury\u2019s systemic risk  determination, FDIC announced that it had agreed to provide protection  against large losses on a fixed pool of Wachovia assets to facilitate the  orderly sale of Wachovia\u2019s banking operations to Citigroup and avert an  imminent failure that might exacerbate the serious strains then affecting  the financial markets, financial institutions, and the economy. On  September 28, 2008, Citigroup and Wells Fargo both submitted bids to  FDIC to acquire Wachovia\u2019s banking operations with FDIC open bank  assistance in the form of loss sharing on Wachovia assets. The Citigroup  and Wells Fargo bids differed in terms of the amount of losses each  proposed to absorb and the result of the bidding process held by FDIC was  the acceptance of Citigroup\u2019s bid. After agreeing with FDIC to a loss- sharing agreement on selected Wachovia assets, Citigroup announced that  it would acquire Wachovia\u2019s banking operations for $2.2 billion and  assume the related liabilities, including senior and subordinated debt  obligations and all of Wachovia\u2019s uninsured deposits. Under the  agreement, Citigroup agreed to absorb the first $42 billion of losses on a  $312 billion pool of loans and FDIC agreed to assume losses beyond that.  To compensate FDIC for its assumption of this risk, Citigroup agreed to  grant FDIC $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants.

While  acknowledging that isolating the impact of FDIC\u2019s assistance from other  factors is difficult, Treasury and FDIC officials with whom we spoke said  that one measure of the success of the loss-sharing agreement was that  Wachovia was able to remain open and meet its funding obligations on  Monday, September 29, 2008. In particular, the determination and the  announcement of Citigroup\u2019s assumption of debt and deposit liabilities of  Wachovia and its insured bank and thrift subsidiaries may have helped to  allay the concerns of creditors and depositors that might otherwise have  withdrawn liquidity support.

In  addition to disruptions in interbank lending, financial institutions also  faced difficulties raising funds through commercial paper and asset- backed securitization markets. The resulting credit crunch made the  financing on which businesses and individuals depend increasingly  difficult to obtain. In addition, FDIC was concerned that large outflows of  uninsured deposits could strain many banks\u2019 liquidity. According to FDIC  officials with whom we spoke, they were not tracking outflows of these  deposits, but relied on anecdotal reports from institutions and the  regulators serving as their primary supervisors.", "In light of the liquidity strains many institutions faced, Treasury, FDIC, and  the Federal Reserve determined that resolving institutions on a bank-by- bank basis in compliance with least-cost requirements would result in  adverse impacts on financial stability and the broader economy. In its  recommendation letter, FDIC concluded that the threat to the market for  bank debt was a systemic problem that threatened the stability of a  significant number of institutions, thereby increasing the potential for  failures of these institutions and losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The  Federal Reserve reasoned, among other things, that the failures and least- cost resolutions of a number of institutions could impose unexpected  losses on investors and further undermine confidence in the banking  system, which already was under extreme stress. Treasury concurred with  FDIC and the Federal Reserve in determining that relying on the least-cost  resolution process would not sufficiently address the systemic threat to  bank funding and the broader economy.", "Treasury concluded that FDIC actions under a systemic risk exception  would avoid or mitigate adverse effects that would have resulted if  assistance were provided subject to the least cost rules.

The  agencies believe the statute could have been drafted more clearly and that  it can be interpreted in different ways.

Initially, all eligible institutions, which included insured  depository institutions, their holding companies, and qualified affiliates,  were enrolled in TLGP for 30 days at no cost and only those that  participated in DGP or TAGP (or both) after the opt-out date became  subject to fee assessments. Table 1 provides additional details related to  TLGP features and requirements. As of March 31, 2009, among depository  institutions with assets over $10 billion, 92 percent and 94 percent had  opted into DGP and TAGP, respectively.

However, while seeking to encourage broad participation, TLGP was not  intended to prop up nonviable institutions, according to FDIC officials.  The TLGP rule allowed FDIC to prospectively cancel eligibility for DGP if  an institution had weak supervisory ratings. According to FDIC officials,  some financial institutions were privately notified by their regulatory  supervisors that they were not eligible to issue TLGP-guaranteed debt.

At the end of the program, FDIC will be permitted to account  for any excess TLGP fees as income to the deposit insurance fund. If a  supportable and documented analysis demonstrates that TLGP assets  exceed projected losses, FDIC may recognize income to the deposit  insurance fund prior to the end of the program.

By comparing  yields on TLGP-guaranteed debt to yields on similar debt issued without  FDIC guarantees, some market observers have estimated that FDIC  guarantees lowered the cost of certain debt issues by more than 140 basis  points. To the extent that TLGP helped banking organizations to raise  funds during a very difficult period and to do so at substantially lower cost  than would otherwise be available, it may have helped improve confidence  in institutions and their ability to lend.

In  comparison to Wachovia, Citigroup had a much larger international  presence, including more than $500 billion of foreign deposits\u2014compared  to approximately $30 billion for Wachovia. Given Citigroup\u2019s substantial  international presence, imposing losses on uninsured foreign depositors  under a least-cost framework could have intensified global liquidity  pressures and increased funding pressures on other institutions with  significant amounts of foreign deposits.

In general,  some economists said that to help mitigate moral hazard, it is important to  specify when the extra deposit insurance and debt guarantee programs  will end.

Bank holding  companies must, under Federal Reserve regulations, serve as the source of  strength for their insured institution subsidiaries. Subject to the limits of  sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, however, bank holding  companies and their nonbank affiliates may rely on the depository  institution for funding.

They also  generally agree that systemically important firms should face additional  capital charges based both on their size and complexity. Such capital  charges (and perhaps also restrictions on leverage and the imposition of  risk-based insurance premiums on systemically important or weak insured  depository institutions and risky activities) could help ensure that  institutions bear the costs of growth and complexity that raise systemic  concerns. Regulators and market observers believe that imposing systemic  risk regulation and its associated safeguards will strengthen the ability of  these firms to operate in stressed environments while the associated costs  can provide incentives to firms to voluntarily take actions to reduce the  risks they pose to the financial system. Under legislative proposals, these  institutions also would be subject to a prompt corrective action regime  that would require the firm or its supervisors to take corrective actions as  the institutions\u2019 regulatory capital level or other measures of financial  strength declined, similar to the existing prompt corrective action regime  for insured depository institutions under the FDI Act.", "Regulators also are considering regulatory reforms to improve the overall  risk management practices of systemically important institutions. The  Federal Reserve has proposed standards for compensation practices  across all banking organizations it supervises to encourage prudent risk  taking by creating incentives focusing on long-term rather than short-term  performance. Regulators noted that compensation practices that create  incentives for short-term gains may overwhelm the checks and balances  meant to mitigate excessive risk taking. In its proposal for financial  regulatory reform, Treasury recommended that systemically important  financial institutions be expected to put in place risk management  practices commensurate with the risk, complexity, and scope of their  operations and be able to identify firmwide risk concentrations (such as  credit, business lines, liquidity) and establish appropriate limits and  controls around these concentrations. Also, under Treasury\u2019s proposal, to  measure and monitor risk concentrations, these institutions would be  expected to be able to identify and report aggregate exposures quickly on  a firmwide basis.", "Regulators also have indicated the need for measures to improve their  oversight of risk management practices by these institutions. In our prior  work on regulatory oversight of risk management at selected large  institutions, we found that oversight of institutions\u2019 risk management  systems before the crisis illustrated some limitations of the current  regulatory system. For example, regulators were not looking across  groups of institutions to effectively identify risks to overall financial  stability. In addition, primary, functional, and holding company regulators  faced challenges aggregating certain risk exposures within large, complex  financial institutions. According to testimony by a Federal Reserve official,  the recent crisis highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and  integrated assessment of activities throughout bank holding companies\u2014a  departure from the customary premise of functional regulation that risks  within a diversified organization can be managed properly through  supervision focused on individual subsidiaries within the firm.  Accordingly, the bank supervisors, led by the Federal Reserve, recently  completed the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, which reflects  some of the anticipated changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to  supervising the largest banking organizations. The Supervisory Capital  Assessment Program involved aggregate analyses of the 19 largest bank  holding companies, which according to Federal Reserve testimony,  accounted for a majority of the assets and loans within the financial  system. Bank supervisors evaluated on a consistent basis the expected  performance of these firms under baseline and more-adverse-than- expected scenarios, drawing on individual firm information and using  independently estimated outcomes. In addition, according to the agency\u2019s  officials, the Federal Reserve is creating an enhanced quantitative  surveillance program for the largest and most complex firms, that will use  supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, and market-based  indicators to identify emerging systemic risks as well as risks to specific  firms.", "Some economists argue that a formal designation of systemically  important institutions would have significant, negative competitive  consequences for other firms and could encourage designated firms to  take excessive risk because they would be perceived to be too big to fail.  Instead some argue that a market stability regulator should be authorized  to oversee all types of financial markets and all financial services firms,  whether otherwise regulated or unregulated. Market observers also point  out factors that complicate such determinations and make maintaining an  accurate list of such institutions difficult. Aside from asset size and degree  of leverage, they include degree of interconnectivity to other financial  institutions, risks of activities in which they engage, nature of  compensation practices, and degree of concentration of financial assets  and activities. Moreover, maintaining a list would require regular  monitoring in order to ensure the list was kept up to date, and some risky  institutions would likely go unidentified, at least for a time. Such  designation also would likely depend on factors outside the firm, such as  economic and financial conditions. However, supervisors would  presumably be doing much of the monitoring activity regardless of the  existence of a public list, and they would have to establish standards,  including assumptions regarding the economic and financial  circumstances assumed when making such designations. It is important  for Congress and regulators to subject systemically important institutions  to stricter regulatory requirements and oversight in order to restrict  excessive risk-taking activities as a result of weakened market discipline  particularly after the use of federal assistance during the crisis to stabilize  such institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resolution Authority for Systemically Important Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The recent crisis also highlighted how a lack of a resolution authority for  failing bank holding companies including those subject to the systemic  risk determinations as well as nonbank financial firms such as Bear  Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group, Inc. (AIG),  complicated federal government responses. For example, regulators  invoked the systemic risk exception to assist bank holding companies and  savings and loan holding companies to prevent systemic disruptions in the  financial markets and provided emergency funding to AIG, and in doing so  potentially contributed to a weakening of incentives at these institutions  and similarly situated large financial institutions to properly manage  risks. According to regulators, the lack of a resolution authority for  systemically important institutions also contributes to a belief by market  participants that the government will not allow these institutions to fail  and thereby weakens market discipline. Proposals for consideration by  Congress include providing federal resolution authority for large financial  holding companies deemed systemically important. One purpose of this  authority would be to encourage greater market discipline and limit moral  hazard by forcing market participants to realize the full costs of their  decisions. In order to achieve its intended purpose, the use of a new  resolution authority must be perceived by the market to be credible. The  authority would need to provide for a regime to resolve systemically  important institutions in an orderly manner when the stability of the  financial system is threatened. As noted in our prior work, a regulatory  system should have adequate safeguards that allow financial institution  failures to occur while limiting taxpayers\u2019 exposure to financial risk while  minimizing moral hazard.", "Regulators and market observers generally agree that a credible resolution  authority to resolve a distressed systemically important institution in an  orderly manner would help to ensure that no bank or financial firm would  be too big to fail. Such authority would encourage market discipline if it  were to provide for the orderly allocation of losses to risk takers such as  shareholders and unsecured creditors, and allow for the replacement of  senior management. It also should help to maintain the liquidity and key  activities of the organization so that the entity could be resolved in an  orderly fashion without disrupting the functioning of the financial system.  Unlike the statutory powers that exist for resolving insured depository  institutions, the current bankruptcy framework available to resolve large  complex nonbank financial entities and financial holding companies was  not designed to protect the stability of the financial system. Without a  mechanism to allow for an orderly resolution for a failure of a systemically  important institution, failures of such firms could lead to a wider panic as  indicated by the problems experienced after the failure of such large  financial companies as Lehman Brothers, and near failures of Bear Stearns  and AIG.", "Proposed new authority for resolution of a systemically important failing  institution would provide for a receiver to resolve the institution in an  orderly way. Government assistance such as loans, guarantees, or asset  purchases would be available only if the institution is in government  receivership. The receiver would have authority to operate the institution,  enforce or repudiate its contracts, and pay its claims as well as remove  senior management. In addition, shareholders and creditors to the firm  would absorb first losses in the resolution. However, imposing losses on  unsecured debt investors of large, interconnected, and systemically  important firms might be inconsistent with maintaining financial stability  during a crisis. In particular, faced with the potential failures of Wachovia  and Citigroup, Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve concluded that the  exercise of authority under the systemic risk exception was necessary  because the failure of these firms would have imposed large losses on  creditors and threatened to undermine confidence in the banking system.  An effective resolution authority must properly balance the need to  encourage market discipline with the need to maintain financial stability,  in particular in a crisis scenario. One market observer argued that no such  losses would be taken immediately by creditors because the objective of  the resolution authority is to prevent a disorderly failure in which such  creditors suffer immediate losses. Therefore an appropriate degree of  flexibility would mean that some of an institution\u2019s creditors might be  protected, at least to some extent, against losses where doing so would be  necessary to protect the stability of the financial system. Other features of  the resolution authority would continue to promote market discipline even  if some credit obligations were honored, because shareholders and senior  management would still suffer losses. A regulatory official stated that the  intertwining of functions among an institution\u2019s affiliates can present  significant issues when winding down the institution and recommended  requirements that mandate greater functional autonomy of holding  company affiliates. In addition, some economists and market observers  also have recommended that regulators break up large institutions in  resolution to limit a continuation of too-big-to-fail problems. That is, when  a regulator assumes control of a troubled important financial institution, it  should make reasonable efforts to break up the institution before  returning it to private hands or to avoid selling it to another institution  when the result would create a new systemically important institution. It is  important for Congress and regulators to establish a credible resolution  process to allow for an orderly resolution of a failed systemically  important institution thereby helping to ensure that no bank or financial  firm would be too big to fail."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The recent financial crisis underscored how quickly liquidity can  deteriorate at a financial institution. As a result, regulators\u2019 deliberations  about whether to invoke the systemic risk exception often occurred under  severe time constraints. Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve  collaborated prior to making announcements intended to reassure the  markets, but the lack of a determination after two of these announcements  of planned FDIC assistance under the systemic risk exception heightened  the risk that such actions will be undertaken without appropriate  transparency and accountability. Specifically, such an announcement  signals regulators\u2019 willingness to provide assistance and may give rise to  moral hazard. However, in cases where Treasury does not make a  determination, FDI Act requirements for communication and  documentation do not apply. Therefore, when a determination is not made  along with the announced actions, Congress cannot be assured that  Treasury\u2019s reasoning would be open to the same scrutiny required in  connection with a formal systemic risk determination. Furthermore,  uncertainty in these situations can arise because there is no requirement  for Treasury to communicate that it will not make a systemic risk  determination for an announced action.", "Our review of Treasury\u2019s systemic risk determinations highlights that the  announced FDIC actions were made to reduce strains on the deteriorating  markets and to promote confidence and stability in the banking system.  Regarding the systemic risk determinations, the regulators concluded that  resolving the depository institutions at issue under the traditional least- cost approach would have worsened adverse conditions in the economy  and in the financial system. While it is difficult to isolate the impact of  those actions from other government assistance, the actions seem to have  reassured investors and depositors at the particular banks and encouraged  them to continue to provide liquidity, thereby allowing the banks to keep  operating. In the case of TLGP, some regulators and market observers  have attributed short-term benefits to FDIC guarantees on certain debt  obligations, citing improved cost and availability of credit for many  institutions.", "However, with respect to TLGP determination, some have noted that  under a possible reading of the systemic risk exception, the statute may  authorize assistance only to particular institutions based on those  institutions\u2019 specific problems, not systemic risk assistance based on  problems affecting the banking industry as a whole. Treasury, FDIC, and  the Federal Reserve considered this and other legal issues in  recommending and making TLGP determination. The agencies believe the  statute could have been drafted more clearly and that it can be interpreted  in different ways. They concluded, however, that under a permissible  interpretation, assistance may be based on industry-wide concerns. They  also concluded that a systemic risk determination waives all of the normal  statutory restrictions on FDIC assistance and then creates new authority  to provide assistance, both as to the types of aid that may be provided and  the entities that may receive it. Under this reading, the agencies believe the  statutory criteria were met in the case of TLGP and that the assistance was  authorized. We examined these issues as part of our review of the basis of  the systemic risk determinations made to date. We found there is some  support for the agencies\u2019 position that the exception authorized systemic  risk assistance of some type under TLGP facts, as well as for their position  that the exception permits assistance to the entities covered by this  program. There are a number of questions concerning these  interpretations, however. For example, the agencies agree that some of the  statutory provisions are ambiguous. Because application of the systemic  risk exception raises novel legal and policy issues of significant public  interest and importance, and because of the need for clear direction to the  agencies in a time of financial crisis, the requirements and assistance  authorized under the systemic risk exception may require clarification by  Congress.", "Systemic risk assistance also raises long-term concerns about moral  hazard and weakened market discipline, particularly for large complex  financial institutions. This involves a trade-off between the short-term  benefits to markets, the economy, and business and households of federal  action and the long-term effects of any federal action on market discipline.  While the financial regulatory framework can serve an important role in  restricting excessive risk-taking activities as a result of weakened market  discipline, the financial crisis revealed limitations in this framework. In  particular, these limitations include inconsistent oversight of large  financial holding companies (bank versus nonbank). Another limitation  was a weakness in the risk management practices of these companies.  Legislators and regulators currently are considering regulatory proposals  to subject systemically important institutions, including those whose  market discipline is likely to have been weakened by the recent exercises  of the systemic risk exception, to stricter regulatory standards such as  higher capital and stronger liquidity and risk management requirements.  Furthermore, according to regulators, the lack of resolution authority for  systemically important institutions contributes to a belief by market  participants that the government will not allow these institutions to fail  and thereby weakens incentives for market participants to monitor the  risks posed by these institutions. Legislation has been proposed to expand  resolution authority to large financial holding companies deemed  systemically important that is intended to impose greater market  discipline and limit moral hazard by forcing market participants to face  significant costs from their risk-taking decisions.

The FDI Act normally permits Deposit Insurance Fund- supported assistance only to insured depository institutions, however, and  allows assistance to operating (\u201copen\u201d) insured depository institutions (so- called \u201copen bank assistance\u201d) only in three situations, and then only by  certain means. As specified in section 13(c) of the FDI Act:  \u201c(c)  Assistance to insured depository institutions  \u201c(1)   is authorized . . . to make loans to, to make  deposits in, to purchase the assets or securities of, to assume  the liabilities of, or to make contributions to, any insured  depository institution\u2014  \u201c(A)  if such action is taken to prevent the default of such  \u201c(B)  if, with respect to an insured bank in default, such  action is taken to restore such insured bank to normal  operation; or  \u201c(C) if, when severe financial conditions exist which  threaten the stability of a significant number of insured  depository institutions or of insured depository  institutions possessing significant financial resources,  such action is taken in order to lessen the risk to the   posed by such insured depository institution  under such threat of instability.\u201d", "12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(c)(1)(A)-(C).", "The FDI Act contains a number of additional restrictions on when and  how the FDIC may use Deposit Insurance Fund monies:  First, before FDIC may provide assistance to an open bank, FDI Act  section 13(c)(8) normally requires it to make a formal determination that  the bank is in \u201ctroubled condition\u201d under specific undercapitalization and  other criteria and that the bank meets other requirements. FDIC must  publish notice of any such determination in the Federal Register.", "Second, if FDIC decides to provide assistance, the assistance normally  must meet so-called \u201cleast-cost requirements\u201d in FDI Act section 13(c)(4).  Section 13(c)(4)(A) requires FDIC to determine, using financial data about  a specific institution, that the proposed assistance is necessary to meet  FDIC\u2019s deposit-insurance obligations with respect to the institution\u2019s  insured deposits and is the least costly of all possible methods of meeting  those obligations. Section 13(c)(4)(E) prohibits FDIC from providing  assistance to creditors or non-insured depositors of the institution if doing  so would increase losses to the Fund beyond those that otherwise might  result from protecting insured depositors.", "Third, FDI Act section 11(a)(4)(C) normally prohibits FDIC from using the  Fund to benefit affiliates or shareholders of an assisted depository  institution in any way, regardless of whether such assistance would cause  a loss to the Fund.", "The agencies believe, however, that if Treasury makes an emergency  determination under the systemic risk exception, this waives all of the  foregoing requirements and also creates new authority to provide any type  of assistance to any type of entity, as long as the assistance is deemed  necessary to avoid or mitigate systemic risk. Specifically, the words of the  statute require Treasury to determine: (i) that \u201ccompliance with  subparagraphs (A) and (E)  with respect to an  insured depository institution would have serious adverse effects on  economic conditions or financial stability\u201d; and (ii) that \u201cany action or  assistance under . . .  would avoid or mitigate\u201d such effects.  If Treasury makes this determination, the FDIC may then \u201ctake other  action or provide assistance under this section as necessary to avoid or  mitigate such effects.\u201d The statute imposes significant deliberative and  consultative requirements on the process for making such a determination:  it must be made by the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary must  receive written recommendations from both the FDIC Board of Directors  and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, each made pursuant to at  least a two-thirds vote; and the Secretary must consult with the President.", "The Agencies\u2019 Reliance on the Systemic Risk Exception to Create  TLGP  The agencies agree that without Treasury\u2019s systemic risk determination for  TLGP in October 2008, the above statutory restrictions would have  prohibited FDIC assistance to most of TLGP recipients, either because the  entities would not have met the statutory \u201ctroubled condition criteria\u201d for  open banks (in the case of many TLGP participants) or because they were  bank holding companies or other affiliates of insured depository  institutions for which FDIC assistance normally is unavailable. The  agencies clearly followed the requisite process in issuing the  determination: FDIC and the Federal Reserve both submitted unanimous  written recommendations in favor of Treasury making a systemic risk  determination; the Secretary consulted with the President; and the  Secretary signed a formal determination on October 14, 2008.  Acknowledging that the systemic risk exception can be interpreted in  different ways, the agencies believe they also met the statute\u2019s substantive  requirements under a permissible interpretation of the statute. We discuss  below two key legal issues that the agencies considered in making their  recommendations and determination.  1.  Authority to Provide Assistance Based on Problems of the  Banking Industry As a Whole  In invoking the exception for the other two systemic risk determinations  made to date\u2014with respect to Wachovia in September 2008 and Citigroup  in January 2009\u2014the agencies concluded, based on the facts of those  specific institutions, that providing least-cost assistance to those entities\u2019  insured institutions would have had \u201cserious adverse effects on economic  conditions or financial stability\u201d\u2014that is, would have caused systemic  risk. The agencies applied the exception differently for TLGP  determination: they made what they characterized as a \u201cgeneric systemic  risk determination\u201d made \u201cgenerically for all  institutions,\u201d that  is, a determination made with respect to \u201cthe U.S. banking system in  general\u201d and \u201cinsured depository institutions in general.\u201d  According to  the agencies, they took this approach because the problem at hand was  not limited to weakness in one or more individual institutions, but was a  banking system problem, an overall scarcity of liquidity caused by lack of  interaction among institutions. The agencies therefore concluded that  providing assistance on a bank-by-bank basis would not have relieved the  existing instability in the industry and that waiting to provide bank-by- bank relief after individual banks had begun to fail would not have  mitigated further systemic risk. The agencies also believed that a bank- specific, wait-for-failure approach would have been more costly than  TLGP assistance provided.", "The agencies believe these facts supported the required statutory finding  that \u201ccompliance with  with respect to an  insured depository institution\u201d would cause systemic risk, in that they  showed that having to apply the least-cost requirements on a bank-by-bank  basis (\u201ccompliance with the . . . requirements with respect to an . . .  institution\u201d) would have caused systemic risk. The agencies also believe  the statute permits a generic rather than a bank-specific determination  because under general statutory construction and grammar rules reflected  in the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, the required finding regarding  compliance \u201cwith respect to an institution\u201d can be read as \u201ccompliance  with respect to one or more institutions\u201d unless statutory context indicates  otherwise.", "Some have noted that a possible reading of the exception authorizes  assistance only to particular institutions, based on those institutions\u2019  specific problems, not, as was done in creating TLGP, systemic risk  assistance to all institutions based on problems affecting the banking  industry in general. In our view, the language, context, and history of the  exception do not clearly restrict its use to assistance to specific  institutions. The statute does not prescribe a detailed method by which  Treasury must determine whether \u201ccompliance . . . would cause systemic  risk,\u201d and we agree with the agencies that \u201ccompliance . . . with respect to  an institution\u201d means the determination can be based on the  circumstances of more than one bank\u2014that is, \u201can institution\u201d can mean  \u201cone or more institutions.\u201d", "As to whether the statute permits a determination to be made generically  based on industry-wide problems at insured depository institutions apart  from the health of any particular institution, nothing in the legislative  history of the exception explicitly refutes the agencies\u2019 position that the  statute permits such a generic determination. The debate leading to  enactment of FDICIA centered on FDIC\u2019s role in resolving \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d  institutions whose collapse might pose a risk to the entire financial  system, rather than on banking system-wide problems already posing  serious risk. However, nothing indicates Congress intended to preclude  use of the exception when, as with the facts leading to TLGP, an adverse  systemic condition is itself the cause of imminent bank failures and the  agencies determine that individual least-cost resolutions would not  adequately address the condition and in fact would worsen it. While  Congress\u2019 intent to further restrict the FDIC\u2019s authority to provide open  bank assistance is clear from the significant new limitations it imposed in  FDICIA, Congress\u2019 simultaneous enactment of the systemic risk exception  indicated a parallel objective to avoid wholesale systemic failure. In light  of these objectives and the language of the statute, we believe there is  some support for the agencies\u2019 position that the law does not require an  institution-specific evaluation where it would result in systemic risk.  Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States, 345 U.S. 59 (1953) (laws  written in comprehensive terms apply to unanticipated circumstances if  they reasonably fall within the scope of the statutory language); see  generally GAO-08-606R (March 31, 2008) at 13-18.", "In sum, given Treasury\u2019s factual determination that systemic risk would  have resulted from application of the least-cost requirements to the  circumstances leading to creation of TLGP, we believe there is some  support for the agencies\u2019 legal position that systemic risk assistance of  some type was authorized. Whether the particular TLGP assistance  provided was within the scope authorized by the systemic risk exception  was a second issue the agencies considered, and which we now address.  2.  Authority to Provide Assistance to Non-\u201dTroubled\u201d Banks,  Bank Holding Companies, and Other Bank Affiliates  In addition to considering whether the banking industry-wide liquidity  crisis could be mitigated by providing systemic risk relief, the agencies  considered whether the statute authorized relief for all of the entities they  believed should receive assistance. The agencies addressed whether the  language of the statute\u2014authorizing FDIC, in the event of a systemic risk  determination, to \u201ctake other action or provide assistance under this  section  as necessary to avoid or mitigate\u201d systemic  risk\u2014waived the statute\u2019s other restrictions, and they concluded that it  both waived the restrictions and then gave FDIC new authority to provide  assistance even beyond that otherwise authorized by the FDI Act, as long  as the assistance was \u201cnecessary to avoid or mitigate\u201d systemic risk. Under  this interpretation, the agencies believe FDIC had authority to provide  TLGP assistance directly to bank holding companies and other bank  affiliates, as well as to insured depository institutions that FDIC had not  determined met the statutory troubled-condition criteria (and would not  have met them in most cases because most of the institutions were  \u201chealthy\u201d under the statutory standards).", "The agencies base their interpretation in part on Congress\u2019 use of the  disjunctive term \u201cor\u201d in authorizing \u201cother action or . . . assistance under  this section,\u201d noting that \u201cor\u201d generally indicates an intention to  differentiate between two phrases. They also rely on a statutory  construction principle known as the \u201cgrammatical rule of the last  antecedent,\u201d where a limiting phrase\u2014here, \u201cunder this section\u201d\u2014 generally should be read as modifying only the words immediately  preceding it\u2014here, \u201cassistance,\u201d not \u201cother action.\u201d In the agencies\u2019 view,  a systemic risk determination creates two distinct options for assistance:  (1) \u201cother action,\u201d that is, \u201caction\u201d \u201cother\u201d than assistance allowed by FDI  Act section 13; and (2) assistance allowed by section 13. \u201cOther action\u201d is  not subject to the restrictions on section 13 assistance, in the agencies\u2019  view, because by definition it is not section 13 assistance, while  \u201cassistance under this section\u201d remains subject to those restrictions unless  explicitly waived by the systemic risk exception, as in the case of the least- cost requirements. Under this interpretation, TLGP\u2019s aid to all open  healthy (non-\u201dtroubled\u201d) banks, considered as a whole, was authorized  because it constituted \u201cother action\u201d not subject to the section 13(c)(8)  ban on relief to healthy open banks, rather than \u201cassistance under this  section\u201d which would have prohibited relief to the same institutions if  considered individually. Likewise, according to the agencies, TLGP\u2019s direct  assistance to bank holding companies and other bank affiliates constituted  \u201cother action\u201d rather than \u201cassistance under this section.\u201d", "The agencies\u2019 reading of the statute raises several issues. First, while rules  of grammar and statutory construction can provide general guidance  about what Congress intended, the actual context and structure of the  statute are of equal if not paramount importance. Here, Congress\u2019  interchangeable use of the terms \u201caction\u201d and \u201cassistance\u201d throughout  section 13 suggests it did not intend to differentiate between those terms  when it used them in section 13(c)(4)(G), the systemic risk exception. For  example, although Congress entitled section 13(c), the general FDI Act  provision authorizing FDIC aid to open insured institutions, as \u201cAssistance  to insured depository institutions,\u201d it then used the term \u201caction\u201d to  identify each circumstance in which such assistance is authorized. See,  e.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1823(c)(1)(A)-(C), 1823(c)(2), 1823(c)(4)(E). This  suggests Congress created only one basic option for systemic risk relief:  action or assistance, authorized by section 13 and related restrictions,  except restrictions expressly waived by the systemic risk exception. The  sequence of the terms \u201cother action\u201d and \u201cassistance\u201d in the statute  supports this reading, because if Congress intended to create two types of  relief\u2014one subject to the section 13 restrictions and the other subject to  no restrictions\u2014arguably it would have reversed the order and authorized  \u201cassistance under this section or other action\u201d rather than \u201cother action or  assistance under this section.\u201d", "Second, the fact that the systemic risk exception explicitly waives the  least-cost requirements, by two specific references to \u201csubparagraphs (A)  and (E),\u201d but waives none of the other statutory requirements, also  supports the one-option interpretation because it suggests Congress did  not intend its authorization of \u201cother action\u201d to override other statutory  restrictions. In this regard, FDIC has long recognized, since promulgation  of its revised Open Bank Assistance Policy in 1992, that the section  13(c)(8) restrictions against assistance to healthy open banks apply even  when there is a systemic risk determination and that these restrictions  must be met prior to providing systemic risk assistance. FDIC thus  applied the restrictions as part of its recommendation for the Citigroup  systemic risk determination in January 2009, and determined that the open  insured depository institutions there were \u201ctroubled,\u201d thus qualifying for  open bank\u2014and systemic risk\u2014assistance. In FDIC\u2019s view, its position  that the Citigroup systemic risk determination did not waive (c)(8) for  open depository institutions is consistent with its position that TLGP  determination did waive (c)(8) for open depository institutions, because  the former constituted \u201cassistance under this section\u201d relief while the  latter constituted \u201cother action\u201d relief. FDIC\u2019s 1992 Open Bank  Assistance Policy did not address this aspect of the systemic risk  exception, FDIC told us, because until TLGP, no one had considered t possibility of systemic risk stemming from industry-wide conditions rathehe  r  than bank-specific conditions. We recognize that FDIC\u2019s interpretation has  evolved in response to new circumstances, but we believe its current and arguably inconsistent \u201cother action\u201d interpretation is subject to questionfor the reasons noted above.", "Third, the practical effect of a systemic risk determination under the  agencies\u2019 reading is to authorize any type of assistance to any type of  entity, provided the aid is deemed necessary to avoid or mitigate systemic  risk. This is because if relief does not meet the restrictions imposed on  \u201cassistance under this section,\u201d the identical relief is by definition  authorized as \u201cother action.\u201d If Congress had intended to give FDIC such  broad new authority, however, it could have simply said so, authorizing  FDIC to \u201ctake action\u201d in the event of systemic risk. Instead, Congress  added qualifying language apparently intended to limit FDIC\u2019s options,  only authorizing it to \u201ctake other action or provide assistance under this  section.\u201d", "Finally, the overall legislative history of FDICIA also suggests Congress  did not intend the exception to provide the breadth of new authority  claimed by the agencies. FDICIA was aimed in part at curbing what  Congress believed had been excessive costs of FDIC bank assistance that  increased the exposure of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Congress therefore  imposed new restrictions intended to raise, not lower, the bar for FDIC  relief. Limits were added, for example, on which entities could receive  assistance (e.g., only open banks in \u201ctroubled condition\u201d) and how much  assistance could be provided (least-cost). Congress also imposed so-called  prompt corrective action mandates on the banking regulators, requiring  them to take increasingly severe actions as an institution\u2019s capital  deteriorates. Additionally, like its predecessor exception, the systemic  risk exception was enacted as part of a provision imposing cost-based  limits on FDIC assistance\u2014the least-cost requirements\u2014rather than as a  separate provision granting new authority. In light of FDICIA\u2019s  overarching remedial purposes, it is questionable that Congress would  have intended to simultaneously provide FDIC with new and substantially  broader authority than the agency had been given since its creation in  1933, and would have done so by means of an implication in a narrowed  exception to a cost restriction. Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 738- 39 (1989)(\u201cGiven that Congress has enacted a general rule . . ., we should  not eviscerate that legislative judgment through an expansive reading of a  somewhat ambiguous exception.\u201d); Whitman v. American Trucking  Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)(\u201cCongress, we have held, does not alter the  fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary  provisions\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d)  (citations omitted).", "In response to these issues, the agencies make two additional points.", "First, they suggest that any uncertainty regarding whether \u201cother action\u201d  authorized TLGP assistance to bank holding companies was resolved by  2009 amendments to the systemic risk exception. At the time TLGP was  created, the exception required FDIC to recover any losses to the Deposit  Insurance Fund caused by its systemic risk assistance, but authorized  recovery only from insured depository institutions. In response to  concerns by FDIC and banking industry representatives that bank holding  companies should also bear some of TLGP costs because they had  received substantial assistance under the program, Congress modified the  provision in May 2009 to permit assessments against bank holding  companies as well as depository institutions. Pub. L. No. 111-22, sec.  204(d), codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(c)(4)(G)(ii). The agencies believe this  confirms the FDIC\u2019s authority to provide assistance to bank holding  companies under TLGP because Congress did not simultaneously amend  the exception to explicitly prohibit such assistance going forward. We  agree the amendment provides some support for the agencies\u2019 position  under a general tenet of statutory construction that congressional  awareness of an agency\u2019s practice in implementing a statute, without  striking down that practice, indicates congressional acquiescence in the  agency\u2019s interpretation.", "Second, the agencies maintain that their interpretation of any ambiguous  aspects of the systemic risk exception warrants substantial deference  under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural  Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and related cases. Under  Chevron, when the meaning of a statute is unclear, either because the  statute is silent on an issue or the language is ambiguous, an interpretation  by an agency charged with the statute\u2019s administration warrants  substantial deference provided the interpretation is reasonable, even if it is  not the only interpretation or the best interpretation. Whether and to what  extent deference is warranted depends on factors including the agency\u2019s  specialized expertise in implementing the statute, whether the agency\u2019s  interpretation has been subjected to public scrutiny through public notice- and-comment rulemaking, and whether its interpretation is consistent with  its previous pronouncements. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218,  227-29 (2001) (citations omitted). Under Mead, Chevron deference is  warranted where the interpretation is made as part of an agency  rulemaking or other agency action that Congress intended to carry the  force of law, and, even if Chevron deference is not warranted, lesser  deference is warranted under Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134 (1944), if the  agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201cpersuasive\u201d based on factors such as the  thoroughness and validity of the agency\u2019s reasoning, the consistency of its  interpretation over time, and the formality of its action.", "We believe these deference principles have some force as applied to the  systemic risk exception and TLGP. Congress did not explicitly address  whether FDIC may provide systemic risk relief directly to bank holding  companies or healthy open banks, and a court arguably could find that the  statute\u2019s authorization of \u201cother action or assistance under this section\u201d is  ambiguous. If it did, we believe the agencies\u2019 reading might merit at least  some degree of deference. Congress charged these three financial  regulatory agencies with implementing the systemic risk exception, and  charged FDIC with implementing other provisions of the FDI Act related  to this exception. The agencies interpreted the exception to authorize  assistance to holding companies, other bank affiliates, and non-troubled  banks as part of the systemic risk determination, and FDIC exercised its  general rulemaking authority to issue regulations establishing TLGP,  including regulations providing for assistance to these entities. According  to the agencies, their interpretation of what \u201cother action or . . .  assistance\u201d authorizes was necessarily part of the rulemaking because  critical aspects of the program\u2014assistance to \u201chealthy\u201d banks, and to  bank holding companies and other bank affiliates\u2014were premised upon  this interpretation and would otherwise have been prohibited. Further,  FDIC\u2019s rulemaking preambles asserted that TLGP was authorized by  Treasury\u2019s systemic risk determination. The fact that the regulations and  preambles did not solicit public comment on the underlying legal  interpretations\u2014and in fact did not indicate what the interpretations  were\u2014did not disqualify them from Chevron deference, according to the  agencies, because under other Supreme Court precedent, an agency\u2019s  interpretation of a statute may warrant deference if the interpretation was  the only logical basis for a rulemaking, even if the agency does not  disclose its interpretation. Finally, we note that the very process  Congress established for issuance of systemic risk determinations reflects  great congressional respect for the agencies\u2019 judgment and expertise, if  not a strict basis for legal deference to their interpretation of the statute.", "We nonetheless believe the arguments for deference to the agencies\u2019  interpretation are undercut by the statutory interpretation concerns  discussed above, which raise questions about the persuasiveness of the  agencies\u2019 arguments, and by the different and arguably inconsistent  positions taken by FDIC regarding whether the systemic risk exception  waives the prohibition against assistance to \u201chealthy\u201d institutions.", "We believe there is some support for the agencies\u2019 position that the  systemic risk exception authorizes assistance of some type under TLGP  facts, as well as for their position that the exception permits assistance to  the entities covered by this program. There are a number of questions  concerning these interpretations, however. Because application of the  systemic risk exception raises novel legal and policy issues of significant  public interest and importance, and because of the need for clear direction  to the agencies in a time of financial crisis, we recommend that Congress  consider enacting legislation clarifying the requirements and assistance  authorized under the exception. Congress is now debating modernization  and reform of the financial regulatory system, including regulation that  addresses systemic risk, and this may provide an opportunity for such  congressional consideration.  Enacting more explicit legislation will  provide legal clarity to the agencies, the banking industry, and the  financial community at large, and will help to ensure greater transparency  and accountability to the taxpaying public.", "Federal Deposit Insurance Act Section 13(c)(4)(G),  Title 12, United States Code, Section 1823(c)(4)(G)  \u00a7 1823.
