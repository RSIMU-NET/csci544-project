Cross-servicing can range from providing computer and software timesharing services to full-service administrative processing. An analogous arrangement in the private sector is the use of shared service centers, which are locations or organizations within a large organization that provide common services to operating locations or business units. In accordance with the definition of outsourcing used in this report, these intra-organization arrangements are discussed as alternative strategies that nonfederal organizations have used to improve their financial operations.", "In addition, when considering outsourcing, an organization may focus on an entire function or portions of a function. To illustrate, an organization\u2019s finance and accounting function is comprised of processes, activities, and tasks. The payroll process includes various activities, such as calculating employees\u2019 gross compensation for the pay period, determining and deducting amounts from gross compensation to calculate net pay, and printing and distributing payroll checks. Each activity, in turn, includes one or more tasks. The activity of calculating employee compensation, for example, includes such tasks as collecting time cards, tabulating time worked or leave taken per employee, and multiplying hours worked or leave taken per employee by the appropriate pay rate.

In August 1995, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the military services to make outsourcing of support activities a priority. A May 1995 report by the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces identified financial management as a prime candidate for outsourcing in DOD. Further, an August 1996 Defense Science Board (DSB) Task Force report on outsourcing found that functions such as accounting, payroll, travel reimbursement, invoicing, debt management, and other support functions are routinely performed in the private sector by a range of outside vendors and recommended that those functions be outsourced. A November 1996 DSB report estimated that such finance and accounting outsourcing could result in substantial savings for DOD. However, subsequently, while agreeing that the potential for savings exists, we questioned the size of DSB\u2019s savings estimates.

A 1996 American Management Association (AMA) member survey found that finance and accounting outsourcing, while used less frequently than other types of outsourcing, has grown rapidly since 1994. Eighteen percent of the 619 responding firms were outsourcing all or part of one or more finance and accounting functions other than payroll. Payroll was outsourced in whole or in part by 38 percent of the responding firms.

For example, officials from one company stated that their approach to improving financial management consisted of: (1) consolidating the accounting function into as few locations as possible and having each location move to a single system to accomplish the function, (2) simplifying existing processes, (3) developing systems that capture data at the point the transaction originated, regardless of the location within the organization, and (4) outsourcing all or parts of processes that could be done more efficiently or effectively by a third party. Through these steps, the company was able to reduce the number of accounting staff by approximately two-thirds in a 15-year period. However, according to organization officials, most of the efficiencies achieved were due to actions other than outsourcing, and they estimated that outsourcing accounted for less than 10 percent of the total savings. Officials from another organization told us that they were able to reduce the number of personnel involved in processing accounting transactions by an estimated 90 percent over a 12-year period through the use of shared service centers, consolidating systems, and reengineering their accounting processes.", "Even companies that outsourced entire processes had reengineered these processes or obtained new accounting systems prior to or at the same time as outsourcing.

Another example is payroll processing, where a company might handle the human resource and payroll tasks of entering data and computing employee gross pay amounts in-house, but contract with a vendor for net pay computation and paycheck printing and distribution tasks.

Some experts in the field have estimated that in 3 to 5 years, organizations with large, complex finance and accounting operations will be able to outsource their entire accounting or finance function. To date, existing capacity concerns appear to have been a significant factor in organizations with large, complex finance and accounting operations moving relatively slowly toward outsourcing.", "Three organizations that outsourced portions of their accounting function, for example, found only one vendor that was capable of providing the breadth of service they required. According to one consulting firm, while large organizations have been able to find vendors to outsource portions of their finance and accounting functions, they have not been able to find vendors that could take over the entire function. The firm\u2019s study of payroll practices at over 50 firms confirmed that payroll outsourcing may not be a viable option for larger operations because outsourcing vendors presently cannot offer them payroll services at cost-effective rates.

Such a policy should be explicit on the extent to which outsourcing will be used to reduce costs, improve efficiency, or increase organizational flexibility. The overall view gleaned from the 15 organizations and outsourcing experts interviewed is that the outsourcing decision and implementation should involve the same type of rigorous analysis, careful planning, and management involvement as any other major business decision.", "Many experts believe that a corporate policy that describes and requires a structured outsourcing process is necessary for successful outsourcing. For example, on the basis of extensive research, one organization developed an outsourcing policy to guide and provide a structured process for deciding whether to outsource. In part, the policy requires (1) clear objectives for outsourcing, (2) a recognition of all available service delivery options (e.g., internal staff versus third party), (3) a rigorous cost/benefit analysis, (4) buy-in by all affected parties, and (5) communication with employees throughout the outsourcing decision-making process.", "Under another organization\u2019s outsourcing policy, the designated outsourcing team was to identify those functions that were candidates for outsourcing and apply specified criteria for deciding what functions to outsource. Outsourcing proposals were to include a detailed risk analysis that addressed the proposed outsourcing\u2019s potential impact on such key areas as cost, savings, service quality, system conversion, retraining of personnel, and the potential for disruption of services. Management believed that the outsourcing arrangements developed under this policy were successful in that the company met its outsourcing goals.", "In contrast, two organizations we talked to had negative outsourcing experiences, which they attributed, in part, to not having an outsourcing policy in place that clearly prescribed a methodology for analyzing costs and for considering all relevant risks associated with such an outsourcing decision. Not until one of these organizations had obtained bids from vendors and was near awarding a contract were concerns raised about the validity of cost estimates and the increased legal and computer security risks. The organization\u2019s president decided to cancel the planned outsourcing until the organization had an outsourcing policy and cost estimation methodology in place. Another organization made the decision to outsource in a rapid fashion without going through a structured process that would be specified in a corporate outsourcing policy. The resulting outsourcing arrangement was not well received by the organization\u2019s employees and resulted in confusion over the purpose and extent of the arrangement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Core Competencies Critical When Determining What to Outsource", "paragraphs": ["Decisions on outsourcing are becoming part of the organizational strategic planning process with the goal of increasing competitiveness in the world market. In considering whether to outsource, organizations have assessed functions strategically in terms of their relationship to core competencies. Core competencies, as defined by G-2 Research, Inc., a firm specializing in business process outsourcing market research, are the essential, defining functions of an organization\u2014those things that if given to an external party, would create a competitor or result in the dissolution of the company. A hospital\u2019s core competencies, for example, would be those directly associated with caring for patients. Core competencies have also been defined as those few functions within a company where the company can dominate, that are important to the customers, and that are embedded in the organization\u2019s systems. Involvement of an organization\u2019s senior management in the process was often identified as essential to ensuring that an organization\u2019s competencies are assessed strategically on an organizationwide basis rather than by function.", "Other functions are considered non-core and can be considered either critical or noncritical. Non-core critical functions are important to an organization but are not directly linked to what the organization perceives as its primary mission. If not performed at world-class levels, however, these functions can place an organization at a competitive disadvantage or even endanger its existence. For most organizations, such functions would include finance, accounting, and human resources administration. Noncritical functions are those that supply no competitive advantage and that even if performed poorly, may not seriously harm an organization. Examples generally include cafeteria services, groundskeeping, and laundry.", "Outsourcing arrangements for many organizations usually start with noncritical functions. As the organization becomes more accustomed to relying on others to perform simple, noncritical functions, the organization tends to consider outsourcing a more diverse and critical set of activities. Reasons that an organization might want to outsource one or more of its critical but non-core functions (such as finance and accounting) include the potential for (1) significant cost savings, (2) access to needed skills and expertise, (3) access to the latest technology or world-class capabilities, (4) accelerated implementation of planned improvements, and (5) freeing management resources for other purposes.", "For example, after identifying its core competencies, one organization decided that outsourcing should be used as an option to improve business performance through reducing costs in non-core areas, leveraging the expertise of best-in-class service providers, and providing a better career path for employees in non-core areas. As part of its determinations, senior management decided that any function that was not a core competency could be subject to outsourcing. Factors considered included whether or not a function (1) involves decision-making, (2) adds significant value to the company\u2019s bottom line, or (3) interfaces directly with its customers.", "Company officials informed us that they believed there was no long-term risk to the company\u2019s competitive position in outsourcing these types of processes.", "Another organization we spoke to also identified its core and non-core activities within the accounting and financial management function. In this case, management decided not to outsource any finance and accounting activity that was important to maintaining control of the business, was important to maintaining the company\u2019s competitive position, involved company confidential information, involved a critical expertise that the company could not afford to lose, or was used to develop staff for managerial advancement.", "Based on these criteria, the organization concluded that managerial analysis and decision support work were core activities, but that other activities, such as the clerical aspects of the accounts payable and payroll processes, were non-core and therefore candidates for outsourcing.

Benchmarking lets an organization know how well it is doing and puts it in a better position to assess which improvement initiative, if any, best fits its situation. A key result of an effective benchmarking process will be a full understanding of the extent and nature of any existing deficiencies in an organization\u2019s finance and accounting operations. As discussed later in this report, this understanding of deficiencies in an organization\u2019s finance and accounting function is critical to successfully establishing and monitoring an outsourcing contract.", "A recent international outsourcing study found that the most important single factor contributing to successful outsourcing was that the activity was well defined. Many of the companies we talked to have used benchmarking to help them determine if any finance or accounting processes or activities they perform were in need of improvement and the extent of improvement needed. Once processes have been benchmarked, an organization is able to determine areas that need improvement and decide on a means of improvement. While some organizations have chosen outsourcing as a first-line means of process improvement, many others have relied more heavily on reengineering processes, installing enterprisewide systems, or establishing shared service centers as their primary approach to improving financial management.", "If through benchmarking an organization finds a particular internal process to be world-class, it might decide that little could be gained by outsourcing. In situations like this, some organizations may offer their services externally and turn the function into a profit center. If all or part of an organization\u2019s finance and accounting function were determined to be world class, and if the organization determines that the function is not one of its core competencies, it may decide to outsource the function to free management resources.", "Consistent, objective, and measurable baseline data on operations compared with baseline data from a world-class organization is essential to a reliable benchmarking assessment. One outsourcing industry consultant said, for example, that an organization must develop reliable, quantitative data on costs as well as other objective measures of the area being considered for outsourcing. Failure to obtain reliable data can increase the risk that data will be manipulated to achieve a desired result. For example, the organizational component being considered for outsourcing may have an incentive to exclude relevant costs so that the costs of its operations appear to be lower than they actually are.

The segment chosen for the pilot should be one that is most amenable to outsourcing. Then, after a successful pilot, the organization could gradually expand the scope of the outsourcing arrangement. A pilot test approach to finance and accounting outsourcing would give the organization time to streamline its outsourcing process while allowing the vendor marketplace to build up the capacity to perform services for large organizations.", "Organizations must also research the quality of vendor services. An official of one organization that had outsourced an accounting process stated that its vendor had a turnover rate much higher than the organization\u2019s internal staff that previously performed the process. He said that the high vendor turnover presented a problem as his employees were constantly dealing with new vendor employees who did not know the organization\u2019s business. One large company decided to bring its outsourced payroll process back in-house and do its own payroll processing because of the poor service it received from its vendor.", "Organizations must also consider if process improvement is an institutional goal and whether or not the services offered by vendors represent an improvement over the effectiveness and efficiency of existing processes. One organization credited its outsourcing vendor with bringing \u201ccutting edge\u201d technology to some of the organization\u2019s accounting and finance processes.

In some instances, we were told, organizations determined that internal opposition to outsourcing was so widespread and vocal that planned outsourcing was halted until employee concerns were addressed. For example, we were told that addressing the concerns expressed by labor unions was considered to be of paramount importance to one organization in reaching a decision to outsource all or part of a function.

One organization, citing its corporate philosophy supporting its employees as its most valuable asset, told us that it has strived to avoid employee layoffs even when selected jobs were phased out through process improvement or outsourcing. Instead, it has relied primarily on attrition and job transfers to reduce numbers of employees and has offered, at certain times, retirement incentive packages to employees whose jobs have been phased out. The organization\u2019s top management advised employees when it was seriously considering outsourcing and sought appropriate employee input in the outsourcing decision.", "One organization\u2019s officials told us that they have delayed outsourcing specific activities because the affected employees may not have the necessary skills to transfer to other areas in the accounting department. Organization officials stated that, rather than displacing existing staff, they will continue to pursue internal operating efficiencies and will wait for the employees to leave through reassignment or normal attrition before outsourcing those positions.", "Officials from another organization that adopted this approach also stated that they believed this strategy contributed to successful outsourcing. The organization believed that because it kept employees informed, it was able to prevent rumors and speculative gossip from becoming a barrier to outsourcing its general ledger accounting processes. The organization also arranged for the outsourcing vendor to offer employment to virtually all of the displaced employees. The vast majority of the employees transferred to the vendor and, for the most part, continued to perform the same duties they had before outsourcing. The outsourcing organization expressed its belief that the employees were treated fairly and equitably and now have more career opportunities because the vendor has multiple career paths.", "In contrast, we were told that some of another organization\u2019s employees may have first learned about the potential outsourcing from its outsourcing vendor. This created a great deal of resentment and ill-feelings and was a major barrier to the outsourcing arrangement, particularly because none of the outsourced employees were to be retained by the outsourcing vendor.", "Another risk posed by outsourcing is the loss of important corporate knowledge. One organization that outsourced accounting activities required the vendor to hire key employees\u2014those who had decision-making responsibilities related to the outsourced area. However, the outsourcing vendor found, while training its new staff, that it needed the unique accounting process knowledge held by lower-level staff. The outsourcing vendor then hired the former lower-level employees to train its new employees and discovered that many of these lower-level jobs required a much longer time to learn than planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Controls and Performance-Based Contracts Essential to Successful Outsourcing", "paragraphs": ["We identified two key factors that, once organizations decided to outsource, were associated with an increased likelihood of the outsourcing arrangements\u2019 ultimate success. These key factors are (1) maintaining sufficient expertise and controls to effectively oversee outsourced operations and (2) establishing a well-defined, results-based contract with the outsourcing vendor. An organization needs to address these critical factors not only to help ensure that it is meeting its cost reduction and/or process improvement goals, but also to avoid an increased risk of unexpected cost increases, poor quality services, or even fraud. In addition, effective oversight controls are critical to ensuring that outsourcing vendors effectively discharge their fiduciary responsibilities for the funds and other resources entrusted to them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effective Oversight of Outsourcing Vendor Is Essential", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring that an organization maintains sufficient expertise and has an effective set of controls in place to oversee the vendor\u2019s operations were identified as essential to successful outsourcing. In recent testimony, we stressed the need for effective contract monitoring and oversight to evaluate contractor compliance and performance in outsourcing arrangements, but found that such monitoring was not always done effectively.", "The PA Consulting Group\u2019s report on its 1996 survey also raised concerns about the adequacy of contract oversight. The study found that contract monitoring was very important in ensuring that organizations reach their outsourcing goals and that service quality and customer satisfaction were the areas most commonly monitored by organizations. However, the study also found that the level of skill and sophistication necessary for effectively monitoring outsourcing arrangements may exceed the capability of many organizations.", "One organization\u2019s experience illustrates the importance of maintaining sufficient in-house expertise to maintain effective oversight controls over an outsourcing vendor\u2019s performance. The human resources department had outsourced the pension payment process believing that they could \u201cwipe their hands clean of it.\u201d However, the organization has subsequently had to consider bringing the process back in house, in part because it has become increasingly concerned about whether it can retain sufficient expertise in-house to effectively oversee the outsourcing vendor to ensure that the organization\u2019s retirees are properly paid.", "Among common contract monitoring techniques organizations have used to maintain control over the outsourcing vendor\u2019s operations were retaining the right to audit the vendor\u2019s operations and periodic reports of cost and service performance and meetings to discuss performance. For example, one organization stipulated in all of its agreements with vendors that its internal audit department must be able to audit the vendor\u2019s records, procedures, policies, and controls related to the outsourced function. Another organization that outsourced a number of accounting processes received monthly performance reports that tracked vendor performance against contractual expectations. In addition, the organization had ongoing meetings with the vendor to discuss performance concerns and any potential process improvement changes and conducted periodic evaluations to determine if outsourcing goals were met and to establish future expectations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures Must Be Established and Used to Monitor Outsourcing", "paragraphs": ["A well-defined results-based contract\u2014based on clearly defined, results-oriented performance measures rather than on the processes to be followed\u2014is recognized as one of the primary ways of helping to ensure that an organization will achieve the desired level of benefits. While a results-based contract will not guarantee good contractor performance, it will help in measuring the performance and the extent to which expected benefits have been achieved.", "Service providers, consultants, and end-users agreed that outsourcing contracts should be results- rather than process-based. According to one service provider, process-based requests for proposals and contract documents often preclude providers from developing the most appropriate outsourcing solution. Officials of one organization that had outsourced major portions of its accounting and finance functions told us that they developed a results-oriented request for proposal that was very descriptive of both current functions and what was expected from the vendor in terms of improved performance. The contract detailed performance expectations for the outsourced processes, including the timing of reports and the presentation, availability, and quality of accounting and finance information and established a related set of performance measures intended to help determine the extent to which the goals of the outsourcing arrangement were achieved.", "Outsourcing contracts that are process rather than results driven may also tend to reinforce any existing finance and accounting deficiencies and limit the vendor in implementing efficiencies and changing processes to improve operations and reduce costs. For example, more staff would be required to process accounts payable if the contract required the vendor to manually match the purchase order, receiving report, and invoice than if the contract specified the vendor was responsible for making timely and correct payments for 99.5 percent of the dollar value of the invoices processed. In the latter case, the vendor would be able to take advantage of such techniques as electronic data interchange and evaluated receipts, thus enabling payments to be based upon efficient and accurate computerized matches of key elements on the purchase order and receiving report.", "We are sending copies of this letter to the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on National Security, the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, and the Subcommittee on Government, Management, Information and Technology of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
