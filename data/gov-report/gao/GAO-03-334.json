However, some unauthorized use of the travel card still occurred. HHS delinquency rates were lower than governmentwide rates for most of 2001 and declined further in 2002. Also, HHS's .29 percent write-off rate--the amount of unpaid travel card charges written off as a percentage of total travel charges--was slightly lower than the governmentwide rate of .44 percent. HHS has not always identified or prevented unauthorized travel card use because its monitoring of travel card use focuses mainly on delinquencies. GAO estimated that unauthorized travel card transactions for fiscal year 2001 ranged from about 7 percent at one HHS component agency to about 22 percent at another. Examples of unauthorized charges included personal charges for meals and automated teller machine withdrawals. While unauthorized use had minimal negative monetary effect because the majority of cardholders who made these charges paid their travel card bills timely, left unchecked, such use could lead to increased delinquencies and write-offs. GAO also found weaknesses in voucher processing, inadequate review of vouchers, and poor record retention, resulting in some employees being reimbursed for more than allowable expenses and for amounts not properly supported. The excess reimbursement ranged from about $2 on one voucher to about $250 on another. While these amounts alone are insignificant and relate to only a small percentage of travel reimbursements for fiscal year 2001, excess reimbursements reduce the amount of available travel funds. Further, vouchers that are not supported by related receipts make it difficult to determine if the reimbursement amounts are proper."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), like other federal  agencies, issues travel cards to personnel for expenses related to official  government travel.

To help cardholders pay their monthly bills on time, the  act also requires that agencies reimburse cardholders for proper travel  claims within 30 days of submission of proper travel vouchers.  Further, the  act allows, but does not require, agencies to offset a cardholder\u2019s pay for  amounts the cardholder owes to the travel card contractor as a result of  travel card delinquencies not disputed by the cardholder.

HHS  designates program coordinators to monitor the travel card program in  each HHS component agency and take corrective or disciplinary action  when necessary.

Program coordinators told us they routinely  review the U.S. Bank reports to identify delinquent cardholders, and during  this review, they may also identify unauthorized charges.  One program  coordinator told us he specifically looks for potential unauthorized or  personal use by all cardholders by checking the location where  transactions occurred (to detect purchases in the local area where  employees work) and the name of merchants where transactions occurred.   However, others only focused on delinquent cardholders.", "Program coordinators issue messages to all staff reminding them of their  responsibility to pay their travel card bills on time and that the card is to be  used only for authorized expenses related to official travel.  In addition,  U.S. Bank staff, departmental staff, and component agency program  coordinators participate in monthly conference calls to discuss issues  related to travel card policy and identify areas where additional monitoring  may be needed.", "As monitoring procedures have identified agency- or employee-specific  problems, component agencies have implemented corrective or  disciplinary actions to address the problems.  For example, at the  beginning of fiscal year 2002, IHS limited ATM withdrawals to $60 per day  not to exceed $360 per week, from the prior limits of $300 per day not to  exceed $600 per week.  It also lowered the credit limit for most of its  cardholders to $3,500 per month.  The limits had been as high as $15,000.   In addition, the IHS program coordinator sends letters to cardholders, their  supervisors, and unit managers containing specific details of the problems  and actions that can or will be taken.

These actions range from verbally reprimanding employees to  canceling travel card accounts.  Specific examples are discussed in the  next section.", "In addition to monitoring travel cards and taking action when problems  arise, HHS staff members responsible for the travel card program told us  that low delinquency and write-off rates can also be attributed to the  demographics of its workforce.

An exception is IHS, which had the highest delinquency  rates of the five component divisions we reviewed.  According to IHS  officials, its traveling workforce tends to be less experienced and lower  paid than employees in the other component agencies.

We identified personal charges for gas  and ATM withdrawals and one business-related transaction for parking at a  meeting.", "In some cases, the component agencies had already identified  unauthorized transactions that were in our sample and had taken action,  and in other cases, the component agencies were not aware of the  unauthorized use until we brought it to their attention.  For example, one of  the transactions in our NIH sample was a personal purchase of gasoline.   NIH provided documentation showing that the cardholder had several prior  instances of personal use of the card and had been delinquent in paying his  travel card bill.  NIH canceled his travel card in June 2002, and the  employee voluntarily resigned.  For two other unauthorized transactions in  our sample, NIH told us that the purchases were not identified until we  started our review.

Specifically, we determined whether the  employees responsible for the unauthorized use were late in paying their  bills or had their accounts written off.  This is key because unauthorized  use of the travel card by itself has no direct negative monetary affect on the  government unless the cardholders do not pay their bills on time.   Delinquencies and write-offs affect how the bank calculates the amount of  an agency\u2019s rebate.

At IHS, three vouchers we tested included  reimbursement amounts totaling $95 related to excess per diem, and five  NIH vouchers we tested included reimbursement amounts totaling $378  related to excess per diem.

The amount of excess reimbursement by CMS for items  credited to hotel bills was about $33 and the amount for OS was about  $159.  We also found that CMS improperly reimbursed about $12 to a  traveler for fees claimed on the voucher twice, and OS paid about $12 in  excess per diem.  While these amounts are minimal, they relate to only a  small percentage of travel voucher reimbursements for fiscal year 2001,  and if extrapolated to all travel reimbursements, the amount could be  significant.  Reimbursing employees for amounts that exceed proper  expenses potentially reduces the amount of travel funds available during  the year for other important mission-related activities requiring travel.

Unchecked, unauthorized use could lead to increased  delinquencies and write-offs, thus reducing the rebates HHS earns on its  travel card program.  In addition, while component agencies have controls  over travel voucher processing, these controls were not always effective in  ensuring that per diem amounts claimed were proper and that  reimbursements did not include amounts for which travelers had received  credits on their hotel bills.

According to HHS, some of the component  agencies we reviewed are taking, or have taken, various actions to  implement our recommendations.  These actions should help to reduce  unauthorized and personal use of travel cards and help ensure that  travelers are not receiving reimbursement in excess of proper travel  expenses.  We urge HHS to ensure that the recommendations are addressed  departmentwide.", "In separate technical comments, CMS took issue with three transactions  that we determined to be unauthorized because the agency did not provide  supporting documentation.  As stated in our report, we characterized  certain transactions as unauthorized because we determined that they  either were for personal use or the component agencies did not provide us  an approved travel order or other documentation to demonstrate that the  transaction was an official travel expense.", "These three transactions did not have cardholder names associated with  them in U.S. Bank\u2019s database.  CMS stated that it could not provide  documentation to support the transactions without a traveler name, and  therefore, these transactions should not be considered errors.  We disagree.", "We had several conversations with representatives from U.S. Bank about  the data.  Based on other data elements in its database, U.S. Bank  representatives told us that they had determined the transactions were  made with travel cards issued to CMS employees.  CMS and the bank were  both aware of the account numbers associated with these three  transactions and other transaction information such as the merchant name  and address and transaction date.  This information would have provided  them an avenue to ascertain the cardholder names.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 7 days after its  date.

We selected  five HHS component agencies to review based on the amount of travel card  activity and delinquency rates in fiscal year 2001.  Table 7 shows the  amounts of travel card activity for these component agencies in fiscal year  2001.  These five component agencies, which incurred approximately  370,000 transactions in the amount of $48.8 million, covered nearly 70  percent of HHS\u2019s travel card activity in fiscal year 2001.", "To determine whether HHS has an effective process for monitoring its  travel card program to minimize delinquency rates, write-offs, and  unauthorized use of the card, we obtained an understanding of the travel  card program, both departmentwide and for the five individual component  agencies.  We interviewed HHS staff members and officials and reviewed  HHS\u2019s departmentwide and individual component agencies\u2019 policies and  procedures to identify procedures for monitoring their travel card  programs.  We also obtained data from the General Services Administration  on delinquency rates and write-offs and compared HHS to other federal  agencies.", "To determine the extent of unauthorized use of travel cards during fiscal  year 2001, we tested random samples of travel card transactions from each  of the five component agencies.  To select the samples, we obtained (1) a  database of HHS travel card transactions for fiscal year 2001 from U.S.", "Bank, the contractor that administers the HHS travel card program, and   (2) lists of fiscal year 2001 travel orders and vouchers from the five  component agencies.  We verified that the population of transactions in the  database agreed with control totals for the number and amount of  transactions provided by U.S. Bank.  We were not able to verify the  completeness of the lists of travel orders and vouchers.", "From the U.S. Bank data, we selected random samples of 86 travel card  transactions for each of the five component agencies, for a total of 430  transactions.  Then, based on the date of the transactions and the dates of  travel, we identified the travel order related to each transaction.  We asked  the component agencies to provide the travel order, travel voucher, and all  documentation and receipts supporting the amount claimed on the travel  voucher for each of the sampled transactions.  Because we were not able to  ensure that the lists of travel orders were complete, in cases where we  could not identify a related order, we provided the component agencies  with information on the transactions, including cardholders\u2019 names and  account numbers, merchant names and addresses, and dates of  transaction, so that they could try to identify the related orders through  other means.  In some cases, the component agencies were able to locate  the related travel orders and vouchers, and they provided the documents to  us, or they provided us with documentation stating that the transactions  were not for authorized expenses related to official travel.  In other cases,  the component agencies provided us with travel orders and vouchers, but  we determined that they did not relate to the transactions, or the  component agencies did not provide any documentation for some  transactions.  We concluded that a transaction was an authorized use of the  travel card if there was an approved travel order related to the transaction.   We concluded the transaction was unauthorized if (1) the component  agency acknowledged unauthorized use, (2) the travel order we were  provided did not relate to the transaction, or (3) we were not provided with  any documentation.

Table 9 shows the number  of cardholders with unauthorized transactions who were delinquent and  who had their accounts written off during fiscal year 2001.", "To determine whether controls over travel voucher processing are effective  in helping ensure that travelers are not receiving reimbursements in excess  of proper travel expenses, we tested the travel voucher covering each of  the authorized transactions in our samples to determine whether the  reimbursement amount was properly supported and not overstated.  For  each voucher in the sample, we verified that correct per diem rates were  used; verified that automated teller machine cash withdrawal fees were  calculated correctly, ensured that the necessary receipts were attached and  the correct amounts were claimed on the voucher, and verified that the  calculations on the voucher were accurate.
