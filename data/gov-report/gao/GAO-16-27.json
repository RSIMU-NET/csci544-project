According to the review conducted in 2013, the 12 firms then participating in the program avoided about $18.5 million in costs through the use of single comprehensive subcontracting plans rather than multiple individual subcontracting plans. Also, a 2007 review estimated that DOD avoided administrative costs of at least $45 million in fiscal year 2005. GAO reviewed the methodologies used for these reviews and took other steps to validate their findings. According to DOD officials, if the Test Program were terminated or allowed to expire, a significant one-time administrative cost of about $22 million could result to participants. GAO's analysis confirms this conclusion. Test Program participants and DOD officials GAO interviewed stated that the program also has resulted in non-financial benefits, including greater company-wide awareness of small business subcontracting opportunities. The participants GAO interviewed said that without the program their companies might be less inclined to award subcontracts to small businesses. They emphasized, however, that the program's continuing test status creates uncertainty and inhibits further expansion. The 2007 review recommended that DOD work with Congress to make the Test Program permanent; however, DOD has not acted on this recommendation. Doing so could help eliminate uncertainty with the program.", "GAO found that the Test Program enhanced small business subcontracting opportunities, although participants' performance in meeting individual goals has varied. Participants are evaluated on their achievement of negotiated initiatives and goals in their comprehensive subcontracting plans. GAO's analysis of performance reports found that participants made acceptable progress on their initiatives 87 percent of the time, thus providing tangible subcontracting opportunities for small businesses. For example, during fiscal years 2006 through 2013, program participants redirected nearly $93 million in subcontracts from large businesses to small businesses. Participants also achieved a 72-percent success rate in increasing small business subcontracts in areas such as integrated circuits and information technology, thus addressing a concern among some small businesses that high-end technical work was not being subcontracted under the program. The 2013 DOD review estimated that participant initiatives could amount to as much as $1.8 billion per year in increased small business opportunities. GAO's analysis found that participants did not always meet individual goals, in part due to the challenging nature of these goals. However, GAO also found that their combined performance from fiscal years 2006 through 2013 resulted in subcontract awards to small businesses that exceeded aggregate goals by about $5.4 billion. The annual performance reviews of the participants, which take into account performance on both initiatives and goals, have been largely positive."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider making the program permanent.

Reporting small business subcontracting activity in  a comprehensive plan means that less data may be available on the  subcontracting activities for specific contracts or programs. In addition,  comprehensive subcontracting plans are to include various initiatives to  enhance small business subcontracting opportunities through specific  programs or other actions.

For example, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has a prime  contract with Lockheed Martin Corporation. For this highly complex  and technical work, Lockheed Martin has subcontracted significant  portions of the work to Northrup Grumman Corporation and BAE  Systems, neither of which is considered a small business.", "Test Program participants can only count certain small business  subcontracting activities toward their goals.

According to Test Program  participants and DOD officials we interviewed, federal acquisition  regulations require that goals for small business subcontracting be  based on the prime contractor\u2019s first-tier subcontracts. This  government-wide practice does not permit prime contractors to report  subcontracting below the first-tier for purposes of demonstrating the  achievement of small business subcontracting goals. Therefore,  participants can only take credit for awards made at the first-tier of  subcontracting. For example, for the F-35 program Lockheed Martin  has approximately 500 first-tier suppliers and 1,250 second-tier  suppliers.

Participants receive  an annual overall program rating ranging from \u201cUnsatisfactory\u201d to  \u201cOutstanding.\u201d Participants that do not receive at least an \u201cAcceptable\u201d  rating are required to submit to DCMA a detailed corrective action plan to  account for and improve on known deficiencies.", "For example, for fiscal year 2013, the 12 participating firms received the  following ratings:", "Five participants received an Outstanding rating\u2014meaning they  generally exceeded the annual negotiated small business goals and  two additional socioeconomic category goals and had exceptional  success with numerous specific initiatives to assist, promote, and  utilize small businesses.", "Four participants received a Highly Successful rating\u2014meaning they  generally met or exceeded negotiated goals, including three small  business categories, and had moderate success with some initiatives  to assist, promote, and utilize small businesses.", "Three participants received an Acceptable rating\u2014meaning they  generally demonstrated a good faith effort to meet all of their annual  subcontracting goals and provided reasonable and supportable  explanations why certain goals could not be met.", "In the period we reviewed, fiscal years 2006 through 2013, no participants  received a rating of \u201cUnsatisfactory\u201d and three participants received a  rating of \u201cMarginal.\u201d Also, none of the participants we reviewed in the  period were found by DCMA to not have made a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d in  seeking to meet their goals, no matter what their overall rating. According  to DCMA annual performance documentation, the \u201cMarginal\u201d ratings were  assigned generally because the participants were deficient in meeting key  subcontracting plan elements, or the contractor failed to satisfy one or  more requirements of a corrective plan from a prior review. Two of these  participants achieved ratings at the \u201cAcceptable\u201d level or above in  subsequent reporting periods and one voluntarily exited the program.", "DOD officials said they have never terminated a participant from the  program, but that some have voluntarily exited the program. DOD officials  stated that ratings are taken into consideration by both DOD and  participants when negotiating future participation in the program and may  be taken into consideration as part of the determination of past  performance by contracting officers in awarding future government  contracts. One participant representative highlighted that the company  uses its high ratings as a marketing tool to attract small businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because of its large contracting operations, DOD is critical to the success  of federal programs designed to provide opportunities for small  businesses. The Test Program is aimed at enhancing these opportunities  and reducing participants\u2019 administrative costs. The evidence collected by  DOD and our analysis of that evidence indicates that the program has  achieved these goals. The use of comprehensive subcontracting plans  allows both DOD and Test Program participants to avoid millions of  dollars in administrative costs and has led to demonstrable  enhancements in small business subcontracting opportunities, thereby  meeting the criteria established by Congress. While there may be  concerns about the visibility of small business subcontracting on  particular contracts or programs, these concerns may diminish when  legislative changes made to the program as part of the fiscal year 2015  National Defense Authorization Act are implemented. Given that the Test  Program has been in existence for 25 years, and therefore has become a  de facto permanent program for both DOD and participants, termination  of the program in favor of individual subcontracting plans would likely  require substantial increases in manpower and fiscal resources. However,  DOD has not acted on a 2007 review recommendation to work with  Congress to make the Test Program permanent. Continually extending  the program rather than making it permanent creates uncertainty among  participants and DOD, inhibiting the expansion of the program by some  participants, the inclusion of new participants, and the formulation of DOD  policies and additional guidance that could enhance the program\u2019s  results. Working with Congress to address the program\u2019s status, for  example by providing information on the effectiveness of the Test  Program as identified in the three DOD-commissioned reviews and our  analysis, could help eliminate the uncertainty associated with the  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure continued reductions in administrative costs to DOD and  program participants and enhance subcontracting opportunities for small  businesses, Congress should consider making the Test Program  permanent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense work with Congress to  determine the status of the Test Program.

The department  agreed to work with Congress to determine the status of the Test  Program. Given DOD\u2019s disagreement, we added a matter for  Congressional consideration to this report and modified the  recommendation as discussed below. DOD\u2019s comments are provided in  full in appendix II.", "Related to the finding on enhancing small business subcontracting  opportunities, with its comments on our draft report, DOD provided a  chart that shows a decrease in the percentage of subcontract dollars  awarded to small business by Test Program participants from fiscal years  1996 through 2014. The department stated in its response that \u201chis  trend shows that the current practices associated with the   do not enhance opportunities for small businesses.\u201d We do not agree with  that assessment for a number of reasons.", "While the percentage of subcontracting dollars awarded to small  business by program participants declined since fiscal year 1996,  more recent data through fiscal year 2013 show that the performance  of program participants has remained relatively stable, as shown in  Figure 3. Although the percentages for program participants are lower  than for nonparticipants, the trends are generally the same for both.  The differences between the groups may be attributable to some of  the factors we discussed in our report\u2014such as the large, technically  complex nature of some participant\u2019s contracts and their inability to  count certain small business subcontracting activities towards their  goals\u2014which do not suggest shortcomings in the program.", "Enhancing opportunities for small business is measured by more than  just the percentage of subcontract dollars awarded. For example, the  value of the small business subcontracts awarded by program  participants grew during this period from about $895 million to more  than $7.7 billion. Small businesses therefore have received a  relatively smaller portion of a significantly larger amount.", "As discussed in the report, the Test Program also provided enhanced  opportunities to small businesses through a variety of initiatives  completed by the participants. These initiatives, among other things,  resulted in the redirection of millions of dollars of subcontracts from  large businesses to small businesses, and increased small business  participation in targeted industries, including innovative research.", "Finally, regardless of the overall percentages, we found that program  participants met or nearly met all of the \u201cstretch\u201d percentage goals  negotiated with the department in the fiscal years we reviewed. In  total, the Test Program participants exceeded the dollar goals by  approximately $5.4 billion.", "Thus, we continue to believe the program achieved its goals of enhancing  opportunities for small businesses, and as discussed in the report,  reducing participants\u2019 and DOD\u2019s administrative costs. Given these  findings, and that DOD had not acted on the 2007 review  recommendation to work with Congress to make the program permanent,  we included a recommendation in the draft report for DOD to draft a  legislative proposal to make the program permanent or otherwise work  with Congress to determine the status of the Test Program. The  department agreed to work with Congress to determine the status of the  Test Program; however, DOD did not concur with the recommendation to  draft a legislative proposal. Consequently we modified the  recommendation and added a matter for Congressional consideration to  help ensure continued reductions in administrative costs to DOD and  program participants and enhance subcontracting opportunities for small  businesses.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and to the Secretary of Defense.

This report addresses  the extent to which the Test Program (1) reduces administrative costs,  and (2) enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses.", "To address if the Test Program reduces administrative costs for program  participants, we collected and analyzed three reviews conducted for the  Department of Defense (DOD) on the Test Program in 2002, 2007, and  2013 that included estimates of the costs associated with the program.  We assessed the methodologies and assumptions utilized\u2014including the  number of contracts and cost of labor to compile program  documentation\u2014and used data collected for DOD\u2019s 2013 study to  validate the findings. To help assess the validity of the data, we discussed  with DOD officials how the data was collected. We determined that the  methodologies were valid and the data were reliable for our purposes. In  addition, we interviewed DOD officials and 5 of the 12 Test Program  participants to obtain their views on any cost savings generated by having  the Test Program, as well as any benefits they experienced from a  reduced administrative burden. Test Program participants we interviewed  represented different levels of participation in the program, including two  corporate-level participants and three division-level participants, as well  as range of subcontracting activity. The views expressed by these  participants provided insight into the operation of the program but are not  generalizable to all program participants.", "In order to determine if the conversion costs articulated by the 2013  review were reasonable, we assessed the methodology used, obtained  the data used for the estimate, discussed how the data was collected with  DOD, and performed our own analysis using more recent data that found  the conclusions of the 2013 review to be reasonable. To perform this  analysis, we obtained March 2015 contract data from the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA) for the Test Program participants.  From the contract listings we received, we removed those contracts for  which we could not determine contract costs, as well as those that were  below reporting thresholds that would require an individual subcontracting  plan, to determine the total number of contracts that would have required  individual subcontracting plans in the absence of the Test Program. DOD  officials also provided a range of estimates for the number of hours  required to develop an individual subcontracting plan, as well as the cost  per hour, which we used to determine the cost for conversion. To validate  the March 2015 contract data received from DCMA, we also obtained  data from one corporate-level participant with a high level of  subcontracting activity that we interviewed. This allowed us to estimate its  cost for converting contracts under their comprehensive subcontracting  plan to individual subcontracting plans. We determined that the data were  reliable for our purposes.", "To address whether the effect of Test Program initiatives enhanced small  business subcontracting opportunities, we selected the period of fiscal  years 2006 through 2013 for analysis. This selection was made because  prior DOD reviews released in 2002 and 2007 assessed participants\u2019  performance against goals and initiatives through fiscal year 2005 and  fiscal year 2013 was the last full year of data available. The 2002 study  used data from fiscal years 1991 to 2000, and the 2007 study used data  from fiscal years 2001 to 2005. We reviewed the available plans,  memorandums, and reviews used by DCMA to assess participant  performance from fiscal years 2006 through 2013. This included: 80  annual comprehensive subcontracting plans submitted by participants to  DCMA, 60 DCMA memorandums documenting negotiations with the  participants, and 85 annual Form 640 reviews performance reviews by  DCMA. We also analyzed the three DOD-commissioned reviews. To  provide context for the negotiation process, as well as to gather different  viewpoints about the initiatives as a whole, we interviewed  representatives from DCMA\u2019s Small Business Programs Division, DOD\u2019s  Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), and five Test Program  participants.", "To address whether the Test Program enhances subcontracting  opportunities for small businesses by successfully achieving its annual  goals, we reviewed Test Program participants\u2019 comprehensive  subcontracting plans and negotiation support memorandums and  analyzed performance data from fiscal years 2006 through 2013. We  compared the actual performance contained in the Form 640 reviews  against the approved subcontracting goals. We also obtained information  about the small business subcontracting performance of DOD in general  from DOD\u2019s OSBP. Combining this information with that obtained for  program participants, we identified trends in small business  subcontracting for Test Program participants in comparison to DOD small  business subcontracting performance in general. We also reviewed  legislation, agency guidance, Federal Register notices, and relevant GAO  and DOD reports. We also interviewed officials from DOD\u2019s OSBP,  DCMA\u2019s Small Business Programs Division, 5 of the 12 prime contractors  participating in the Test Program, and two small business advocacy  groups chosen for their representation of the small business community,  for their views on the Test Program, and factors that contribute to or  undermine its success.
