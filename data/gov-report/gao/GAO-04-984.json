For example, they had added physical barriers, enhanced protection from hackers, or established geographically diverse backup facilities. Still, some entities had limitations that increased the risk that a wide-scale disaster could disrupt their operations and, in turn, the ability of securities markets to operate. For example, three organizations were at a greater risk of disruption than others because of the proximity of their primary and backup facilities. In addition, four of the eight large trading firms GAO reviewed had all of their critical trading staff in single locations, putting them at greater risk than others of a single event incapacitating their trading operations. Geographic concentration of these firms could leave the markets without adequate liquidity for fair and efficient trading in a potential disaster. Since GAO last reported, actions were taken to improve the resiliency of the telecommunications service critical to the markets, including creating a private network for routing data between broker-dealers and various markets. Maintaining telecommunications redundancy and diversity over time will remain a challenge. Financial market regulators also took steps that should reduce the potential that future disasters would disrupt the financial markets, such as issuing business continuity guidelines for financial market participants designed to reopen trading markets the next business day after a disruption. However, despite the risk posed by the concentration of broker-dealers' trading staffs, and the lack of regulations requiring broker-dealers' to be prepared to operate following a wide-scale disruption, SEC had not fully analyzed the extent to which these organizations would be able to resume trading following such a disruption. Furthermore, while SEC has made some improvements to the voluntary program it uses to oversee the information security and business continuity at certain critical organizations, it has not taken steps to address key long-standing limitations. Despite past difficulties obtaining cooperation with recommendations and a lack of resources to conduct more frequent inspections, SEC had not proposed a rule making this program mandatory or increased the level of the program's resources--as GAO has previously recommended. In addition, SEC appeared to lack sufficient staff with expertise to ensure that the organizations in the program adequately addressed the issues identified in internal or external reviews, or to identify other important opportunities for improvement. Although SEC staff continue to assess the impact of a recent reorganization involving the programs staff, whether the current placement of the program within SEC is adequate for ensuring that the program receives sufficient resources is not yet clear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The massive destruction to property and supporting utility infrastructure  resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade  Center exposed the vulnerability of the financial markets to disruption by  such events. In February 2003, we reported that critical financial market  participants and regulators took many actions to reduce the risk that such  disasters would disrupt the markets\u2019 operations in the future. However, we  also reported that some critical market participants still had limitations in  their physical security protections or business continuity capabilities that  increased their risk of being disrupted. In addition, we found that financial  regulators had begun to take steps\u2014such as issuing draft recovery goals  and best practices for entities that perform the critical clearing and  settlement functions that ensure that ownership and payments are  transferred after trades occur\u2014to reduce the likelihood that future  disasters would lead to widespread payment defaults. Nevertheless, we  also reported that regulators could take further actions to better ensure  that trading could resume in a timely manner after such events. Thus, in our  2003 report, we recommended that the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) work with industry to improve the preparedness of the  financial sector to resume operations after future disruptions.", "To further improve the preparedness of securities organizations, we also  made recommendations to SEC to improve the Automation Review Policy  (ARP) program that it uses to oversee security and operations continuity  issues at exchanges, clearing organizations, and electronic  communications networks (ECN), which are electronic venues for  matching and executing orders to trade securities. Finally, we  recommended that SEC make compliance with ARP mandatory and, if  possible, increase the level of staffing and resources committed to the  program.", "Because of ongoing concerns about our nation\u2019s vulnerability to terrorist  attacks, you asked that we review progress made since our previous report  by (1) securities market organizations, including exchanges and clearing  organizations; (2) market participants, such as key banks and  broker-dealers; and (3) financial regulators to reduce the likelihood of  potential terrorist attacks and other disasters disrupting market  operations. You also asked us to report on the progress that SEC has made  in responding to our recommendations of developing goals, strategies, and  business continuity practices that could better ensure that market  participants, which are needed for trading activities to resume, would be  prepared for future disasters. In addition, you asked that we review the  actions SEC has taken to improve the ARP program. Specifically, we  assessed (1) actions that critical securities market organizations and key  trading or clearing firms undertook to reduce their risk of disruption from  terrorist attacks or other disasters; (2) steps that financial market  participants, telecommunications industry organizations, and others took  to improve the resiliency of telecommunications systems; (3) financial  regulators\u2019 efforts to ensure the resiliency of the financial markets; and   (4) the progress SEC has made in improving the ARP program.", "In performing our follow-up work, we reviewed regulatory and industry  documents and interviewed staff from broker-dealers, banks, regulators,  telecommunications providers, industry associations, and other  organizations. We visited seven organizations that we categorized as  \u201ccritical,\u201d based on our consideration of whether viable immediate  substitutes existed for the products or services they offered or whether the  functions they performed were essential for the overall ability of the U.S.  securities markets to continue operations. We inspected various physical  and electronic security measures at these seven organizations and  reviewed their business continuity capabilities. In assessing the  organizations\u2019 physical and electronic security and business continuity  efforts, we used criteria that were either established by regulators or were  generally accepted by government or industry. For our reviews, we relied  on documentation and descriptions provided by market participants and  regulators and reviews conducted by other organizations. When feasible,  we also directly observed controls in place for physical security, electronic  security, and business continuity at the organizations assessed. We did not  test these controls by attempting to gain unauthorized entry or access to  facilities or information systems, neither did we directly observe testing of  business continuity capabilities. We also discussed the business continuity  capabilities and improvements made by eight large broker dealers and  banks that collectively represented a significant portion of trading and  clearing volume on U.S. securities markets. In addition, we reviewed the  efforts that financial market regulators, industry associations, and  telecommunications carriers and organizations took to improve the  resiliency of the financial markets. We performed our work from  September 2003 through August 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. For security reasons, we did not  include the names of the organizations we reviewed, their functions, or  their locations in this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Customer orders for stocks and options, including those from individual  investors and from institutions such as mutual funds, are generally routed  through a broker-dealer and executed at one of the many exchanges  located in the United States. After a securities trade is executed, the  ownership of the security must be transferred and payment must be  exchanged between the buyer and the seller. This process is known as  clearance and settlement and is performed by separate clearing  organizations for stocks and for options. A depository maintains records of  institutional ownership for the bulk of the securities traded in the United  States. Banks also participate in the U.S. securities markets by acting as  clearing banks that maintain accounts for broker-dealers to accept and  make payments for these firms\u2019 securities activities. Payments for  corporate and government securities transactions, as well as for business  and consumer transactions, are transferred by payment system processors,  including those operated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  (Federal Reserve) and private organizations. Virtually all of the information  processed is transferred between parties via telecommunications systems;  and as a result, the securities markets depend heavily on its supporting  telecommunications infrastructure.", "Although thousands of entities are active in the U.S. securities markets,  certain key participants are critical to the ability of the markets to function.  Some are more important than others because they offer unique products  or perform vital services. For example, markets cannot function without  the activities performed by clearing organizations; and in some cases, only  one clearing organization exists for particular products. In addition, other  market participants are critical to the overall market functioning because  they consolidate and distribute price quotations or information on  executed trades. Other participants may be critical to the overall  functioning of the markets only in the aggregate. For example, if one of the  thousands of broker-dealers in the United States is unable to operate, its  customers may be inconvenienced or unable to trade, but the impact on the  markets as a whole may just be a lower level of liquidity or reduced price  competitiveness. However, a small number of large broker-dealers account  for sizeable portions of the daily trading volume on many exchanges. If  several of these large firms were unable or unwilling to operate, the  markets might not have sufficient trading volume to function in an orderly  or fair way.", "Several federal organizations oversee the various securities market  participants. SEC regulates the stock and options exchanges and the  clearing organizations for those products. In addition, SEC regulates the  broker-dealers that trade on those markets and other participants, such as  mutual funds, which are active investors. The exchanges also have  responsibilities as self-regulatory organizations for ensuring that their  participants comply with the securities laws and the exchanges\u2019 own rules.  SEC or one of the depository institution regulators oversees participants in  the government securities market, but the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) also plays a role. Treasury issues rules pertaining to securities  market, but SEC or the bank regulators are responsible for conducting  examinations to ensure that these rules are followed. Additionally, several  federal organizations have regulatory responsibilities over banks and other  depository institutions, including those active in the securities markets.  The Federal Reserve oversees bank holding companies and state-chartered  banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.

However, several organizations still faced an increased risk of  disruption from potential future attacks, either because of the location of  their backup facilities or because they have not taken steps to better ensure  the availability of critical staff.

Physical security  encompasses measures such as installing physical barriers around  buildings, screening people and objects, and using employee and visitor  identification systems. We assessed the organizations\u2019 physical security  using standards and best practices developed by the Department of  Justice. For example, as a deterrent to potential attacks, one organization  increased the number of armed security officers that protect the perimeter  of its facility. These security personnel are also now clad in military-style  uniforms and possess greater firepower than they did previously. In  addition, this organization installed additional video cameras to allow it to  monitor more locations around its facility. Another organization we  reviewed had installed new perimeter barriers and X-ray equipment outside  of its facility to better protect its lobby and other interior spaces. Four of  the critical organizations we reviewed still faced increased risks in their  physical security, such as an inability to control vehicular traffic around  their primary facility, which put them at greater risk of disruption from  potential physical attacks than other organizations. However, each of these  four organizations also had geographically diverse backup facilities  capable of conducting some or all of the organization\u2019s critical operations,  mitigating the effect of a disruption at the primary facility.", "All seven organizations had also implemented countermeasures to mitigate  chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) threats. For example, each  organization had identified its facilities\u2019 outdoor air intakes, which can be  highly vulnerable to CBR attacks, and took steps to prevent access to them.  Such steps included installing locks, video cameras, security lighting, and  intrusion detection sensors in order to establish a security zone around the  air intakes. The organizations also took actions to prevent public or  unauthorized access to areas that provide access to centralized mechanical  systems, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment.  Finally, some organizations also isolated their lobbies, mail processing  areas, and loading docks.", "An effective physical security program includes periodic testing of controls  such as reviews of security guard performance outside of normal business  hours, attempts to bring in prohibited items (such as weapons), and review  of employees\u2019 use of access to restricted and sensitive areas. Periodic  monitoring of such controls not only provides a valuable means of  identifying areas of noncompliance or previously undetected  vulnerabilities, but can also serve to remind employees of their security  responsibilities and demonstrate management\u2019s commitment to security.  Each of the organizations we visited performed these types of tests on a  periodic basis.", "The critical organizations also continued to invest in information security  measures to reduce the risk that their operations would be disrupted by  electronic attacks. Electronic attacks can come in different forms and  include attacks in which persons (such as hackers) attempt to gain  unauthorized access to a specific organization or system or attacks by  computer programs or codes, such as viruses or worms. We applied criteria  from the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual, as well as  other federal guidelines and industry best practices, to assess the  organizations\u2019 information security. For more information on the scope of  our assessment, please see appendix I. All of the organizations we reviewed  enhanced protections against unauthorized outside access to their  computer systems. For example, one organization increased the coverage  of its intrusion detection and prevention systems to better monitor and  address attacks by outsiders. Some of the organizations we reviewed also  had invested in more secure technologies. For example, one organization  put in place a new multitiered external network, which provides multiple  layers of security. During our reviews, we also identified and discussed  with these organizations additional actions they could take to further  improve their information security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Organizations Improved Their Ability to Recover from Disruptions, but Some Faced Limitations That Increased Risks", "paragraphs": ["All the critical organizations had also further increased their ability to  recover from attacks or other disasters since our 2003 report, but some still  had limitations in their business continuity capabilities that increased their  risk of disruption. Since our report, these organizations also have more  specific standards against which to measure their capabilities because  federal financial regulators have issued business continuity guidelines and  principles that set expectations for these organizations. These regulatory  guidelines direct the organizations to establish geographically diverse  backup capabilities and state that the operation of a backup site should not  be impaired by a wide-scale evacuation at the primary site or the  inaccessibility of the staff. Although the guidance does not specify a  minimum distance between primary and backup facilities, regulators state  that such facilities should not rely on the same infrastructure components,  such as transportation, telecommunications, water supply, and power  supply.", "As of May 2004, four of the seven critical organizations had geographically  dispersed backup sites that their officials indicated were capable of  conducting the organizations\u2019 critical operations. Each backup site was  located at a considerable distance from the organizations\u2019 primary  sites\u2014ranging from almost 300 miles to over 1,100 miles. However, as of  June 2004, the remaining three critical organizations that we noted in our  previous report as lacking geographic separation between their primary  and backup facilities did not have geographically diverse backup facilities  capable of assuming all critical operations. Instead, these three  organizations\u2019 current backup facilities were located within the same  geographic area as their primary sites (although, as discussed below, one  organization had a geographically diverse facility that it could use to run  some of its critical applications). Officials at one organization said that  these facilities do not depend on the same infrastructure components as  their primary facilities; although, in some cases, they would depend on the  same transportation system.  Although having backup sites does reduce the  risk that these organizations\u2019 operations would be disrupted in future  attacks, both primary and backup facilities could be affected by wide-scale  events, and thus, these organizations faced an increased level of risk of  operational disruptions.", "However, officials at the three critical organizations that lacked  geographically dispersed backup sites were reducing the risks resulting  from the proximity of their primary and backup facilities. One organization  established a geographically diverse backup site, and as of June 2004, had  the ability to run some of its critical operations from that site. Officials at  this organization anticipated being able to conduct all of its critical  operations from the new site by the end of 2005. To reduce the risk arising  from certain types of events, the other two organizations had begun work  to establish management systems that would allow them to operate the  hardware and systems at their primary sites from geographically remote  locations. Federal financial regulators have stated that having a backup site  that is fully capable of operating all critical functions is necessary for  organizations to ensure that they can meet regulators\u2019 recovery objectives.  (We discuss recovery objectives more fully later in this report.) However,  these organizations\u2019 remote management capabilities, which both intended  to have in place by the end of 2004, would allow them to continue operating  under disaster scenarios in which their facilities were not damaged but  were rendered physically inaccessible for public safety or other reasons. As  of August 2004, one of these two organizations had a plan to implement a  geographically diverse backup site by April 2005. The other organization  was considering alternatives for being able to recover its operations in  geographically dispersed locations but had not developed any definite  plans.", "Additionally, at the time we conducted this review, six of the seven  organizations had arrangements in place that appear to ensure the  availability of critical staff. Organizations also can enhance business  continuity capabilities following a disaster by implementing plans to ensure  the availability of key staff, if staff who perform critical activities at a  primary facility become incapacitated. For example, one organization  rotated its critical staff among multiple locations, ensuring that all such  staff were never in the same location at the same time. However, one of the  seven organizations had not developed a formal plan for ensuring the  availability of key staff. Officials at this organization said they believed that  a sufficient number staff necessary to conduct critical operations were not  at the primary facility at any one time for a variety of reasons, including  vacations and business travel.  However, they had no formal plan to ensure  that sufficient numbers of trained staff would be available should staff at  the primary facility be lost. In July 2004, officials from this organization  said they were seeking to have such a plan in place in the near future. This  particular organization already has faced an increased risk of disruption  because it was also one of the three organizations that did not yet have a  geographically diverse backup facility. While this organization had  improved its physical security, which can help protect an organization\u2019s  primary facility as well as its critical staff, it was still at greater risk of  disruption than other critical organizations.", "Further, all seven organizations that we reviewed appeared to be following  sound practices for ensuring the continuity and recoverability of their  critical telecommunications services. Business continuity guidelines  identify five telecommunications-related practices that organizations can  follow to improve the continuity of their critical telecommunications  services: developing and maintaining an inventory of existing  telecommunications services, identifying those services critical to  continued operations, identifying the risks to those services, developing  strategies and solutions to mitigate those risks, and testing those risk  mitigation and continuity strategies. Specifically, the critical organizations  we reviewed inventoried their voice and data telecommunications services  and identified those services critical to their operations. The organizations  also took actions to identify and mitigate their respective risks. For  example, to mitigate the risk that a single failure point in their internal  networks might disrupt their operations, all organizations linked their  facilities to public networks at two diverse points on their premises and  distributed those connections throughout their facilities through redundant  cabling. To limit their exposure to disruptions in public network facilities,  some organizations also subscribed to services that linked their facilities to  the public network at multiple points and also linked them to services that  would reroute their connections around failure points that might occur in  the public networks. To improve service recoverability, six of the seven  organizations were also taking advantage of a federal telecommunications  priority program that would provide increased priority for restoration of  the key telecommunications circuits in their inventories in the event of a  disruption. These critical organizations were also testing their own  abilities to recover their communications operations during a disaster and  to communicate with key customers and organizations. Further, within  their overall continuity strategies, most critical organizations were either  establishing or continuing to operate out-of-region telecommunications  facilities that would, among other things, reduce the risk that a failure in  local telecommunications services at any one location would pose a risk to  their continuing operations.", "Finally, given that most organizations had limited resources, effectively  managing operations risks involved balancing additional protections for  facilities, personnel, and systems with enhancing business continuity  capabilities. As part of this process, organizations take into consideration  that enhancing capabilities in one area can help mitigate vulnerabilities in  another area. For example, as noted previously, four of the critical  organizations we reviewed had weaknesses in their physical security but  also had geographically diverse backup facilities capable of conducting  some or all of the organization\u2019s critical operations, mitigating the effect of  a disruption at the primary facility. That is, if a physical security weakness  allowed a disruption to occur at the organization\u2019s primary facility,  operations could be transferred to a backup facility. Similarly, one  organization that had not yet implemented a geographically diverse backup  facility had made significant improvements to the physical security  protections in place at its primary facility, which can help reduce the  likelihood of that facility becoming incapacitated by potential physical  attacks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broker-Dealers and Banks Also Reduced Their Risk of Disruption, but Some Faced Increased Risk Because of Concentration of Key Staff", "paragraphs": ["The trading firms with whom we spoke\u2014eight trading firms, including five  large broker-dealers and three banks whose activities represent a  significant portion of the total trading and clearing volume on U.S.  markets\u2014also took steps to improve their recovery capabilities, but some  still faced increased risk of disruption. The smooth functioning of U.S.  securities markets also depends on the ability of trading firms to conduct  trading and clear and settle their transactions. In our 2003 report, we noted  that because of the considerable efforts required for broker-dealers to  restore operations, insufficient liquidity existed to open the markets during  the week of the September 2001 attacks. For example, several large  broker-dealers had not invested in backup facilities and had to recreate  their trading operations at new locations; others needed to improve their  business continuity capabilities for telecommunications. All of the firms we  spoke with during this review said they had backup data centers capable of  running critical applications and also had alternate locations out of which  key staff could operate if the primary facilities should become unusable.  For example, to address the potential for a region-wide disruption in New  York City, one firm was developing a geographically diverse backup center.  Another firm improved its ability to ensure the availability of critical staff  by dividing key technical and business staff between two separate  locations. All of the firms also took steps to improve their ability to retain  telecommunications capabilities in the event of a disruption. For example,  all five of the broker-dealers with whom we spoke had begun using the  Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure, a private telecommunications  network linking financial market participants. Four of the broker-dealers  and all three of the banks also said they were required to meet federal  regulatory goals for the recovery of their clearing and settlement  operations and that they were taking steps that would allow them to meet  those goals within the recommended time frames.", "However, four of these firms were at greater risk of a disruption to their  trading operations than other firms because of the concentration of key  trading staff in a single location at the same time. Each of these firms did  have alternate locations out of which key trading staff could work, which  would allow them to recover their trading activities if their primary site  were damaged or inaccessible. However, officials at these firms said that if  the trading staff at the primary site were incapacitated, they would either  not be able to resume trading quickly enough to meet regulators\u2019 goal of  recovering trading activity on a next-day basis, or if able to resume trading,  they would not be able to trade at normal capacity. For example, officials at  two firms said that if they were to lose their trading operations staff, it  would likely take several weeks to reconstitute their trading operations,  even using staff from other locations. Officials at one of these firms said  that replacing highly skilled trading staff with inexperienced staff could put  the firm\u2019s capital at risk and that while they might eventually reconstitute  their trading operations, they would likely exit the market for an indefinite  period of time. Although officials at both of these firms said they  recognized that they faced increased risk, they said at this point, the  decreased efficiency and increased costs that would be associated with  splitting or rotating these staff were viewed as too great, compared with  the potential risk of disruption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securities Industry Organizations Undertook Testing and Crisis Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In addition to taking actions individually, securities market participants  also have worked jointly to improve the readiness of the financial sector for  potential future attacks. One of the weaknesses we noted in our 2003  report was that some organizations had not completely tested their  business continuity capabilities, and some also lacked sufficient  connectivity to the backup sites of other organizations. To increase the  industry\u2019s overall readiness, the Securities Industry Association (SIA),  which represents over 600 of the broker-dealers active in U.S. markets, has  been coordinating an industry-wide testing project since September 2002.  The first phase of the project had broker-dealers testing connections from  their backup facilities to the core clearing and settlement organizations and  correctly sending and receiving information. The second phase of the  project will involve broker-dealers, exchanges, and other securities market  participants in exercises that will simulate regional power and  telecommunications outages. During the exercises, participants will be  expected to conduct critical operations from an alternative location as well  as test connectivity and communications capabilities.", "Although testing took longer than originally envisioned, SIA substantially  completed the first phase by June 2004. According to SIA officials, smaller  firms that are not testing as quickly as others contributed to the delay. Also  according to SIA staff, the more than 110 firms that completed at least part  of the first phase of testing represented over 80 percent of broker-dealer  trading activity, and nearly all of the 25 largest firms have completed most  or all parts of this testing. Further, SIA conducted a disaster simulation  exercise\u2014involving key industry participants as well as SEC\u2014in May 2004  to help better prepare for the second phase of testing, which was scheduled  to begin in the third quarter of 2004.", "To address another concern revealed by the 2001 attacks, securities market  associations established crisis command centers or other coordination  procedures. Just after the September 2001 attacks, some market  participants encountered difficulties in communicating and coordinating  with other market participants, regulators, and governmental bodies that  responded to the disaster. More specifically, to coordinate the industry\u2019s  response and the dissemination of information during a crisis, in June 2002  SIA created a crisis command center. SIA also placed a representative at  the New York City Office of Emergency Management, an office that acts as  an interagency coordinator in partnership with local, state, federal, and  private entities to provide comprehensive emergency response, hazard  planning and disaster mitigation to New York City.  According to SIA  officials, they activated the SIA command center during the August 2003  blackout and during Hurricane Isabel in September 2003, allowing them to  test and validate the functioning of the command center.", "In addition, the trade association that represents firms active in bond  trading, the Bond Market Association, also took action to improve its  members\u2019 response to future crises. According to organization officials,  this association created a structure for coordinating the response of  participants in the fixed-income securities markets. The association would  communicate with its members through one of its standing committees  regarding the condition of the fixed-income securities markets and the  potential opening and closing of those markets. In addition, the  association\u2019s committee would share information and coordinate its  actions with the SIA command center.", "Finally, information regarding business continuity practices and potential  threats to the industry has been shared with market participants. For  example, SIA collected and distributed business continuity best practices  to its members, established subcommittees to study business  continuity-related issues, and conducted conferences to share and foster  discussion of these issues in the securities industry. Also, Treasury  designated another organization, the Financial Services Sector  Coordinating Council (which comprises representatives from private firms  in the financial industry) as the private-sector coordinator for critical  infrastructure protection for the banking and finance sector. In particular  this council, along with SIA and the American Bankers Association, has  supported and promoted use by the financial sector of the Financial  Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS/ISAC), a mechanism  to gather, analyze, and share information on threats, incidents, and  vulnerabilities faced by the financial sector. The council also has been  participating in educational and outreach efforts in conjunction with the  Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, which  coordinates critical infrastructure protection among federal financial  regulators."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Steps Are Under Way to Meet Challenge of Improving the Resiliency of Telecommunications", "paragraphs": ["The September 2001 terrorist attacks highlighted the critical importance of  resilient telecommunications services for the continued operation of U.S.  financial markets. The resulting damage disrupted telecommunications  service to thousands of businesses and residences, and some firms learned  that their services were not as robust as they believed prior to that event.  Since 2001 terrorist attacks, telecommunications groups and carriers and  financial market participants have worked to improve the resiliency and  the recoverability of telecommunications services in the event of future  disruptions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "September 2001 Attacks Highlighted Financial Sector Dependence on Telecommunications Services and Challenges of Maintaining Diverse Systems", "paragraphs": ["As we described in our 2003 report, the 2001 terrorist attacks resulted in  significant damage to telecommunications facilities, lines, and equipment.  The loss of telecommunications service as well as damage to power and  transportation infrastructure delayed the reopening of the markets. Much  of the disruption to voice and data communications services throughout  lower Manhattan\u2014including the financial district\u2014occurred when one of  the buildings in the World Trade Center complex collapsed into an adjacent  Verizon communications center at 140 West Street, which served as a major  local communications hub within the public network. Approximately  34,000 businesses and residences in the surrounding area lost services.  The loss of this facility also resulted in disruptions to customers in other  service areas because other telecommunications carriers had equipment  colocated in 140 West Street that linked their networks to Verizon and  considerable amounts of telecommunications traffic that originated and  terminated in other areas also passed through this location. AT&T\u2019s local  network service in lower Manhattan was also significantly disrupted  following the attacks.", "The attacks also highlighted the difficulties of ensuring that the  telecommunications services required to support critical financial market  operations could withstand the effects of network disruptions. One of the  primary ways that users of telecommunications services try to ensure that  their services will not be disrupted is to use diverse telecommunications  facilities to support their needs, including diversely routed lines and  circuits. These steps are necessary to ensure that damage to any single  point in one communications path does not cause all services to fail.  However, ensuring that telecommunication service carriers actually  maintain diverse telecommunications services is a long-standing financial  industry concern. For example, a December 1997 report prepared by the  President\u2019s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee  (NSTAC) noted, \u201cdespite assurances about diverse networks from the carriers, a consistent concern among the financial services industry was  the trustworthiness of their telecommunications diversity arrangements.\u201d", "The ongoing operation and maintenance of network facilities can itself  pose a challenge to ensuring diversity of services. To improve the reliability  and efficiency of their networks, telecommunications carriers can change  the physical network facilities they use to route circuits in a process they  call \u201cgrooming.\u201d This process can result in a loss of diversity over time,  however, if diverse services are rerouted onto or through the same  facilities. For example, as our 2003 report noted, many financial firms that  thought they had achieved telecommunications service diversity still  experienced service disruptions as a result of the September 2001 attacks.  Some of these firms indicated that although they were assured that their  communications circuits flowed through physically diverse paths, at the  time they first acquired those services, their service providers rerouted  some circuits over time without their knowledge, eliminating the assurance  of diversity and leaving the firms more vulnerable to disruption.", "However, an NSTAC 2004 report noted that carriers would have to follow  labor-intensive, manual processes to ensure route diversity and monitor  that condition on an ongoing basis. NSTAC also reported that  guaranteeing that circuit routes would not be changed could actually make  an organization\u2019s service less reliable because their circuits could lose the  benefit of networking technologies that automatically reroute circuits in  the event of facility failures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Private Telecommunications Network Created for Financial Market Participants", "paragraphs": ["Responding to the challenges of maintaining diversity, one financial market  participant has acted to improve the resiliency of the telecommunications  services supporting the financial industry. In January 2003, the Securities  Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) began operating its own private  network, known as the Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure (SFTI),  to provide more reliable and \u201csurvivable\u201d private communications services  linking exchanges, clearing organizations, and other financial market  participants. The information that travels on this network includes orders  to buy and sell stocks on the New York and American stock exchanges as  well as information needed to clear and settle these transactions.", "SFTI was designed to overcome several of the challenges in attaining  continual resiliency in telecommunications services. For example, to  ensure redundancy and eliminate single points of failure, SFTI employs  redundant equipment throughout, and carries data traffic over redundant  fiber-optic rings whose routes are geographically and physically diverse. To  access the network, users are required to connect to two or more of the  eight SFTI access nodes located in Boston, Chicago, and the New York City  metropolitan area. Therefore, if service is disrupted at one access node,  service can still be obtained through an alternate node. Further, users can  access SFTI in various ways, including obtaining a direct connection to the  SFTI access nodes or connecting to one of four financial \u201cextranet\u201d service  providers that operate their own telecommunications networks and also  link to the SFTI access nodes. Some customers may choose to use a  combination of both approaches.", "To further enhance diversity throughout this private network, SIAC has  contracted for auditable route diversity for the SFTI network. Because  SIAC manages all SFTI facilities, it can also control all the grooming that  takes place among the lines within the New York regional segment of this  network. In addition, SIAC established a remote out-of-region network  operations center that can manage network operations in the event of any  disruption to its own New York area-based operations.", "The financial industry has responded positively to SFTI since its  implementation. For example, according to SIAC, financial industry  associations, including SIA, the Bond Market Association, and the  Investment Company Institute, which represents mutual funds, have all  supported use of SFTI for their respective members. Moreover, NYSE, the  American Stock Exchange, and the Consolidated Tape Authority, which  oversees the systems that distribute stock quotes and completed trade  information for the stock exchanges, expect that all of their participating  member firms will be using SFTI to connect to its trading services, as of  December 2004.

Further, NSTAC, which had also studied diversity  issues, recommended that the federal government support research and  development activities on resiliency, diversity, and alternative technologies.", "Additionally, the federal government sought to increase financial industry  participation in federal programs that could enhance the recoverability of  disrupted services. Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) National Communications System (NCS) promoted participation in  its Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) program. TSP allows  financial market participants to register their key telecommunications  circuits for priority restoration in the event of a crisis. Financial market  participants are sponsored for registration in this program by their  regulatory agency. According to NCS officials, the financial industry has  made greater use of the TSP program, as there are now about 4,100  financial organization circuits registered in TSP for priority restoration;  more than 3,500 of those were registered since June 2002. Further, to  improve the recoverability of SFTI, the Federal Reserve worked with SIAC  to ensure that all SFTI access lines were registered for TSP priority  restoration as those circuits were installed.", "Federal financial regulators also have been working with carriers to more  closely examine the diversity challenge and identify potential management  solutions. In a recently initiated pilot project, the Federal Reserve has been  working with the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions to  examine the diversity of circuits supporting Federal Reserve networks.  The project\u2019s goal is to develop an efficient, affordable way to document  and maintain routing diversity using those circuits as a baseline. According  to Federal Reserve and Treasury officials, this exercise could yield a model  approach for achieving assured diversity, improve the processes required  to do so, and provide a better understanding of the associated costs.", "Finally, New York City officials have enhanced their ability to monitor and  coordinate infrastructure recovery efforts with local carriers. City officials  recently revised their Mutual Aid Restoration Consortium (MARC)  agreement, which governs monitoring and coordination of restoration  actions between telecommunications carriers and city officials in the event  of service outages. City officials invoked this agreement in the aftermath of  the September 2001 attacks to ensure that essential city government offices  and operations would have adequate telecommunications service and to  aid coordination of infrastructure recovery efforts by carriers operating in  the city. More recently, the MARC agreement proved effective during the  August 2003 blackout, in which teleconferences were used to identify and  communicate urgent diesel fuel needs of carriers and to coordinate other  critical assistance to share power generators and network facilities.

This should reduce the potential  for service in one area to be lost when damage occurs to facilities in other  areas. In addition, Verizon has also used more resilient and physically  diverse fiber optic systems within lower Manhattan, which also may  provide alternate network access capabilities at strategic locations.

Issued by SEC, the Federal  Reserve, and the OCC, this interagency paper identifies business continuity  practices that core clearing and settlement organizations and firms that  play a significant clearing or settlement role in critical financial markets are  expected to follow. Core organizations include clearing organizations  responsible for securities and other financial products and payment system  processors. In addition to these organizations, the interagency paper also  applies to financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealers, which  conduct significant amounts of trading and clearing activities. If these firms  were unable clear and settle the outstanding trades that they or their  customers conducted, they could create payment problems for other  participants in the markets. By proposing that these organizations and  firms follow the practices identified in the interagency paper, regulators  expect to minimize the immediate systemic effects of a wide-scale  disruption\u2014by setting goals for key payment and settlement systems to  resume operation promptly following a wide-scale disaster, and for major  participants in those systems to recover sufficiently to complete pending  transactions.", "In the interagency paper, the regulators outline various practices for  organizations and firms to follow and set goals related to resumption of  their clearing and settlement activities.

They are also expected to  determine appropriate recovery and resumption objectives for those  activities. The regulators state that, at minimum, the organizations and  firms are expected to be able to recover within the same business day. To  realistically achieve this, the regulators expect that these organizations and  firms would maintain geographically dispersed resources to meet their  recovery and resumption objectives. Specifically to be consistent with best  practices, backup facilities for clearing functions should be as far away  from the primary facility as necessary to avoid being subject to the same  set of risks as the primary facility. The backup facilities also should not rely  on the same infrastructure\u2014such as power and telecommunications\u2014as  the primary facility, and the operation of the backup facility should not be  impaired by a wide-scale evacuation at, or the inaccessibility of staff that  service, the primary site.

Some of these unaddressed  weaknesses later led to problems. For example, one organization  experienced problems related to ensuring adequate processing capacity  that delayed the implementation of decimal pricing by all securities  markets for 3 months. In another instance, SEC staff raised concerns about  the lack of a backup operating facility at an entity that had its primary  facility in the area that would later be affected by the 2001 terrorist attacks.  In some cases, organizations subject to ARP were also not providing the  reports of system changes and other events that SEC expects to receive  under the program. To address this issue, we recommended in our 2003  reports that SEC issue a rule that would make adherence to tenets of the  ARP program and the recommendations of its staff mandatory for  exchanges and clearing organizations. In contrast, ECNs have had to  comply with ARP recommendations since 1998, when SEC adopted a rule  increasing regulatory scrutiny of alternative trading systems.

Our 2001 and 2003 reports  described how a lack of resources hampered the ability of the ARP  program to oversee the operations of the entities it reviews. For example  we reported that these resource constraints affected the ARP program\u2019s  ability to conduct frequent examinations. In our 2003 report, we reported  that the intervals between ARP examinations had exceeded 3 years for five  of the seven critical financial market organizations that we reviewed, with  the other two organizations not being reviewed for 6 years or more.

Under this schedule, first-tier  organizations, including the clearing organizations and most active  markets, are to be reviewed annually. Second-tier organizations are  reviewed based on their risk assessment profile under a 3-year inspection  cycle, and third-tier firms, such as small ECNs are inspected for cause.

Although in recent years, SEC\u2019s overall resources have  significantly increased\u2014its funding increased 45 percent in 2003\u2014as of  May 2004, no significant additional resources had been allocated to the  ARP program. SEC staff said the recent creation of the Office of Market  Continuity provided them with access to some additional staff resources,  as noted earlier, but demands on ARP staff also have grown. For example,  in our 2003 report, we noted that ARP staff workload had expanded to  cover entities with more complex technology and communications  networks.

In previous reports, we have described difficulties SEC has had in  retaining qualified and experienced staff in its ARP program, as well as  concerns of industry officials over ARP staff expertise. During this review  we identified examples where ARP staff could benefit from additional  technical expertise. For example, reviews by internal and external  reviewers are a key component of the ARP program and SEC officials said  they attempt to track all significant issues and recommendations to ensure  they are addressed. However, we found that internal and external  reviewers at some of the critical organizations we reviewed had identified  important actions to improve the security of their information systems, but  that the organizations had not implemented them. In addition, at some of  the critical organizations, we identified important additional opportunities  for improvements in information security that had not been previously  identified by internal or external reviewers or by SEC\u2019s ARP staff.", "One way organizations can help ensure that their various functions receive  the appropriate level of resources, including staff and expertise, is to  ensure that those functions are properly aligned within the organization\u2019s  overall structure. Currently, the ARP program is located within the Division  of Market Regulation and, as such, is a small part of a larger division whose  primary responsibility is to establish and maintain standards for the  operation of fair, orderly, and efficient markets. As noted previously, SEC  recently relocated the ARP program within the Division of Market  Regulation, and SEC officials told us that this move has been beneficial and  that they continue to assess the impact of the reorganization on the  program\u2019s effectiveness. However this move has not yet resulted in  significant additional staffing or additional technical expertise specifically  dedicated to the ARP program. Other possible placements that might prove  beneficial for the ARP program from a resource and expertise standpoint  could include placing the ARP program with the other examination staff  within SEC\u2019s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, or  combining its staff with those having similar technical expertise within  SEC\u2019s Office of Information Technology. Realigning the ARP program  within SEC could, however, have potential disadvantages. For example,  having ARP staff within the Division of Market Regulation, as it is now,   provides valuable expertise and information gathering abilities and allows  this examination function to be linked with the related policy-making  function."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The securities market organizations we reviewed all had reduced the risk  that their operations would be disrupted by terrorist attacks or other  disasters. In addition, financial market participants and  telecommunications organizations increased the resiliency of the critical  telecommunications services necessary for the functioning of the markets.  Further, financial regulators have issued guidance to these organizations  that, if implemented, should greatly increase the ability of the markets to  recover.  However, as of May 2004, a number of the critical financial market  organizations and the broker-dealers and banks that conduct significant  trading activities remained at a greater risk of disruption than others from a  wide-scale event because they lacked certain business continuity  capabilities. The ability of U.S. financial markets to recover and resume  operating in the wake of any future attacks or disasters depends upon the  extent to which these critical market participants augment their business  continuity capabilities or mitigate existing weaknesses.", "One of the lessons learned from the September 2001 attacks was that  without key broker-dealers able to trade, the markets could not reopen. As  we noted in our 2003 report, insufficient liquidity existed to open the  markets during the week of the September 2001 attacks because of the  considerable efforts required for broker-dealers to restore operations.  However, SEC currently lacks adequate assurance that the actions of  organizations that trade in the markets will be sufficient to ensure that this  important activity can also resume. Although joint regulatory guidance  addresses organizations\u2019 clearing and settlement activities, and SEC\u2019s own  policy statement directs exchanges and ECNs to implement sound business  continuity practices, the firms that conduct trading activities in U.S.  markets are not similarly required to implement such practices, and SEC  officials said they do not have specific authority to require broker-dealers  to participate in the markets to any degree. Nevertheless, SEC has not fully  assessed whether or not sufficient numbers of firms with staff capable of  trading securities would to be ready to operate after a wide-scale disaster.  Similarly, although many other trading firms exist, including regional firms  with sizeable operations located throughout the United States, SEC has not  sufficiently analyzed the willingness and capabilities of these firms to step  up and become the significant providers of liquidity necessary for fair and  orderly trading to occur in the aftermath of a disaster. Once it conducts a  more complete analysis of the likely readiness of trading firms to resume  trading, SEC could use the results to identify actions that specific  exchanges, clearing organizations, or trading firms could take to increase  the likelihood that trading in the markets could resume when appropriate.  Given that some disaster and damage impact scenarios are more or less  likely than others, having SEC weigh the feasibility and costliness of any  actions that it identifies against the potential benefits and likelihood of  such scenarios occurring appears warranted.", "While SEC has made some enhancements to the ARP program, it has also  not made key improvements, including those we recommended in our 2003  report, that could better ensure that it is as credible and as effective as  possible. Given the importance of the work with which SEC\u2019s ARP staff are  tasked, ensuring that they have a specific rule to mandate compliance with  ARP program tenets and sufficient staff to conduct their oversight appears  justified. While SEC has made progress in ensuring that exchanges and  clearing organizations implement ARP staff recommendations, such  current voluntary cooperation may not always exist in the future,  especially when ARP-recommended actions would be costly to an  organization. The limited resources that SEC has devoted to ARP thus far  have generally prevented it from conducting more frequent examinations  and do not appear to have provided it with sufficient technical expertise to  address important information security issues.", "While the ARP program was realigned within the Division of Market  Regulation in November 2003 and SEC staff indicated that they are  assessing the impact on the program\u2019s effectiveness, it is not yet clear  whether this change will improve the program\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient  additional resources and staff with the necessary expertise. Given that the  functioning of the markets is critical to our nation\u2019s economy, taking steps  to better ensure that the program used to oversee operational and  information security issues at these entities has sound legal authority and  adequate resources and expertise is warranted at this time. Such steps  would include assessing whether the placement of the program within  SEC\u2019s organizational structure is optimal for ensuring that it has adequate  resources and staff expertise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater assurance that the critical trading that is conducted in  U.S. financial markets can resume, in as timely a manner as appropriate,  after disruptions, we recommend that the Chairman, SEC, fully analyze the  readiness of the securities markets to recover from major disruptions and  work with industry and other federal agencies, as appropriate, to determine  reasonable actions that would increase the likelihood that trading in the  markets could resume when appropriate.", "In addition, to improve the effectiveness of SEC\u2019s ARP program, which  oversees preparedness of securities trading and clearing organizations for  future disasters, we recommend that the Chairman, SEC, take the following  three steps to enhance the ARP program\u2019s effectiveness:   Establish a definite time frame for the submission of a rule requiring  exchanges and clearing organizations to engage in activities consistent  with the operational practices and other tenets of the ARP program;  Assess the adequacy of ARP staffing in terms of positions and technical  skill levels, including information security expertise, given its mission  and workload; and   Continue to assess the organizational alignment of the ARP program  within SEC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the heads, or their  designees, of the Federal Reserve, OCC, Treasury, and SEC.

The Federal Reserve, OCC, and SEC also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "SEC generally agreed with the report and its recommendations. The letter  from SEC\u2019s Chairman noted that SEC has been working actively with the  trading markets, core clearing organizations, and major market  participants to strengthen the resiliency of the financial markets. In  addition, SEC\u2019s letter noted that it would be taking specific actions in  response to our recommendations, including conducting an assessment of  key broker-dealers\u2019 trading staff arrangements and the preparations of  these firms to resume trading operations following a disaster. SEC also  indicated that its Market Regulation Division is developing a proposed rule  that would require exchanges and clearing organizations to engage in  activities consistent with the operational practices and other tenets of the  ARP program and that this should be submitted to the Commission during  the first half of 2005. SEC stated that it is also currently assessing the  adequacy of staffing and technical skill levels within the ARP program and  that increased education for its staff, hiring new staff, and engaging  consultants are all ways that it could use to address its needs in this area.  Finally, SEC noted that as part of the agency\u2019s routine strategic planning  effort, it will continue to assess the organizational alignment of the ARP  program within SEC. In its letter, the Federal Reserve noted that addressing  the risks posed by the September 11 attacks continues to be a priority for  the organization and that it is continuing efforts to improve the resiliency of  the financial system.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Specifically, we assessed (1) actions that critical  securities market organizations and key market participants undertook to  reduce their vulnerabilities to physical or electronic attacks and to improve  their business continuity capabilities; (2) steps that financial market  participants, telecommunications industry organizations, and others took  to improve the resiliency of telecommunications systems and  infrastructure; (3) financial regulators\u2019 efforts to ensure the resiliency of  the financial markets; and (4) the progress the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) has made in improving its Automation Review Policy  program, which oversees security and operations issues at exchanges,  clearing organizations, and electronic communications networks (ECN).  As in our previous report, for purposes of our analysis we selected seven  organizations whose ability to operate is critical to the overall functioning  of the financial markets. We made these categorizations by determining  whether viable immediate substitutes existed for the products or services  the organizations offer or whether the functions they perform were critical  to the overall markets ability to function. To maintain the security and the  confidentiality of their proprietary information, we agreed with these  organizations that we would not discuss their efforts to address physical  and information security risks and ensure business continuity in a way that  could identify them.", "To assess actions that critical securities market organizations took to  reduce their vulnerabilities to physical or electronic attacks and to improve  their business continuity capabilities, we visited their facilities, reviewed  relevant business continuity policies, and interviewed officials at the  organizations. Specifically, to determine what steps these seven  organizations were taking to reduce the risks to their operations from  physical attacks, we conducted on-site \u201cwalkthroughs\u201d of their facilities,  reviewed their security policies and procedures, and met with key officials  responsible for physical security to discuss these policies and procedures.  We compared these policies and procedures with 52 standards developed  by the Department of Justice for federal buildings. Based on these  standards, we evaluated the physical security efforts across several key  operational elements, including measures taken to secure perimeters,  entryways, and interior areas and whether organizations had conducted  various security planning activities. To identify types of tests an  organization can perform to monitor the effectiveness of physical security  measures in place, we reviewed publications and guidance, such as that  contained in our Executive Guide on Information Security Management  and obtained information from security experts within our office, including  Office of Special Investigations. We obtained information on the types and  extent of physical security testing performed by the organizations at their  primary locations and compared it with the information we collected. We  also reviewed publications and guidance, such as those issued by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Federal Emergency  Management Administration, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,  to identify high-level countermeasures that an organization could take to  mitigate the CBR threat. For each primary facility, through interviews with  the organizations\u2019 security officials, we identified and compared their  actions against our listing of countermeasures.", "To determine what steps these seven organizations were taking to reduce  the risks to their operations from electronic attacks, we reviewed the  security policies of the organizations we visited and reviewed  documentation of their system and network architectures and  configurations. We also compared their information security measures with  those recommended for federal organizations in the Federal Information  System Controls Audit Manual, other federal guidelines and standards, and  various industry electronic security best practice principles. Using these  standards, we attempted to determine, through discussions and document  reviews, how these organizations had addressed various key operational  elements for information security, including how they controlled access to  their systems and how they detected intrusions, what responses they made  when such intrusions occurred, and what assessments of their systems\u2019  vulnerabilities they had performed.", "To determine what steps these seven organizations had taken to ensure  they could resume operations after an attack or other disaster, we  discussed their business continuity plans (BCP) with staff and visited their  facilities. We reviewed their BCPs and assessed them against practices  recommended for financial organizations, including bank regulatory  guidance. Among the operational elements we considered were the  existence and capabilities of backup facilities, whether the organizations  had procedures to ensure the availability of critical personnel and  telecommunications, and whether they completely tested their plans. In  evaluating these organizations\u2019 backup facilities, we attempted to  determine whether these organizations had backup facilities that would  allow them to recover from damage to their primary sites or from damage  or inaccessibility, resulting from a wide-scale disaster. We did not directly  observe the operation of these backup sites, but relied on documentation,  including backup facility test results, provided by the organizations. We  also discussed the business continuity capabilities and improvements made  by eight large broker dealers and banks that collectively represented a  significant portion of trading and clearing volume on U.S. securities  markets.", "To determine the extent to which critical financial market organizations  reduced the likelihood that their operations might be disrupted by future  disasters, we also examined the telecommunications continuity practices  they were following. To identify sound telecommunications-related  continuity practices, we first reviewed business continuity planning  guidance published by the Business Continuity Institute, the Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council, and other continuity planning  guidance. Based on our review of those materials, we identified five  principal practices that organizations should follow to plan for the  availability of telecommunications services that are important to their  continuing operations. We also discussed our selection of practices for use  as criteria with a private-sector business continuity expert to affirm that  our selection of these five practices was an appropriate judgment. We then  examined the extent to which the critical organizations followed these  practices by reviewing network documentation, continuity plans, and  testing reports where available, and discussed with organization  telecommunications managers their network continuity strategies and the  practices they followed to mitigate perceived continuity risks. We assessed  those strategies, practices, and related documentation against the five  practices we identified.", "To determine how financial and telecommunications industry  organizations, federal and local government entities, and supporting  telecommunications service providers further improved  telecommunications service resiliency, including improved infrastructure  diversity and recoverability, we reviewed reports and related  documentation prepared by three Presidential Advisory Committees\u2014the  National Infrastructure Advisory Council, the National Security  Telecommunications Advisory Council, and the Network Reliability and  Interoperability Council. These reports and documentation evaluated  infrastructure interdependencies and network diversity challenges, and  they identified practices that telecommunications carriers and large  organizations might follow to better prepare for and recover from future  network disruptions. We also reviewed plans and documentation  developed by a critical financial organization to implement and operate a  private network for the benefit of financial market participants. In addition,  we met with managers at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  (the Federal Reserve) and the federal National Communications System to  obtain data on the use of federal national security/emergency preparedness  programs by the financial industry to improve the recoverability of  important telecommunications services. We also met with New York City  officials to review the status of their efforts to reestablish an agreement to  coordinate and monitor the recovery of local infrastructure in the event of  future service outages. Finally, we met with managers at three large  telecommunications carriers to review how they were rebuilding local  infrastructure in New York City, and steps taken to review and revise their  own continuity plans.", "To assess financial regulators\u2019 efforts to ensure the resiliency of the  financial markets, including the progress SEC has made in improving its  program for overseeing security and operations issues at exchanges,  clearing organizations, and ECNs, we reviewed relevant regulations and  interviewed officials at SEC, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency, and the Department of Treasury. We also discussed  initiatives to improve responses to future crises and improve the resiliency  of the financial sector and its critical telecommunications services with  representatives of industry trade groups, including the Bond Market  Association and the Securities Industry Association.", "For our reviews, we relied on documentation and descriptions provided by  market participants and regulators and reviews conducted by other  organizations. When feasible, we also directly observed controls in place  for physical security, electronic security, and business continuity at the  organizations assessed. We did not test these controls by attempting to gain  unauthorized entry or access to facilities or information systems, or  directly observe testing of business continuity capabilities.", "We performed our work from September 2003 through August 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created to help coordinate  the efforts of organizations and institutions involved in protecting the  nation against terrorist attacks, has essentially delegated to Treasury this  coordinating role within the banking and finance sector.

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), issued in December  2003, further stated that the Secretary of DHS, would be responsible for  coordinating the overall national effort to enhance the protection of the  critical infrastructure of the United States. HSPD-7 also stated that it is  U.S. policy to enhance the protection of these critical infrastructures  against terrorist attacks that could, among other things, damage the private  sector\u2019s capability to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy.", "To fulfill these objectives, HSPD-7 directs the Secretary of DHS to work  closely with other federal departments and agencies, and designates  specific agencies to coordinate efforts within certain sectors. Within the  banking and finance sector, Treasury was given responsibility for  collaborating with all relevant federal, state, and local officials, as well as  the private sector. To fulfill this responsibility, Treasury coordinates with  other federal financial regulators through the Financial and Banking  Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC), whose members include  representatives of the various regulators of banks, broker-dealers, futures  commission merchants, and housing government sponsored enterprises, as  well as other related organizations. Treasury coordinates its collaboration  with the private sector through the Financial Services Sector Coordinating  Council (FSSCC), whose members include representatives from  exchanges, clearing organizations, and banking and securities trade  associations.", "According to Treasury officials, they coordinate with DHS in several ways.  For example, a FBIIC member attends weekly meetings of DHS\u2019s  Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP),  which identifies and assesses threats and issuing timely warnings on those  threats. According to Treasury, the FBIIC member at those meetings  provides input on the needs of the financial sector as well as the relevancy  for that sector of any identified threats. In addition, Treasury has worked  with DHS to plan disaster recovery exercises, such as the TOPOFF  exercises, which simulate physical attacks. Treasury is also working with  DHS to continue developing \u201cChicago First,\u201d an emergency preparedness  program designed to coordinate activities among financial sector  participants and federal, state, and local government officials. Treasury is  promoting this program as a model for other cities to implement. Finally,  the Secretary of the Treasury, along with the Director of the Office of  Homeland Security is a member of the Homeland Security Council, which  ensures the coordination of homeland security activities among executive  departments and agencies. Representatives of the Homeland Security  Council, in turn, are members of FBIIC.", "According to FSSCC officials, they are interacting with DHS in at least two  ways. First, DHS has asked FSSCC to prepare an updated version of the  banking and finance sector\u2019s portion of the national strategy for critical  infrastructure assurance, the first version of which was completed in May  2002. FSSCC expected to complete the updated version in June 2004.  Second, FSSCC representatives have taken part in quarterly meetings  between DHS and other sector coordinators.
