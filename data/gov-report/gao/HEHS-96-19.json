VA did not adequately consider the availability of hundreds of community nursing home beds and unused VA hospital beds or the potential decrease in future demand for VA hospital beds. VA could achieve its service goals for the target area by using existing capacity. For example, it could buy more convenient and less costly care from community nursing homes and use the former Naval hospital in Orlando for more accessible medical and psychiatric services.", "Like Brevard, building the proposed Travis medical center also may not be the most cost-effective option available at this time. A VA task force study appropriately determined that it was the best option in June 1992, when a replacement for the closed Martinez medical center was being sought. However, circumstances have changed, creating an opportunity for more efficient or effective options. For example, using the Mather Air Force Base hospital in Sacramento to serve veterans could be a viable option. It would provide a 105-bed facility that is about 30 miles from the Travis site that could be more accessible to many veterans in the Travis medical center target area.", "The VA task force rejected the Mather Air Force Base hospital in Sacramento as a viable option for a joint VA and Department of Defense venture, but two of the factors that led to the rejection of that facility have now changed. First, although the Air Force had planned to use the Mather Hospital to serve McClellan Air Force Base beneficiaries, the Department of Defense now plans to close McClellan. Second, the hospital at Mather was rejected because it was too small to meet VA\u2019s projected needs for a 243-bed facility. However, some of VA\u2019s needs are currently being met with 55 beds negotiated at the Travis Air Force Base hospital, and some needs could possibly be met with available community hospital space. Moreover, the demand for inpatient care in the target area will likely decline in the future as the veteran population in northern California declines as it is projected to do throughout the country.", "The VA task force that selected the Travis site for the proposed VA medical center had ranked other options involving dual inpatient locations higher than the Travis option for veterans\u2019 access to health care but had rejected these options, in part, because they were too costly. Now, however, with the planned closing of McClellan and the possible availability of the Mather hospital for VA use, providing some inpatient care at the Travis hospital and some at the Mather hospital (or another northern California site) may provide veterans with better and more cost-effective access to VA health care than can be provided by a single Travis project.", "VA also did not rigorously analyze available alternatives when developing the seven renovation proposals. Had criteria similar to that recently proposed by VA for realigning medical facilities and siting new ones been used, lower cost alternatives may have been identified. The need for the proposed projects was determined on the basis of the physical needs identified in the medical centers\u2019 facility development plans. These plans indicate that some alternatives were considered, but officials at most of the seven medical centers told us that they did not conduct detailed studies or analyses of all available options. Some said, for example, that they did not thoroughly explore the possibility of using community and other VA medical facilities. They believe, however, that using other VA medical centers is infeasible, usually because the other VA centers are too far away or do not provide the needed medical services, and that use of community facilities is infeasible, usually because contracting for care is thought to be too expensive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Effects of Delayed Project Funding Depend on Length of Delay", "paragraphs": ["The effects of delaying the proposed projects on construction award dates and costs would depend on the length of the delay. Delaying project funding until fiscal year 1997 should have a negligible effect on construction award dates for the projects if current design schedules are met. Because construction schedules for all but two projects show that construction award dates would be July 1996 or later, the dates for starting construction would be delayed only 1 to 3 months; the Reno, Nevada, project would be delayed 11 months, and the Travis project has no single award date because it has several phases. Delaying the projects longer would extend the construction award dates. Moreover, VA headquarters officials expressed concern that, if delayed, the projects may not be selected for VA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 major construction budget because VA may identify other higher priority projects.", "Most medical center officials believe that delaying the awards of construction contracts would increase costs due to inflation. However, delaying the awards until fiscal year 1997 would have minimal effects on costs because cost increases from inflation would involve time periods of fewer than 3 months for most projects. Similarly, savings expected from increased efficiencies would be lost for only a short time. In addition, VA would defer for a relatively short time the project activation costs, which are estimated at more than $100 million for the Brevard and Travis projects, and the costs associated with providing such new services as air conditioning.

They also said that the proposed replacement medical center at Travis Air Force Base should be fully funded in fiscal year 1996. In addition, they do not believe that the remaining seven projects should be delayed because the projects would correct fire, safety, and environmental deficiencies in some of VA\u2019s most antiquated facilities. They said that without needed attention, fire and safety code violations at these facilities could conceivably result in catastrophic consequences.", "VA officials said that the inference in our report that the planned realignment creates uncertainty in construction needs is misleading. They recognize that the VISN concept is new but do not believe that the planned realignment will preclude the need to upgrade the facilities. Officials in the seven medical centers scheduled for renovation and NCHCS do not believe that the realignment will significantly affect the need for and scope of their projects. The VA officials told us that VA managers recently validated the projects\u2019 consistency with the needs of a network organization and with anticipated facility missions and workloads. These officials believe that veterans will continue to be served at the facilities. They said that any uncertainty about construction needs is created by the uncertain future direction of health care in general, not by VA\u2019s planned realignment.", "Despite these arguments, we continue to believe that the Congress should consider delaying funding for construction of major projects until VA has had time to implement its planned realignment efforts. This implementation is expected to include completing and applying criteria for assessing all alternatives for serving veterans, such as using community or other VA facilities. VA\u2019s planned realignment efforts have merit, and VISN directors need time to determine what changes should be made to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of VA health care delivery.", "We believe that the planned realignment creates uncertainty because it appears to suggest that medical centers may not operate in the future as they do today. However, our review showed that VA determined the medical centers\u2019 construction needs on the basis of the assumption that the centers would continue to operate essentially as they do today. Our concern is that VA may determine, as part of the realignment effort, that services provided by one or more of the facilities could be provided more effectively or efficiently through sharing or contracting with other providers or consolidating with services of other VA medical centers. If the proposed construction projects are under way, VA may continue providing services as usual, even though doing so may be less effective or efficient than other potential service alternatives.", "Delaying construction funding should provide VA the time needed to assess available alternatives to the proposed renovation projects and to reexamine the Travis project in view of the changed circumstances, such as the closure of McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento. If the assessment shows that the facilities would operate for 25 or more years, the projects would be justified. Our position that the proposed Brevard project is unjustified remains unchanged.", "VA officials are concerned that delaying project funding could significantly affect construction award dates. They said that design funds for most projects have already been delayed and have not been approved. Without congressional approval of design funding, no awards of construction document contracts will be made for fiscal year 1996. According to VA officials, this will delay project schedules for at least 1 year. We have revised our \u201cMatter for Congressional Consideration\u201d to clarify that the Congress may wish to make design funds available in fiscal year 1996 for the proposed projects if it wants to avoid significant delays of construction awards for projects that are ultimately justified under VA\u2019s pending assessment criteria. Our observation that delaying project funding until fiscal year 1997 should have a negligible effect on construction award dates for projects if design schedules are met is based on the premise that design funds will be available for the projects in fiscal year 1996.", "VA officials also said that the projects were not intended to correct all the deficiencies at the seven medical centers scheduled for renovation. They said that the size and number of projects in the fiscal year 1996 request were constrained by anticipated budget levels and that VA managers were instructed to limit the size of projects to address only the most pressing patient environment, ambulatory care, and infrastructure needs. Moreover, they said that the six projects involving renovation of inpatient areas purposely affect 50 percent or less of the total inpatient space at most facilities to recognize the downsizing of inpatient care capability.", "We reported that the projects would not correct all deficiencies to discuss the projects in proper perspective\u2014not to criticize VA for failing to make all corrections at once. Appendix II shows that the proposed projects would affect only a fraction of the inpatient beds in most of the facilities scheduled for renovation.
