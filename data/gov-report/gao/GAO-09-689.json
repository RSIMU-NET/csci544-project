The SFF methodology assigns points to deficiencies cited on standard surveys and complaint investigations, and to revisits conducted to ensure that deficiencies have been corrected. CMS uses its methodology periodically to identify candidates for the program--nursing homes with the 15 worst scores in each state--but the program is limited to 136 homes at any point in time because of resource constraints. In 2008, CMS introduced a Five-Star Quality Rating System that draws on the SFF methodology to rank homes from one to five stars. GAO assessed CMS's SFF methodology, applied it on a nationwide basis using statistical scoring thresholds, and adopted several refinements to the methodology. Using this approach, GAO determined (1) the number of most poorly performing homes nationwide, (2) how their performance compared to that of homes identified using the SFF methodology, and (3) the characteristics of such homes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO's estimate, almost 4 percent (580) of the roughly 16,000 nursing homes in the United States could be considered the most poorly performing. These 580 homes overlap somewhat with the 755 SFF Program candidates--the 15 worst homes in each state--and the 136 homes actually selected by states as SFFs. For example, GAO's estimate includes 40 percent of SFF Program candidates and about half of the active SFFs as of December 2008 and February 2009, respectively. Under GAO's estimate, however, the most poorly performing homes are distributed unevenly across states, with 8 states having no such homes and 10 others having from 21 to 52 such homes. CMS has structured the SFF Program so that every state (except Alaska) has at least one SFF even though the worst performing homes in each state are not necessarily the worst performing homes in the nation. To identify the worst homes in the nation, GAO applied CMS's SFF methodology on a nationwide basis using statistical scoring thresholds and made three refinements to that methodology, which strengthened GAO's estimate. The scoring thresholds were (1) necessary because there were no natural break points that delineated the most poorly performing homes from all other nursing homes and (2) conservative, focusing on chronic poor performance generally over a 2- or 3-year period or very poor performance over about 1 year. The most poorly performing homes identified by GAO averaged over 46 percent more serious deficiencies that caused harm to residents and over 19 percent more deficiencies that placed residents at risk of death or serious injury (immediate jeopardy), compared to the 755 SFF Program candidates identified by CMS's approach. GAO's three refinements to CMS's SFF methodology had a moderate effect on the composition of the list of homes that GAO identified as the most poorly performing. First, deficiency points from CMS's Five-Star Quality Rating System were used because they decreased the disparity between immediate jeopardy and lower-level deficiencies, such as those with the potential for more than minimal harm, which compensates somewhat for the understatement of serious deficiencies in some states. Second, homes received extra points when certain actual harm deficiencies occurred in standards areas that CMS categorizes as substandard quality of care, an important change because we found that many homes had at least one such deficiency. Third, the full deficiency history of homes was included. CMS recognizes that its methodology overlooks deficiencies for some homes, which almost always results in scores that are lower than if all deficiencies were included in the scores. GAO found that the most poorly performing nursing homes had notably more deficiencies with the potential for more than minimal harm or higher and more revisits than all other nursing homes. For example, the most poorly performing nursing homes averaged about 56 such deficiencies and 2 revisits, compared to about 20 such deficiencies and less than 1 revisit for all other homes. In addition, the most poorly performing homes tended to be chain affiliated and for-profit and have more beds and residents."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s 1.4 million nursing home residents are a highly vulnerable  population of elderly and disabled individuals who rely on nursing homes  to provide high-quality care.

Nursing homes must meet those  standards in order to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. Our prior  reports have found that some nursing homes are chronically  noncompliant; that is, they have been cited repeatedly by state survey  agencies for serious deficiencies, such as residents having preventable  pressure sores that harmed them or put them at risk of death or serious  injury.

CMS limits the SFF Program to  136 nursing homes nationwide (fewer than 1 percent of nursing homes) at  any point in time because of resource constraints.

The SFF methodology creates a total score for each  nursing home over three cycles by assigning points to (1) deficiencies  cited during the three most recent standard surveys, (2) deficiencies cited  on the last 3 years of complaint investigations, and (3) the number of  revisits surveyors made to ensure that the nursing home had corrected the  deficiencies cited on the three most recent standard surveys. To  determine the adequacy of the SFF methodology, we compared it to other  compliance-based measures of poor performance and tested the sensitivity  of the methodology to variations such as not giving greater weight to  recent poor performance compared to poor performance that occurred in  earlier years. Based on our examinations of the SFF methodology,  document review, and interviews, we concluded that the SFF methodology  is reasonable and comprehensive. Using our assessment of the SFF  methodology, we developed our estimate of the most poorly performing  nursing homes by (1) applying the SFF methodology on a nationwide basis  using statistical scoring thresholds and (2) adopting three refinements that  helped to identify some homes that would otherwise have been missed but  that had a moderate impact on the composition of the list of homes we  identified as the most poorly performing.

We developed a nationwide estimate because the  worst performing nursing homes in some states had high total scores from  a combination of numerous deficiencies, serious deficiencies, and revisits,  while the worst performing nursing homes in other states did not (see   fig. 4). For example, in the preceding three cycles, we found that the  worst performing nursing home in South Dakota had a score of about 68.  The score was composed of 32 deficiencies at the D level or higher, 2 of  which were at the actual harm level (where the highest scope and severity  level was H) and none of which were at the immediate jeopardy level. In  contrast, during the same three cycles, the worst performing nursing home  in Tennessee had a score of about 1,512, with 63 deficiencies at the D level  or higher. Of these deficiencies, 3 were at the actual harm level and 22 at  the immediate jeopardy level (where the highest scope and severity level  was L).

If CMS applied its SFF methodology to  identify the worst 755 homes in the nation rather than the worst 15 in each  state, the home ranked 755 would have a score of about 127; however,   48 percent of the SFF Program candidates had scores below this  threshold. As a result, the SFF Program is missing some of the worst  performing nursing homes in the nation.", "Statistical scoring thresholds. Absent a fixed number of homes per  state, we developed statistical scoring thresholds because there was no  natural break point delineating the most poorly performing nursing homes  from all other homes. The two statistical scoring thresholds we used  were conservative, because they focused on chronic poor performance  and nonchronic, very poor performance.

Our three refinements  to CMS\u2019s SFF methodology had a moderate effect on the composition of  the list of homes we identified as the most poorly performing.", "Deficiency points. We believe that the deficiency points used in the Five- Star System are more appropriate for identifying the most poorly  performing nursing homes nationwide than those used in the SFF  methodology because they compensate somewhat for understatement and  the interstate variation in the citation of serious deficiencies. First, given  the significant disparity between immediate jeopardy (50 to 150 points)  compared to lower-level deficiencies (2 to 6 points for D- through F-level  deficiencies), our use of SFF deficiency points to identify the most poorly  performing nursing homes nationwide might have missed poorly  performing nursing homes in states with significant understatement.  Second, there is considerable interstate variation in the citation of serious  deficiencies, including immediate jeopardy\u2013level deficiencies. For  example, in 2008, about 11.3 percent of deficiencies were at the immediate  jeopardy level in one state, but less than 1.0 percent of deficiencies were  cited at that level in 26 states. The Five-Star System, on average, doubles  the points assigned to deficiencies below the immediate jeopardy level,  giving a D-level deficiency 4 points and a G-level deficiency 20 points,  compared to 2 and 10 points, respectively, using the SFF deficiency  methodology. As a result, using the Five-Star System deficiency points,  homes with numerous D- through I-level deficiencies are more likely to be  identified as the most poorly performing. CMS officials told us that they  planned to evaluate the effect of using the Five-Star System deficiency  points on identifying SFF candidates; our analysis showed that it changed  the composition of SFF Program candidates by an average of about 2.5  candidates per state.", "Substandard quality of care. In comparison with the SFF methodology  and the Five-Star System, we assigned 5 more points to G-level  deficiencies that occurred in any of the three categories of standards that  CMS considers to be SQC. As noted earlier, CMS does not classify any   G-level deficiencies as SQC. Without this modification, an F-level  deficiency in an SQC area is assigned the same number of points as a G- level deficiency even if the G-level deficiency is in an SQC standard\u201410  and 20 points, respectively, under the SFF or Five-Star System  methodologies. (See table 2.) This adjustment was important because  approximately 45 percent of all nursing homes had one or more G-level  deficiencies in an SQC category during the three cycles used for  calculating SFF scores. Therefore, assigning SQC points to G-level  deficiencies had an effect on total scores for the nursing homes, which we  used to determine the most poorly performing homes nationwide, and  would have an effect on the composition of CMS\u2019s SFF candidate list. For  example, about 4 percent of the SFF Program candidates\u2014or less than  one candidate per state on average\u2014would change if CMS assigned SQC  points to G-level deficiencies.", "Technical status changes. While the SFF methodology does not consider  all deficiencies and revisits identified within the three-cycle period that  occurred before the nursing home\u2019s technical status change, we  incorporated the full histories of nursing homes that underwent a  technical status change. At the time of a technical status change, a new  provider identification number is assigned, and the nursing home\u2019s  complete history under the old number is not combined with that of the  new provider number. For example, a nursing home with a status change  on January 1, 2008, might have a compliance history for only 1 year at the  time we did our work instead of the three cycles called for in the SFF  methodology. The SFF scores for nursing homes that have undergone  technical status changes within the last three cycles are almost always  lower than would be the case if three cycles of deficiency history were  included and, therefore, more favorable than would be justified by the  complete history. We found that almost 1 percent of all nursing homes  (148), including 11 of the 580 we identified as the most poorly performing,  had a technical status change during the last three cycles that affected  their SFF scores.

We believe that our estimate is  conservative, because we focused only on those nursing homes with  chronic poor performance over time or with very poor performance in one  survey cycle. Because of resource constraints, CMS limits the size of the  SFF Program, requiring every state except Alaska to select from 1 to 6  homes\u2014an allocation based on the number of nursing homes in each  state\u2014from a list of 15 candidates. The homes selected are not necessarily  the most poorly performing homes in the nation but rather are among the  poorest performers in each state. In contrast, the 580 homes we identified  have more deficiencies at the potential for more than minimal harm level  or higher and more revisits on average than the 755 homes identified as  potential SFF candidates using CMS\u2019s SFF methodology. Our estimate also  revealed that the state-by-state distribution of the most poorly performing  homes nationwide is uneven, calling into question the approach CMS uses  to allocate SFFs across states.", "Furthermore, we believe that CMS\u2019s SFF Program and the Five-Star  System could be strengthened by incorporating the three enhancements  we made to identify the most poorly performing homes nationwide:    First, we adopted the deficiency points that CMS developed for its Five- Star System because they compensate somewhat for understatement and  the interstate variation in the citation of serious deficiencies, an important  consideration for our nationwide estimate of the most poorly performing  nursing homes. Currently, CMS uses a different set of deficiency points for  the SFF methodology, but agency officials told us that they planned to  study the effect of using a common set of numeric points\u2014the Five-Star  System deficiency points\u2014for both methodologies.", "Second, we added points for G-level deficiencies in the three standard  areas that CMS considers to be an indication of SQC. We found that about  4 percent of the SFF candidates\u2014or less than 1 candidate per state, on  average\u2014would change if CMS assigned SQC points to G-level  deficiencies when they were cited in an SQC area. Without such an  adjustment, an F-level deficiency in an SQC area would receive the same  number of deficiency points as a G-level deficiency in the same standard  area. Approximately 45 percent of all nursing homes had one or more   G-level deficiencies in an SQC category during the three cycles used for  calculating SFF scores.", "Third, we incorporated the full compliance history of homes that  underwent technical status changes. For example, a nursing home with a  technical status change on January 1, 2008, might have a compliance  history for only 1 year at the time we did our work instead of the three  cycles called for by the SFF methodology. The SFF scores of homes that  have undergone technical status changes within the last three cycles are  almost always lower than if all three cycles were considered.

Consider using a common set of numeric points for identifying poorly  performing nursing homes by determining the effect of adopting those  associated with the Five-Star System for the SFF methodology. 2.  Assign points to G-level deficiencies in SQC areas equivalent to those  additional points assigned to H- and I-level deficiencies in SQC areas.  3.

In addition, we interviewed officials in all 10 CMS regional  offices and 14 state survey agencies regarding their impressions of the SFF  methodology and also asked the state survey agencies what they consider  to be indicators of poor performance. To ensure that we calculated the  scores for each nursing home consistent with CMS\u2019s SFF methodology, we  obtained a copy of the computer programming that CMS used to score and  rank nursing homes, verified that our use of CMS\u2019s program generated  results that were consistent with output on scores that CMS provided to  states, and used the program as the basis for our estimate of the most  poorly performing nursing homes in the United States. The SFF  methodology creates a total score for each nursing home over three cycles  by assigning points to the following data, which we obtained from   CMS\u2019s On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting system (OSCAR)  database: (1) deficiencies cited on the three most recent standard surveys,  (2) deficiencies cited on the last 3 years of complaint investigations, and  (3) revisits associated with the three most recent standard surveys.  Additional points are assigned to deficiencies classified as substandard  quality of care (SQC). Each cycle consists of one standard survey, revisits  associated with the standard survey, and 12 months of complaint  investigations. We extracted these data from OSCAR in December 2008.", "To learn about methods used to rate nursing home performance, we  interviewed officials of two nursing home associations\u2014the American  Health Care Association and the American Association of Homes and  Services for the Aging, interviewed experts in long-term care research,  attended meetings that CMS held to seek input from long-term care  researchers on the development of the agency\u2019s Five-Star Quality Rating  System (Five-Star System), analyzed information available at CMS\u2019s  Providing Data Quickly Web site, reviewed prior GAO reports, and  interviewed officials from some states with nursing home rating systems.

We found  that those nursing homes with the worst total scores in the nation were  much more likely to have met the criteria for SQC in the last 1, 2, and 3  years compared to all other nursing homes. Similarly, we found that the  same nursing homes were much more likely to have had deficiencies that  could have resulted in the imposition of at least one immediate sanction in  the last 1, 2, and 3 years compared to all other nursing homes.  In addition,  we tested the sensitivity of CMS\u2019s SFF methodology to several variations,  some of which led us to consider making modifications to the  methodology that affected facility scores. For example, in one variation,  we modified the SFF methodology so that the cycle scores were no longer  weighted\u2014CMS began weighting the cycle scores in June 2008. We  concluded from this test that the SFF methodology was sensitive to  weighting, which influenced our decision to impose a requirement in our  scoring thresholds such that the most poorly performing nursing homes  have high scores in at least two of three cycles or a very high score overall.", "Based on our examinations of the SFF methodology, document review,  and interviews, we concluded that the SFF methodology is reasonable and  comprehensive because it uses multiple years of data, includes all  deficiencies as opposed to a subset of deficiencies, includes deficiencies  from standard surveys and complaint investigations, and accounts for the  scope and severity of deficiencies and the number of revisits.

Tukey\u2019s  method is meant to identify the extreme ends of the distribution. It labels  an observation as a potential outlier if its value is greater than the  threshold identified by the following equation:  Potential Outlier Threshold = Q3 + 1.5 * (Q3 \u2013 Q1)  Where: Q3 = 75th percentile and  Q1 = 25th percentile  The range identified by (Q3 \u2013 Q1), called the interquartile range, covers   50 percent of the observations in the center of the distribution.

For each option, we  analyzed the group of resulting nursing homes identified as poor  performers and those missed by the thresholds. As the result of our  examination of the SFF methodology and prior work in which we  classified nursing homes as low, moderately, or high performing, we knew  that nursing homes that have serious deficiencies in one year may not  demonstrate consistent poor performance\u2014what we term chronic poor  performance in this report. Thus, another option we considered was to  identify as a poor performer any nursing home that had a total score that  (1) was above the potential outlier threshold and (2) was also above the  potential outlier threshold for at least two of its three cycle scores. This  option identified 507 nursing homes. Because these nursing homes had  poor performance in at least two of three cycles as well as high total  scores, we concluded that this threshold identified chronic poor  performance. However, we found that when we limited the most poorly  performing nursing homes to this group of chronic poor performers we  missed some nursing homes with very poor performance that was not  chronic. Therefore, we established a second threshold to identify those  very poor performers\u2014those nursing homes that were at or above the   99th percentile\u2014or approximately 330\u2014of total score.
