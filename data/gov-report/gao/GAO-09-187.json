To facilitate these and other equipment management decisions, NASA recently invested $29 million in a new program: the Plant, Property, and Equipment (PP&E) Module--a component of NASA's Integrated Enterprise Management Program. GAO was asked to assess the effectiveness of NASA's processes, systems, and controls for managing its PP&E. This report addresses whether NASA (1) effectively designed controls over steps NASA identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process, including sending equipment to disposal, and (2) implemented policies, controls, and processes to enhance equipment reutilization. To answer these questions, GAO reviewed NASA equipment reutilization policy and conducted on-site visits at five NASA centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Inconsistent descriptions and inaccurate information on the condition of equipment hamper the PP&E Module's ability to produce equipment matches and enhance reutilization. Although descriptions of equipment items are crucial for the new module to succeed in identifying equipment for reutilization, NASA has not provided detailed guidance on what should be included in the description field, leading to widely varying descriptions. For example, the same type of computer server equipment was described as a \"disk array,\" \"disk drive unit,\" and \"storage array unit.\" GAO's physical inspections at two centers found that 83 of the 84 equipment items inspected were incorrectly coded as new and unused in the PP&E Module. These problems may lead to reutilization opportunities being overlooked. Further hampering equipment reutilization is the PP&E Module's lack of detailed equipment availability information. The module does not identify the extent to which each piece of equipment is in use, necessitating a potentially lengthy search process. For example, an end user searching for an oscilloscope could currently have to contact up to 1,700 other end users to determine the availability status of these equipment items. These conditions contribute to inadequate end user utilization of the NASA Property Web interface (N-PROP), the PP&E Module's automated component. N-PROP allows end users to perform online equipment management functions, which NASA anticipated would generate cost savings by facilitating equipment reutilization and eliminating manual processes. However, 98 of the 121 end users who were responsible for equipment selected from a NASA-wide statistical sample stated that they had never used either N-PROP or the prior systems, limiting the potential savings from implementing the new PP&E Module. NASA's existing policies and procedures regarding equipment screenings and annual walk-through inspections--both key controls in the equipment reutilization process--were carried out inconsistently, if at all, at the five centers GAO visited. Without specific guidance on how to implement NASA's equipment screening policy, centers failed to ensure that screenings occurred prior to purchasing new equipment, undermining the purpose of the screenings. Further, NASA does not require users to justify the need to purchase new equipment when a screening has identified equipment available for reutilization. In addition, required walk-through inspections intended to identify idle equipment were not conducted at one center and were ineffective at the other four. Equipment managers did not always follow up to ensure that the PP&E Module was updated and GAO's testing estimated that about 16 percent of NASA's controlled equipment (with a value of at least $230 million) was improperly listed as being actively in use and had been overlooked during annual walk-through inspections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) stands at one  of the most important crossroads it has faced since its inception in 1958.

According to a  September 2008 NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report, it was  anticipated that these features would generate operational cost savings  and reduce unnecessary procurements by facilitating equipment  reutilization, promoting intercenter equipment transfers and loans, and  eliminating manual processes.", "The majority of end users we interviewed\u201498 of 121\u2014stated that they had  never used N-PROP (or the prior systems) to screen equipment for  reutilization. Although this lack of use of N-PROP may be due in part to  the timing of our review, which coincided with initial implementation of  the PP&E Module, these responses also reflect a lack of end user  familiarity with and use of equipment management functions in the prior  systems. In addition, as the NASA OIG reported in September 2008, NASA  took steps to incorporate stakeholders in the requirements development  process of the PP&E Module to ensure that their needs were met.  Stakeholders identified and reviewed project requirements and, during  system development, helped determine whether each portion of the  system would meet their requirements. However, during our site visits we  observed that few end users appeared to be interested in learning about  the new module or taking a greater role in equipment reutilization. The  reasons end users said that they had not used the PP&E Module included  that they (1) had not taken the training NASA has made available on the  new module, (2) were not familiar with the equipment management and  screening features, or (3) had not obtained a password needed to use the  module. Considering the key role that end users need to play in achieving  cost savings through equipment management responsibilities, these facts  indicate that steps taken by NASA to encourage end user participation  may have been insufficient to change end users\u2019 perceptions and  expectations.", "Our interviews further disclosed that a substantial number of end users  did not view equipment management as necessary or important, another  factor that could limit the likelihood that they would use the new module.  Among the reasons that some end users gave for not screening through N- PROP before initiating a new procurement was that they preferred new  equipment; others told us that they viewed existing equipment as  undesirable and unlikely to meet their projects needs and they did not  consider the equipment description and physical condition reported in the  PP&E Module to be reliable, or that they were unfamiliar with the module.  Furthermore, in addition to responding to our interview questions, 29 of  the 121 end users we spoke with volunteered that they had more  important tasks to perform than managing equipment, did not view  property management as a key responsibility in their day-to-day duties, did  not want to learn how to use the module for equipment management, or  were not familiar with or had never heard of the new module.", "End users were not required to use the PP&E Module and most end users  we spoke with had not used the PP&E Module at the time of our visits.  Therefore, property custodians had assumed many equipment  management responsibilities, perpetuating manual procedures that the  new module sought to automate. Because property custodians cannot  accept, receive, or transfer equipment for the end users, they must obtain  the end users\u2019 signatures and submit the documentation to the centers\u2019  logistics property management officials. As we previously reported, the  number of equipment items and end users assigned to each property  custodian can vary widely\u2014with some property custodians responsible  for as many as 4,000 equipment items. According to NASA officials, one  use envisioned for the PP&E Module includes end users negotiating with  each other to work out when to share equipment. This is one of NASA\u2019s  approaches to enhance equipment reutilization, but if many end users are  not using the system this is unlikely to occur. It is unrealistic to expect  property custodians to keep up on the nuances of equipment usage, such  as whether equipment that is used on an episodic basis is currently in use  or not, and therefore they are not in a position to determine whether other  uses could be negotiated. Continuing to rely upon property custodians  rather than focusing efforts to encourage direct end user involvement will  likely reduce the potential savings that NASA intended to achieve through  the PP&E Module by automating manual processes. Therefore, it will be  important that NASA take steps to enhance or provide additional  incentives so that end users recognize the benefits of reutilizing equipment  and encourage them to use the PP&E Module to identify potential matches  and negotiate with other users to help NASA increase equipment  reutilization. Steps to enhance end user participation could include setting  performance expectations for end users, setting equipment reutilization  goals by program or project, tracking agency performance measures on  equipment reutilization, providing awards and recognition to highlight  effective reutilization practices, emphasizing available N-PROP training,  and including goals for equipment reutilization in Senior Executive Service  contracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NASA Has Not Implemented Effective Policies and Detailed Procedures to Enhance Equipment Reutilization", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s existing policies and procedures related to equipment reutilization  were either not being carried out or were being carried out inconsistently  at the five centers we visited.

One problem was that NASA has not required uniform  implementation of a PP&E Module feature that officials from two of the  five centers we visited were unaware of, and thus were not using. This  feature was designed to suspend new procurements until the screening  process has been completed. Another problem was that the five centers  we visited were not following up to see if end users were purchasing new  equipment in lieu of reutilizing equipment items identified during  screening. One center did not have a designated center equipment  screener to conduct searches. Another center made equipment  procurements regardless of the outcome of the screening process. For  example, an equipment screener at one of the centers identified a digital  oscilloscope\u2014an instrument commonly used at NASA for testing\u2014that  was available at another center. However, upon notifying the purchaser  that a potential equivalent oscilloscope was available, the screener was  told that the requester preferred to purchase a new oscilloscope. In  another case, upon notifying a purchaser who had requested a  spectrometer\u2014test equipment\u2014that six equivalent spectrometers were  located, the screener was told that new equipment had already been  purchased. As a result, the screening process failed to prevent the  procurement of new equipment when equivalent equipment was available.", "Although the other three centers were using the procurement suspension  control function to ensure screening, the equipment screener for one  center told us that only NASA contractor equipment requests were  screened, rather than all new procurements. Furthermore, we found that  NASA\u2019s Logistics Management Division lacked the oversight to ensure that  this required screening occurs. At the time of our visits, 124 of 220  equipment end users and property custodians stated that they had never  requested a screening through the property disposal officer or center  equipment manager or used the PP&E Module or its predecessor\u2014 NEMS\u2014to screen existing equipment before initiating and processing a  request to purchase equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA-Wide Implementing Procedures for Walk- Through Inspections Are Not Sufficient to Ensure Consistent Performance", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our visits the five NASA centers were not conducting  required annual walk-through inspections consistently, and sometimes not  at all. According to NASA equipment management policy, the annual walk- through inspections are intended to identify equipment that is not being  used or is no longer needed for ongoing NASA programs or projects, and  can be made available for utilization in another program or NASA center  or transferred to disposal. At each NASA center, the division director or  equivalent organization head is responsible for ensuring that his or her  staff conduct annual walk-through inspections. After staff complete an  annual walk-through inspection, the division director is required to  prepare and send a written memorandum, documenting the results of the  inspection, to the center\u2019s supply equipment management officer. In  addition, the center equipment manager is required to ensure that the  PP&E Module is updated to reflect the results of the inspection.", "One of the five centers we visited did not conduct these required  inspections and the other four did so in varying manners and to varying  degrees. For example, none of the centers maintain sufficient  documentation to determine whether the PP&E Module was updated to  reflect the results of the walk-through inspections, thus offering no  assurance that this control was effective. At two of these four centers,  directors prepared memorandums to document the results of the annual  walk-through inspections that outlined the equipment items\u2019 names and  equipment control numbers and what specific actions were needed. At the  remaining two centers, directors documented that walk-through  inspections were performed, but not the detailed results of the  inspections. All four center equipment managers told us that they did not  follow up to ensure that the equipment management system\u2014either NEMS  or the PP&E Module\u2014was updated to reflect the changes identified by the  inspections. And none of the centers maintained any evidence to show  when the property system was updated, if it was updated at all.", "Because of these inconsistencies, NASA was unable to demonstrate  whether the annual walk-through inspections met their objectives. Our  testing of equipment in NASA\u2019s legacy NEMS (as of September 30, 2007)  estimated that about 16 percent of NASA\u2019s controlled equipment (with a  value of at least $230 million) was improperly listed as being actively in  use in an ongoing program, and had been overlooked during annual walk- through inspections. In accordance with NASA equipment management  policy, this equipment should have been identified as excess or  underutilized and made available for reutilization or disposal. We selected  our sample in April 2008, before the PP&E Module\u2019s implementation. All  equipment in our sample was transferred from NEMS to the PP&E Module,  including the sample items that were inaccurately described as actively in  use. Table 1 contains examples of equipment that we identified during our  visits to the five centers during the months of May through July 2008 that  was inaccurately reported in NASA\u2019s NEMS as actively used by a NASA  program or project.", "We did not assess whether any of the above equipment could have been  reutilized to avoid the purchase of new equipment because NASA could  not provide this information. However, these items should have been  identified during prior annual walk-through inspections and the property  management systems should have been updated to reflect that this  equipment was not being used. Correctly following NASA policy in this  area would have increased the chance that the equipment could have been  reutilized by other end users. In addition, NASA officials reported that in  fiscal year 2008, the agency reinstituted performing compensating controls  reviews, which are designed to evaluate the adequacy and consistency of  NASA policy execution and procedural compliance with NASA guidance.

Given NASA\u2019s current and projected budget constraints, cutting costs  through equipment reutilization and improved equipment management  efficiencies will be critical if it is to free up vital resources for other  mission-related objectives. Unfortunately, ineffective controls over  equipment reutilization and limited utilization of the new system may  prevent the PP&E Module from fully delivering on its potential cost  savings. These shortcomings may prevent the PP&E Module from  providing NASA employees and contractors with the tools needed to make  informed decisions regarding the disposal or reutilization of equipment,  including over 1.2 million types of equipment if the space shuttle is retired  in 2010 and NASA transitions to its new space exploration policy as  planned.", "Strong leadership will be critical to promoting and enforcing existing  equipment reutilization requirements, emphasizing the need for better  equipment accountability, and stressing the importance of reutilizing  equipment. Strengthening NASA-wide oversight and monitoring controls  and processes could help NASA managers more effectively oversee  NASA\u2019s compliance with its policies and procedures.

NASA did not concur with our recommendation to  modify the PP&E Module to capture information on the anticipated and  actual usage (availability) of equipment assigned to end users at the time  the equipment is accepted and provide a mechanism to ensure that this  information is updated as appropriate. NASA stated that records for  equipment in the PP&E Module reside within the Equipment Master  Record (EMR) module and are listed as \u201cactive.\u201d NASA\u2019s further stated  that because NASA\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d equipment is now visible NASA-wide, there  is no need to design and implement a separate status category for  equipment listed in the EMR. Further, it stated that this current level of  \u201cactive\u201d equipment visibility provides the opportunity for programmatic,  technical, and scientific experts to discuss possible reuse through loans or  borrowing, coordinating through their property custodians or equipment  managers.", "We continue to believe that not also including information in the PP&E  Module on the availability of equipment (the extent to which \u201cactive\u201d  equipment is used, or is likely to be used) will present a barrier to effective  and efficient equipment reutilization. Specifically, because the module  does not identify the extent to which each piece of equipment is being, or  is likely to be, used, such as on a weekly or monthly basis, potential end  users must perform a potentially lengthy search by contacting other  equipment end users to determine the extent to which their \u201cactive\u201d  equipment is available for utilization. For some types of equipment  commonly used in NASA, the potential users one would need to contact to  research actual availability of equipment listed as \u201cactive\u201d could number in  the hundreds. This potentially labor-intensive research may serve as a  disincentive for users to try to identify when they could share equipment  rather than purchase new equipment.", "Moreover, as discussed in our draft, our review identified some equipment  in storage that NASA listed as actively in use.

We also obtained and reviewed NASA  equipment management policy and procedural guidance for screening  existing equipment inventory; performing annual walk-through  inspections; and managing, reutilizing, and disposing of equipment. To  enhance our understanding of NASA\u2019s process for ensuring maximum  utilization of equipment, we conducted walk-throughs at five NASA  centers where our sample equipment items were assigned: Goddard Space  Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Langley  Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center. We interviewed NASA  officials responsible for equipment management and reutilization,  including the Director of the Logistics Management Division, Logistics  Management Division management analysts, asset managers, agency  equipment program managers, and supply equipment management officers  at headquarters and at each of the five NASA centers we visited and  warehouse officials, property disposal officers, center equipment  managers, center equipment screeners, property managers, property  custodians, procurement officials, equipment end users, and officials from  the Office of the Chief Financial Officer.", "To determine the accuracy of the equipment recorded as \u201cactive\u201d in the  NASA Equipment Management System (NEMS) database at the time we  started our review, we selected a random probability sample of all  equipment in NEMS, with an availability status code of \u201cactive.\u201d We  obtained data from NEMS as of September 30, 2007, and identified 299,386  equipment items with availability status code \u201cA\u201d or \u201cactive,\u201d representing  the sample universe. Based on previous audit work regarding the  reliability assessment of NASA\u2019s accounting and property data, we  determined if inactive equipment was erroneously coded as active in  NEMS. We tested the random probability sample of 160 transactions, from  five NASA centers, from the population of transactions with the  availability status code \u201cA\u201d to determine the accuracy of the recorded  availability status code. NASA implemented its new Property, Plant, and  Equipment (PP&E) Module on May 19, 2008. To ensure that the sample  transactions we extracted from the legacy system were transferred and  recorded in the PP&E Module, we traced each sample item to the PP&E  Module, and verified that the sample transactions were transferred and  recorded in the module. However, we did not determine whether all legacy  system transactions were recorded in the PP&E Module, nor did we  review or assess whether NASA followed best practices in designing and  implementing the PP&E Module.", "We selected a two-stage cluster sample with probability proportional to  size with replacement at the first stage of selection. At the first stage, we  selected eight NASA centers (clusters) with the probabilities of selection  being proportional to the number of pieces of equipment each center had  in the database (i.e., the larger centers had a better chance of being  selected in the sample). Each time a center was selected, it was returned  to the sample universe and given an additional chance of being selected.  Therefore, it was possible for a center to be selected more than one time  in the sample. We sampled eight clusters that yielded five distinct NASA  centers.", "At the second stage, we selected a simple random sample of 20 pieces of  equipment, independently for each time a center was selected at the first  stage. The total sample size of items is 160 (8 clusters of 20 items per  cluster). Table 2 shows the description of the sample population and total  number of sample of transactions.", "Because we selected a sample of equipment, our results are estimates of  the population and thus are subject to sample errors that are associated  with samples of this size and type. Our confidence in the precision of the  results from this sample is expressed in 95 percent confidence intervals,  which are expected to include the actual results in 95 percent of the  samples of this type. We used a ratio estimator to generate estimates of the  proportion and the total dollar amounts associated with equipment that  were inaccurate and calculated a one-sided 95 percent confidence lower  bound. Based on our sample results we estimate that about 16 percent (the  95 percent confidence interval ranges from 10 to 26 percent) of the  equipment with availability status code \u201cA\u201d in the NEMS database as of  September 30, 2007, was miscoded. Further, we are 95 percent confident  that this miscoded equipment represents at least 2 percent of the total  dollar amount of the equipment in NEMS with availability status code \u201cA,\u201d  or at least $230 million. We also traced each sample item to the PP&E  Module to verify that the sample transactions were transferred and  recorded in the module.

Lack of common data fields, missing information such as equipment\u2019s  model and manufacturer, and the lack of clear and consistent descriptions  prevented us from comparing fiscal year 2007 equipment purchase  transactions to NASA\u2019s disposal activity; this prevented us from identifying  instances and dollar values where NASA purchased new equipment rather  than reutilizing available equipment.", "To determine the extent to which NASA\u2019s planning and initial  implementation of the new PP&E Module addressed problems and control  weaknesses we identified in NASA\u2019s reutilization of equipment, we  reviewed and analyzed NASA equipment management policy and  procedural guidance for the PP&E Module and module implementation  and planning documents, including briefings and overviews of PP&E  Module requirements.
