At the federal level, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) uses a  computer model known as the Highway Economic Requirements System  (HERS) to estimate the future investment required to maintain and improve  the nation\u2019s highways. DOT reports the results of this analysis to the  Congress on a biennial basis. However, state governments make a large  number of highway infrastructure investment decisions. States currently  use a variety of analytic tools to make these decisions. Interest in using  HERS at the state level has grown. Two states\u2014Indiana and Oregon\u2014are  already using customized versions of the model, and in December 2000,  FHWA began a pilot project to test its state-level version of HERS, called  HERS-ST, with interested states.", "The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) directed GAO  to evaluate and report to the Congress on the extent to which the HERS  model can be used to provide states with useful information for their  planning efforts. Accordingly, this report describes (1) why FHWA  developed a state-level HERS model, (2) how FHWA is making the state- level HERS model available to states, (3) how states expect to use the  model, and (4) how FHWA could improve the model, including  improvements already planned and additional changes that might increase  the state-level HERS model\u2019s usefulness, including the incorporation of  additional data. To address these issues, we built on our June 2000 report,  which focused on the federal HERS model, by reviewing documentation  for the federal and state-level models and interviewing the models\u2019  developers and managers. We interviewed FHWA officials about the HERS- ST pilot project. In addition, to identify how states might use the HERS-ST  model, we first randomly selected 8 states from a list of 16 states that  initially volunteered to participate in FHWA\u2019s pilot project. For each of the  selected states, we asked state transportation officials to identify how they  plan to use the HERS-ST model and how, based on their current  understanding, the model might be improved. Finally, to draw on the  experiences that Indiana and Oregon have had with other state-level HERS  models, we interviewed transportation officials from these states about  changes that could be made to the HERS-ST model\u2019s assumptions and data  to improve the usefulness of the model.

In developing its portion of the report,  FHWA bases its estimates of investment requirements for most highways  on the Highway Economic Requirements System (HERS) computer model.  Before using the HERS model, FHWA used an engineering model that  compared highway conditions with engineering standards, identified  deficiencies, and calculated investment needs by totaling the costs of fixing  all the deficiencies. In contrast, the HERS model compares the relative  costs and benefits associated with potential highway improvements, such  as widening or resurfacing, to identify those that are economically justified.  The HERS model begins by assessing the current condition of the highway  sections in its database. It then projects the future condition and  performance of the highway sections on the basis of expected changes in  factors such as traffic, pavement condition, and average vehicle speed.  (See fig. 1.) The model identifies deficient highway sections, ranks  improvements by economic merit (benefits exceeding costs), and then  selects improvements. Benefits considered include reductions in factors  like travel time, vehicle operating costs, accidents, and vehicle emissions  over the lifetime of the improvement, while costs considered include the  capital expenditures required to construct the improvement.", "The total cost of constructing selected improvements represents the future  investment requirement for highways included in the HERS model. FHWA  can calculate these costs on the basis of several different scenarios. For  example, under the \u201ceconomic efficiency\u201d scenario, the model selects and  implements all the improvements for which benefits exceed costs. Under  the \u201cmaintain current (pavement) conditions\u201d scenario, the HERS model  selects and implements the least costly mix of improvements that would  maintain average pavement conditions. Under a third scenario, designed to  address road congestion, the HERS model selects the least costly  improvements that would maintain current travel times.", "To run the HERS model, FHWA uses highway condition and performance  data that each state collects and annually updates on a sample of highway  sections representing different highway classes. The highway sections  range in length from 1 block to 10 miles. States are to report detailed  highway data for sampled highway sections. The data include information  on highway capacity, traffic volume, pavement roughness, lane widths, and  other physical characteristics. In addition to collecting these data, the  states develop forecasts of traffic growth for each section.", "We reviewed the HERS model and reported in June 2000 that HERS  provided the Congress with a more useful and realistic estimate of needed  highway improvements than earlier models had. In particular, we found  that a major strength of the model is its ability to assess the relative  benefits and costs associated with making alternative highway  improvements. In addition, an expert panel of economists and engineers  from the public and private sectors convened by FHWA in June 1999 found  that FHWA has strengthened HERS over time and that recent refinements  have increased the model\u2019s applicability and credibility. Nonetheless, we  found that the HERS model also has some limitations. First, since the  model analyzes each highway section independently rather than the entire  transportation system as a whole, it cannot reflect how changes in one part  of the system might affect another part of the system, such as how traffic  might be redistributed as improvements are made. Second, the HERS  model uses a computational \u201cshortcut\u201d to approximate the lifetime benefits  associated with an improvement. Several transportation modeling experts  have questioned whether this approach reasonably approximates future  benefits. Third, because the HERS model is not designed to quantify the  uncertainties associated with its methods, assumptions, and data, the  model cannot estimate the full range of uncertainty within which its  estimates vary. Finally, the model excludes certain classes of the nation\u2019s  highways from its analysis, meaning that FHWA must use alternate  methods to forecast investment needs for these classes of highways.", "Like FHWA, state departments of transportation undertake planning and  reporting activities to manage their highways and determine their capital  needs. For example, under federal transportation planning requirements,  states must carry out a process for considering the effect of transportation  projects on a variety of factors, including the economy and the  environment. States are also required to develop both long-range plans  covering at least 20 years and transportation improvement programs (state  investment plans) that cover at least 3 years. These requirements help  ensure that state transportation projects come from a systematic planning  process rather than from a \u201cwish list\u201d of transportation projects. To meet  these planning and reporting requirements, some state DOTs have had to  rely on their technical capabilities. Many states have developed pavement  management systems to help them systematically analyze data on existing  highways and project future pavement needs. For example, several states  have used models, based on pavement engineering criteria, to analyze  pavement needs either at the project level or for a whole statewide  network. Some states have also adopted a predecessor of the HERS model  developed by FHWA, called the Analytic Process model, that compares  highway conditions with engineering criteria to identify potential  improvements.", "After FHWA developed the HERS model, two states contracted to have  customized state-level HERS models developed for them. Oregon DOT,  when updating its long-range statewide highway plan, hired the same  consultant that had produced HERS for FHWA. That consultant  recommended that Oregon DOT use a customized version of the HERS  model for its statewide plan. Similarly, when Indiana DOT engaged the  same consultant for a corridor planning study, the consultant  recommended that Indiana DOT use a customized version of the HERS  model for its corridor planning analysis. Indiana DOT subsequently used its  model\u2019s results to draft a new statewide highway plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Developed the HERS-ST Model as an Investment Analysis Tool for Highway Planning at the State Level", "paragraphs": ["After its positive experience with the national-level HERS model and the  model\u2019s successful adaptation in Oregon and Indiana, FHWA began to  formally develop HERS-ST in 1999.

FHWA officials also said that the HERS model\u2019s  benefit-cost approach complies with an executive order that requires  federal spending for infrastructure to be based on a systematic analysis of  expected benefits and costs.

Oregon officials cite their HERS model\u2019s effective use of benefit- cost analysis as a foundation for determining the best combination of  improvements and for allocating resources between programs. Oregon  officials have found these benefit-cost results useful for highway planning,  corridor planning, and goal setting. For example, when analyzing the 1999  Oregon Highway Plan (an element of the required long-range plan), state  officials evaluated investment tradeoffs between system preservation  projects\u2014capital projects that ensure that a highway continues to serve its  intended purpose\u2014and modernization projects\u2014capital projects that  typically increase capacity. Oregon\u2019s report said that this analysis helped  the Oregon Transportation Commission gain a clear picture of the  condition of the highway system under different funding scenarios and thus  helped the Commission make difficult investment decisions. (See app. II  for information on the technical features of the Oregon model.)", "Indiana\u2019s DOT sought out a modified version of the HERS model in an  attempt to improve its planning process and, more specifically, to  strengthen its technical planning tools. Indiana officials wanted a model  that would analyze benefits and costs for all of the state\u2019s highway projects,  and they decided that a modified version of the HERS model would meet  their needs. These officials used their HERS model to analyze highway  investment needs over a 25-year period, including a comparison of the  status of the highway system at different levels of funding. In addition,  Indiana officials used their model to analyze highway investment needs at  the district level within the state. The Indiana model has a unique feature  that links specific model results with a geographic information system  (GIS) that visually displays results on state highway maps. This feature  allows the staff to compare district offices\u2019 and metropolitan planning  organizations\u2019 priorities with the ones the model identifies. (See app. II for  information on the technical features of the Indiana model.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Developed the HERS-ST Model to Help States Plan and Manage Their Highways", "paragraphs": ["After FHWA officials reviewed their positive experience with HERS, along  with the positive experiences of Oregon and Indiana with their customized  HERS models, they decided to consider developing a HERS model that all  states could use. FHWA\u2019s Office of Asset Management commissioned two  studies to identify the potential role of a HERS model in helping states  assess their highway investment needs and develop state highway plans.  The studies demonstrated a potential state interest in a state-level HERS  model. Therefore, FHWA developed a prototype state model, HERS-ST,  from the national-level HERS model that any state could use for planning  and programming activities. FHWA officials believe that states could use  the HERS-ST model to perform benefit-cost analysis on highway  improvements and to forecast the future condition and performance of  state highway systems. In addition, the Office of Asset Management\u2019s Asset  Management Primer explains that HERS-ST has the potential to help  state-level policy makers address resource allocation questions because  the model can analyze \u201cwhat if\u201d questions using specific funding levels. For  example, the model can show the long-term effects that different levels of  spending or different emphases in investment could have on the condition  and performance of highways. The primer also states that the model may  even help some states meet new Government Accounting Standards Board  provisions requiring states to report the cost of maintaining their  transportation infrastructure assets.", "The HERS-ST model that FHWA developed is based on and operates in  much the same way as the national-level HERS model, with a few  noteworthy differences. Like the HERS model, HERS-ST (1) projects the  future condition and performance of a state\u2019s highway system, (2) assesses  whether any highway improvements are warranted, and (3) selects  appropriate improvements using benefit-cost analysis. One difference  between the HERS and HERS-ST models is that the HERS-ST model has an  \u201coverride\u201d feature that allows a state official to override highway  improvement selections made by the model in order to reflect specific,  local conditions. According to FHWA officials, the model\u2019s override feature  will enable state officials to apply specific knowledge about highway  improvements (such as whether implementing a particular improvement is  feasible) that may not be reflected in the model\u2019s database. For example, an  official might specify that the model reconstruct a highway section rather  than resurface it because of problems with the underlying structure of the  pavement that are not yet apparent from measurements of the pavement\u2019s  roughness. The override feature is unique to the HERS-ST model. Another  difference is that the HERS-ST model is capable of providing detailed  results about each of the highway sections it analyzes, including  information on the particular improvement selected, the expected future  condition of the section, and the benefits and costs of making the  improvement. By contrast, the HERS model generates only summary  results for the classes of roads it analyzes.", "In addition to these differences between the two models, the HERS-ST  model offers states further options regarding what data to consider. State  officials can adjust the HERS-ST model to reflect state conditions by, for  example, using state highway construction costs rather than national  average costs. And state officials may use HERS-ST either to analyze the  statistical sample of their state\u2019s highways included in FHWA\u2019s Highway  Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database or, if they have the  appropriate data, to analyze all highway sections in the state\u2019s system.  While the HERS model could also analyze all highway sections, it is  currently limited to analyzing only the sample of sections in the HPMS  database. When the HERS-ST model\u2019s projections are based on sampled  sections in the HPMS database, the projections may not account for all the  highways for which a state department of transportation is responsible.  However, the state can, if it has appropriate data on all its highway  sections, use the HERS-ST model to analyze every section in the state  highway system, as Oregon and Indiana did with their customized HERS  models.

Officials from five of these states believe this would  help the states prioritize projects and maximize the effect of their spending.  An official in one state said that the state\u2019s highway funding depends, in  part, on a study of infrastructure needs.

In addition, the HERS model performs its  analysis using several submodels representing specific highway processes,  including traffic growth, pavement wear, vehicle speed, accidents, and  highway improvement costs. The analysis, which is based on the current  condition of the highway system, is conducted over four 5-year periods, for  a total of 20 years. The HERS model draws information from the database  and analysis from the submodels to identify deficient sections, evaluate  alternative improvement options, and select and implement improvements.  HERS uses benefit-cost ratios (benefits divided by costs) to evaluate and  select improvements under several investment scenarios that FHWA  developed. The benefits include reductions in travel times, vehicle  operating costs, and agency maintenance, while the costs include the  capital expenditures necessary to construct the improvement. The model  reports its results in a series of tables showing the cost of improvements  needed to support the model\u2019s investment decisions for each highway class  and funding period analyzed.", "The HERS model has several strengths:  The model\u2019s major strength is its ability to assess the relative benefits  and costs associated with alternative options for making improvements  on the nation\u2019s highways. The HERS model selects for implementation  only those improvements that are economically justified according to its  analysis, a significant improvement over FHWA\u2019s previous methods,  which used engineering standards to identify deficiencies and select  improvements without regard to economic merit.", "Another strength of the HERS model is that FHWA has consulted with  experts in order to assess the model\u2019s reasonableness and improve it.  For example, in June 1999, FHWA convened an expert panel consisting  of economists and engineers from the public and private sectors. This  panel found that FHWA has strengthened the model over time and that  the recent refinements have increased its applicability and credibility.", "The HERS model has some limitations:  First, because the HERS model analyzes each highway section  independently rather than the entire transportation network, it cannot  completely reflect changes occurring among all highways and modes in  the transportation network at the same time. For example, it will not  reflect how, as improvements are made, traffic might be redistributed  from other existing highway sections to an improved highway section.  By incorporating price elasticity into the model, FHWA officials assume  that the model captures the net effect of all changes in the  transportation network as well as in the overall economy. Although the  implication of this limitation is unclear (it may over- or under-state the  effect of changes in traffic resulting from a highway improvement),  explicitly modeling the entire transportation network is not possible  with the current state of the art in modeling or available data.", "Second, because the HERS model is not designed to quantify the  uncertainty associated with its methods, assumptions, and data, the  model cannot estimate the full range of uncertainty within which its  estimates vary. As a result, the precision of the model\u2019s estimates is  unknown. The HERS model\u2019s estimates rely on a variety of estimating  techniques and hundreds of variables, all of which are subject to some  uncertainty. However, changing the model to fully account for  uncertainty in its factors is not likely to be cost-effective because it  could require extensive and expensive reprogramming. We  recommended in our June 2000 report that FHWA clarify, when  publishing the results of HERS model analyses, that there is uncertainty  associated with the results. State-level users can account for some  uncertainty by conducting \u201csensitivity analyses\u201d to measure how much  the model estimates change when the values of certain key inputs or  assumptions used in the model are changed.", "Third, the HERS model uses a computational \u201cshortcut\u201d to approximate  the lifetime benefits associated with an improvement. Conceptually,  benefits such as reductions in travel time accrue over each  improvement\u2019s full lifetime, 20 years or more. However, in its initial  evaluation of whether to improve a highway section, the HERS model  calculates benefits only during the first 5-year period. To account for the  benefits accruing after the first 5-year period, FHWA developed a  shortcut that essentially uses an estimate of the improvement\u2019s  construction cost as a proxy for the improvement\u2019s remaining future  benefits. FHWA developed the shortcut several years ago, when  limitations in computer processing power necessitated simplifying some  of the calculations. Given recent improvements in computing power,  FHWA officials plan to modify the HERS model to account for lifetime  benefits and see correcting the shortcut as a potential improvement for  the HERS-ST model as well.", "Fourth, although FHWA has taken steps to ensure that the data used in  the HERS model are reasonable, some of these data vary in quality. For  example, the model uses emissions data that may not be representative  of actual conditions. To estimate the emissions associated with traffic  on a given section, the model uses information from the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) on emissions rates per vehicle type and speed.  Vehicle emissions, however, may depend more on how the vehicle is  driven than on the total miles driven. FHWA officials told GAO they will  update these data once EPA finishes revising its emissions data. In  addition, we reported earlier that the pavement roughness data reported  by the states to FHWA are not comparable, partly because the states use  different devices and approaches for measuring roughness. The HERS  model uses the roughness data in projecting the pavement condition of  each section. FHWA is supporting efforts to standardize states\u2019  pavement roughness measurements. Moreover, some information used  in the model is dated. For example, the pavement resurfacing costs used  in the HERS model are based on 1988 data (adjusted for inflation from  1988 to 1997). FHWA officials said they plan to update the HERS model\u2019s  resurfacing costs, and the HERS-ST model offers users the option of  introducing their own construction cost data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HERS Model Used in Oregon", "paragraphs": ["The Oregon Department of Transportation obtained the first customized  HERS model in 1998.

By contrast, the  HERS model generates only aggregate results for classes of roads.", "Both the HERS-ST and the HERS models also use data from studies of  the national economy. However, the state user can modify some of these  data to reflect conditions in his or her state. For example, both models  count as a benefit any reduction in travel time brought about by a  highway improvement. In making this calculation, FHWA uses average  national hourly compensation data from the Department of Labor\u2019s  Bureau of Labor Statistics to quantify the dollar value of travel time  saved by travelers on work-related trips. In the HERS-ST model, the  state user could substitute state-level data to derive an alternative  estimate of travel time savings.", "The HERS-ST model also offers the state user a choice between analyzing a  statistical sample of highways represented in FHWA\u2019s HPMS database or  the option of analyzing all highway sections in the state\u2019s system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Use of the HERS Model", "paragraphs": ["While the HERS-ST model pilot project is FHWA\u2019s first attempt to promote  state use of a HERS model, the agency previously released copies of the  HERS model.
