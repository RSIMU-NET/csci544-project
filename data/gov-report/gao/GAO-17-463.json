Of these programs, nine describe early learning or child care as an explicit purpose and are administered by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (Education), and the Interior (Interior). Fiscal year 2015 obligations for these nine programs totaled approximately $15 billion, with the vast majority of these funds concentrated in Head Start and the Child Care and Development Fund. An additional 35 programs did not have an explicit early learning or child care purpose, but permitted funds to be used for these services. Additionally, three tax expenditures subsidized individuals' private purchase of child or dependent care.", "As GAO found in 2012, some early learning and child care programs are fragmented, overlap, or have potential for duplication. Specifically:", "Fragmentation. The federal investment in early learning and child care is fragmented in that it is administered through multiple agencies.", "Overlap. Some programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose overlap, given that they target similar beneficiaries, such as low-income children, or engage in similar activities. However, these programs often have different goals and administrative structures.", "Duplication. Some programs are potentially duplicative because they may fund similar types of services for similar populations. However, the extent to which actual duplication exists is difficult to assess due to differing program eligibility requirements and data limitations.", "HHS and Education have helped address these conditions through improved agency coordination, particularly by following leading practices for interagency collaboration. For example, in response to needed actions GAO identified in 2012, HHS and Education expanded membership of their inter-departmental workgroup on young children to include other agencies with early learning and child care programs. The agencies have also documented their agreements, dedicated staff time to promote the goals and activities of this inter-departmental workgroup, and issued joint policy statements. The resulting improvement in coordination has helped mitigate the effects of fragmentation and overlap.", "HHS, Education, and Interior use different methods to assess performance for the nine programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose. These agencies collect performance information through various combinations of performance monitoring, program evaluations or studies, and other information, such as grantee-submitted reports. In addition, they collect performance information that aligns with program objectives, and many programs examine common aspects of performance. However, the specific results agencies assess differ for a number of reasons. For example, some programs assess children only while they receive services, while others assess later impacts on children."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report.

We limited our review to  programs for which federal funds were obligated in fiscal year 2015, the  most recent available obligations data at the time we conducted our work.  We did not conduct a separate legal review to identify and analyze  relevant programs or verify the accuracy of the information agencies  provided to us.", "To address our first objective, we started with the list of 45 programs and  5 tax expenditures in our 2012 review. We sent questionnaires to nine  agencies and one regional commission included in the 2012 review and  received responses from them all. We conducted follow-up interviews  with agency officials to confirm that these programs and tax expenditures  continued to meet all three of our criteria in fiscal year 2015. We also  reviewed supplementary information, such as information from annual  reports and program notices in the Federal Register, from the  Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human Services  (HHS), the Interior (Interior), and all the other agencies included in our  prior review. After we created a preliminary list of programs, we counted  the number of federal early learning and child care programs by  examining the key benefits and services they provide. Using a similar  definition as in our prior review, we considered a program to have an  explicit early learning or child care purpose if, according to our analysis,  early learning or child care is specifically described as a program purpose  in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) or in agency  documents. We categorized all other programs included in this review as  not having an explicit early learning or child care purpose. In this review,  we also included tax expenditures that could be used to subsidize families  or employers for early learning or child care related expenses. After we  identified programs and tax expenditures that met our criteria, we  obtained information about fiscal year 2015 program obligations from the  President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2017.

For  example, workforce participation among mothers with children age 5 and  under has generally increased since the 1970s. In addition, initiatives to  expand access to preschool have developed at the local, state, and  federal level. Federal support for early learning and child care has  developed gradually in response to emerging needs. Historically, early  learning and child care programs existed separately with separate goals:  early learning programs focused on preparing young children for school,  while child care programs subsidized the cost of child care for low-income  parents who worked or engaged in work-related activities. Over time, the  distinction between these two types of programs has blurred somewhat  as policymakers seek to make educationally enriching care available to  more young children.", "In addition to costs paid by parents, multiple levels of government  contribute funding to support early learning and child care through a  loosely connected system of private and public programs. Public  financing for early learning and child care in the United States involves  multiple funding streams and programs at the federal, state, and local  level. A portion of federal support for child care is provided through  funding to states, which in turn provide subsidies to low-income families.  Within the parameters of federal law, regulations, and guidance, states  generally determine their own specific policies concerning the  administration of these funds, including who is eligible to receive  subsidies, the amount of the subsidies, and the standards that programs  must meet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that different agencies administer the array of  federal early learning and child care programs.

Agencies may use  different methods to assess the performance of programs. Performance  measurement focuses on whether a program has achieved its objectives,  expressed as measureable standards, while program evaluations typically  examine a broader range of information on program performance and its  context.

The federal investment in early  learning and child care includes three broad categories of programs:  1.  Programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose:  For these programs, early learning or child care is specifically  described as a program purpose, according to our analysis of the  CFDA and agency documents. This may include some programs that  also serve children older than 5 or provide some services outside a  formal early learning or child care setting. The Child Care and  Development Fund (CCDF), which provides subsidies to low-income  working families, is an example of a program in this category.  2.  Programs without an explicit early learning or child care  purpose: These programs may provide or support early learning or  child care; however, early learning or child care is not specifically  described as a program purpose in the CFDA or agency documents.  According to agency officials, these programs permit, but do not  require, using funds for these services. Programs in this category  include multipurpose block grants; programs that permit funds to be  used for early learning or child care as an ancillary service; and  programs that support early learning or child care through food,  materials, or other services. Examples of programs without an explicit  early learning or child care purpose include Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families (TANF), the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act Adult program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program.  3.  Tax expenditures that subsidize child care through the tax code:  These include tax credits and exclusions that subsidize the private  purchase of child care. Tax credits allow eligible individuals or  employers to reduce their tax liability dollar for dollar. The credits  included in this review are nonrefundable and do not offer benefits to  individuals or businesses with no tax liability. Exclusions allow  individuals to exclude certain compensation from their taxable income  and generally provide larger tax savings to those taxed at higher  rates. The revenue that the government forgoes through tax  expenditures can be viewed as spending channeled through the tax  system, which contributes to the overall federal investment. The  credit for child and dependent care expenses is an example of such a  tax expenditure.", "Within this framework, we identified 9 programs that have an explicit early  learning or child care purpose and another 35 programs that do not have  an explicit early learning or child care purpose. In addition to these  federally funded programs, we identified three federal tax expenditures  that forgo tax revenue to subsidize the private purchase of child care and  adult dependent care services.

The vast majority of this funding is concentrated in two  programs administered by HHS: Head Start and CCDF. Together, these  two programs comprised over 90 percent of total obligations for programs  with an explicit early learning or child care purpose in fiscal year 2015. All  other programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose each  obligated less than $500 million in fiscal year 2015 (see table 1).", "All of the programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose  require at least some funds to be used on early learning or child care  services, according to agency officials. However, not all funds for these  programs are targeted toward children from birth through age 5 in an  early learning or child care setting, and agencies noted that they are  generally not required to track funds used specifically for these purposes.  One exception is the Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy Program:  Education officials collect data on the amount of funds used for pre- literacy activities because grantees must ensure that local providers use  15 percent of funds to serve children from birth through age 5. In fiscal  year 2015, all four programs that exclusively target children age 5 or  under\u2014Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with  Disabilities, Preschool Development Grants, Preschool Grants for  Children with Disabilities, and Head Start\u2014used 100 percent of their  funds for early learning or child care services for this population,  according to agency officials. In contrast, CCDF, Family and Child  Education (FACE), Promise Neighborhoods, and Child Care Access  Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) programs provide services to  school-age children in addition to children age 5 and under. Officials told  us they were unable to identify the amount of funds used specifically for  children age 5 and under for these programs. For example, CCDF serves  eligible children under age 13, and while states report the percentage of  children served by age, officials told us states are not required to report  the amount of CCDF funds spent by age. Not all CCDF funds are used for  child care subsidies. In addition to directly subsidizing access to child  care services for eligible low-income children, CCDF invests in improving  the quality of child care available to families. We recently reported that the  majority of children who received CCDF subsidies were under age 5.", "Among programs without an explicit early learning or child care purpose,  none require spending on early learning or child care, according to  agency officials. Further, agency officials told us that they do not track the  amount of funds used for early learning or child care for most of these  programs and are not required to do so. Officials from 3 of these 35  programs could identify the amount of funds obligated for early learning  and child care purposes. Funding for early learning or child care for  these three programs ranged from $2 million to $14 million in fiscal year  2015. Additionally, HHS officials told us that although they do not track  program obligations specifically for early learning or child care purposes  for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) and TANF, they do track  state spending on child care. However, HHS does not track spending  specifically for services provided to children age 5 and under, according  to agency officials. (See table 6 in appendix III for details.)", "Moreover, although they do not track this information, officials from some  programs without an explicit early learning or child care purpose said it is  likely that little funding, if any, actually went toward these purposes. For  example, officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) told us  that the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program  are targeted to school-age children, and they did not think very many  children under age 5 receive meals from the program. Additionally,  Department of Labor officials told us that the Native American  Employment and Training Program permits funds to be used for child  care services, among other supportive services, to enable parent  participation in the program. However, due to the limited grant size,  officials said it is likely that most participants only receive referrals to child  care providers.", "Much like the agencies with programs that do not have an explicit early  learning or child care purpose, Treasury does not estimate the amount of  forgone revenue resulting specifically from tax credits or exclusions that  support the care of children age 5 and under, according to agency  officials. All of the tax expenditures we identified are available for the care  of dependent children. The credit for child and dependent care expenses  also subsidizes dependent care of individuals who are physically or  mentally incapable of self-care, including adults with disabilities or who  are elderly. Combined, these tax expenditures accounted for  approximately $5.4 billion of forgone federal income tax revenue in fiscal  year 2015 (see table 2). This amount, however, includes forgone  revenue for care of children older than age 5 and dependent adults, since  the available data do not distinguish children and other dependents by  age."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improved Agency Coordination has Helped Address Fragmentation, Overlap, and Potential Duplication", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Early Learning and Child Care Programs are Still Fragmented, Overlap, or Have Potential for Duplication", "paragraphs": ["As we found in 2012, some fragmentation, overlap, and potential  duplication exist among early learning and child care programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fragmentation", "paragraphs": ["The federal investment in early learning and child care is fragmented in  that it is administered through multiple agencies.

For example,  five of the nine programs with an explicit early learning or child care  purpose primarily target children age 5 and under, and four programs  target low-income children. Despite these general similarities, however,  some of these programs target very specific populations that in some  cases have limited overlap or no overlap. For example, Preschool  Development Grants specifically target 4-year-olds, the Early Intervention  Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities targets children with  disabilities from birth through age 2, and Preschool Grants for Children  with Disabilities targets children with disabilities ages 3 through 5. Other  programs target more specific populations, such as children whose low- income parents are pursuing postsecondary education, or children living  in certain distressed geographic areas.", "Additionally, some programs engage in similar activities, according to our  analysis of agency-provided information. For example, grantees of Head  Start, Preschool Development Grants, and FACE use funds for  enrollment slots (spots for individual children to participate in programs on  an ongoing basis), health care, and social services or transportation,  according to agency officials. However, other programs with an explicit  early learning or child care purpose do not fund enrollment. Instead, some  programs fund additional services to aid early learning, such as special  education services or evaluations (see fig. 2).", "Despite some similarities in target populations and activities, programs  with an explicit early learning or child care purpose often have different  goals and administrative structures. For example, while the CCAMPIS  program and CCDF both fund child care, they have different goals. The  goal of CCAMPIS is to support the participation of low-income parents in  postsecondary education. In contrast, CCDF has dual goals of providing  child care as a work support to parents and providing children with quality  child care to prepare them for success in school, according to HHS.  Additionally, the two largest programs\u2014Head Start and CCDF\u2014differ  significantly from each other both in their goals and in how they are  administered. Head Start was created, in part, to support children\u2019s early  development by offering comprehensive, community-based services to  meet children\u2019s multiple needs and, as such, provides federal grants  directly to community-based public and private service providers. In  contrast, CCDF was created to help states reduce dependence on public  assistance. It provides grants to states to subsidize child care to support  parents\u2019 involvement in the workforce. States, in turn, generally provide  subgrants to counties or other local entities for distribution to parents.", "Though some overlap exists among programs with an explicit early  learning or child care purpose, the majority of the programs we identified\u2013 35 of 44\u2013do not have such a purpose. Overlap is limited among these 35  programs and those 9 programs with an explicit early learning or child  care purpose for a number of reasons. For example:", "Multipurpose block grants can be combined and jointly  administered: In their comments regarding our 2012 report, HHS  officials noted that many states choose to integrate CCDF, TANF, and  SSBG funding streams to provide services. They noted that states  jointly administer these funding streams under one set of rules, often  in coordination with other state and local funding.", "Programs that provide child care as an ancillary purpose are not  targeted toward children: Overlap between programs that permit  funds to be used for child care as an ancillary service and those with  an explicit child care purpose is limited given that such programs are  not targeted to children and that child care is not among the programs\u2019  objectives. For example, six worker training programs authorized by  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act allow for grant dollars  to pay for child care and other supportive services that are necessary  to enable an individual to participate in training and other authorized  activities. These programs are not targeted to children age 5 or  under\u2014their objectives are to provide individuals with job search  assistance and training.", "Some programs support but do not provide early learning or  child care for young children: Other programs we identified support  early learning or child care by providing food, materials, or other  services. These programs have limited overlap with programs with an  explicit early learning or child care purpose because they support  such programs rather than provide early learning or care for children  age 5 and under. For example, the Child and Adult Care Food  Program, which is administered by USDA, reimburses child care  centers for the cost of meals and snacks, among other things.  Additionally, the General Services Administration donates unused  federal property to certain state and local agencies through the  Donation of Federal Surplus Personal Property program. Officials  from the General Services Administration told us that agencies that  receive the donations pass them along to eligible organizations, which  may include preschools. They also told us that they do not track the  ultimate destination of the donated property.", "HHS and Education have acknowledged some overlap among early  learning and child care programs. In a November 2016 joint report to  Congress, HHS and Education identified eight federal programs with a  primary purpose of providing early learning for young children. In this  report, HHS and Education stated that overlap among early learning and child care programs is purposeful and necessary to meet the needs of  children and parents. For example, some programs fund enrollment slots  and others fund additional services to aid early learning, such as special  education services, according to HHS and Education officials. They also  noted that families may have multiple needs that require more than one  type of service. For instance, families can combine Head Start and  CCDF, which allows families to meet children\u2019s learning needs and  parents\u2019 child care needs, according to HHS officials.", "Despite this overlap, there may be service gaps because these programs  are not entitlements, and therefore do not serve all eligible children. For  example, we recently reported that an estimated 1.5 million children  received CCDF subsidies, out of an estimated 8.6 million children who  were eligible in their state in an average month in 2011 and 2012.  Additionally, Education officials told us that many states have narrowed  their eligibility criteria for the Early Intervention Program for Infants and  Toddlers with Disabilities because of funding constraints.

For example:", "Program eligibility requirements: Eligibility requirements differ  among programs, even for similar subgroups of children, such as  those from low-income families. For example, Head Start serves  primarily low-income children under age 5 whose families have  incomes at or below the official federal poverty guidelines, while  CCDF serves children under age 13 whose parents are working or in  school and who earn up to 85 percent of state median income.  Moreover, states have the flexibility to establish specific eligibility  policies for CCDF within broad federal eligibility requirements. Given  this flexibility, it may be possible for families with similar  circumstances to be eligible to receive CCDF subsidies in some  states but not others. Additionally, although the CCAMPIS program  also provides funding for child care, families must be eligible for Pell  Grants, which are need-based federal grants to low-income  undergraduate students, in order to receive services.", "Data limitations: For some programs, relevant programmatic  information is sometimes not readily available. For example, as we  previously reported, HHS does not collect data on all families who  receive child care funded by TANF. This is because some families  that do not receive cash assistance receive child care funded through  TANF. States are not required to report on families who receive only  TANF-funded child care without also receiving cash assistance. This  leaves an incomplete picture of the number of children receiving  federally funded child care subsidies. We previously suggested  requiring additional data collection on families receiving TANF-funded  child care, but this information is currently not collected. Additionally,  inadequate or missing data, as well as difficulties quantifying the  outcomes of some tax expenditures, can make it difficult to study the  beneficiaries of these expenditures.", "While the extent of potential duplication may be difficult to fully assess,  some early learning and child care programs include some safeguards  against duplication. For example, some programs can use funds to  expand access to other programs, thus limiting the likelihood that the  same beneficiaries receive the same services from more than one  program. Promise Neighborhood grantees can use funds to expand  access to Head Start or to establish new child care or preschool options.  Similarly, Preschool Development Grants can be used to expand the  capacity of Head Start to serve more eligible children. Specifically,  Preschool Development Grant funds must be used to supplement, not  supplant, any federal, state, or local funds, including Head Start and  CCDF, among others.", "In addition, the tax code has limits on combining the credit for child and  dependent care and the employer-provided child care exclusion.  Taxpayers can claim the credit for child and dependent care if they pay  someone to care for a dependent under age 13 or for a spouse or other  dependents who are not able to care for themselves. The credit can be up  to 35 percent of dependent care expenses with a limit of $3,000 per  qualifying person and $6,000 for two or more qualifying persons. The  employer-provided child care exclusion, a kind of flexible spending  account for dependent care expenses, generally provides participants an  opportunity to exclude an amount not to exceed $5,000 for dependent  care each year from their gross income. Families using the employer- provided child care exclusion must subtract the amount of those benefits  from the maximum they are eligible to receive for the credit for child and  dependent care, thereby preventing duplication of benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS and Education Have Helped Address Fragmentation, Overlap, and Potential Duplication through Improved Coordination with Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["We found that since our 2012 review of early learning and child care  programs, HHS and Education have improved coordination among the  agencies that administer these programs, which has helped to address  potential risks regarding fragmentation, overlap, and potential duplication.

For  the other eight programs, HHS and Education report results on  measureable performance standards in agency congressional budget  justifications or other publicly available sources.", "Program evaluations or studies: For six of the nine programs,  agency officials also periodically conduct internal or contracted  program evaluations or studies. Most of the programs that have  conducted program evaluations have done so to fulfill a program  requirement. For example, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) called for a national  assessment to measure the implementation progress and relative  effectiveness of the law. Similarly, in response to a congressional  mandate in the 1998 reauthorization of Head Start, HHS conducted  a national impact evaluation of Head Start and an evaluation of the  Early Head Start program. Additionally, since fiscal year 2000,  Congress has appropriated funds through CCDF specifically for  research and evaluation, according to agency officials.", "Other performance information: Officials from six of the nine  programs told us they collect other performance information through  grantee-submitted performance reports or other methods. For  example, the CCAMPIS program, which funds child care for student  parents enrolled in postsecondary institutions, uses grantee-submitted  annual reports to collect detailed information about individual student  enrollment that provides context for understanding performance  measures. Additionally, some programs track information about the  cost of certain outcomes.", "Agency officials told us they use results from performance monitoring,  evaluations, and other performance information to assist in grantee  monitoring, determine continued funding to grantees, and develop  technical assistance, among other things.", "While agencies use different methods to assess programs, all agencies  that administer programs with an explicit early learning or child care  purpose collect performance information that aligns with program  objectives to determine progress toward those objectives. For example,  the Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy program aims to advance  literacy skills\u2014including pre-literacy skills, reading, and writing\u2014for  students from birth through grade 12. The program has four performance  measures that assess student\u2019s literacy proficiency at age 4, grade 5,  grade 8, and again at high school. (See appendix IV for more details on  recent program performance for each of the nine explicit-purpose early  learning or child care programs.)", "Additionally, agency officials examine common aspects of performance  for many programs with an explicit early learning or child care purpose.  Specifically, we found that many programs had assessments relating to 1)  results for children age 5 and under, 2) program quality or teacher  qualifications, and 3) academic improvement or kindergarten readiness  (see fig. 4). For example:", "Children age 5 and under: Eight of the nine programs assess results  regarding this age group. For example, for the Early Intervention  Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, Education officials  assessed the percentage of children who entered the program with  below age social-emotional skills and who then substantially  increased their rate of growth by the time they exited the program.", "Program quality or teacher qualifications: Six of the nine programs  assess program quality or teacher qualifications. For example, CCDF  measures the number of states that implement a systemic approach  to assessing, improving, and communicating a child care or education  program\u2019s level of quality, including meeting certain benchmarks.  Similarly, Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities measures the  number of states with at least 90 percent of special education  teachers certified in the areas in which they are teaching.", "Academic improvement or kindergarten readiness: Eight of the  nine programs, including all seven of the programs with an explicit  early learning purpose, assess academic improvement or  kindergarten readiness. For example, for the Striving Readers  Comprehensive Literacy program, Education measures the  percentage of participating 4-year-old children who achieve significant  gains in oral language skills. For Preschool Development Grants,  Education measures the number and percentage of children served  by the grant who are ready for kindergarten.", "Although many of the programs with an explicit early learning or child  care purpose assess common aspects of performance, the specific  results agencies examine differ for a number of reasons. One reason is  that agencies use different tools to assess performance. For example,  although all seven early learning programs assess some aspect of  academic improvement or kindergarten readiness, programs vary in how  they perform these assessments. The Striving Readers Comprehensive  Literacy program provides grants to states and requires them to use  approved state accountability assessments to determine most program  performance measures. In contrast, the FACE program provides grants  to Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools that implement in-home  and center-based services, and uses a single student assessment tool to  measure performance across participants.", "Another reason assessments differ is that some programs examine  students\u2019 progress while they participate in the program, whereas others  assess proficiency at a particular point in time. For instance, both of the  special education programs administered by Education that we reviewed  collect entry and exit data on children with disabilities who receive  program services. Officials use these assessments to show children\u2019s  developmental progress while in the program across a number of early  childhood outcomes, including early language and literacy knowledge  skills, including early language and literacy knowledge skills. In contrast,  other programs assess children only once, during the academic year. For  example, the Preschool Development Grants program assesses children  once at kindergarten entry.", "Programs also differ in the time frame over which officials assess  performance. For example, HHS has assessed the long-term impact of  Head Start and Early Head Start by evaluating the same cohort of  children as they progress through later grades, even after the children  stopped receiving program services. Other programs gauge children\u2019s  performance annually while grantees receive funding, but do not evaluate  them after they stop receiving grant-funded services. (See appendix IV for  additional performance details and a complete list of program  performance measures for all nine programs with an explicit early  learning or child care purpose.)", "In addition to assessing performance by program, HHS and Education  each have an agency-wide priority goal that incorporates early learning or  child care program performance measures, and both agencies assess  performance on meeting these goals. The GPRA Modernization Act of  2010 (GPRAMA) requires that every 2 years, certain agencies identify  their highest priority performance goals, which GPRAMA refers to as  agency priority goals. Agencies are expected to identify performance  measures to track progress on achieving these goals, or identify  alternative ways of measuring progress, such as milestones for  completing major deliverables. Education incorporated performance  measures for the Preschool Development Grants program into its priority  goal, and HHS incorporated performance measures from Head Start and  CCDF (see table 5). Education and HHS have incorporated these goals  into their strategic plans and have published updates on progress toward  meeting their priority goals at performance.gov.", "Guidance from the Office of Management and Budget states that  agencies are to identify tax expenditures, as appropriate, among the  various federal programs and activities that contribute to their strategic  objectives and agency priority goals. HHS officials told us that they  decided the three child care-related tax expenditures we identified are not  potential contributors to their agency priority goal to improve the quality of  early childhood programs for low-income children. According to HHS  officials, they concluded that low-income families who qualify for HHS\u2019s  key programs, such as CCDF, are not likely to benefit from these tax  expenditures due to their lack of tax liabilities. Moreover, agency officials  told us the child care-related tax expenditures we identified are available  to help pay for dependent care and do not directly align with HHS\u2019s  priority goal focused on program quality. According to Education officials,  Education also does not incorporate these tax expenditures in its agency  priority goal because families who benefit from publicly provided early  learning services would not incur tuition costs, and therefore would not  benefit from these expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human Services  (HHS), and the Interior (Interior).
