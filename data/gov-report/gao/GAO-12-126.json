Policymakers are concerned that the lack of price transparency inhibits competition in the device market, leading to higher costs for hospitals, and ultimately higher Medicare spending. GAO was asked to examine (1) Medicare spending and utilization trends for procedures involving IMDs provided to beneficiaries, and (2) what available information shows about the prices hospitals pay for IMDs and any factors particular to the IMD market that influence those prices. GAO analyzed the most recently available Medicare inpatient and outpatient hospital claims from fiscal years 2004 through 2009. GAO requested price information on five devices from 60 hospitals, 6 GPOs, Department of Defense (DOD) medical centers, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system.

While cardiac and orthopedic procedures accounted for nearly all IMD-related expenditures, orthopedic procedures accounted for most of the increase in such expenditures during this period. Utilization increased at a faster rate for orthopedic devices and accounted for the majority of changes in expenditures for IMD procedures during the period.", "The information GAO obtained on the amounts hospitals paid for selected IMDs showed substantial variation. For a number of reasons, the detailed information needed to accurately compare prices across hospitals\u0097both the specific model and sale price net of discounts and rebates\u0097was not reported by all respondents for all IMDs in our study. However, data from 31 hospitals indicated substantial variation in reported prices for cardiac devices. For example, the difference between the lowest and highest price hospitals reported paying for a particular automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) model was $6,844. The difference between the highest and lowest price reported for another AICD model was $8,723. The price differences for the remaining two AICD models in our study fell in between $6,844 and $8,723. The median prices across the four AICD models ranged from $16,445 to $19,007. A factor particular to the IMD market that affects prices hospitals pay is the influence of physicians on hospitals\u0092 IMD purchasing. Although physicians are not involved in price negotiations, they often express strong preferences for certain manufacturers and models of IMDs. To the extent that physicians in the same hospital have different preferences for IMDs, it may be difficult for the hospital to obtain volume discounts from particular manufacturers. Also, confidentiality clauses barring hospitals from sharing price information make it difficult to inform physicians about device costs and thereby influence their preferences. Other factors that influence IMD prices include the degree of seller competition and a hospital\u0092s market share.", "These data suggest that some hospitals have substantially less bargaining power with the small group of companies that manufacture particular IMDs and consequently face challenges in obtaining more favorable prices. The lack of price transparency and the substantial variation in amounts hospitals pay for some IMDs raise questions about whether hospitals are achieving the best prices possible.

Policymakers are concerned that the lack of price transparency inhibits  competition in the device market, leading to higher costs for hospitals,  and ultimately higher spending in Medicare.

We matched these procedure codes  with 115 inpatient and 30 outpatient \u201cdevice dependent\u201d payment codes  in each claim. Because our list of IMD-dependent codes represented  procedures performed almost exclusively in a hospital setting, we  excluded procedures performed in other facilities (e.g., ambulatory  surgical centers). We only included services and expenditures when the  IMD-dependent procedure code was the primary procedure associated  with the payment for the claim submitted to Medicare. We examined  the extent to which changes in expenditures were explained by changes  in utilization or average cost. We determined that the claims data we  used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis by  performing appropriate electronic data checks.", "To determine what information is available on the prices hospitals pay for  IMDs, we selected five specific devices used in the five IMD-related  procedures that ranked highest in terms of Medicare spending in 2009.  The five devices were primary total knee implants, primary total hip  implants, coronary drug-eluting stents, automated implantable  cardioverter defibrillators (AICD), and cardiac resynchronization therapy  defibrillators (CRT-D). We asked 60 randomly selected hospitals,   6 GPOs, Department of Defense (DOD) medical centers and hospitals,  and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to report fiscal year 2010  pricing information for each of these five IMDs. Of the 60 hospitals,   39 hospitals\u2014or 65 percent\u2014provided IMD pricing data; in some cases,  the information reflected purchases made by the health system with  which the hospital is affiliated or for a point in time during fiscal year 2010.  In addition, 5 of the 6 GPOs, 8 DOD medical centers or hospitals, and the  VA health care system provided IMD pricing data. To compare the  prices that hospitals paid for cardiac IMDs, we limited our analysis to  those hospitals that provided detailed information on both the specific  model and the sale price net of discounts and rebates. Not all hospitals  provided pricing information for each device model in our study. To  compare the prices that hospitals paid for orthopedic IMDs, we used  examples from the information provided by hospitals and GPOs on behalf  of their member hospitals. The data we obtained on cardiac and  orthopedic IMD prices are not generalizable. To identify the factors that  affect the prices hospitals pay for IMDs, we reviewed relevant literature  and interviewed officials from the 6 GPOs from which we requested  pricing data, 3 nongovernment hospital systems with the highest  revenues for 2009 and 2010, 5 large IMD manufacturers that  volunteered to participate through a trade association, 2 small hospitals  that performed a low volume of procedures involving orthopedic IMDs  commonly used among Medicare beneficiaries in 2009, and professional  associations representing orthopedic surgeons and cardiologists.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 to December 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The cost reports  capture data on hospitals\u2019 costs for all services and supplies, including  IMDs, but do not separately identify specific IMD costs.
