Treasury uses working  groups, disclosure checklists, and other tools to assist in determining  appropriate reporting in accordance with new standards. Treasury\u2019s  procedures include working with federal entities during the fiscal year to  determine the reporting required based on new standards. Treasury  presents the new standards for discussion at monthly Central Reporting  Team meetings that include financial reporting representatives from  federal entities. Treasury also establishes working groups for certain new  standards, such as the working group established for the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s (FASAB) Statement of Federal  Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 47, Reporting Entity, to work  with federal entities on their implementation. Treasury also utilizes a  financial reporting disclosure checklist to help determine that all  disclosures required by FASAB standards are included in the CFS.  Treasury updates this disclosure checklist throughout the fiscal year and  completes the checklist as a key focus of the CFS compilation process.", "Although Treasury has processes in place for the implementation of new  standards, certain disclosures required by new standards were not  included in the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report. For example, the  draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report did not include disclosures related  to federal government land assets, such as the number of acres held at  the end of each reporting period, explanations of federal entities\u2019 election  to include or exclude land and land rights from their opening balances,  and a reference to the component reporting entity\u2019s financial report, as  required by SFFAS 50, Establishing Opening Balances for General  Property, Plant, and Equipment. In addition, the draft fiscal year 2018  Financial Report did not include disclosures related to significant  component entity amounts included in certain CFS line items that were  determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB) standards rather than FASAB standards, in accordance with  SFFAS 47. SFFAS 34, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles, Including the Application of Standards Issued by the Financial  Accounting Standards Board, provides that general purpose federal  financial reports prepared in conformity with accounting standards issued  by FASB also may be regarded as in conformity with U.S. generally  accepted auditing principles (U.S. GAAP). SFFAS 47 permits the  consolidation of amounts determined in accordance with FASAB and  FASB standards into a single line item without conversion for differences  in accounting policies and also provides application guidance that  emphasizes the need for disclosures of the different accounting policies  and the related amounts to aid financial statement users\u2019 understanding  of the information provided.", "Treasury\u2019s disclosure checklist was not updated in sufficient detail for  Treasury accountants to identify appropriate disclosures for inclusion in  the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report in accordance with these new  federal accounting standards. The updated disclosure checklist used for  fiscal year 2018 did not include (1) specific details about disclosures  required by SFFAS 50 for land assets, such as the number of acres  added or disposed of during the reporting period, and (2) questions to  help determine the need for disclosures to communicate the effect on  certain CFS line items that include material amounts determined using  accounting policies in accordance with FASB standards rather than  FASAB standards, as SFFAS 47 allows. Also, Treasury did not calculate  in aggregate the amounts that are reported in the CFS on a FASB basis  by line item in order to determine line items where the disclosures were  needed. We communicated these matters to Treasury officials, who  conducted a comprehensive analysis and included disclosures in the final  fiscal year 2018 Financial Report, as appropriate. In addition, although  Treasury established a working group to help implement SFFAS 47,  Treasury\u2019s procedures did not provide for sufficient consultation with  technical experts in interpreting new standards and updating the  disclosure checklist to reasonably assure that all requirements related to  the new standard were incorporated during implementation. Actively  consulting with technical experts, such as members of FASAB, the body  designated as the source of U.S. GAAP for federal reporting entities,  would help minimize the risk of misinterpreting the standards or  presenting and disclosing information in the Financial Report that is  incorrect, inconsistent, or incomplete.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that one  of the key objectives of an organization\u2019s internal control over financial  reporting is to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of its  financial reporting, including its financial statements and note  disclosures.

Treasury also performs procedures to  determine the consistency of such reporting with significant component  entities\u2019 audited financial statements.", "Treasury\u2019s Subject Matter Analysis standard operating procedure  includes steps for Treasury\u2019s staff to obtain financial information from  significant component entities and to prepare the draft Financial Report.  According to these procedures, Treasury\u2019s staff uses third quarter  financial data that significant component entities report and other  information to obtain a preliminary understanding of potential changes to  prior year amounts and adjustments to beginning net position. Treasury\u2019s  staff compares these preliminary results to the entities\u2019 year-end  information and compares beginning net position amounts reported for  the current year to ending net position amounts reported the prior year to  identify changes to prior year amounts. The staff then prepares a table  categorizing such changes as restatements, reclassifications, or  adjustments to beginning net position. This table includes a separate line  for each of the significant component entities but does not include  separate lines for each line item or note disclosure affected. Treasury  uses this table to prepare a summary analysis of its conclusions for  reporting restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning  net position and related note disclosures presented in the draft Financial  Report. The subject area manager reviews the results of the procedures  that Treasury\u2019s staff performed and documented.", "Although Treasury\u2019s staff followed these procedures for fiscal year 2018,  we found that Treasury did not always maintain sufficient support for  restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning net position  included in the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report. For example,  Treasury reported an adjustment to beginning net position but did not  identify errors made in prior years to support such an adjustment.  Treasury also reported that restatements affected the Statement of  Changes in Cash Balance from Budget and Other Activities, but  supporting documentation provided by Treasury for the draft fiscal year  2018 Financial Report did not clearly indicate how this statement was  affected by restatements. Treasury included a summary of significant  accounting policies in Note 1 to the CFS as required by U.S. GAAP,  which contained information about restatements, reclassifications, and  adjustments to beginning net position. However, Treasury did not disclose  consistent information in related line item notes, such as those for loans  receivable and loan guarantee liabilities, federal employee and veteran  benefits payable, and funds from dedicated collections in the draft fiscal  year 2018 Financial Report. Treasury included information in its summary  analysis and supporting documentation that was not consistent with  information that significant component entities reported. Although  Treasury\u2019s processes did not identify these inconsistencies, Treasury  corrected them in response to our questions.", "We found that Treasury did not identify these inconsistencies, in part,  because its subject matter review procedures did not include steps for  coordinating with Treasury managers of other subject matter areas to  reasonably assure consistency and appropriate support for conclusions.  Also, although Treasury\u2019s process involved preparing a summary of  analyses performed, Treasury\u2019s process did not include steps or other  tools to reasonably assure that consistent information was communicated  in all financial statement line items and note disclosures affected by  restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to net position.", "SFFAS 21, Reporting of Corrections of Errors and Changes in Accounting  Principles, requires that reporting entities restate prior period financial  statements for material errors discovered in the current period, if such  statements are provided for comparative purposes and if the effect of an  error would be material to the financial statements in either period. If not  material, corrections should be made to the beginning balance of  cumulative results of operations in the statement of changes in net  position. A reclassification is the movement of a prior year amount in  comparative financial statements in order to conform to the current year  presentation.

Management should periodically review  policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued relevance  and effectiveness in achieving objectives.", "Without sufficient procedures for reporting restatements, reclassifications,  and adjustments to beginning net position, there is an increased risk of  presenting information that is inaccurate or incomplete in the Financial  Report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to Treasury:", "The Secretary of the Treasury should ensure that the Fiscal Assistant  Secretary enhances existing procedures for Treasury management to  perform additional reviews for restatements, reclassifications, and  adjustments to beginning net position to reasonably assure that they  are properly supported and accurately reported.

Significant component entities are responsible for  properly accounting for and reporting legal contingency losses in their  entity-level financial statements and submitting this information to  Treasury for inclusion in the CFS. For each entity-level financial  statement audit, U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards  require that component entity auditors obtain written legal representations  as part of the audit. The significant component entities provide interim  and final legal representation letters, along with management schedules,  to Treasury, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and GAO.", "According to DOJ\u2019s established process, its legal counsel reviews  individual cases included in these legal representation letters for which  the potential loss exceeds $500 million individually or in the aggregate for  similar cases. DOJ is responsible for preparing and submitting an interim  and final government-wide legal representation letter to Treasury and  GAO, containing its assessment of the potential litigation losses, including  whether there are litigation, claims, or assessments that were not  addressed in the significant component entities\u2019 legal representation  letters that DOJ believes should have been reported or which DOJ  believes should have been reported differently.", "Treasury\u2019s procedures call for it to determine whether the financial  statement information that the significant component entities submitted  and Treasury used to compile the fiscal year 2018 CFS is consistent with  the significant component entities\u2019 management schedules, legal  representation letters, and the government-wide legal representation  letter. For fiscal year 2018, Treasury identified various inconsistencies  among the significant component entities\u2019 financial statement information,  management schedules, and legal representation letters as well as  inconsistencies between the government-wide legal representation letter  and the significant component entities\u2019 management schedules and legal  representation letters. There may be appropriate reasons for these  differences. For example, although management often relies on advice of  legal counsel on the likelihood of loss and estimate of the amount or  range of potential loss, as reflected in the legal representation letter,  management is ultimately responsible for determining whether the loss  should be recognized as a liability or disclosed in the notes to the  financial statements. As such, management may make a different  determination as to the likelihood of loss or estimated loss amounts than  those in the legal counsel\u2019s assessment. Also, differences between the  government-wide legal representation letter and the significant  component entities\u2019 legal representation letters can occur in situations in  which DOJ has more current information on the likelihood of loss and  estimated loss amounts.", "However, Treasury was not always able to timely determine whether  there were appropriate reasons for the differences it identified or whether  adjustments were needed to the legal contingency loss information  reported in the fiscal year 2018 CFS. Based on our work, we found that  certain of these differences required correction in the fiscal year 2018  CFS. For example, Treasury noted that one significant component entity  included estimated loss amounts for reasonably possible cases in its  management schedule and that such amounts were not reported in the  financial information provided to Treasury for consolidation. Because  Treasury was unable to timely resolve the issue, the fiscal year 2018 CFS  was not appropriately adjusted to include these amounts. Further, DOJ  did not provide us the final government-wide legal representation letter as  of our audit completion date.", "Although Treasury has procedures for reviewing and analyzing the  significant component entities\u2019 legal contingency loss information and the  government-wide legal representation letter, we found that Treasury  lacked effective processes and procedures to reasonably assure that  appropriate information regarding legal contingency losses was reported  in the fiscal year 2018 CFS. Specifically, Treasury did not have sufficient  processes and procedures to obtain the needed information in a manner  that would facilitate the timely compilation of the legal contingency loss  information for inclusion in the fiscal year 2018 CFS or for timely resolving  issues identified during its review. For example, as part of Treasury\u2019s  procedures, it compares the estimated loss amounts for reasonably  possible and probable cases included in the significant component  entities\u2019 management schedules with the financial statement information  that the significant component entities report for inclusion in the fiscal  year 2018 CFS. If discrepancies are greater than 10 percent, Treasury\u2019s  procedures call for significant component entities to provide an  explanation. However, because of the extensive amount of time needed  to perform this analysis, Treasury was not always able to timely follow up  and resolve the differences with the significant component entities.", "SFFAS 5, Accounting for Liabilities of The Federal Government, as  amended by SFFAS 12, Recognition of Contingent Liabilities Arising from  Litigation, contains accounting and reporting standards for loss  contingencies, including those arising from litigation, claims, and  assessments. An entity should recognize a liability and a related charge  to expense for an estimated loss from a loss contingency only when (1) a  past event or exchange transaction has occurred, (2) a future outflow or  other sacrifice of resources is probable, and (3) the future outflow or  sacrifice of resources is measurable. A contingent liability should be  disclosed if any of the conditions for liability recognition are not met and  there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss  may have been incurred. Disclosure should include the nature of the  contingency and an estimate of the possible liability, an estimate of the  range of possible liability, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be  made. OMB Bulletin 19-01 provides guidance to federal agencies on the  preparation of legal letters and management schedules, and the Treasury  Financial Manual provides federal agencies the legal letter reporting  requirements. Also, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government provides that management should design control activities to  achieve objectives and respond to risks. For example, management  should design control activities so that financial information is completely  and accurately reported.", "Until the federal government implements effective processes and  procedures to obtain and assess information regarding legal contingency  losses, the reliability of amounts and disclosures associated with legal  loss contingencies reported in the CFS and the ability to assess their  potential effect on the financial condition of the federal government will be  limited."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury should ensure that the  Fiscal Assistant Secretary, working in coordination with the Controller of  OMB, establishes effective processes and procedures to reasonably  assure that appropriate information regarding legal contingency losses is  reported in the CFS.

As noted in appendix I, Treasury established three broad  categories to help agencies in classifying treaties and other international  agreements with respect to their potential financial implications. The  establishment of three standard categories provides some guidance for  identifying and reporting treaties and other international agreements;  however, as stated in appendix I, we continue to believe further guidance  is needed to determine whether additional disclosure in the CFS is  required by U.S. GAAP.
