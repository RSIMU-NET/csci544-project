The need for a vigilant approach to information security has been demonstrated by the pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States; these attacks continue to pose a potentially devastating impact to systems as well as the operations and critical infrastructures that they support. Concerned by reports of weaknesses in federal systems, Congress passed the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), which authorized and strengthened information security program, evaluation, and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies. GAO was asked to testify on federal information security and agency efforts to comply with FISMA. This testimony summarizes (1) federal agencies' efforts to secure information systems and (2) opportunities to enhance federal cybersecurity. To prepare for this testimony, GAO analyzed its prior reports and those from 24 major federal agencies, their inspectors general, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have reported mixed progress in securing their systems and implementing key security activities. For example, in fiscal year 2009, agencies collectively reported an increasing percentage of personnel receiving security awareness training and specialized security training, but a decreasing rate of implementation for other key activities when compared to fiscal year 2008. In addition, federal systems continued to be afflicted by persistent control weaknesses. Almost all of the 24 major federal agencies had information security weaknesses in five key control categories, as illustrated in the figure below. An underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively implemented key elements of an agencywide information security program, as required by FISMA. As a result, they may be at increased risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction of information or disruption of mission critical operations. Such risks are illustrated, in part, by the increasing number of security incidents experienced by federal agencies. Opportunities exist to enhance federal cybersecurity through a concerted response to safeguarding systems that include several components. First, agencies can implement the hundreds of recommendations GAO and inspectors general have made to resolve control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. In addition, OMB's continued efforts to improve reporting and oversight as recommended by GAO could help assess agency programs. Finally, the White House, OMB, and certain federal agencies have undertaken several governmentwide initiatives that are intended to enhance information security at federal agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on federal  information security. As the number of reported computer security  incidents and threats to the nation\u2019s cyber infrastructure steadily increase,  the need for a vigilant and comprehensive approach to federal information  security is greater than ever. In 2009, the federal government faced  coordinated attacks against its Web sites, and several agencies were  affected by the Gumblar Trojan, which uses multiple exploits to  compromise legitimate web pages. In addition, the Conficker worm posed  a threat to both federal and non-federal systems. Such attacks highlight the  importance of developing a concerted response to safeguard federal  information systems.", "Proper safeguards can mitigate the risk to federal computer systems and  networks posed by individuals and groups with malicious intentions.

As part of its oversight responsibilities OMB requires agencies to  report on specific performance measures, including:    Percentage of employees and contractors receiving IT security awareness    Percentage of employees with significant security responsibilities who  received specialized security training,    Percentage of systems whose controls were tested and evaluated,    Percentage of systems with tested contingency plans, and    Percentage of systems certified and accredited.", "Since the enactment of FISMA in 2002, federal agencies have generally  reported increasing rates of implementation for key information security  activities. However, in fiscal year 2009, agencies reported mixed progress  in implementing these activities compared to fiscal year 2008. For  example, governmentwide, agencies collectively reported that 91 percent  of employees and contractors had received security awareness training in  fiscal year 2009, up from 89 percent in fiscal year 2008. Agencies also  reported that 90 percent of employees with significant information  security responsibilities had received specialized training, up from 76  percent in fiscal year 2008.", "In other key areas, agencies reported slight decreases from fiscal years  2008 to 2009.

A  summary of these percentages is shown in figure 1.", "In these and other areas, inspectors general at the 24 major agencies have  also reported weaknesses in their fiscal year 2009 audits and evaluations.  Weaknesses in requirements such as periodic testing and evaluation,  certification and accreditation, configuration management, and remedial  actions were most commonly reported. For example,    at least 13 inspectors general reported that their agencies had insecure  configuration settings, or had not applied needed patches in a timely  manner, or both;    at least 15 inspectors general reported that their agency did not adequately  assess security controls such as those recommended by NIST;    at least 11 inspectors general reported that their agencies failed to create a  remediation plan for all identified weaknesses.    at least 13 inspectors general reported that documents required to make  an informed decision regarding certification and accreditation of systems  were either missing or incomplete, or that the accreditation was allowed  to expire on at least one system without recertification;  Weaknesses such as these continue to impair the government\u2019s ability to  ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information  and information systems used to support the operations and assets of  federal agencies.

Most of the 24  major federal agencies had reported deficiencies in the following major  categories of information security controls, as defined by our Federal  Information System Controls Audit Manual:    access controls, which ensure that only authorized individuals can read,  alter, or delete data;    configuration management controls, which provide assurance that only  authorized software programs are implemented;    segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that one individual can  independently perform inappropriate actions without detection;    continuity of operations planning, which provides for the prevention of  significant disruptions of computer-dependent operations; and    an agencywide information security program, which provides the  framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that effective  controls are selected and properly implemented.", "As shown in figure 3, agencies reported deficiencies in all five of the  information security control areas. For example, agencies did not  consistently configure network devices and services to prevent  unauthorized access and ensure system integrity; assign incompatible  duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not  control all aspects of a process or transaction; and maintain or test  continuity of operations plans for key information systems. Such  information security control weaknesses unnecessarily increase the risk  that the reliability and availability of data that are recorded in or  transmitted by federal systems could be compromised.", "An underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at  federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively implemented  key elements of an agencywide information security program, as required  by FISMA.

In addition, the laboratory\u2019s decentralized  management approach has led to weaknesses in the effectiveness of its  classified cybersecurity program. Although the laboratory has taken steps  to address these weaknesses, its efforts may be limited because LANL has  not demonstrated a consistent capacity to sustain security improvements  over the long term.", "We identified a number of shortcomings in key program activities at the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
