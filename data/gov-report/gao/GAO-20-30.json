Established by law in 2009, the project provides research grants to develop and implement strategies to reduce obesity among low-income children. One of CDC's design changes, for example, was to modify the scope of the project (i.e., type of strategies implemented by grantees). After CORD phase 1, CDC officials shifted the scope from prevention\u2014through the implementation of strategies in community settings, such as schools, and in health care settings\u2014to the treatment of children who were overweight or had obesity. According to CDC officials, the agency made this change due to the shorter time frame for implementing CORD phase 2 and in response to existing national recommendations related to childhood obesity. CDC also changed the purpose of the project's study design prior to phase 3. Whereas CORD phases 1 and 2 were intended to build knowledge and evidence of effective strategies, CDC modified CORD phase 3 to focus on translating effective strategies into routine use by converting them into a package of materials that others could replicate.", "To evaluate the effectiveness of CORD phase 1\u2014the only phase that is complete\u2014CDC awarded a grant to an independent entity to aggregate results across the three grantees, and each grantee conducted their own evaluation.

For example, grantees noted that the preexistence of programs and policies that promoted healthy behaviors positively affected their implementation of CORD strategies. CDC officials identified the turnover of principals and other school or clinic staff as negatively affecting the implementation and suggested that future researchers incorporate staff retraining costs into their strategies as a way to help mitigate this challenge.", "CDC has taken steps to share CORD design materials and results through published literature, websites, and conferences. It has also coordinated with other Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offices and agencies to promote the wider adoption of CORD strategies in low-income communities.

Childhood obesity  disproportionally affects children from low-income families. For example,  CDC data show that the obesity rate for children in families with incomes  below the federal poverty threshold was 21 percent from 2013 through  2016, which was about 71 percent higher than the rate for children in  families with the highest incomes. There are both numerous negative  health outcomes and financial consequences related to childhood obesity.  For example, researchers have found that childhood obesity is associated  with a number of health disorders including high blood pressure and high  cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. Studies suggest that children  with obesity are likely also to become adults who are overweight or have  obesity, which can contribute to increased health care expenditures over  their lifetimes.", "The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009  (CHIPRA) authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) to establish the Childhood Obesity Research  Demonstration (CORD) Project.

HHS designated CDC as the agency responsible for  designing, awarding, and managing the grants. Subsequent laws\u2014 including the 2018 reauthorization of CHIP\u2014appropriated funding for, and  further extended, the CORD Project. With this funding, CDC established  two additional CORD Project phases\u2014CORD 2 and CORD 3\u2014which  awarded additional grants and used different design approaches.

In January 2011, CDC  published the funding opportunity announcement\u2014which outlined the  goals of the grant as well as the eligibility criteria and other  requirements\u2014and, in September 2011, the first demonstration projects  began. Congress subsequently appropriated additional funding for the  CORD Project in April 2015 and January 2018, bringing the total amount  appropriated to $65 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2023. CDC  officials told us that during this time period the CORD Project was the  primary source of CDC funding for childhood obesity research focused on  low-income children. CDC implemented the CORD Project in three  separate grant phases, with different design approaches and grantees.  (See fig. 1.)", "Across the three CORD Project phases\u2014only the first of which is  complete\u2014CDC has awarded ten grants to entities to implement  demonstration projects aimed at reducing obesity in low-income  children.

CDC changed the scope of the project (i.e., type of strategies  implemented), the type of evaluations (i.e., how it evaluated the  strategies), the purpose of the study design, and the extent of  participation by state Medicaid or CHIP programs. (See fig. 2.) CDC  officials designed the CORD Project based on the language and  requirements in CHIPRA and the CORD Project Plan developed by HHS,  according to CDC officials. For CORD phases 2 and 3, CDC officials  modified elements of the design in response to lessons learned, time  frames for implementation, and recommendations related to childhood  obesity made by national organizations such as the U.S. Preventive  Services Task Force (hereafter referred to as the Task Force).", "Scope of CORD Project. After CORD phase 1, CDC officials shifted the  scope of the CORD Project from prevention to the treatment of children  who are overweight or have obesity, according to CDC officials.  Specifically, CDC designed CORD phase 1 to require grantees to  implement demonstration projects that integrated public health and  primary care strategies by promoting children and their families\u2019 use of  healthy behaviors and by modifying community environments. CORD  phase 1 grantees implemented strategies in two types of settings: (1)  community and (2) health care settings. Public health strategies are  activities and programs delivered in community settings, such as schools  and early care and education centers. Grantees also implemented  primary care strategies, which in general are BMI screenings or other  activities implemented in health care settings, such as during physician  visits in federally qualified health centers. While CORD 1 grantees  implemented strategies in both types of settings, the specific strategies  that each CORD phase 1 grantee implemented varied. (See text box and  app. I for additional information about the strategies CORD 1 grantees  implemented.)", "Examples of Strategies Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration Phase 1  Grantees Implemented  California Demonstration Project", "Public health strategies implemented included training staff at early care and  education centers on health behavior change strategies and providing centers  with large self-service water containers to promote increased water intake.", "Primary care strategies implemented included body mass index (BMI)  screenings for children participating in early care and education centers. BMI is a  measure used to determine overweight and obesity.", "Massachusetts Demonstration Project", "Public health strategies implemented included training teachers in participating  elementary schools on how to implement evidence-based health education  curricula that encouraged learning about nutrition and physical activity.", "Primary care strategies implemented included establishing a healthy weight  clinic located in the participating health centers.", "Texas Demonstration Project", "Public health strategies implemented included providing classroom-based  nutrition and gardening curricula in the early care and education centers.", "Primary care strategies included modifying electronic health records systems to  increase provider awareness and action related to maintaining healthy weight,  such as prompting clinicians to refer children who were overweight or had obesity  to additional services.", "Pediatric Weight Management  Interventions  The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) defines pediatric weight  management interventions as intensive  behavioral interventions designed to address  excess weight through child and parental  counseling on diet, physical activity, or  behavior change management. The U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force refers to  these as interventions for weight management  interventions.", "For CORD phases 2 and 3, CDC shifted the scope of the CORD Project  to the treatment of children who are overweight or have obesity.  Specifically, CDC modified the scope to only focus on implementing  pediatric weight management interventions, one type of primary care  treatment strategy (see sidebar). CDC officials told us they changed the  scope of CORD phase 2 in response to the shorter, 2-year funding period  authorized by law. CDC officials stated that unlike CORD phase 1, the  shorter time frame for CORD phase 2 did not allow for a planning year to  establish and solidify community relationships across multiple community  settings while also enabling sufficient time to implement the strategies  and analyze outcome and other data.", "CDC also modified the scope for CORD phase 2 and 3 to focus on  pediatric weight management interventions in response to existing  national recommendations related to childhood obesity, according to CDC  officials. The Task Force recommended that primary care providers  screen children 6 years and older for obesity and offer, or refer children  with obesity to, pediatric weight management interventions. In making  its recommendation, the Task Force found that pediatric weight  management interventions should involve at least 26 hours of contact  between the provider and the child, family, or both over a period of 2 to 12  months. According to CDC\u2019s funding opportunity announcement for  CORD phase 2, a 2007 expert committee convened by the American  Medical Association similarly recommended that all health care providers  address weight management and lifestyle issues with children at least  once a year and provide behavior counseling on key obesity-related  behaviors. CDC officials stated they designed CORD phase 2 to meet  the guidelines and standards outlined in these recommendations.", "After Congress extended the CORD Project for a 6-year period beginning  in fiscal year 2018 and appropriated additional funding, CDC designed  the scope of CORD phase 3 as a 5-year grant to continue efforts to  implement pediatric weight management interventions only. CDC  officials stated they considered returning to an integration of public health  and primary care strategies for CORD phase 3, similar to CORD phase 1,  but decided that the best use of resources was to focus on integrating  pediatric weight management interventions into communities, which  includes linking families with resources already available in the  community, such as low-cost physical activity offerings.", "Common Outcome Measures for  Childhood Obesity Research  Demonstration (CORD) Phase 1  Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption   Frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage  consumption  Physical activity   Sleep time  Screen time (e.g., watching television and  playing video games)  Body mass index  Quality of life (e.g., physical, emotional, and  social)", "Type of evaluations. In CORD phase 1, CDC awarded a grant to  another entity\u2014the evaluation center\u2014to conduct a cross-site evaluation  to aggregate results of the three implementing grantees\u2019 demonstration  projects. In designing CORD phases 2 and 3, CDC did not award grants  to independent entities to conduct cross-site evaluations of the  implementing grantees\u2019 demonstration projects. In CORD phase 1, the  cross-site evaluation was intended to help inform national policy decision- making, including recommendations regarding the applicability of CORD  strategies in other communities. To assess the effectiveness of CORD  phase 1, CDC designed the cross-site evaluation to examine the  demonstration projects using a set of common outcome measures, which  the evaluation center developed in collaboration with CDC officials and  implementing grantees (see sidebar).", "CDC officials told us they removed the cross-site evaluation component  for CORD phases 2 and 3 in part due to challenges executing the cross- site evaluation in CORD phase 1. Officials explained, for example, that  the difficulty in developing common outcome measures that could be  analyzed across the three demonstration projects that were both valid  and specific enough to the strategies was a challenge given the variation  in the strategies implemented by each grantee, data collection time  frames, and methodologies. In addition, CDC officials stated the  implementing grantees had sufficient capacity to conduct their own  evaluations. For these reasons, CDC officials said they concluded that  the cross-site evaluation was not an efficient use of resources. The  CORD phase 1 grantees also identified the following challenges related to  the cross-site evaluation:", "Grantees told us there was insufficient time to develop the common  outcome measures prior to implementing the strategies. One grantee  noted this resulted in them needing to collect some data  retrospectively instead of collecting it in real time.", "Grantees also collected data at different time frames from each other,  which resulted in limited data for measuring outcomes via the  common measures. Evaluation center officials stated that the lack of a  common timeline for collecting data resulted in them only being able  to analyze changes in common outcomes measures at the two  common time points across all three grantees\u2014baseline and 12  months\u2014even though some grantees collected data at later time  points (e.g., 24 months after implementation began). Thus, evaluation  center officials said they were unable to determine whether changes  in outcomes observed were sustained 24 months after  implementation.", "Grantees reported challenges in creating valid common outcome  measures applicable across the varying age ranges, locations, and  strategies implemented for the three demonstration projects that  affected results of the cross-site evaluation. For example, only the  Massachusetts demonstration project chose to implement strategies  in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants  and Children offices, making any data collected about that strategy  unable to be included in the cross-site evaluation.", "CDC required the implementing grantees in all CORD phases to conduct  their own evaluations and report on outcomes associated with the  strategies implemented under their demonstration projects. Specifically,  CDC expected the grantee-specific evaluations to measure health  outcomes\u2014such as changes to BMI, nutrition, and physical activity\u2014and  quality of life, and to report information on the processes, outcomes, and  costs of the individual demonstration projects in the evaluations.", "Purpose of study design. While CDC designed CORD phases 1 and 2  to build knowledge and evidence on strategies for reducing obesity  among low-income children, CDC designed CORD phase 3 to focus on  translating strategies proven to reduce childhood obesity into routine use  for low-income families. More specifically, for CORD phases 1 and 2,  CDC required grantees to use or adapt strategies that previously had not  been rigorously tested in low-income children. For example, in CORD  phase 2, the Arizona demonstration project adapted a preexisting  program\u2014which was aimed at preventing child behavior issues through  motivational interviewing techniques and parent education\u2014to improve  weight-related health behaviors in low-income children. By comparing  low-income participants receiving the strategies with those who did not,  the Arizona demonstration project aims to develop evidence about  whether or not these strategies work to reduce obesity in low-income children. Arizona officials told us that while the CORD phase 2 study  design is appropriate for helping to expedite the translation of knowledge  into practice, it has nonetheless been challenging to implement the  demonstration project in a 2-year period. The officials explained 2 years is  a short period of time for this type of demonstration project.", "For CORD phase 3, CDC is requiring grantees to take an existing  evidence-based pediatric weight management intervention and convert it  into a user-friendly package of information, containing all materials clinical  or community-based entities would need to easily, efficiently, and  completely replicate the pediatric weight management intervention.  Materials may include implementation manuals, training curricula,  technical assistance, and evaluation materials. CORD phase 3 grantees  are required to partner with clinical or community entities that will then  use the package to implement the set of pediatric weight management  interventions in their community. Additionally, CORD phase 3 grantees  are required to make edits to the packaged materials based on the results  of the implementation and develop sustainability and dissemination plans  to implement the pediatric weight management intervention at additional  locations.", "CDC officials and agency documentation outlined multiple reasons why  they modified the study design for CORD phase 3. For example, in its  funding opportunity announcement for CORD phase 3, CDC noted that  there have been challenges in moving research-based, national  recommendations, like Task Force recommendations, into practice.  According to CDC officials, this challenge is especially great in low- income communities, where there are a limited number of available  pediatric weight management interventions that are rigorous enough to  meet the standards outlined by the Task Force. Additionally, officials  noted that when these interventions are available, families are generally  charged for the services. CDC officials told us that, according to the  literature, it can take many years for evidence-based clinical interventions  to make it into mainstream practice. Thus, by designing CORD phase 3  to package evidence-based pediatric weight management interventions  that will be targeted to communities with low-income families, CDC  officials told us they hope to reduce the number of years before adoption  of such treatment strategies is prevalent.", "Participation by state Medicaid or CHIP program officials. In the  design for CORD phase 1, implementing grantees were not required to  develop relationships with officials from their state Medicaid or CHIP  offices or with other payers, but these relationships were encouraged,  according to CDC officials. At each subsequent CORD phase, CDC  modified its expectations of grantees regarding the involvement of state  Medicaid and CHIP program officials in the demonstration projects.  Specifically, CDC added a requirement that the implementing grantees  form a payer advisory board with representatives from state Medicaid or  CHIP offices and encouraged grantees to collaborate with other relevant  health care stakeholders, such as private payers, to foster discussions  about how to obtain reimbursement for CORD strategies.", "Noting the importance of establishing these types of relationships, CDC  officials told us that grant funding and in-kind donations\u2014which CDC  encouraged grantees to identify and use to supplement CORD grant  funding\u2014are not sustainable sources of funding for continued  implementation of childhood obesity programs. As a result, the officials  told us reimbursement from insurers, such as Medicaid or CHIP, is  necessary to sustain the implemented strategies at the level of intensity  required by the Task Force recommendations. For example, in CORD  phase 2, officials from the Arizona demonstration project told us they  included representatives from United Healthcare\u2019s private and Medicaid  health plans and also a representative from Mercy Care, a not-for-profit  Medicaid plan, on their payer committee. Arizona demonstration project  officials stated they were working with representatives of the state  Medicaid program and private health plans to determine what kind of  evidence payers would need to reimburse for obesity-related services.", "Reimbursement is a key focus in CORD phase 3, and CDC officials told  us they plan to assist grantees in determining which services provided  within the pediatric weight management interventions may be  reimbursable. Specifically, CDC officials stated they will coordinate  opportunities for information sharing, technical assistance, and  networking between CORD phase 3 grantees, states, and CMS in order  to explore broader Medicaid and CHIP coverage options for the services  delivered through the grants. CMS officials noted that medical services  provided under the grant could be reimbursable under states\u2019 Medicaid  and CHIP programs, including under the Early and Periodic Screening,  Diagnostics and Treatment benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC Used a Similar Approach to Grantee Management in the First Two CORD Phases", "paragraphs": ["While CDC changed some design elements of the CORD Project  between the phases, according to CDC officials, the agency used a  consistent approach in managing grantees.

CDC  officials told us they used a team of personnel with different expertise to  oversee the CORD phase 1 and 2 grants. For example, the team included  a project officer who specialized in program management to oversee the  day-to-day operations, as well as subject matter experts, including one  experienced in evaluation design. CDC officials told us they interacted  with CORD phase 1 and 2 grantees on regular conference calls and  conducted annual site visits to each grantee. Grantees stated that CDC\u2019s  site visits aided them in implementing their demonstration projects by  keeping them and their community partners accountable. In addition,  grantees told us that CDC collaborated with them to provide expertise on,  or troubleshoot the design of, the implementation of their demonstration  projects.

CDC officials told us  they plan to continue a similarly collaborative management approach for  CORD phase 3.", "CDC officials stated they also monitored CORD phase 1 and 2 grantees  by requiring grantees to regularly report on their efforts and generally plan  to monitor CORD phase 3 grantees the same way. For example, CDC  required CORD phase 1 grantees to submit annual progress reports at  least 90 days before the end of the budget period that included  descriptions of progress made towards the research goals, information on  expenditures, and a detailed budget justification for the new budget  period.

The  primary objective of the cross-site evaluation was to determine if there  was evidence that an integrated approach had any advantage over  implementing either public health only or primary care only strategies.  The evaluation center examined the extent to which the three CORD 1  demonstration projects collectively were associated with positive changes  over time in behavior or reductions in BMI. Because of the considerable  variation in each of the three demonstration projects, the evaluation  center grouped the various strategies implemented by the three grantees  into two categories for the analysis: public health and primary care plus.  Next, the evaluation center categorized children by the types of strategies  they received (public health only, primary care plus only, or both public  health and primary care plus) and by age (2 to 5 years, 6 to 8 years, and  9 to 12 years). The evaluation center tested whether each of the  possible combinations of strategy and age showed improvement over a  12-month period for each common measure.", "Using this approach, the evaluation center found some improvements for  all of the common outcomes measured; however, improvements were not  observed for each strategy or age group. Specifically, of the 81 possible  combinations of strategy and age, 52 demonstrated some improvement  over the 12-month period; however, only 16 of them showed a statistically  significant improvement. (See fig. 3.) For example, BMI improved for  children over the 12-month period in three of the strategy and age  combinations, but the improvement was statistically significant for just one  of those combinations. Among the 52 groups that showed improvements  at 12 months, most of the differences observed were very small. For  example, from the start of the intervention to 12 months after the  intervention, there was about a 1 percent increase in the percentage of  children who reported they were physically active for 60 minutes at least  one day a week.", "The implementing grantees\u2014each of which conducted their own  evaluations\u2014also reported some improvements in the children who  received CORD phase 1 strategies. Similar to the evaluation center\u2019s  findings, the implementing grantees did not report improvements for all  participating age groups or all outcomes they examined. Among their  findings, the grantees reported the following:", "Children at participating early care and education centers in Texas,  who were exposed to strategies such as classroom-based nutrition  and gardening curricula, demonstrated modest improvements in BMI  over a 2-year period when compared with children who did not receive  these Texas demonstration project strategies. The Texas  demonstration project also reported improvements in BMI for some  children who participated in a weight management program  administered in YMCAs compared with a different weight  management program administered in primary care clinics.  Specifically, researchers found that the YMCA program was more  effective in reducing BMI for low-income children at 3 months but not  at 12 months after implementation of the program.", "Children who received both public health and primary care strategies  under the California demonstration project experienced some  improvement on some outcome measures when compared to children  who only received one type of strategy. For example, children who are  overweight or have obesity who received both public health and  primary care strategies reported playing less hours of video games  during the week than those who only received the primary care  strategies.", "During CORD phase 1, the Massachusetts demonstration project  observed some improvements over time in the children who received  CORD strategies. For example, the percentage of seventh grade  students with obesity decreased from the start of implementation  compared with 24 months after implementation in the two  communities where the strategies were implemented. However,  these results were modest; the decrease in the percentage of  students with obesity was less than 3 percent in both communities.", "CDC officials, implementing grantees, and the evaluation center noted  that modest or no effects were likely in part due to small sample sizes  because of recruitment issues. Regarding recruitment, CDC officials told  us that two of the three CORD phase 1 demonstration projects had issues  with recruitment that caused sample size issues and ultimately statistical  power issues. Specifically, when there is a smaller sample size, a study  may be underpowered, which means that statistically significant effects  are less likely to be detected even when differences exist. CDC officials  explained that having limited statistical power affects the ability for more  specific modeling or analysis to determine for whom the strategies works  best (e.g., those with obesity or severe obesity). Grantees and CDC  officials told us that when faced with recruitment issues, grantees made  changes to their recruitment strategies. For example, grantees reduced  the minimum BMI required for children participating in the demonstration  projects in an attempt to increase participation. However, grantees told us  they were still not able to reach their anticipated number of participants.  Additionally, an official from the evaluation center told us some common  outcome measures used in the cross-site evaluation were limited. The  official explained that, had the grantees had more time to reach  consensus on how to collect the data for the common outcome measures,  or had the common outcome measures been identified in advance of the  implementing grantees developing their own evaluations using measures  specific to their demonstration projects, the evaluation center might have  had more precise data to demonstrate improvements among participants.", "In planning for CORD phase 1, CDC officials acknowledged that the  demonstration projects might not result in significant changes for some  outcomes. CDC\u2019s funding opportunity announcement noted that changes  in health indicators, such as BMI, are long-term objectives, and that the  period of funding for the projects might be too short to demonstrate  significant improvement in these outcomes. A CDC official stated that  although strong results were not found across each of the demonstration  projects, the results of the implemented strategies provided evidence that  these strategies could be implemented in a real-world setting. Thus, they  noted the lack of stronger and larger effects does not mean that the  demonstration projects were not successful.", "CORD phase 1 grantees told us they continue to analyze the data and  expect to publish additional findings, even though the grant period has  concluded. For example, the evaluation center told us they had enough  data from the CORD Project to continue publishing for many years and  planned to publish studies examining how existing community policies\u2014 such as physical activity policies\u2014affected the outcomes of the  implemented strategies. One of the implementing grantees also told us  that having more time to fully analyze, use, and publish results from the  data was needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC and Grantees Identified Several Factors Affecting the Implementation of Strategies to Reduce Obesity among Low- Income Children", "paragraphs": ["CDC officials and CORD grantees identified several factors that affected  grantees\u2019 ability to implement strategies to reduce childhood obesity  among low-income children. According to CDC officials, policymakers and  researchers should consider these factors when implementing similar  strategies in the future. CDC officials or implementing grantees identified  the following factors they observed across the CORD grantees:", "Staff turnover. CDC officials told us that the turnover of principals  and other administrative personnel trained to provide the strategies is  one factor that negatively affected the implementation of the  strategies in schools or clinics. For example, CDC officials noted that  in the Massachusetts demonstration project, researchers had to  establish a relationship with a new principal of one of the participating  schools when the other principal left, which delayed progress in  implementation at that location. Similarly, the Arizona demonstration  project also experienced staff turnover at the clinics, which led to a  need for retraining and challenges in staff flows. CDC officials  suggested that future research should consider incorporating staff  retraining costs in the design of public health strategies to help  mitigate this challenge.", "Family support. CDC officials told us that grantees had to provide  more support than initially anticipated to families to better ensure their  participation. CDC officials told us that grantees addressed this  challenge by allowing siblings to also attend or participate in the  activities or by holding activities on weekends or after school to  accommodate parents\u2019 work obligations. Strategies should be  designed to be flexible for families, as there are competing demands  on the families participating in the demonstration projects, CDC  officials explained.", "Pertinent programs and policies. Implementing grantees noted that  the preexistence of programs or policies that promoted healthy  behaviors in the public health and primary care sectors positively  affected their implementation of CORD strategies. For example,  Massachusetts demonstration project officials told us that the  strategies they implemented complemented an existing statewide  program that promoted opportunities for healthy eating and active  living in the communities, schools, childcare centers, and businesses.  Grantee officials attributed the organizational commitment and  motivation they observed in participating schools to these preexisting  activities.", "Commitment from partner organizations. Implementing grantees  found that the commitment of partner organizations, such as schools,  was an important factor affecting implementation. According to  implementing grantees, determining the willingness and ability of an  organization to implement the strategies is important\u2014by identifying,  for example, leaders who support the strategies and can help ensure  staff commitment to execute them. The Massachusetts demonstration  project reported that 90 percent of the stakeholders they worked with  noted the presence of leadership and administrative support for the  project reduced feelings of conflict between program implementation  and other priorities. Alternatively, the California demonstration project  identified the lack of a strong supporter in a leadership position as a  barrier to implementation.", "Parental stresses. Implementing grantees found that parental  stresses related to social economic status (e.g., food insecurity or  accessibility challenges, including transportation to intervention sites)  was a major factor negatively affecting family participation and the  implementation of the strategies. Grantees explained that  understanding the effect of these stresses on a family\u2019s ability to focus  on the strategies to reduce childhood obesity is important and  grantees should plan for ways to mitigate those stresses.", "CDC told us that the CORD phase 3 demonstration projects may be able  to help mitigate some of the challenges identified from prior CORD  experiences, as noted above. For example, CDC officials told us they  plan to work with CORD phase 3 grantees to find ways to mitigate  challenges associated with staff turnover, which could include taping  trainings or allowing for virtual opportunities for retraining. Additionally,  the CORD phase 3 grants are implementing pediatric weight  management interventions in different settings\u2014some in clinical settings  and some in community settings\u2014which CDC officials said may provide  parents with additional flexibility to participate in the strategies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CDC and Others Have Taken Steps to Disseminate CORD Results and Continue to Promote the Use of CORD Strategies in Low-Income Communities", "paragraphs": ["CDC has taken steps to share CORD phases 1 and 2 design materials  and available results with researchers and others.

In  addition, CDC shared lessons learned about the CORD Project and  evidence-based childhood weight management programs during a series  of webinars. According to CDC officials, the intended audience for the  webinars included public health practitioners and researchers; local,  state, and federal government agency officials; health care professionals;  policy analysts; and community health workers. CDC officials also told us  they have presented CORD results and lessons learned at conferences  and at meetings organized by other HHS agencies. Specifically, a CDC  official and grantees summarized results from the first phase of the  CORD Project at the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Annual  Conference in 2016. CORD phase 1 results were also presented at the  2018 Annual Meeting for the Association of State Public Health  Nutritionists. Additionally, in November 2017, CORD phase 1 grantees  met with researchers from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Childhood  Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research program to share lessons  learned from their respective research.", "To further disseminate CORD results, CDC officials highlighted their  planned report to Congress, as required by CHIPRA, which was  subsequently issued in September 2019. The report describes the findings for CORD phase 1 and provides brief descriptions of the CORD  phase 2 grantees and their demonstration projects, since the results of  those projects are not yet available. The report identifies CORD phase 1  findings, including information about the costs of implementing the  strategies. CDC officials noted that the implemented public health  strategies, such as providing classroom-based nutrition and gardening  curriculum or programs that promote physical activity, cost less than  primary care strategies. Specifically, CDC reported that the costs of public  health strategies in early care and education centers ranged from $26 to  $96 per child, the costs of some primary care strategies ranged from  $164 to $181 per child, and the cost of more intensive family-based  weight management programs ranged from $2,107 to $2,220 per child.", "CDC, in collaboration with other HHS agencies, has also taken some  steps to promote the wider adoption of CORD strategies in low-income  communities. For example, CDC and CMS have had preliminary  discussions about how CMS could help CORD grantees understand how  Medicaid and CHIP programs could reimburse for the obesity-related  strategies they are implementing as part of the CORD Project, which  CDC officials told us could help to sustain and expand these strategies to  other low-income communities. CMS officials told us they are considering  whether to issue guidance to state Medicaid and CHIP programs that  explains how some states have been able to reimburse entities for the  provision of overweight- and obesity-related services. CDC officials told  us that after discussions with CMS officials, they provided information to  CMS in October 2018 that could be used for a possible CMS information  bulletin to state Medicaid and CHIP officials on childhood obesity.", "In addition, CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  and Evaluation within HHS have awarded a cooperative agreement to the  National Association of Community Health Centers to increase the  implementation of an evidence-based childhood weight management  program\u2014Mind, Exercise, Nutrition, Do It!\u2014by federally qualified health  centers. According to HHS officials, the National Association of  Community Health Centers is assisting 14 federally qualified health  centers in five states (Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, and North  Carolina) to implement this intervention and, based on lessons learned,  plans to develop an implementation guide to support the expansion of this  strategy to other health centers. CDC officials also told us they are  coordinating with the National Cancer Institute within the National  Institutes of Health to share knowledge with CORD phase 3 grantees  about how to develop business models to support the expansion of  successful strategies, which aligns with one of CDC\u2019s goals for CORD  phase 3 to determine how to increase the adoption of successful  strategies beyond the CORD intervention sites.", "CDC officials and implementing grantees provided us some examples of  CORD strategies and materials that continue to be used in the states  where they were implemented or have been implemented in other low- income communities.", "Officials from the Massachusetts demonstration project told us that  some of the primary care strategies they developed during CORD  phase 1 are still provided in the healthy weight clinics that participated  in the project.", "Officials from the Arizona demonstration project told us they have  received funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop a  new training module for health care providers interested in  implementing the project\u2019s pediatric weight management intervention.
