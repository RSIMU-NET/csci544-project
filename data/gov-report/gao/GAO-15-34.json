EPA works with DOJ\u2014which represents EPA in litigation \u2014to decide whether to settle a deadline suit. EPA and DOJ officials stated that the factors they consider include (1) the cost of litigation, (2) the likelihood that EPA will win the case if it goes to trial, and (3) whether EPA and DOJ believe they can negotiate a settlement that will provide EPA with sufficient time to complete a final rule if required to do so.", "Of the total number of major rules EPA promulgated from May 31, 2008 to June 1, 2013, nine were issued following seven settlements in deadline lawsuits, all under the Clean Air Act. The terms of the settlements in these deadline suits established a schedule to issue a statutorily required rule(s) or to issue a rule(s) unless EPA determined that doing so was not appropriate or necessary pursuant to the relevant statutory provision. None of the seven settlements included terms that finalized the substantive outcome of a rule. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to solicit public comments on drafts of settlements. The nine major rules were Clean Air Act rules, and EPA solicited public comments on all of the drafts. EPA received between 1 and 19 comments on six of the settlements and no comments on one settlement. EPA determined that none of the comments disclosed facts or other considerations compelling it to withdraw or withhold consent for the settlement.", "The effect of settlements in deadline suits on EPA's rulemaking priorities is limited. According to EPA officials, settlements in deadline suits primarily affect a single office within EPA\u2014the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)\u2014because most deadline suits are based on provisions of the Clean Air Act for which that office is responsible. These provisions have recurring deadlines requiring EPA to set standards and to periodically review\u2014and revise as necessary\u2014those standards.

To address the second objective, we  accessed a database that GAO maintains to help implement the CRA to  identify the major rules EPA issued from May 31, 2008 through June 1,  2013. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of identifying major rules issued by EPA. EPA officials identified  which of these rules EPA issued following a settlement in a deadline suit,  and we obtained those settlements. We relied on EPA because neither  EPA nor DOJ maintains a database that links settlements to rules, and  there is no comprehensive public source of such information. We  determined the extent to which the public commented on the terms of the  settlements by examining EPA documentation on the number and content  of the public comments.

For example, a deadline  suit may involve a person suing EPA because EPA failed to issue a rule  by a date established in statute. Similarly, a person may sue EPA  because it missed a recurring deadline to review and revise, as  necessary or appropriate, an existing rule. In August 2011, we reported  that the number of new environmental litigation cases\u2014of all types\u2014filed  against EPA each year from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2010  averaged 155 cases per year.", "Before filing a deadline suit, a person generally must file a Notice of Intent  to Sue (NOI) with EPA.

A settlement agreement is not  subject to court approval but can result in a stay of the lawsuit. If EPA  fails to meet the terms of the settlement agreement, then the plaintiff can  ask the court to lift the stay in order to proceed with the lawsuit. A consent  decree is entered as a court order. If EPA fails to meet the terms of a  consent decree, the court can enforce or modify the consent decree,  including citing EPA for contempt of court.", "Unless a more specific statute governs, when EPA or any other federal  agency promulgates a rule, whether or not in conjunction with a deadline  suit, it generally follows procedures prescribed in the Administrative  Procedures Act (APA).

It  includes requirements for publishing notices of proposed and final rules in  the Federal Register and for providing opportunities for the public to  comment on notices of proposed rulemaking.

In making this decision, EPA and DOJ  consider several factors to determine which course of action is in the best  interest of the government. According to EPA and DOJ officials, these  factors include: (1) the cost of litigation, (2) the likelihood that EPA will win  the case if it goes to trial, and (3) whether EPA and DOJ believe they can  negotiate a settlement that will provide EPA with sufficient time to  complete a final rule if required to do so. EPA and DOJ officials told us  that they often choose to settle deadline suits when EPA has failed to  fulfill a mandatory duty because it is very unlikely that the government will  win the lawsuit. In many such cases, the only dispute is over the  appropriate remedy, i.e., fixing a new date by which EPA should act.  Additionally, in such cases, officials may believe that negotiating a  settlement is the course of action most likely to create sufficient time for  EPA to complete the rulemaking if it is required to issue a rule.

According to EPA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel, provisions in the Clean Air Act that authorize  the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program and Air  Toxics program account for most deadline suits. These provisions have  recurring deadlines requiring EPA to set standards and to periodically  review\u2014and revise as appropriate or necessary\u2014those standards.  OAQPS sets these standards through the rulemaking process. For  example, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to review and revise as  appropriate NAAQS standards every 5 years and to review and revise as  necessary technology standards for numerous air toxics generally every 8  years.", "The effect of settlements in deadline suits on EPA\u2019s rulemaking priorities  is limited. OAQPS officials said that deadline suits impact the timing and  order in which rules are issued by the NAAQS program and the Air Toxics  program, but not which rules are issued. The officials also noted that the  impact of deadline suits on the two programs differs because of the  different characteristics of the programs.", "Regarding the NAAQS program, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to review  and revise as appropriate the NAAQS standards for six pollutants\u2014called  criteria pollutants\u2014at 5-year intervals. NAAQS standards limit the  allowable concentrations of criteria pollutants in the ambient air. There is  more than one standard for each criteria pollutant. EPA establishes the  required standards through the rulemaking process and recently  conducted seven NAAQS reviews to review the standards and revise as  appropriate. According to an OAQPS official, prior to 2003, EPA did not  review NAAQS on a regular cycle. Beginning in 2003, EPA faced four  deadline suits for failure to complete NAAQS reviews for the six criteria  pollutants. EPA settled two of these suits and was subject to a court order  regarding the other two suits after it failed to successfully negotiate  settlements with the plaintiffs. The settlements and court orders led EPA  to perform the statutorily required reviews of the NAAQS standards for  the six criteria pollutants and to promulgate seven rules\u2014one for each  NAAQS review. The last of these seven rules was promulgated in April  2012. According to officials, the deadline suits addressing the NAAQS  standards did not affect which NAAQS standards were reviewed since  EPA reviewed all of the standards. According to officials, the deadline  suits did affect the timing and order in which EPA conducted the reviews  to accommodate the time frames in the settlements and court orders.  Additionally, according to officials, as a result of the experience in  responding to the deadline suits, the agency is striving to maintain the 5- year statutory review cycle for criteria pollutants going forward. However,  officials noted that it is difficult for EPA to complete its NAAQS reviews  every 5 years. From April 2012 through September 2014, EPA has  promulgated one rule following a NAAQS review after it settled a deadline  suit and has missed the statutory deadline for reviewing the standards of  two other criteria pollutants, one of which EPA is under court order to  complete by October 2015 following a deadline suit.", "Regarding the Air Toxics program, OAQPS officials said that the impact  of deadline suits on the Air Toxics program is different from that of the  impact on the NAAQS program because of the large number of rules that  the Air Toxics program promulgates. For example, the Clean Air Act  establishes a schedule under which EPA established 120 standards to  reduce the emissions of 187 hazardous air pollutants. These National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) apply to  certain categories of sources of these pollutants, such as cement  manufacturing, municipal solid waste landfills, and semiconductor  manufacturing. Generally, the act requires EPA, no less often than every  8 years, to review the standard, and revise as necessary. It makes any  necessary revisions through the rulemaking process. The review must  take into account developments in practices, processes, and control  technologies. For sources subject to Maximum Achievable Control  Technology (MACT) standards promulgated pursuant to section 112(d)(2)  of the Clean Air Act, EPA must also conduct a residual risk assessment  within 8 years after the initial promulgation of the standard. EPA refers  to these two reviews together as the risk and technology review (RTR).  As of October 2014, EPA has completed 28 RTRs (27 of these reviews  following deadline suits) and has not completed 57 RTRs for which the  statutory deadline has passed and 36 RTRs for which the statutory  deadline has not passed. Additionally, officials report that, currently,  most of the resources available to complete RTRs are focused on a 2011  settlement. This settlement listed 27 NESHAPs for which RTRs were  overdue. OAQPS officials said that they have been unable to meet all of  the time frames contained in the 2011 settlement and, as a result, have  negotiated amendments to the settlement extending the time frames.  Officials said that they intend to complete all of the overdue RTRs but are  focused on fulfilling the terms of the 2011 settlement and several other  settlements to which EPA has entered into that address a smaller number  of reviews. Additionally, in September 2013, EPA received a NOI  concerning 43 additional NESHAPs for which a RTR is overdue. EPA  officials said that they are engaged in settlement discussions over one of  these reviews for which EPA has been sued.", "Additionally, we discussed with EPA budget officials the potential impact  of budget allocation decisions associated with deadline suits on EPA  offices that are not subject to deadline suits. According to the budget  officials, EPA accounts for anticipated workload arising out of litigation in  its budgeting cycle for affected programs but does not make changes in  existing budget allocations specifically to address settlements in deadline  suits.
