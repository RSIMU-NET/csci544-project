This report examines (1) GPO contracting practices and the reported effects of these practices; (2) how GPOs are funded and the reported effects of this funding structure. To do this work, GAO sent a questionnaire to representatives of the 5 largest national GPOs about their contracting practices and sources of revenue; reviewed the literature on the effects of the GPO funding structure; reviewed laws, regulations, and guidance on the GPO safe harbor; interviewed representatives from HHS, FTC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), vendors, hospitals, trade associations, and economic and health care experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to representatives from the 5 large group purchasing organizations (GPO) in GAO's review, GPO contracting generally involves three phases: (1) issue requests for proposals or invitations for vendors to competitively bid for a contract, (2) review proposals, and (3) negotiate and award contracts. GPOs reported negotiating and awarding different types of contracts to vendors in different situations. All 5 GPOs reported that the majority of the contracts they negotiate are either dual-source or multi-source, meaning that the majority of the products sold through their contracts have more than one vendor available on the GPOs' contracts. In addition, all GPOs reported that they did not bundle unrelated products and awarded mostly contracts with 3-year terms in 2012. The views of experts and others GAO interviewed on the effects of GPO contracting practices varied on issues such as whether the practices affect product innovation. In addition, while officials from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated that they continue to receive and review complaints each year about GPO contracting practices, in the last 10 years, the FTC has not initiated any enforcement actions directed at GPO conduct.", "The 5 GPOs in GAO's review reported being predominately funded by administrative fees collected from vendors, which were almost always based on a percentage of the purchase price of products obtained through GPO contracts. The 5 GPOs reported that these fees totaled about $2.3 billion in 2012, and nearly 70 percent of these fees were passed on to GPO customers or owners. The literature and the views of experts varied widely on the effects of this funding structure. Some suggested it creates misaligned incentives for GPOs to negotiate higher prices for medical products in order to increase the amount of vendor fees that they receive. Others suggested that competition between GPOs incentivizes them to negotiate the lowest possible prices, and mitigates these concerns. There is little empirical evidence available to either support or refute these concerns. However, to the extent that the vendor fee-based funding structure affects prices for medical products and services, Medicare payment rates may be affected over time through the annual update to hospital payment rates, which relies, in part, on information that hospitals report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Moreover, Medicare payments also could be affected if hospitals do not account for revenue they receive from GPOs, which they are required to report as a reduction in costs on their cost reports. However, the extent to which hospitals are reporting this revenue is not known because this has not been reviewed by HHS since 2005, and CMS officials stated that the agency has not specifically identified this as information that should be routinely audited. Repealing the safe harbor\u2014which allows administrative fees\u2014could eliminate the potential effects of the GPO funding structure on Medicare payment rates, but experts and others stated that this could be disruptive to the health care supply chain at least in the near term. Over the longer term, GPOs and hospital systems are likely to adapt to the new market environment. While a repeal of the safe harbor provision would require a clearer understanding of the impact of the GPO funding structure, hospitals' potential underreporting of administrative fee revenue presents an immediate risk that can be addressed within the current GPO funding structure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of HHS determine whether hospitals are appropriately reporting administrative fee revenues on their Medicare cost reports and take steps to address any under-reporting that may be found. HHS agreed with the recommendation.

Federal spending for  health care services provided through Medicare and Medicaid in fiscal  year 2013 totaled $850.7 billion\u2014an increase from $557.4 billion in  2006\u2014and spending is expected to continue to increase. The increase in  federal spending for health care services can be attributed, in part, to the  growth in health care costs, and an important component of those costs is  the cost of products that hospitals and other health care providers  purchase to provide care. Providers often use purchasing intermediaries  known as group purchasing organizations (GPO) to negotiate contracts  for products and services with vendors such as manufacturers,  distributors, and other suppliers. Providers can then purchase products  and services from the vendors for the prices negotiated by the GPOs.", "When a provider purchases a product or service from a vendor that has a  contract with a GPO, the vendor pays the GPO an administrative fee,  generally based on the purchase price paid by the provider. These fees  are a source of operating revenue for GPOs, and they are allowed to  collect them if they meet the requirements of a safe harbor to the \u201canti- kickback\u201d provision of the Social Security Act\u2014known as the Anti- Kickback statute\u2014which would otherwise prohibit such fees.harbor\u201d provision was enacted in 1986 to allow these payments, which   This \u201csafe  had constituted a violation of the Anti-Kickback statute. According to a  House of Representatives Committee report, the Committee believed that  GPOs could help reduce health care costs by enabling hospitals to obtain  volume discounts from vendors and that a safe harbor should be  established to ensure that GPOs and the vendors with which they  contract do not risk prosecution as a result of the payment and collection  of administrative fees.under this safe harbor has raised questions about whether GPOs are in  fact negotiating the lowest possible prices for their customers because of  an inherent conflict: while GPOs represent the interests of health care  providers to obtain needed products and services at a lower price, they  are funded based on a percentage of the costs of products purchased  from the vendors they negotiate with on behalf of providers.", "However, the GPO funding structure protected  Over more than a decade, members of Congress and others have raised  questions about certain GPO contracting practices and the funding  structure that includes vendor-paid fees. For example, questions have  been raised about sole-source contracting, in which GPOs may contract  with only one vendor for a given product when multiple vendors of  comparable products are available; product bundling, in which price  discounts are linked to purchases of a specified group of products; and  long-term contracts of 5 years or more. Members of Congress have also  raised questions about the oversight of GPOs by the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as GPO self-regulation  through the Healthcare Group Purchasing Industry Initiative (HGPII). We  issued five reports between 2002 and 2012 related to these issues.", "You raised questions about GPOs\u2019 contracting practices and about the  effects of the GPO funding structure. This report examines 1.  GPO contracting practices and the reported effects of these practices;  2.  how GPOs are funded and the reported effects of this funding  structure.", "To address these objectives, we sent a questionnaire to representatives  of the five largest national GPOs by purchasing volume about their  contracting practices and sources of revenue, including administrative  fees collected from vendors. We also conducted a review of the literature  regarding the effects of the GPO funding structure. In addition, we  reviewed documentary evidence of the factors that GPOs consider when  contracting for products and services, and reviewed published articles in  economic and law journals, as well as analyses of the healthcare market.  We also reviewed laws, legislative history, regulations, and guidance  related to the GPO safe harbor. We interviewed FTC, DOJ, and HHS  officials about their oversight of GPOs. To obtain contextual information  about their experiences with GPOs, we interviewed representatives from  five hospitals and eight vendors of medical products. We selected  hospitals based on variation in the number of hospital beds, the extent to  which the hospital had an ownership interest in a GPO, and which GPOs  they used. We selected vendors based on variation in the types of  products manufactured. To determine the reported effects of the GPO  funding structure, we interviewed 13 experts in economics, the healthcare  market, and purchasing cooperatives. We identified these experts through  our search of the relevant literature on GPOs, healthcare markets,  purchasing cooperatives, and economics. We also interviewed trade  associations representing GPOs and vendors of medical products.  Information obtained from interviews is not generalizable. A more  extensive discussion of our scope and methodology appears in   appendix 1.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 through October  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The intent of GPOs is to save their customers money by  pooling their purchases in order to obtain lower prices and by taking on  the administrative burden of negotiating contracts with vendors. Through  GPO-negotiated contracts, health care providers can purchase products  from vendors, including medical devices, commodities, branded drugs,  and generic drugs, as well as services, such as laundry and food  services. The Healthcare Supply Chain Association (HSCA)\u2014a trade  association representing 14 healthcare GPOs\u2014estimates that U.S.  hospitals use, on average, 2 to 4 GPOs per facility, and nearly every  hospital in the United States\u2014approximately 96 percent to 98 percent\u2014 purchases through GPO contracts.", "According to HSCA, the first GPO was established in 1910 by the  Hospital Bureau of New York, and by the 1980s, there were more than  100 GPOs. While over 600 GPOs in various markets are currently active  in the United States, a relatively small number of GPOs dominate the  healthcare market for products and services sold through GPO contracts.  According to HSCA, GPOs vary in size, type of ownership, and the  contracting services they offer their customers. For example, some GPOs are owned by hospitals, while others are not. operate nationally, while others operate regionally to negotiate  contracts with local vendors.  serve not-for-profit hospitals, others serve for-profit hospitals, and  some serve both. offer a broad portfolio of products and services, while others focus on  specific product categories or certain types of health care, such as  long-term care.", "In recent years, the GPO market has become more consolidated as some  large GPOs have merged. The five largest national GPOs have reported  contracting for a similar, broad portfolio of products, including, for  example, commodities such as cotton balls and bandages, devices such  as pacemakers and stents, and branded and generic drugs. During fiscal  year 2012, the 5 largest GPOs by purchasing volume reported a total  purchasing volume of $130.7 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administrative Fees", "paragraphs": ["During the contracting process for products and services, GPOs negotiate  the payment of administrative fees by the vendor to the GPO. In addition  to using these administrative fees to cover operating expenses, GPOs  may distribute a portion of the fees to their health care provider customers  or use them to finance other ventures, such as investing in other  companies. GPOs may also use administrative fees to fund additional  services outside of group purchasing for their customers, which can  include custom contracting; services related to product evaluation, such  as clinical evaluation and standardization of products; assessments of  new technology; benchmarking data services; and marketing and  insurance services.

The Anti-Kickback statute, originally  enacted in 1972 and amended over the years, generally prohibits the  knowing or willful receipt or payment of fees to induce or reward the  purchase of an item or service for which payment may be made under a  federal health care program. According to HHS-OIG, the main purpose  of the Anti-Kickback statute is to protect patients and federal health care  programs, including Medicare, from fraud and abuse by curtailing the  corrupting influence of money on health care decisions.

However, HHS-OIG has the authority to investigate potential  violations of the Anti-Kickback statute. HHS-OIG also has the authority to  impose administrative penalties, including civil money penalties, and  exclusion from federal health care programs on GPOs that violate the  statute. HHS-OIG also may refer such violations to DOJ, which in turn  may bring criminal and civil actions against GPOs that it determines to  have violated the Anti-Kickback statute. HHS-OIG does not have  general oversight authority over GPOs because GPOs do not directly  participate in Medicare and, therefore, do not enter provider agreements  with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014a component  of HHS.", "In 2012, we found that, according to officials from HHS-OIG, the office  had not routinely exercised its authority to request and review disclosures  related to GPOs\u2019 administrative fees, but it had collected information on  GPOs\u2019 administrative fees while conducting audits of hospitals\u2019 cost  reports. The provision and receipt of discounts, rebates, and net  revenue distributions by GPOs to hospitals is protected from prosecution  under the Anti-Kickback statute by another provision\u2014known as the  \u201cdiscount safe harbor.\u201d Specifically, a discount or other reduction in price  obtained by a Medicare or Medicaid provider is protected from  prosecution if the reduction in price is properly disclosed and  appropriately reflected in the provider\u2019s Medicare, or applicable state  Medicaid, cost report.", "HHS-OIG conducted two audits in 2005 in which it reviewed the  administrative fees that six national GPOs received from vendors and  how selected customers of the GPOs accounted for revenue distributions  from the GPOs on their Medicare cost reports.

(See fig. 2.)", "Issue RFPs. Representatives from all five GPOs in our review reported  generally issuing RFPs as part of an open bidding process for products  and services to place on contract. Issuing RFPs includes notifying  vendors, and publicly posting information such as bid calendars, minimum  requirements for vendors, and criteria that the GPOs will weigh when  considering competing proposals. All five GPOs in our review have  posted on their websites information about the minimum requirements  that vendors must meet. For example, one GPO\u2019s website states that  vendors must be the original equipment manufacturer or demonstrate an  exclusive marketing relationship for the products included in the RFP,  among other things. Another GPO specifies meeting minimum levels of  product quality, durability, and cost-effectiveness, as well as requirements  for the financial stability and long-term viability of the vendor. A sample  RFP provided by a GPO states that during the competitive bidding  process, it will consider a vendor\u2019s product capabilities, maintenance, and  ability to upgrade, as well as pricing and other financial factors.", "Four of the five GPOs in our review reported that under certain limited  circumstances, they may award contracts to vendors without issuing  RFPs. For example, these \u201cnon-bid\u201d contracts may be awarded to  vendors that present a proprietary, patented, or innovative product; if a  small group of customers request a local or regional vendor contract; or if  a product supply shortage or other unique circumstances arise. The fifth  GPO reported that all contracts are awarded through a competitive  bidding process, even if there is only one bidder. A representative from  one generic drug manufacturer stated that, while there is not much  opportunity for innovation in the generic drug market, GPOs will award  contracts outside of the three-phased competitive bidding process to  vendors that have innovative packaging\u2014such as flip-top vials versus a  pre-mixed bag\u2014if it benefits their customers. A representative from this  manufacturer stated that GPO contracts with vendors generally contain  provisions that the GPOs have the right to add additional vendors of the  same product if the other vendor has innovative packaging.", "Review proposals. All five GPOs in our review reported considering  multiple aspects of a vendor and product when reviewing proposals,  including weighing financial and nonfinancial criteria, and then scoring  competing vendors in order to inform their contracting decisions.example, one GPO reported reviewing aspects such as a vendor\u2019s ability  to provide sufficient product to its customers, any documentation of  concerns raised by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspections,  quality and safety of the products, the source of raw materials, and bar  code readability. A representative from another GPO said that the GPO  considers the \u201ctotal value\u201d of a product or service for their customers, not  necessarily solely the price. The total value includes, for example, product  quality, upfront price, discounts, rebates, and anticipated administrative  fee revenue. This representative said that in certain situations, such as  with multiple possible suppliers of a product, a GPO customer would not  necessarily want to purchase the product with the lowest price.", "Negotiate and award contracts. GPOs reported negotiating and  awarding different types of contracts to vendors in different situations. All  five of the GPOs in our review reported that the majority of the contracts  they negotiate are either dual-source or multi-source, meaning that the  majority of the products sold through their contracts have more than one  vendor available on the GPOs\u2019 contracts. In addition, all five GPOs  reported that they did not bundle unrelated products, and awarded mostly  contracts with 3-year terms in 2012. All five GPOs also reported including  provisions in some contracts\u2014referred to as commitment provisions\u2014in  which customers that purchase a certain percent of product volume  receive a rebate or reduced price. For example, a vendor might offer  greater discounts to GPO customers that purchase at least 80 percent of  a certain group of products from that manufacturer. Commitment  requirements can also be tiered, resulting in the opportunity for a  customer to commit to different percentages of purchasing volume: the  higher the percentage, the lower the price.", "Representatives from all five GPOs also reported that, in certain  situations, they negotiated sole-source contracts, contracts that bundled  related products, and long-term contracts of 5 years or more. All five  GPOs in our review reported that their contracting practices have not  changed much over time.", "Sole-source contracts: All five GPOs reported that they do negotiate  sole-source contracts when it is advantageous to their customers,  though some GPOs reported negotiating a higher proportion of sole- source contracts than others. One GPO said that about 18 percent of  its customers\u2019 spending through the GPO is through sole-source  contracts. Three GPOs reported sole-source contracting for branded  drugs and commodities, and four GPOs reported sole-source  contracting for generic drugs, including generic injectable drugs. For  example, one GPO reported that in 2012 it had sole-source contracts  in effect for generic drugs including an oncology drug\u2014oxaliplatin,  and an antiviral\u2014acyclovir. Representatives from this GPO reported  taking a vendor\u2019s performance and supply capacity into consideration  when determining whether to sole-source contract with a vendor. For  example, the representatives stated that the GPO no longer sole- source contracts with a vendor that had failed to comply with FDA  standards. Representatives from one vendor stated that, as a result of  recent drug shortages, some GPOs have developed a philosophy to  contract with as many vendors as possible to ensure a continuous  supply for their customers, but that other GPOs choose to contract  with a limited number of vendors and hold those vendors accountable  for supplying their customers.", "Contracts that bundle related products: Representatives from all five  GPOs in our review reported negotiating contracts that offer discounts  based on the purchase of bundled products, but restricting bundling to  products that are used together or are otherwise related in order to  create efficiencies and help standardize products for their customers.  Several GPOs reported bundling related commodities, and one GPO  reported bundling related branded pharmaceuticals. Representatives  from one GPO stated that the GPO bundles related products in the  same product category, such as intravenous (IV) sets and solutions,  diapers and underpads for incontinence care, and mobility aids such  as walkers, crutches, and canes. Representatives from another GPO  stated, for example, that it negotiates bundled contracts for  interventional coronary products including stents, balloons, catheters,  and guide wires. In addition, another GPO reported that, in 2013, it  implemented a program through which participating customers can  standardize their purchases for up to 40 commodity categories for  additional discounts.", "Long-term contracts: Representatives from all five GPOs reported  awarding longer terms for certain types of products, such as IV  systems and laboratory products. One GPO reported that its  customers requested long-term contracts for IV systems because they  found it difficult to switch IVs and pumps every 3 years, and one  manufacturer we interviewed stated that the investment in time and  money needed to train clinicians in how to use a brand of IV products  makes it inconvenient and disruptive for hospitals to change these  products. A representative from another GPO stated that they often  negotiate longer-term contracts for chemistry analyzers and the  specific reagents that are used with them, and had recently negotiated  a 7-year contract for both the analyzers and reagents together.", "Finally, all 5 GPOs in our review provide a grievance process for vendors  who are not awarded contracts. A representative of one GPO stated that,  when vendors are not awarded a contract and want to know why, GPO  staff debrief the vendor on how to make changes to increase their  chances of being awarded a contract during the next RFP cycle. After this  debrief, a representative of the GPO stated that vendors can file a formal  grievance with the GPO. Another GPO posted on its website that any  vendor may file a grievance within 30 days of the announcement of the  contract award. The website states that the GPO will acknowledge receipt  of the grievance immediately, and provide a detailed response within   90 days, including the GPO\u2019s rationale for the final decision. In addition to  each GPO\u2019s separate grievance processes, HGPII\u2014which GPOs formed  in 2005 in order to promote best practices and public accountability  among member GPOs\u2014also has a formal grievance process that  vendors may use to lodge complaints against GPOs. However, HGPII  representatives told us that no complaints have been formally submitted.  They explained that, while it is possible that there are no vendor  complaints, they believe it is more likely that not enough vendors know  about the grievance process. HGPII representatives stated that they have  brought on board an in-house ethicist to review HGPII\u2019s grievance  process.", "The views of experts and others we interviewed on the effects of GPO  contracting practices varied. For example, some experts and other  stakeholders contend that GPOs\u2019 contracting practices may result in a  reduction in product innovation. Specifically, one expert said that if  manufacturers believe that it is impossible to get onto a GPO contract, but  that such a contract is necessary for market success, then manufacturers  will not innovate and create new products. However, others we  interviewed told us that GPO contracting practices do not block access to  innovative products. For example, all 5 of the largest GPOs reported  using a competitive bidding process as well as contract clauses that allow  for innovative products to be placed on existing contracts. The GPOs in  our review also reported participating in forums to help identify new,  potentially innovative, products in the marketplace. However, they said  vendors of products that are essentially the same as other products  already on GPO contracts need to compete through the competitive  bidding process for the opportunity to be awarded a contract. While  officials from the FTC told us that they continue to receive complaints  each year about the potential anticompetitive effects of GPO contracting  practices\u2014including complaints that GPOs have contributed to recent  shortages of generic injectable drugs\u2014in the last ten years, the FTC has  not initiated any enforcement actions directed at GPO conduct. FTC staff  explained that they have faced significant challenges in investigating  allegations of anticompetitive behavior of GPOs due to a lack of data.  They stated that there are a number of significant methodological  challenges related to conducting a rigorous economic analysis of the  GPO industry.

In addition, all five GPOs reported average fees received  in 2012, weighted by purchasing volume, of around 1 to 2 percent. This  average includes fees from distributors and manufacturers. Because fees  from distributors are often less than 1 percent, average fees from  manufacturers are likely to be higher than the 1 to 2 percent overall  average. In addition, the three GPOs without private-label programs in  2012 reported that the highest vendor fee they received that year was   3 percent.

Some of the literature we reviewed and experts  we interviewed asserted that the vendor fee-based funding structure of  GPOs creates misaligned incentives for them to negotiate higher prices  for medical products in order to increase the amount of vendor fees that  that they receive. Several experts that we interviewed stated that, based  on economic theory, the GPO funding structure creates a principal-agent  problem, in which the GPOs are motivated to act in their own best  interests, rather than the best interests of their customers. These experts  argued that because the GPOs\u2019 compensation increases as prices  increase, the GPOs have little incentive to negotiate lower prices, even  though their customers would benefit from lower prices. Therefore, GPOs  may place greater weight on the administrative and other fees than the  prices of products and services for their customers. According to these  experts, this funding structure\u2014which allows vendors to pay  administrative fees to GPOs\u2014distorts the bidding process and results in  inflated prices for hospitals relative to a funding structure where these  administrative fees are not allowed.", "Other people we interviewed\u2014including some experts and  representatives of the GPOs\u2014stated that competition between GPOs to  retain their customers incentivizes them to negotiate the lowest possible  prices, and mitigates any theoretical principal-agent problem. They  explained that hospitals can switch GPOs anytime if they are not satisfied  with the prices that a GPO is negotiating. Representatives from one  hospital said that hospitals switch GPOs when they merge with larger  systems, but that there are significant costs related to the conversion.  Several experts reported that not only are the largest national GPOs in  intense competition with each other, they are in competition for purchases  made directly from manufacturers, as well as through regional GPOs, and  hospital and health system alliances. Specifically, one expert we  interviewed stated that GPO customers often obtain pricing information  from all possible sources and then selectively choose products and  services they can obtain for the best prices. Another expert told us that  the percentage-based administrative fee structure works well because  GPOs are only compensated for the sales that are made.", "Although some experts have reported potential effects of the GPO  funding structure, empirical data on the effects are limited. We identified  one study that presented empirical data on the effects of the vendor-fee- based GPO funding structure. The authors of this study concluded that,  if the GPO safe harbor provision were eliminated, then GPOs \u201cwould  likely structure their procurement process in a way that elicited more  competitive bidding, resulting in lower prices and greater competition.\u201d In  addition, the authors concluded that altering the GPO funding structure  would not eliminate any efficiencies that GPOs currently offer, such as  reduced transaction costs or consolidated buying power. We also found  other studies that presented empirical data focused more broadly on the  value of GPOs, such as studies that focused on whether GPOs save their  customers money. However, these studies did not include empirical  evidence that directly addressed the effects of the GPO funding structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The GPO Funding Structure May Affect Medicare Payments over Time", "paragraphs": ["The GPO funding structure may affect Medicare payments over time.

According to HHS, these updates rely, in part, on  information reported by hospitals on their Medicare cost reports, which  reflect the hospitals\u2019 costs of medical supplies, including those purchased  through GPOs.", "Moreover, Medicare payments could be affected if hospitals do not  appropriately account for any revenues they receive from GPOs. These  revenues are required to be reported as a reduction in costs on hospitals\u2019  costs reports. All five GPOs in our review reported passing a percentage  of the administrative fees\u2014in some cases, the majority of fees collected  from vendors\u2014on to their customers or owners in 2012.

This represents 70 percent of the $2.3 billion in administrative fees collected in 2012. The amount distributed to  customers and owners ranged from $54 million to $472 million per GPO.  To the extent that administrative fee revenue is not reflected on cost  reports, Medicare could be overpaying hospitals. The extent to which  hospitals are reporting this additional revenue is not known because  HHS-OIG has not reviewed cost reports for this information since 2005.  In addition, CMS officials told us that the agency has not specifically  identified this as information that should be routinely audited by Medicare  Audit Contractors.", "Some experts that we interviewed stated that the potential effects of the  GPO funding structure on Medicare payment rates could be eliminated if  the GPO safe harbor were repealed and GPOs were no longer permitted  to collect fees from vendors. However, experts and representatives from  vendors, GPOs, and hospitals we interviewed stated that there would be  a disruption to hospitals and vendors while they transitioned to a new  supply chain model. Others we interviewed\u2014including GPO  representatives\u2014told us that if the safe harbor were repealed, GPOs  would eventually cease to exist because hospitals would not be able to  afford to pay the fees. However, some hospitals already pay directly for  access to contracts to supplement their existing contracting arrangements  with their GPOs. For example, a wholly-owned subsidiary of one large,  national GPO charges its customers a $50,000 a year subscription fee for  access to a web-based system for viewing hospital supply prices,  negotiating contracts with vendors directly, and tracking their purchases  and contracts online. The company has reported more than $10 billion in  purchasing power from a user base of 600 hospitals in its first year.

However, the GPO funding structure  protected under the safe harbor\u2014specifically, the payment of  administrative fees by vendors based on a percentage of the cost of the  products or services\u2014raises questions about whether GPOs are actually  negotiating the lowest prices. Some experts believe there is an incentive  for GPOs to negotiate higher prices for products and services because  GPO compensation increases as prices increase. However, other  experts, as well as GPOs, stated that there is sufficient competition  between them to mitigate any potential conflicts of interest. Almost   30 years after its passage, there is little empirical evidence to definitively  assess the impact of the vendor-fee-based funding structure protected  under the safe harbor. While repealing the safe harbor could eliminate  misaligned incentives, most agree there would be a disruption while  hospitals and vendors transitioned to new arrangements. Over the longer  term, if the current trend of hospital consolidation continues, the concerns  about these disruptions may be diminished to the extent that large  hospital systems may be in a better position to pay GPOs directly for their  services or negotiate contracts with vendors on their own. Furthermore,  given that some hospitals are already paying a subsidiary of one GPO  directly for access to vendor contracts, alternative approaches are  possible.", "Despite the limited evidence on the impact of the vendor-fee-based  funding structure protected under the safe harbor, there is a potential  impact on the Medicare program. To the extent that the funding structure  has the potential to affect the costs of products and services, periodic  updates of Medicare\u2019s payment rates will incorporate these costs over  time. Additionally, GPOs distribute to their owners and customers\u2014 mostly hospitals\u2014a percentage of the administrative fees they collect  from vendors, in some cases the majority of such fees. Hospitals are  required by federal law to account for this revenue in reports to Medicare,  but that has not always occurred. In 2005, HHS-OIG found that some  GPO customers did not fully account for GPO revenue distributions on  their Medicare cost reports. Subsequently, CMS issued updated guidance  specifying that these distributions must be properly reported, but HHS has  not reviewed cost reports for this information since then.
