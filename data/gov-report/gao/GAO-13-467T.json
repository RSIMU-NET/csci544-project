As you know, the 2007-2009 financial crisis focused attention on  weaknesses in the U.S. regulatory structure, including the lack of an  agency or mechanism responsible for monitoring and addressing risks  across the financial system and a shortage of timely information to  facilitate that oversight. In response to the crisis, Congress passed the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act) in July 2010, which provided for a broad range of regulatory  reforms. Among other things, the act established FSOC to monitor the  stability of the U.S. financial system and take actions to mitigate risks that  might destabilize the system. The Dodd-Frank Act also created OFR to  support FSOC and Congress by providing financial research and data.", "Congress gave FSOC a number of significant authorities to help it  execute its broad mission, including to designate nonbank financial  companies for heightened supervision by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and to require financial  companies to provide data to OFR. Although Congress set up some  specific accountability mechanisms for FSOC and OFR, some members  of Congress have questioned whether more needs to be done to help  ensure that FSOC and OFR use their authorities as Congress intended.", "My testimony today will address four topics: (1) the challenges FSOC and  OFR face in fulfilling their missions; (2) FSOC\u2019s and OFR\u2019s efforts to  establish management structures and mechanisms to carry out their  missions and attain their goals; (3) FSOC\u2019s and OFR\u2019s activities  supporting collaboration among members and external stakeholders,  including international bodies and regulators; and (4) FSOC\u2019s rules for  designating nonbank financial companies that pose threats to financial  stability.", "My remarks are primarily based on our September 2012 report on FSOC  and OFR.

In addition,  we analyzed FSOC policies, procedures, and products to determine  whether and how their collaboration practices compared with key  elements of effective collaboration we have previously identified and to  determine processes FSOC used to issue products. We also interviewed  FSOC and OFR staff; officials from FSOC\u2019s member agencies; and  external stakeholders, including foreign officials, industry trade groups,  and academics. In March 2013, we interviewed Treasury and OFR  officials to obtain updates on the progress FSOC and OFR had made in  implementing our recommendations. The work on which this statement is  based was conducted from November 2011 through September 2012 and  in March 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

As the chairperson of  FSOC, the Secretary of the Treasury has certain powers and  responsibilities related to FSOC\u2019s meetings, rulemakings,  recommendations, and reports and testimony to Congress. The  Secretary, in consultation with the other FSOC members, is also  responsible for regular consultation with the financial regulatory entities  and other appropriate organizations of foreign governments or  international organizations.

First, FSOC\u2019s missions\u2014to  identify risks to U.S. financial stability and respond to emerging threats to  stability\u2014are inherently challenging, for several reasons. Identifying risks  to financial stability is challenging because (1) key indicators, such as  market prices, often do not reflect threats to financial stability; (2) such  threats do not develop in precisely the same way in successive crises; (3)  financial innovations are not well understood; and (4) according to  experts, effectively monitoring and mitigating systemic risk is both vast  and procedurally complex. In addition, actions to preemptively mitigate  emerging threats may appear unnecessary or too costly at the time they  are proposed or taken.", "Second, although the Dodd-Frank Act created FSOC to provide for a  more comprehensive view of threats to U.S. financial stability, it left most  of the fragmented and complex arrangement of independent federal and  state regulators in place and generally preserved their statutory  responsibilities. As a result, FSOC\u2019s effectiveness in providing for a more  comprehensive view of threats to U.S. financial stability hinges to a large  extent on collaboration among its many members, almost all of whom  have their own independent regulatory responsibilities. In testifying on the  coordination of Dodd-Frank rulemakings assigned to specific FSOC  members before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in  October 2011, the chairperson of FSOC recognized this challenge.  However, he also noted that certain agencies were working much more  closely together than before FSOC\u2019s creation. The federal financial  regulators have also emphasized the importance of maintaining their  independence while serving as members of FSOC. For example, several  member agencies noted in our prior work on Dodd-Frank rulemakings  that any effort to coordinate rulemakings assigned to specific agencies  through FSOC would need to be balanced against the statutory  requirements of the independent agencies involved. Regulators have  also pointed to their differing statutory requirements to explain why they  have differing views on policy issues. During the Basel II deliberations  prior to the financial crisis, for instance, U.S. bank regulators\u2014the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Federal Reserve, and the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\u2014each had a different  view of various aspects of those requirements. The regulators traced  their differences back to their specific statutory responsibilities.", "Third, OFR faces the challenge of trying to build a world-class research  organization from the ground up, including acquiring staff with the needed  skills, while meeting its short-term responsibility to support FSOC. The  researchers who supported the creation of OFR suggested that it would  take many years for the new entity to provide the insights that would  ultimately be expected of it. Though OFR now has a confirmed director,  these researchers had also noted that the long absence of a director for  the organization had slowed this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSOC and OFR Could Strengthen Mechanisms to Fully Ensure Accountability and Transparency", "paragraphs": ["FSOC and OFR have taken steps toward meeting the challenges they  face. For example, they have taken steps to build mechanisms to identify  potential threats to financial stability, provide information to the public  about their activities and progress, and establish management and  planning structures.

These steps include setting up the Systemic Risk  Committee\u2014one of the seven standing FSOC committees\u2014that is  responsible for systemic risk monitoring and plays a key role in reviewing  sources of systemic risk. The committee is operating under draft  procedures, with member agency staff suggesting risks or threats that, in  their view, may benefit from interagency coordination.FSOC policy staff, if there is agreement that an issue warrants further  examination, an agency is assigned to develop it, including identifying  vulnerabilities in the financial system. When the committee determines  that the issue is sufficiently developed, it presents the issue to the  Deputies Committee. According to the draft procedures, if issues are  elevated beyond the Deputies Committee to FSOC members, agencies  may respond with a variety of actions, including enhanced monitoring,  additional analysis, the development of potential policy responses, or the  implementation of a particular policy response. Potential threats to  financial stability are also discussed at FSOC meetings; for example,   According to  FSOC officials noted that a teleconference was convened to discuss MF  Global\u2019s bankruptcy.", "OFR participates in the Systemic Risk Committee and is building capacity  to monitor the financial system for threats to financial stability. OFR has  developed the Financial Stability Monitor, a collection of metrics and  indicators related to financial stability that is to be continuously updated,  according to OFR and Treasury officials. According to these officials,  OFR began sharing the Financial Stability Monitor with the Systemic Risk  Committee and FSOC member agency staff in February 2012. OFR is  also assessing options for analyzing risks to financial stability and  produced a working paper in collaboration with outside researchers,  published in January 2012 to survey existing approaches. OFR and FSOC sponsored conferences in December 2011 and  December 2012 to discuss a range of issues related to risks to financial  stability. OFR staff said that they were evaluating a range of metrics and  methods for measuring and analyzing financial markets and systems and  were in the early stages of developing network maps and other tools to  assess financial stability. For example, OFR evaluated 11 measures  against a series of crises over time and reported on some of these efforts  in its 2012 Annual Report.", "Dimitrios Bisias, Mark Flood, Andrew W. Lo, and Stavros Valavanis, A Survey of  Systemic Risk Analytics, Office of Financial Research Working Paper #0001 (Washington,  D.C.: Jan. 15, 2012). positioned to judge which potential threats will benefit from interagency  discussions. FSOC and OFR could improve their efforts to identify risks  and threats by collecting and sharing a common set of financial  indicators. Systematic collection, analysis, and sharing of financial  indicators of key risk factors such as leverage, liquidity, concentrations,  underwriting standards, collateral quality, and delinquencies should  provide insight into vulnerabilities affecting particular types of financial  intermediaries or reveal patterns occurring across the financial system.  OFR, through a mechanism such as the Financial Stability Monitor, could  play a role in collecting, analyzing, and reporting on these indicators. To  improve FSOC\u2019s approaches for monitoring threats to financial stability,  we recommended that FSOC develop an approach that included  systematic sharing of key financial risk indicators across FSOC members  and member agencies to assist in identifying potential threats for further  monitoring or analysis.", "In addition, FSOC does not have sufficient processes for identifying or  prioritizing potential emerging threats to U.S. financial stability for its  annual reports. FSOC\u2019s annual reporting process is an ongoing  responsibility which, in the absence of a strategic plan, functions as its  major strategic planning document and method for communicating with  Congress and the public, especially regarding potential emerging threats  to U.S. financial stability. FSOC\u2019s 2011 and 2012 annual reports generally  addressed the subjects mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. These reports  also provided extensive information about the current economy and  complex issues, such as high-frequency trading and the MF Global  bankruptcy. In addition, the reports contained extensive discussions of  current known threats, such as those associated with money market  funds and the European sovereign-debt crisis, and made some  recommendations to address them. However, FSOC has not developed a  structure that supports having a systematic or comprehensive process for  identifying potential emerging threats. In particular, FSOC does not have  processes for consistently identifying such threats, separating them from  more current threats, or prioritizing them. For instance, certain potential  threats related to U.S. debt are not in the 2011 Annual Report. However,  the 2012 Annual Report identifies the U.S. debt as a potential threat but  does not explain what has changed since the 2011 report. Similarly, the  2011 or 2012 annual reports identify risks, such as those associated with  the European sovereign debt crisis or money market funds, which are  ongoing or have previously been identified as potentially emerging.  Further, FSOC identifies a large number of threats without explicitly  prioritizing them. In contrast, other entities, such as the International  Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, issue reports that explicitly  prioritize potentially significant threats. Treasury and FSOC officials and  staff noted that FSOC\u2019s annual reports have a different purpose and  implicitly prioritize the threats in the recommendations sections of the  reports. As a result of FSOC\u2019s limited processes for identifying and  prioritizing potential emerging threats to financial stability in its annual  reports, policymakers and market participants do not have the information  they need to develop effective and timely responses to those threats.

OFR has also posted key documents  on its web pages, including its annual report, strategic framework, and  updates on recent developments, such as the status of the legal entity  identifier.", "However, FSOC does not keep detailed records of deliberations or  discussions that take place at the council\u2019s meetings or at the committee  level. While no specific level of detail is required for FSOC minutes, the  limited documentation of their discussions makes it difficult to assess  FSOC\u2019s performance. For instance, the minutes typically describe agenda  items for the meetings and information on the presenters for each agenda  item but lack additional detail even when the information being discussed  is not likely to be market sensitive or limit the quality of deliberations. As a  result, the public receives little information about FSOC\u2019s activities and  deliberations, limiting its understanding of these activities.", "FSOC policy officials recognized the need for transparency but also noted  that certain information was protected from disclosure under various  statutes and could not be released. FSOC staff also noted the need to  balance the desire for transparency with the need to provide an  environment that allows for open discussion and deliberation of issues  and policy options. However, similar bodies, such as the Federal Open  Market Committee, publish minutes that provide greater detail, and the  Federal Open Market Committee voluntarily releases transcriptions of its  meetings 5 years after a meeting occurs. As we have previously reported,  transparency is a key feature of accountability even when there is a need  to safeguard certain sensitive information to protect the marketplace. We  recommended that FSOC keep detailed records of closed door sessions  of key meetings.

OFR issued a strategic framework in March  2012 to cover fiscal years 2012-2014 that lists five strategic goals,  including:  supporting FSOC through the secure provision of high-quality financial  data and conducting the analyses needed to monitor threats to  financial stability; developing and promoting data-related standards and best practices; establishing a center of excellence for research on financial stability  and promoting best practices for financial risk management; providing the public with key data and analyses while protecting establishing OFR as an efficient organization and world-class  workplace.", "OFR\u2019s framework also highlights a number of objectives under those  goals and lays out implementation priorities for fiscal year 2012.However, OFR acknowledges that it has not yet put other key elements of  performance management in place, including linking programmatic,  human resources, and budgetary decision making to its strategic goals  and developing a performance measurement system. To support the  growth of OFR into a viable and sustainable entity, we recommended that  OFR build on its strategic framework by further developing its strategic  planning and performance management system so that it linked its  activities to its goals and used publicly available performance measures  to measure its progress. OFR officials said that they had developed  performance measures and planned to describe these in their fiscal year  2014 budget submission.", "In the absence of a strategic plan, FSOC\u2019s annual reports serve as a key  accountability document.

They added that the chairperson  was required to testify annually before Congress on the report, an activity  that served as another accountability mechanism.", "When discussing accountability, FSOC members have noted the  importance of the statement contained in the front of the reports (and  signed by each member) that FSOC is taking reasonable steps to ensure  financial stability and mitigate systemic risk. FSOC members have also  acknowledged the need to follow up on the report\u2019s recommendations,  and FSOC staff noted that recommendations would be monitored by  FSOC as a whole. However, the annual reports do not specify how FSOC  will conduct this monitoring. For example, they do not consistently  designate an FSOC member or members to monitor or implement the  recommendations or establish time frames for certain actions, such as  reporting to the council on the status of recommendations. Treasury  officials noted that the Dodd-Frank Act did not give the chairperson or  council authority to require that independent regulators take action or  impose time frames on member agencies. However, they noted that  some recommendations in the 2012 Annual Report were made to specific  agencies and put greater stress on more immediate action than others.  For example, the 2012 report emphasized the importance of a  recommendation to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to  take action to address money market fund risks by noting that wholesale  short-term funding markets were a critical component of a well-functioning  financial system. FSOC continues to be focused on structural  vulnerabilities in money market funds that could disrupt these markets  and has proposed specific recommendations for addressing these.  However, SEC has not taken further action, and FSOC does not have the  authority to require that its proposals be implemented.", "To improve FSOC\u2019s accountability, we recommended in September 2012  that FSOC should make recommendations in the annual report more  specific by identifying which FSOC member agency or agencies, as  appropriate, were recommended to monitor or implement such actions  within specified time frames. In March 2013, Treasury officials told us that  FSOC had begun the development process for the 2013 annual report  and that our recommendations about the annual reports were provided to  the team assigned to pull together this year\u2019s annual report for their  consideration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FSOC and OFR Have Taken Steps to Collaborate but Could Enhance Their Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act directs FSOC to facilitate information sharing  and coordination among its member agencies and other federal and state  agencies regarding domestic financial services policy development,  rulemaking, examinations, reporting requirements, and enforcement  actions.

In particular, FSOC and OFR held joint conferences in  December 2011 and 2012 to discuss a range of issues related to risks to  financial stability. OFR has also initiated a working paper series in which  OFR researchers have collaborated with outside academics to catalog  systemic risk monitoring systems and ways to improve risk management  at financial institutions. In addition, OFR created the Financial Research  Advisory Committee in November 2012 to solicit advice,  recommendations, analysis, and information from academics,  researchers, industry leaders, government officials, and experts in the  fields of data and technology. Moreover, OFR is working with industry,  foreign government entities, and international bodies to create a legal  entity identifier, which OFR describes as an emerging global standard  that will enable regulators and companies around the world to quickly and  accurately identify parties to financial transactions.", "However, FSOC could do more to promote collaboration and coordination  and apply key practices for successful collaboration that we have  previously identified, such as leveraging resources, agreeing on roles and  responsibilities, and establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies.  For example, FSOC has not taken advantage of opportunities to leverage  resources through its authority to appoint technical and professional  advisory committees. Industry representatives have commented on the  benefits of having industry input through such committees, but to date  FSOC has not established such committees. Moreover, while FSOC  members from federal regulatory agencies are able to draw on staff from  across their agencies, the independent insurance member and state  representatives have limited support structures\u2014a shortcoming that could  be remedied by having other state regulators participate through advisory  councils.", "In addition, FSOC and OFR have not defined their roles and  responsibilities for monitoring risks to the financial system. As noted  earlier, FSOC is tasked with monitoring the financial services marketplace  to identify potential threats to U.S. financial stability, and OFR must  develop and maintain metrics and reporting systems for risks to U.S.  financial stability as well as monitor, investigate, and report on changes in  systemwide risk levels. These responsibilities overlap somewhat, but this  overlap is not unexpected given OFR\u2019s primary mission of supporting  FSOC. The Dodd-Frank Act defines certain responsibilities for FSOC and  OFR, but the lack of clear responsibility for implementation can lead to  duplication, confusion, and gaps in their efforts. This risk is further  compounded by the fact that many FSOC member agencies have risk  analysis and data collection functions associated with their supervisory  responsibilities. Some of these functions are explicitly focused on risks to  financial stability, and some member agencies have created their own  programs to examine them. To the extent that these programs provide  unique information to FSOC, they will be contributing to the overall effort.  However, if not properly coordinated, these separate efforts could be  duplicative, resulting in wasted time and resources. We recommended  that FSOC and OFR clarify responsibility for implementing requirements  to monitor threats to financial stability across FSOC and OFR, including  among FSOC members and member agencies.", "Further, although FSOC has taken action to better coordinate members\u2019  rulemakings, additional action is needed.

It also does  not describe when interagency coordination is required or what happens  when rules conflict with or duplicate each other. We recommended that  FSOC work with federal financial regulators to (1) develop formal  coordination policies that would clarify issues such as the timing of  coordination, the process for soliciting and addressing comments, and  FSOC\u2019s role in facilitating coordination and (2) more fully incorporate the  key practices for successful collaboration that we have previously  identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSOC Has Not Yet Designated Nonbank Financial Companies for Enhanced Supervision", "paragraphs": ["The Dodd-Frank Act gave FSOC the authority to designate financial  market utilities (FMUs) as systemically important if FSOC determines that  the failure of an FMU or a disruption in its functioning could threaten U.S.  financial stability. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act provided FSOC with the  authority to designate nonbank financial companies for supervision by the  Federal Reserve under its enhanced prudential standards. The act  stipulates that FSOC may designate these companies if material financial  distress at that company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration,  interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the company could pose a  threat to U.S. financial stability. While individual designations are not  made through rulemakings, in an effort to be more transparent FSOC has  issued rulemakings for designating FMUs as systematically important and  designating nonbank firms for Federal Reserve supervision. FSOC issued  final rules, which explain the processes and criteria FSOC intends to use  in making the individual designations, in July 2011 and April 2012,  respectively.", "Each rule, with any accompanying interpretive guidance, outlines a  multistage process that FSOC intends to follow in designating these  entities. For example, the interpretive guidance that accompanies the rule  for designating nonbank financial companies for Federal Reserve  supervision includes a number of thresholds that a firm must meet to  move beyond the first stage of the process. Financial companies must  meet a size threshold of $50 billion in assets and one of five other  thresholds, including measures of leverage and debt. In its 2012 Annual  Report, FSOC reported that it had designated eight FMUs as systemically  important. However, FSOC is still engaged in its process for designating  nonbank financial companies, and therefore no company has yet been  designated.", "FSOC is subject to laws and executive orders that require certain  regulatory analyses as part of its rulemaking processes, including the  Paperwork Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as well as  Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. However, FSOC was required to  consider costs and benefits of its FMU and nonbank financial company  rules only as they related to the Paperwork Reduction Act. FSOC did not  conduct a benefit-cost analysis for the rules designating FMUs or  nonbank financial companies because the Office of Management and  Budget determined that these rules were not economically significant.  Treasury officials noted that the rule did not impose substantive  requirements on specific entities but only laid out the process by which  they could become subject to other rules and regulations. In addition,  FSOC member staff noted that the costs and benefits of the designation  were not among the factors that the Dodd-Frank Act directed FSOC to  consider when making a designation.", "Nonetheless, the designations were intended to address certain risks to  financial stability posed by these entities and have the potential to confer  other benefits and costs on the wider economy as well as on the  individual entities designated. For example, some research has shown  that certain large, interconnected financial institutions considered too big  to fail may have lower borrowing costs than would otherwise be  warranted. But being designated would impose a significant regulatory  burden on the designated companies according to some of those who  commented on the nonbank financial company rule during the rulemaking  process. FSOC has some limited processes in place to review its  designations of nonbank financial companies, including an annual review  of material changes for a designated company and a review of the stage  one thresholds stated in dollar terms at least every 5 years. However, it  has not set up processes to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the  overall impact of the designations and to determine whether they are  achieving the intended result.", "Doing a comprehensive analysis to assess whether designations are  having their intended impact of providing greater financial stability and the  extent of any other impacts will be challenging, but FSOC is uniquely  positioned to address that challenge. Establishing a baseline from which  to evaluate the overall impact of various rules will likely be complex  because the impact of being designated will depend on the application of  a number of rules being written by multiple independent regulatory  agencies\u2014Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), FDIC, the  Federal Reserve, and SEC\u2014and issued over a span of time. For  example, the Federal Reserve has not issued final rules on the enhanced  prudential standards that designated nonbank financial companies will be  subject to, but other final rules that will apply to these entities have been  issued. These rules include one on resolution plans or \u201cliving wills\u201d that  was jointly issued by the Federal Reserve and FDIC and that will require  designated nonbank financial companies to prepare resolution plans.  Treasury has also issued a rule that establishes an assessment schedule  for the Financial Research Fund, which finances OFR and FSOC under  the Dodd-Frank Act.conduct cost-benefit analyses that might be useful in establishing a  baseline. Finally, while some regulatory agencies may conduct periodic  retrospective reviews of their rules, these reviews tend to focus only on  the rules issued by their agency.", "Moreover, not all of these agencies are required to  Because FSOC is responsible for designating FMUs and nonbank  financial companies and its member agencies are responsible for writing  the rules that will impact these designated entities, it has certain  advantages in conducting a comprehensive analysis. Moreover, FSOC  can rely on OFR for some data collection and analysis. However, FSOC  members would need to collaborate on such an assessment, because  FSOC policy and OFR staff, who are Treasury employees, may not have  access to all of the needed information. In addition, collaboration is  needed because, according to Treasury officials, it would be inappropriate  for FSOC staff to review rules drafted by independent agencies unless  those agencies agreed to participate in the comprehensive  assessment. Without such an assessment, decision makers may not  have the information they will need to determine whether designating new  entities for enhanced supervision and other requirements and restrictions  is addressing a perceived gap in the regulatory system and improving the  stability of the financial system or whether policy changes should be  considered. To strengthen the accountability of FSOC\u2019s decisions, FSOC  should establish a collaborative and comprehensive framework for  assessing the impact of decisions for designating FMUs and nonbank  financial companies on those entities and the wider economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 2 \u00bd years, FSOC and OFR have made progress in  establishing their operations and approaches for monitoring threats to  financial stability. Both entities have also worked to establish  accountability and transparency mechanisms and promote collaboration  among FSOC members and with external stakeholders. However, as we  reported in September 2012, continued efforts are needed. We made 10  recommendations to FSOC and OFR to strengthen the accountability and  transparency of their decisions and activities as well as enhance  collaboration among FSOC members and with external stakeholders.", "In its November 2012 response to our report and recommendations,  Treasury noted that FSOC and OFR had considered the  recommendations. In March 2013, Treasury officials described steps that  each entity was considering or taking to address some of the  recommendations, such as reviewing FSOC\u2019s transparency policy and  updating the websites. Although fully addressing the recommendations  will likely take time, doing so will help FSOC and OFR shed more light on  their decision making and activities and allow Congress to hold them  accountable for results. Furthermore, addressing our recommendations  can help FSOC and OFR enhance collaboration among FSOC\u2019s  members and with external stakeholders, activities that are critical to their  ability to achieve their missions. We will continue to monitor FSOC\u2019s and  OFR\u2019s progress in implementing our recommendations and stand ready  to assist Congress as it continues its oversight of these entities.", "Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
