However, Gulf War reports pointed out that medical personnel were unprepared to provide combat casualty care. These reports questioned the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) ability to meet its wartime medical mission, particularly in providing care to the predicted number of casualties. A major area of concern was that many military medical personnel lacked sufficient training or experience in wartime skills, such as trauma care.", "Few military medical personnel receive hands-on training for trauma care, which includes treating actual patients who have incurred severe injuries. Instead, most medical readiness training is provided through formal classroom instruction and field exercises. In peacetime, medical personnel have little chance to practice their battlefield trauma care skills because most patient care provided in military treatment facilities bears little resemblance to injuries treated in wartime. For example, the most common wounded-in-action injury is an open penetrating wound, whereas the most common peacetime diagnosis is a single live birth. In fact, none of the 50 most frequent peacetime diagnoses at military medical centers match a wounded-in-action condition. Appendix I describes the top five wounded-in-action injuries, nonbattlefield injuries, and diseases and the top five diagnoses seen in military treatment facilities in fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Gulf War Studies Highlighted the Need to Improve Trauma Care Training", "paragraphs": ["DOD lessons learned after the Gulf War highlighted that many medical personnel had little to no experience in taking care of severely injured patients. For example, of the 16 surgeons on the Navy hospital ship  USNS Mercy, only 2 had recent trauma surgical experience. Also, none of the over 100 corpsmen at a surgical support company had ever seen actual advanced trauma life support given to a trauma patient. In addition, an Army report highlighted that surgical teams identified to complement the rapid movement of troops during the war and provide emergency surgical services consisted of physicians who were not surgeons, such as obstetrician/gynecologists. An Army trauma surgeon deployed to the area believed that an obstetrician could not have provided lifesaving definitive surgery.", "In 1992 and 1993, we issued reports on medical readiness weaknesses identified during the Gulf War. These reports highlighted that some medical personnel were not trained to take care of combat casualties. For example, although Navy nurses and physicians who were deployed to the war were described as experienced and competent, many of them had never treated trauma patients, and most had not completed training in combat casualty care. The prolonged buildup of forces over a 6-month period allowed Navy personnel to perform medical training, such as refresher resuscitative skills, mass casualty drills, and triage procedures. Also, one report noted that a slot for an Army thoracic (chest) surgeon was filled by a gynecologist who admitted that he was not qualified for the position because he had never opened a human chest cavity.", "A July 1995 Congressional Budget Office report on restructuring military medical care, prepared at the request of the House Committee on National Security, indicated that the military services may need to establish affiliations with level I civilian trauma centers to improve wartime medical training and broaden exposure to wounded-in-action injuries. Level I centers provide total care for the most severely injured trauma patients.Many injuries seen in these centers are similar to the injuries seen in war. Only 2 of DOD\u2019s 115 military hospitals are level I trauma centers. These centers are Brooke Army Medical Center and Wilford Hall Medical Center, both located in San Antonio, Texas.", "In March 1995, Congress held hearings on DOD wartime and peacetime medical requirements, including medical readiness training weaknesses.

Historical data from past conflicts shows that medical treatment, including nonsurgical, makes a significant contribution to the decrease in loss of lives and limbs during this critical period.", "Initial care of a wounded soldier is provided by self-aid or a fellow soldier administering first aid. The first medically trained team that responds to battlefield injuries\u2014known as first responders\u2014includes enlisted medical personnel, such as combat medics, field corpsmen, and independent duty corpsmen, and a physician assistant or a physician. These personnel move with the combat units they support and provide medical care limited to emergency procedures that prevent death, such as establishing an airway, controlling hemorrhaging, administering intravenous fluids, and stabilizing wounds and fractures.", "Forward surgical teams, which consist of physicians (especially surgeons), nurses, and medical technicians, also provide care for those severely injured on the battlefield.

After 4 years of medical school, physicians receive specialized training in graduate medical education or residency programs. Residents in a surgical specialty are required to perform a rotation in trauma and critical care to become board-certified general surgeons. This rotation provides the resident experience with hands-on management and treatment of severely injured trauma patients. Much of this trauma training occurs in civilian facilities because DOD has only two level I trauma centers that receive severe trauma patients. After physicians complete residency training, no formal DOD or service hands-on training program exists for sustaining trauma care skills. Although there is no requirement in the civilian sector for continuing hands-on experience, the American College of Surgeons suggests that surgeons treat about 50 severe trauma cases per year to remain adequately trained in trauma care.", "Enlisted medical personnel, such as combat medics and field corpsmen, receive initial medical readiness training in both basic military and life support skills. The military skills courses teach technical, tactical, and leadership training necessary for personnel to function as part of a medical team in a war environment, and the basic life support course teaches necessary medical skills. For example, the entry-level course for Army medics includes about 150 hours of classroom training devoted to basic emergency medical skills and a field exercise at the conclusion of the class. However, the medics do not receive hands-on trauma experience at a hospital or on board an ambulance.", "Before deployment, both military physicians and enlisted medical personnel are required to take courses on combat casualty care, which focuses on the military casualty management system and casualty care in a battlefield environment.

This affiliation had consisted of Navy general surgery residents training at the local trauma center and two Navy trauma-trained surgeons on call at the civilian trauma center about 3 to 4 nights per month. In addition, a Navy surgeon at Portsmouth had been involved in the Combat Trauma Surgical Committee, which established the standards for trauma surgery sustainment training. No other sites were proposed by the Navy.", "According to Health Affairs and service officials, other sites were informally suggested but were deemed unacceptable because they were either military treatment facilities, instead of civilian centers, or graduate medical education programs, instead of sustainment training programs. Other suggestions had limitations. For example, the Army initially suggested a trauma sustainment program based in Georgia but then did not support it because the surgeon in charge of the program was deployed to Bosnia for a year. The Air Force suggested Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston; however, its current program for general surgeons only consists of observation and no hands-on experience. Because of the limitations of these and other possibilities, Health Affairs requested that the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth conduct the DOD demonstration program. In October 1997, the medical center signed an agreement with Eastern Virginia Medical School to obtain sustainment trauma training for Navy general surgeons at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

First, Health Affairs officials explained that the delay was partly due to shifting responsibility for the program between its offices. The program started in the Clinical Services office because Health Affairs thought trauma care training was a peacetime training issue. When Health Affairs realized that trauma care training was actually a wartime medical readiness training issue, it transferred responsibility for the program to its Health Services Operations and Readiness office.", "Second, Health Affairs was examining whether it could use in-house trauma training programs at DOD\u2019s two trauma centers\u2014Brooke Army Medical Center and Wilford Hall Medical Center\u2014to fulfill the legislative mandate. The officials stated that these two military centers could train the whole trauma team and not just general surgeons. However, Health Affairs realized that this training would not meet the requirement of the law because the training would not take place in civilian trauma centers. In addition, according to Brooke and Wilford Hall officials, their military centers do not have the trauma volume to train military personnel that are not already permanently assigned there.", "Third, Health Affairs officials wanted to determine minimum training standards for general surgeons before the start of the program. According to DOD officials, consensus on the minimum number of cases and the amount of time needed in training was difficult to reach. Agreeing and publishing DOD\u2019s recommendation for the minimum training standards for trauma surgery took from August 1996, when the Combat Trauma Surgical Committee was convened, to February 1997. According to a Committee official, consensus took a long time because (1) no civilian standards existed on how many cases per year a surgeon needs to manage to be adequately trained in trauma and (2) the length of training that is both reasonable and doable was difficult to determine, given DOD\u2019s conflicting medical missions.", "Finally, DOD did not want the implementation of the demonstration program to interfere with other Naval Medical Center Portsmouth trauma training at the civilian center. Specifically, from May to October of each year, senior surgical residents from Naval Medical Center Portsmouth train for 3 months at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. During this rotation, the surgical residents function as trauma team leaders. The official responsible for the demonstration program did not want to send general surgeons for sustainment training at the hospital at the same time as senior surgical resident training because the number of cases that could be managed by each group would be lessened.", "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Operations and Readiness was not concerned about the late implementation of the demonstration program because he believed that 6 months would be adequate to determine the feasibility of training surgeons in a civilian trauma center.

We agree with DOD that the demonstration program and the other individual trauma training programs have shown that it is feasible to train general surgeons in civilian trauma centers and that additional data is needed for other military medical personnel. The general surgeons who have trained in the civilian centers have been given opportunities to perform hands-on procedures on severely injured patients and participate in decision-making skills. Many of the trainees stated that the training in the civilian centers renewed their confidence for treating severely wounded patients. Even though the demonstration program and the other initiatives have shown that it is possible to train surgeons in civilian trauma centers, the impact on the delivery of DOD peacetime health care when the program is expanded DOD-wide is still unknown.", "DOD stated that it plans to negotiate a new agreement with Sentara Norfolk General Hospital to provide trauma care training. DOD also agreed with our recommendation to facilitate development of an evaluation tool to help in the assessment of the effectiveness of trauma care training. DOD plans to expand this evaluation to include other individual trauma care training programs beyond the demonstration program. DOD also plans to establish panels to determine trauma care sustainment training needs for military medical personnel in addition to those created for general surgeons. Regarding our recommendation that DOD develop a long-term strategic plan that establishes goals and identifies actions and appropriate milestones, DOD stated that, in February 1998, the Combat Trauma Surgical Committee reconvened to coordinate with the services to develop and implement trauma care training plans for both the active and reserve components that are directed toward building a long-term strategy.", "DOD stated that potential military training sites for reserve personnel could include the three military treatment facilities in Texas that treat trauma patients\u2014Brooke Army, Wilford Hall, and William Beaumont Army Medical Centers. However, we believe that these facilities may not be viable training sites because their low volume of trauma admissions and their current staffing levels preclude the centers from providing sustainment training for military medical personnel not already assigned there.", "DOD also stated it has specific concerns regarding (1) the additional costs for licensure and credentialing of providers, (2) costs for additional civilian trauma training opportunities, and (3) the sustainment costs of what will have to become a new readiness mission. We did not identify any significant financial impact regarding the demonstration program. For example, only nominal costs were incurred for trainee licenses. In addition, due to the close proximity of the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, no travel or temporary duty costs were incurred for the trainees. Finally, no additional staffing was required at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth to cover patient workload. We recognize that cost is a factor that DOD must consider in selecting civilian training locations. We note that the extent to which DOD might incur additional costs depends on the agreement reached between the military organization and the specific civilian site selected."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
