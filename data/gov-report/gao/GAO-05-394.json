The Coast Guard and other agencies have sought to further enhance information sharing and port security operations by establishing interagency operational centers--command centers that tie together the efforts of federal and nonfederal participants.

At the four port locations GAO visited, federal and nonfederal stakeholders said that the newly formed committees were an improvement over previous information sharing efforts. The types of information shared included assessments of vulnerabilities at port locations and strategies the Coast Guard intends to use in protecting key infrastructure. The three interagency operational centers established to date allow for even greater information sharing because the centers operate on a 24-hour-a-day basis, and they receive real-time information from data sources such as radars and sensors. The Coast Guard is planning to develop its own centers--called sector command centers--at up to 40 additional port locations to monitor information and to support its operations. The relationship between the interagency operational centers and the planned expansion of sector command centers remains to be determined. The major barrier hindering information sharing has been the lack of federal security clearances for nonfederal members of committees or centers. By February 2005--or 4 months after the Coast Guard developed a list of 359 committee members who needed a security clearance--28 of the 359 members had submitted the necessary paperwork for a security clearance. Coast Guard field officials did not clearly understand that they were responsible for contacting nonfederal officials about the clearance process. To deal with this, in early April 2005, the Coast Guard issued guidance to field offices that clarified their role. In addition, the Coast Guard did not have formal procedures that called for the use of data to monitor application trends. Developing such procedures would aid in identifying deficiencies in the future. As the Coast Guard proceeds with its program, another way to improve the submission of paperwork involves educating nonfederal officials about the clearance process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s ports against a potential terrorist attack has become  one of the nation\u2019s security priorities since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001. Factors that make ports vulnerable to a terrorist  attack include their location near major urban centers, such as New York  and Los Angeles; their inclusion of critical infrastructure such as oil  refineries and terminals; and their economic importance for the nation\u2019s  economy and trade. Although no port-related terrorist attacks have  occurred in the United States, internationally terrorists have demonstrated  their ability to access and destroy infrastructure, assets, and lives in and  around seaports. According to the Coast Guard, a major port closure for 1  month could cost tens of billions of dollars, disrupting trade and the U.S.  economy as a whole.", "Given that ports are sprawling enterprises that often cross jurisdictional  boundaries, the need to share information among federal, state, and local  agencies is central to effective prevention and response. The Homeland  Security Act of 2002, which provided the basis for federal efforts against  terrorism in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, underscores the  importance of sharing timely, effective, and useful information to enhance  the shared partnership among federal, state, and local entities in the fight  against terrorism. The act recognizes that sharing information with state  and local officials can improve the capability of nonfederal officials to  deter, prevent, or disrupt a possible terrorist attack.", "Since the terrorist attacks, the federal government has taken a number of  approaches designed to enhance information sharing. One of these  approaches, called for under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of  2002 (MTSA), was to provide the Coast Guard with authority for creating  area maritime security committees at the port level. These committees\u2014 which were to include representatives from the federal, state, local, and  private sectors\u2014were intended as a way to identify and deal with  vulnerabilities in and around ports, as well as to provide a forum for  sharing information on issues related to port security. Much of the  federally generated information about port security\u2014such as assessments  of specific port vulnerabilities or information about potential threats being  monitored\u2014is classified national security information and cannot be  released, even to law enforcement personnel, if they have not undergone  the necessary federal background checks and received a security  clearance. Lacking access to such information, nonfederal officials may be  at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat.", "As another approach to improving information sharing and port security  operations, various federal agencies, including the Department of  Homeland Security (through the U.S. Coast Guard), the Department of the  Navy, and the Department of Justice (DOJ), have developed interagency  operational centers at certain port locations. These centers are command  posts that tie together the intelligence and operational efforts of various  federal and nonfederal participants. They currently exist in three  locations: Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Diego,  California. Congress has expressed interest in knowing more about the  applicability of such centers in other locations, and it required the Coast  Guard to submit a report by February 2005 that describes, among other  things, the number of ports that could benefit from such centers and the  associated cost of implementing them.", "The experience gleaned to date from both of these approaches to  improving information sharing represents an opportunity that could help  guide future efforts to improve port security. Therefore, we examined the  efforts of the Coast Guard and other federal agencies in improving  information sharing between and among federal, state, local, and industry  stakeholders. This report addresses the following questions:    What impact have area maritime security committees had on  information sharing?", "What impact have interagency operational centers had on information  sharing?", "What barriers, if any, have hindered improvements in information  sharing among port security stakeholders?", "To answer these questions, we focused much of our work at the port level.  To review the activities of area maritime security committees, we selected  four ports for detailed review. These four ports\u2014Baltimore, Maryland;  Charleston, South Carolina; Houston, Texas; and Seattle, Washington\u2014 were selected to reflect various coastal regions and a wide range of  volume and types of operations. To review the activities of the interagency  operational centers, we visited all three centers currently in operation,  discussing ways in which the centers operate with both federal and  nonfederal participants as well as observing operations at the centers.  During our visits, we talked with Coast Guard officials involved in sharing  information and we also discussed information sharing issues with  numerous nonfederal stakeholders, including private sector officials and  officials from port authorities or local law enforcement. We examined in  more detail the Coast Guard\u2019s procedures for processing security  clearances for members of area maritime security committees. We also  reviewed legislation and congressional committee reports related to  information sharing, reviewed numerous other documents and reports on  the issue, and spoke with officials at the Coast Guard and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about their approaches to sharing  information with nonfederal entities.

Ports  are used to import and export cargo worth hundreds of billions of dollars,  generating jobs, both directly and indirectly, for Americans and our  trading partners. Ports, which include inland waterways, are used to move  bulk agricultural, mineral, petroleum, and paper products. In addition,  ports are also used to move cargo containers (as shown in fig. 1)\u2014one of  the most important segments of global commerce, accounting for 90  percent of the world\u2019s maritime cargo. In 2002, approximately 7 million  containers arrived in U.S. seaports, carrying more than 95 percent of the  nation\u2019s non-North American trade by weight and 75 percent by value.  Ports also contribute to the economy through recreational activities such  as boating, fishing, and cruises. As an indication of the economic  importance of ports, a 2002 simulation of a terrorist attack at a port led to  the temporary closure of every seaport in the United States and resulted in  an estimated loss of $58 billion in revenue to the U.S. economy, including  spoilage, loss of sales, manufacturing slowdowns, and halts in production.  Ports are also important to national security because they host naval bases  and vessels, facilitate the movement of military equipment, and supply  troops deployed overseas.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, the nation\u2019s 361 seaports have  been increasingly viewed as potential targets for future terrorist attacks.  Ports are vulnerable because they are sprawling, interwoven with complex  transportation networks, close to crowded metropolitan areas, and easily  accessible. Ports and their maritime approaches facilitate a unique  freedom of movement and flow of goods while allowing people, cargo, and  vessels to transit with relative anonymity. Because of their accessibility,  ports are vulnerable to a wide variety of types of attacks. Cargo  containers\u2014mentioned above as important to maritime commerce\u2014are a  potential conduit for terrorists to smuggle weapons of mass destruction or  other dangerous materials into the country.

The committees also serve as a link for  communicating threats and disseminating security information to port  stakeholders. In all, the Coast Guard ultimately organized 43 area maritime  security committees, covering the nation\u2019s 361 ports.

For  example, a primary function served by the committees was to develop  security plans for port areas\u2014called area maritime security plans. The  goal of these plans was to identify vulnerabilities to a terrorist attack in  and around a port location and to develop strategies for protecting a wide  range of facilities and infrastructure (as shown in fig. 2). In doing so, the  committees established new procedures for sharing information by  holding meetings on a regular basis, issuing electronic bulletins on  suspicious activities around port facilities, and sharing key documents,  including vulnerability assessments and the portwide security plan itself,  according to committee participants. These activities did not exist prior to  the creation of the committees, and they have contributed to the  improvements in information sharing. The area maritime security plan  provides a framework for communication and coordination among port  stakeholders and law enforcement officials, and identifies strategies for  reducing vulnerabilities to security threats in and near ports. It is designed  to capture the information necessary to coordinate and communicate  security procedures at each maritime security level, complement and  encompass facility and vessel security plans, and ultimately be integrated  into the National Maritime Security Plan. Coast Guard officials and  nonfederal stakeholders we contacted agreed that efforts such as these  have improved information sharing.", "Committee participants we spoke with noted that an essential component  that has improved the timeliness of information sharing has been the  development of both formal and informal stakeholder networks resulting  from the formation of area maritime security committees. As part of the  process for developing the plan, the committee identifies critical  stakeholders and assembles their contact information, allowing for timely  dissemination of relevant information. For example, in the event the Coast  Guard learns of a potential and credible threat, the committee would  designate who should be contacted, the order in which members should  be contacted, and what information the committee provides or receives.  Participants in the committees told us that the interactions of committee  members have also led to the formation of informal stakeholder networks  as committee members encounter other stakeholders with similar  concerns and perspectives. The committee also provides a forum for real- time sharing of information between stakeholders through meetings or  electronic communications. For example, our discussions with federal and  nonfederal officials at the ports of Charleston and Houston indicated that  committee members representing private industries were granted access  to daily information bulletins that they had not received prior to the  formation of area maritime security committees, and these information  bulletins have allowed them to stay informed of important Coast Guard  decisions. In Houston, the Captain of the Port has used such bulletins to  notify and inform local stakeholders of unannounced drills, changes in  security levels, and Coast Guard guidance for vessel inspections and  voluntary screening. In Charleston, bulletins have been used to share  information on closure of waterways, release of new regulations, and  methods for preventing a possible terrorist attack.", "At the ports we visited, committee members noted that their participation  has allowed them to disseminate more complete information and receive  more useful information in return. Committee members representing the  private sector at two of the ports we visited noted an increased willingness  to disclose vulnerabilities to federal stakeholders with confidence that the  information would be protected. Coast Guard officials noted that access to  more complete information regarding vulnerabilities and threats at  individual facilities has aided them in mitigating risks. Additionally, having  a complete view of vulnerabilities at the port as a whole has been useful in  identifying gaps and common security needs. For example, while private  sector stakeholders are sharing their written assessments of their  vulnerabilities with the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard is, in turn, sharing  its strategies for the overall protection of ports against potential terrorist  activities. State and local port authority operators and private sector  stakeholders commented that the committees have increased their  awareness of security issues around the port and that information received  from the Coast Guard has been useful in identifying and addressing  security concerns at their facilities. Efforts at sharing information prior to  the creation of area maritime security committees had not produced such  effects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committees Have Flexibility in Their Structure and in the Way in Which They Share Information", "paragraphs": ["While the committees are required to follow the same guidance regarding  their structure, purpose, and processes, each of the committees is allowed  the flexibility to assemble and operate in a way that reflects the needs of  its port area. Each port is unique in many ways, including the geographic  area covered and the type of operations that take place there. These port- specific differences influence the number of members that participate, the  types of state and local organizations that members represent, and the way  in which information is shared.", "One aspect of this flexibility is the way in which information is channeled  to specific stakeholders. The representation of various stakeholders on a  committee can cause differences in the type of information that is shared.  While committee members from federal agencies may have access to  classified information because they have obtained a security clearance,  other members may receive a sanitized version of the information or be  restricted from participating in certain committee meetings. To mitigate  this situation, some committees have formed subcommittees that deal  with classified materials such as intelligence reports or details of military  deployments. The role stakeholders play in protecting strategic assets or  the type of cargo they handle may also affect what types of information  they receive as well as what types of information they can share with the  committee at large. For example, at one port we visited, the details  regarding a shipment of a sensitive material were restricted to committee  members that had a direct involvement in the operation.", "The committees also show marked differences in how their meetings  occur, and these differences in turn affect the specific ways in which  information is shared. For example, at Baltimore, officials told us that  committee meetings are open to the general port community and can draw  over 80 participants in addition to the 48 committee members. Coast  Guard officials told us that such a large attendance made it difficult to  conduct committee business. To include all interested stakeholders in the  information network while maintaining a working structure for the  committee, the Captain of the Port designated 17 members to an executive  committee, while the remaining 31 members served on a general  committee. This structure allowed the committee to incorporate a large  amount of stakeholder input and to share information with all interested  parties while keeping the decision making duties of the committee at a  manageable level. In contrast to Baltimore\u2019s 48 members, the Puget Sound  area maritime security committee consists of 25 members who each share  in decision making. The smaller committee allows for greater familiarity  amongst members as well as immediate decision making at meetings  because stakeholders with decision making authority are all present.", "At least two of the other committees we reviewed leveraged existing  information sharing networks, such as trade and industry associations, by  having Coast Guard officials participate in these groups. For example, at  Charleston, Coast Guard officials noted that many of the stakeholders  included on the area maritime security committee were already members  of a local maritime association that had been operating since 1926.  Officials from the Coast Guard and other federal agencies are members of  the association and use the group\u2019s meetings as one way of sharing  information with stakeholders. Coast Guard officials noted that while this  approach may reduce the role and level of participation in the committee,  it avoids duplication of efforts and allows the committee to be part of a  broader information sharing network. At the port of Houston, the strong  presence of the petrochemical industry also made sharing information  easier since an association of petrochemical companies was already in  place, according to local petrochemical and Coast Guard officials.", "Regardless of the structures and communication networks a committee  adopted, stakeholders at all four locations we reviewed agreed that the  committees fostered improved information sharing. We were not able,  however, to determine if any of these structures worked better than others  for two reasons. First, the different structures reflected the specific needs  of each port location.

The Coast Guard is developing plans to develop its  own centers, called sector command centers, as part of an effort to  reorganize and improve its awareness of the maritime domain. Some of  these sector command centers may be interagency on either a regular or  an ad hoc basis.

In contrast, interagency operational centers can provide  continuous information about maritime activities and involve various  agencies directly in operational decisions using this information. Radar,  sensors, and cameras offer representations of vessels and facilities. Other  data are available from intelligence sources, including data on vessels,  cargo, and crew. For example:  In Charleston, four federal agencies (DOJ, Coast Guard, U.S. Customs  and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement) coordinate in a unified command structure, and each of  these agencies feeds information into the center. Eight state or local  agencies (such as the county sheriff and the state\u2019s law enforcement  division) have participants at the center full-time, and eight others  participate on an as-needed or part-time basis. Federal and nonfederal  officials told us that information sharing has improved, since  participants from multiple agencies are colocated with each other and  work together to identify potential threats by sharing information.", "In San Diego, the center is located in a Coast Guard facility that  receives information from radars and sensors operated by the Navy and  cameras operated by the local harbor patrol.

A Coast Guard  Field Intelligence Support Team is colocated at the center and shares  information related to the large concentration of naval and commercial  vessels in and around the port area with Navy and Coast Guard  personnel.

Unlike the  area maritime security committees, these centers are operational in  nature\u2014that is, they have a unified or joint command structure designed  to receive information and act on it. In the three centers, representatives  from the various agencies work side by side, each having access to  databases and other sources of information from their respective agencies.  The various information sources can be reviewed together, and the  resulting information can be more readily fused together. Officials said  such centers help leverage the resources and authorities of the respective  agencies. For example, federal and nonfederal participants collaborate in  vessel boarding, cargo examination, and other port security  responsibilities, such as enforcing security zones (as shown in fig. 3). If the  Coast Guard determines that a certain vessel should be inspected on  maritime safety grounds and intends to board it, other federal and  nonfederal agencies might join in the boarding to assess the vessel or its  cargo, crew, or passengers for violations relating to their areas of  jurisdiction or responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations across Centers Affect Information Sharing", "paragraphs": ["The types of information and the way information is shared varies at the  three centers, depending on their purpose and mission, leadership and  organization, membership, technology, and resources, according to  officials at the centers.

The Norfolk center has a port security purpose, but its  mission focuses primarily on force protection for the Navy. It is led by the  Coast Guard, and its membership includes two federal agencies and no  state or local agencies. As a result, the Charleston center shares  information that focuses on law enforcement and intelligence related to  port security among a very broad group of federal, state, and local agency  officials. The San Diego center shares information on a broader scope of  activities (beyond security) among a smaller group of federal and local  agency officials. The Norfolk center shares the most focused information  (security information related to force protection) among two federal  agencies.

The San Diego and Norfolk centers have an array of  standard and new Coast Guard technology systems and access to Coast  Guard and various national databases, while the Charleston center has  these as well as additional systems and databases. For example, the  Charleston center has access to and shares information on Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s databases on incoming cargo containers from the  National Targeting Center. In addition, Charleston has a pilot project with  the Department of Energy to test radiation detection technology, which  provides additional information to share. The Charleston center is funded  by a special appropriation that allows it to use federal funds to pay for  state and local agency salaries. This arrangement boosts the participation  of state and local agencies, and thus information sharing beyond the  federal government, according to port stakeholders in Charleston.

The task force meets regularly  to monitor potential migration events, update the contingency plan, and  otherwise coordinate its activities. When a mass migration event occurs,  the task force is activated and becomes a full-time interagency effort to  share information and coordinate operations to implement the  contingency plan. This task force was activated in February 2004 to  implement Operation Able Sentry to interdict a mass migration from Haiti.", "Another example of an interagency arrangement for information sharing  can occur in single-agency operational centers that become interagency to  respond to specific events.

While  these centers normally focus on a variety of Coast Guard missions and are  not normally interagency in structure, they have established protocols  with other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection and  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to activate a unified or incident  command structure should it be needed. For example, the interagency  Operation Able Sentry (discussed above) was directed from the Coast  Guard\u2019s District Seven command center. Similarly, to respond to a  hijacking of a ship, an interagency operation was directed from the Coast  Guard\u2019s Sector Miami command center. While an interagency operation  might be directed from these Coast Guard command centers, it might be  led by another agency with greater interests or resources to respond to an  event. For example, this was the case with a recent interagency operation  to arrange for the security of dignitaries at an international conference in  Miami that was led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. These  Coast Guard centers make it possible to host interagency operations  because they have extra space and equipment that allow for surge  capabilities and virtual connectivity with each partner agency.", "Officials from the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and  Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Miami all said that these ad hoc  interagency arrangements were crucial to sharing information and  coordinating operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Plans to Develop Sector Command Centers at Ports", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is planning to develop its own operational centers\u2014 called sector command centers\u2014at additional ports.

For fiscal year 2006, the Coast  Guard is requesting funds that support its plans to improve awareness of  the maritime domain by, among other things, continuing to evaluate the  potential expansion of sector command centers to other port locations.  For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request includes $5.7 million to  continue developing a nationwide maritime monitoring system, the  common operational picture. The common operational picture is primarily  a computer software package that fuses data from different sources, such  as radar, sensors on aircraft, and existing information systems. The Coast  Guard has also requested funding for training personnel in common  operational picture deployment at command centers and to modify  facilities to implement the picture in command centers. While the total  cost of operating command centers is still unknown, the Coast Guard\u2019s  Five-Year Capital Investment Plan shows that the capital costs of this  effort amount to an estimated $400 million, with acquisition of the system  estimated to start in fiscal year 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Report Pending on Interagency Operational Centers", "paragraphs": ["The relationship between the interagency operational centers and the  Coast Guard\u2019s sector command centers has not been determined yet.

Here are several examples:    An official of the Washington State Ferries who participates on the  Puget Sound area maritime security committee said that not having a  security clearance\u2014and therefore the ability to access classified  information\u2014affected his ability to carry out security-related  activities. He noted that the local U.S. Attorney reported to a local  newspaper in the summer of 2004 that suspicious activities had been  reported on the state ferry system. The Washington State Ferries  official indicated that he or his staff was the source for some of the  data but that federal officials would not provide him with more details  on the activities because he did not have a security clearance. A Coast  Guard field intelligence official corroborated this by stating that the  Captain of the Port was unable to share classified information from the  U.S. Attorney\u2019s office that indicated a pattern of incidents involving the  ferries. Although Coast Guard officials said they wanted to share this  information, ferry officials\u2019 lack of a federal security clearance  precluded them from doing so.

At the center in San Diego, the chief of the local harbor patrol  noted that the lack of security clearances was an issue for patrol staff who  are involved in the center. Subsequent to raising this issue, DHS sponsored  security clearances for 18 harbor patrol officials. At the center in  Charleston, participants in the interagency operational center cited the  lack of security clearances as a potential barrier to information sharing.  The Department of Justice addressed this potential barrier by granting  security clearances to nonfederal officials involved in the center.

For  example, according to this official, membership on area maritime security  committees changes over time, and it would be helpful to have guidance  on the process for obtaining additional security clearances or dropping  clearances for officials who no longer participate on the committees or  who no longer have a need to know classified information. This official  noted that the process differed depending on whether a committee  participant is considered to be a military or civilian official.", "In early February 2005, we expressed our concerns about the security  clearance program to Coast Guard officials.

In a similar security clearance  program, the experience of the FBI shows the utility of data as a tool for  managing the program. For example, FBI officials indicated that its  databases have served as management tools for tracking state, local, and  industry security applications and for monitoring application trends and  percentages. The Coast Guard has yet to develop formal procedures for  using its data on committee participants as a tool to assess potential  problems and to take appropriate action, if necessary.

In  addition, we reviewed Coast Guard documents related to information  sharing, such as data on the number of nonfederal officials who had  received security clearances, guidance from Coast Guard headquarters to  field offices, and other pertinent instructions. In regard to this database,  we checked the reliability of the database for the four ports we visited and  found that the database was generally accurate. We found that 24 of the 27  entries were correct. In addition, we reviewed prior GAO reports that dealt  with information sharing issues. Finally, we interviewed 64 federal and  nonfederal stakeholders at the four ports we visited and asked them  whether there were any barriers to information sharing. The results of our  interviews cannot be projected to all participants on the area maritime  security committees.", "Our review was conducted from May 2004 to March 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Stakeholder Groups Recommended for Membership on Area Maritime Security Committees", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides information on the Coast Guard\u2019s guidance for  developing the local membership and organization of the area maritime  security committee. The Coast Guard\u2019s guidance directs the Captain of the  Port to take into account all aspects of each port area and its adjacent  waterways and coastal areas. The committees should be composed of  federal, state, and local agencies; law enforcement and security agencies;  and port stakeholders. Representatives for each aspect of the port and  those charged with its regulation or enforcement should be encouraged to  participate.

Table 2 lists departments  and agencies/components (including the Coast Guard) that potentially  play a role in disseminating maritime threat information to, and receiving  information from, area maritime security committees and interagency  operational centers.", "The Coast Guard, as the lead in domestic maritime security, plays a central  role in maritime threat information sharing and has a robust presence at  the national, regional, and port levels. In this capacity, it conducts  intelligence activities in support of all its missions, maritime homeland  security, and national security objectives, including information collection,  analysis, and dissemination of intelligence information. Figure 4 illustrates  how Coast Guard national and regional maritime information is channeled  to and from representatives of a local area maritime security committee  (AMSC) or interagency operational center.", "Beyond the Coast Guard, other agencies can also play a major role in  channeling maritime security information to the port level. As shown in  table 2, some of these agencies have broader responsibilities for  intelligence across all domains. For example, DOJ has a number of  organizations involved in terrorist threat information sharing, such as the  National Joint Terrorism Task Force, which act as a liaison and conduit  for \u201call domain\u201d (e.g., maritime and nonmaritime) information from FBI  headquarters to Joint Terrorism Task Forces operating in the field. The  FBI also has designated Maritime Liaison Agents at the port level who  interact with state, local, and private sector officials and other federal  agencies, to enhance security at the nation\u2019s seaports. In addition, U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices of DOJ set up Anti-terrorism Advisory Councils that  sponsor state- or regional-level task forces or coordination centers that  may include a maritime security component. Figure 5 graphically  illustrates (1) how maritime and nonmaritime information and intelligence  is shared among agencies at the national level and (2) organizational  conduits through which information is shared with the port level. The left  side of the figure shows DOJ channels for information discussed above.  On the right side, the figure also shows the flow of information through  Coast Guard channels, as already shown in figure 4."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, David Alexander, Neil Asaba, Juliana  Bahus, Christine Davis, Kevin Heinz, Emily Pickrell, Albert Schmidt, Amy  Sheller, Stan Stenersen, and April Thompson made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard:  Observations on Agency Priorities in Fiscal Year 2006  Budget Request.
