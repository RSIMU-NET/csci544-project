For example, California told us it estimated that over 100,000 families with adults would reach the federal time limit in the next year. California plans to use state-only funds to continue aid beyond 60 months to children by removing the adult from the case. California also plans to continue aid to families who are making a good faith effort to find employment and to families who are hard to employ because the adult is aged, disabled, caring for a disabled family member, or experiencing domestic violence.

As discussed earlier, TANF allows each state to extend the 60 month time limit for up to 20 percent of the average monthly number of families receiving TANF assistance funded in whole or part with federal TANF funds.

The dramatic caseload decline that greatly reduced the federally required participation rates gave states great flexibility in implementing work requirements. With this flexibility, the extent of involvement of TANF adults in federally or state-required activities varied greatly among the states. On the one hand, this means states have adapted their programs to meet state and local goals and needs. On the other hand, it means states with relatively low participation rates have more limited experience than other states in involving welfare recipients in work activities. This may affect their ability to meet federal participation rate requirements in the future. In addition, many states have used the flexibility allowed them in using state MOE to exclude families from or to extend federal time limits. In this way, states could ensure a safety net for families that state TANF program officials had determined needed more time to become self-sufficient or were unable to support themselves. Because so many families have not yet reached their time limits, much remains unknown about choices states will make in enforcing time limits and whether an appropriate balance will be struck between ensuring a safety net for families in need and creating a transitional aid system that promotes work and personal responsibility.", "Two issues that warrant attention in the future include wider implementation of the 20 percent federal time limit extension and states\u2019 use of separate state programs to provide cash assistance. First, as we reported, the 20 percent time limit extension, when applied to adults, represents a larger and varying share of adults among the states than when applied to all families, including child-only cases. As this extension policy is more widely used in the years ahead, it will be important to understand whether the 20 percent extension as currently calculated affords all states the access needed to support families experiencing hardship as well as supporting the federal goal of reducing welfare dependence. Second, with the use of state MOE through separate state programs, a not insignificant number of families\u2014and potentially more in the years to come\u2014receive cash assistance although they are not counted in welfare caseload data routinely reported by HHS. With continuing attention focused on the number of families receiving cash assistance and whether PRWORA has successfully reduced dependence on welfare, it is important that program administrators and policymakers have information on the size of the separate state program caseload.

For example, Wyoming may extend time limits for up to 92 families, which represents 20 percent of the 458 TANF families in Wyoming. However, because almost three-fourths of its TANF families are child-only, only 119 families with adults would have time limits in place. This means that the state could provide extensions to 92 of the 119 TANF families with adults; this represents 77 percent rather than 20 percent of TANF families with adults. In contrast, in New Mexico, with its much smaller percentage of child-only families (15 percent), the maximum percentage of time-limit extensions that may be provided to families with adults is 24 percent rather than 20 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Elisabeth Anderson, Kara Kramer, and Kim Reniero.
