Moreover, while some identity theft victims can resolve their problems quickly, others face substantial costs and inconvenience repairing damage to their credit records. Some individuals have lost job opportunities, been refused loans, or even been arrested for crimes they did not commit as a result of identity theft. Millions of people become victims of identity theft each year. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that in 1 year, as many as 10 million people--or 4.6 percent of the U.S. adult population--discover that they are victims of some form of identity theft, translating into reported losses exceeding $50 billion. Several steps have been taken, both in terms of legislation and administrative actions to combat identity theft at the federal, state and local levels, although efforts to assist victims of the crime once it has occurred remain somewhat piecemeal. While there is no one law that regulates the overall use of personally identifiable information by all levels and branches of government, numerous federal laws place restrictions on public and private sector entities' use and disclosure of individuals' personal information in specific instances, including the use and disclosure of Social Security Numbers (SSN)--a key piece of information that is highly valuable to identity thieves. One intention of some of these laws is to prevent the misuse of personal information for purposes such as identity theft. Despite efforts to prevent identity theft, vulnerabilities remain and can be grouped into several areas, including display and use of Social Security numbers, availability of personal information through information resellers, security weaknesses in federal agency information systems, and data security breaches. GAO's work indicates that persistent weaknesses appear in five major categories of information system controls, including access controls which ensure that only authorized agency personnel can read, alter, or delete data. As a result, federal systems and sensitive information are at increased risk of unauthorized access and disclosure, modification, or destruction, as well as inadvertent or deliberate disruption of system operations and services.

Personally identifiable information  includes information that can be used to locate or identify an individual,  including names, date of birth, Social Security number (SSN), biometric  records, or other information that can be linked to an individual. Identity  theft occurs when individuals\u2019 personal identifying information is used  without authorization in an attempt to commit fraud or other crimes.  Identity thieves use personally identifiable information to open new  financial accounts and incur charges (such as opening credit accounts in  that individual\u2019s name), to take over an individual\u2019s existing accounts to  make unauthorized charges or withdraw money, or to assume another  person\u2019s identity. Accordingly, my remarks today will address (1) the  problem of identity theft; (2) steps taken at the federal, state, and local  level, to prevent potential identity theft and assist victims of this crime;  and (3) vulnerabilities that remain to protecting personally identifiable  information, particularly in federal information systems.", "In summary, identity theft is a serious crime that affects millions of  individuals each year with costs, according to a Federal Trade  Commission estimate, that exceeded $50 billion in a single year. Victims of  identity theft may not realize the crime has been committed for months or  years, with potential serious consequences financially, civilly, and even  criminally. Once victimized, individuals may have to deal with a complex  array of public and private organizations to correct the damage, often at  great expense to themselves both in terms of time and money. Steps have  been taken in both the public and private sectors in an attempt to prevent  or detect identity theft, and where possible, assist victims. These include  federal and state laws, law enforcement activities, and guidance and other  assistance provided to consumers. Despite these steps, vulnerabilities  remain. In particular, recent security breaches of both federal and private  data sources have highlighted the challenges that remain to preventing  identity theft. We and agency inspectors general have made numerous   recommendations in recent years to federal agencies to resolve significant  control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. In  particular, we have noted that agencies also need to implement controls  that reduce the chance of incidents involving data loss or theft, computer  intrusions, and privacy breaches.", "For this testimony, we primarily relied on information from our prior  reports and testimonies that address public and private sector use of  personally identifiable information, as well as federal, state and local  efforts to protect the security of such information.

Therefore, the total  of number of identity thefts is unknown.", "Several examples we previously identified illustrate the magnitude of the  losses that could occur from a single incident and how aggregated  personal information can be vulnerable to misuse:    A help desk employee at a New York-based software company, which  provided software to its clients to access consumer credit reports, stole  the identities of up to 30,000 individuals by using confidential passwords  and subscriber codes of the company\u2019s customers. The former employee  reportedly sold these identities for $60 each. Furthermore, given the  explosion of Internet use and the ease with which personally identifiable  information is accessible, individuals looking to steal someone\u2019s identity  are increasingly able to do so.

Additionally, the Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) requires agencies  to develop, document, and implement agency wide programs to provide  security for their information and information systems (which include  personally identifiable information and the systems on which it resides).  FISMA is the primary law governing information security in the federal  government. The act also requires the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) to develop technical guidance in specific areas,  including minimum information security requirements for information and  information systems.", "Other laws which help protect personally identifiable information include  the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, the Identity Theft  Penalty Enhancement Act of 1998, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA),  and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA). (See app. I,  table 1, for a more detailed description of these and other related laws.)  For example, the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, enacted  in 1998, makes it a criminal offense for a person to \u201cknowingly transfer,  possess, or use without lawful authority,\u201d another person\u2019s means of  identification, such as their SSN, with the intent to commit, or in  connection with, any unlawful activity that constitutes a felony under state  or local law. This act also mandated a specific role for the FTC in  combating identity theft. To fulfill the mandate, FTC is collecting identity  theft complaints and assisting victims through a telephone hotline and a  dedicated Web site; maintaining and promoting the Identity Theft Data  Clearinghouse, a centralized database of victim complaints that serves as  an investigative tool for law enforcement; and providing outreach and  education to consumers, law enforcement, and industry. According to  FTC, it receives roughly 15,000 to 20,000 contacts per week on the hotline,  via its Web site, or through the mail from victims and consumers who want  to avoid becoming victims. In addition, the Identity Theft Enforcement and  Restitution Act of 2008 requires persons convicted of identity theft to  compensate their victims for the value of the time spent by the victim in an  attempt to remediate the intended or actual harm incurred.", "Another law with some provisions to assist victims of identity theft is  FACTA. This law has several provisions to help address the difficulties  victims often encounter in trying to recover from identity theft, including  (1) a requirement that the FTC develop a model summary of rights to be  distributed to consumers who believe that they are victims of identity  theft, (2) the right for consumers to place fraud alerts on their credit  reports, (3) the right to obtain copies of business records involved in  transactions alleged to be the result of identity theft, and (4) the right to  obtain all information about fraudulently incurred debts that have been  turned over to a collection agency.", "The Office of Management and Budget has also issued numerous  memoranda to federal agencies on safeguarding personally identifiable  information.

This is, in part, because identity theft is not a \u201cstand alone\u201d  crime, but rather a component of one or more complex crimes, such as  computer fraud, credit card fraud, or mail fraud. For example, with the  theft of identity information, a perpetrator may commit computer fraud  when using a stolen identity to fraudulently obtain credit on the Internet.  Computer fraud may also be the primary vehicle used to obtain identity  information when the offender obtains unauthorized access to another  computer or Web site to obtain such information. As a result, if caught, the  offender may be charged with both identity theft and computer fraud.  Moreover, perpetrators usually prey on multiple victims in multiple  jurisdictions. Consequently, a number of federal law enforcement agencies  can have a role in investigating identity theft crimes. How the thief obtains  and/or uses an individual\u2019s identity usually dictates which federal agency  has jurisdiction in the case. For example, if an individual finds that an  identity thief has stolen the individual\u2019s mail to obtain credit cards, bank  statements, or tax information, the victim should report the crime to the  U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal  Service. In addition, violations are investigated by other federal agencies,  such as the Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General,  the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S.  Department of State, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Inspector  General, and the Internal Revenue Service.

Although the SSN was created as a means to track workers\u2019 earnings and  eligibility for Social Security benefits, it is now also a vital piece of  information needed to function in American society. Because of its unique  nature and broad applicability, the SSN has become the identifier of  choice for public and private sector entities, and it is used for numerous  non-Social Security purposes. Today, U.S. citizens generally need an SSN  to pay taxes, obtain a driver\u2019s license, or open a bank account, among  other things. SSNs, along with names and birth certificates, are among the  three personal identifiers most often sought by identity thieves. SSNs play  an important role in identity theft because they are used as breeder  information to create additional false identification documents, such as  drivers\u2019 licenses. Most often, identity thieves use SSNs belonging to real  people rather than making one up; however, on the basis of a review of  identity theft reports, victims usually (65 percent of the time) did not know  where or how the thieves got their personal information. In those  instances when the source was known, the personal information, including  SSNs, usually was obtained illegally. In these cases, identity thieves most  often gained access to this personal information by taking advantage of an  existing relationship with the victim. The next most common means of  gaining access were by stealing information from purses, wallets, or the  mail. Finally, while documents such as public records were traditionally  accessed by visiting government records centers, a growing source of  identity theft may be via the Internet. This is because some record keepers  sell records containing SSNs in bulk to private companies and provide  access to records on their own government Web sites. When records are  sold in bulk or made available on the Internet, it is unknown how and by  whom the records, and the personal identifying information contained in  them, are used. Because the sources of identity theft cannot be more  accurately pinpointed, it is not possible at this time to determine whether  SSNs that are used improperly are obtained most frequently from the  private or public sector.", "Our prior work has documented several areas where potential  vulnerabilities exist with respect to protecting the security of SSNs in both  the public and private sectors. For example:    SSNs are displayed on some government-issued identification  cards: We have reported that an estimated 42 million Medicare cards, 8  million Department of Defense (DOD) insurance cards, and 7 million  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiary cards displayed entire 9- digit SSNs. VA and DOD have begun taking action to remove SSNs from  cards. For example, VA is eliminating SSNs from 7 million VA  identification cards and will replace cards with SSNs or issue new cards  without SSNs until all such cards have been replaced. However, the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with the largest number of  cards displaying the entire 9-digit SSN, has no plans to remove the SSN  from Medicare identification cards.  examining the availability of SSNs in public records, we found that it is  possible to reconstruct an individual\u2019s full nine-digit SSN by combining a  truncated SSN from a federally generated lien record with a truncated SSN  from an information reseller. These records typically contain an  individual\u2019s SSN, name, and address. As a result of these findings, we  advised Congress to consider enacting legislation to develop a  standardized method of truncating SSNs. Such legislation was introduced  in the 110th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Law Does Not Cover all Data or Services Provided by Information Resellers", "paragraphs": ["Federal law does not currently cover all data or services provided by  information resellers, and the personally identifiable information these  entities use in the course of their business operations could create  potential vulnerability for identity theft, particularly when the information  is available on the Internet. For example, information resellers, sometimes  referred to as information brokers, are businesses that specialize in  amassing personal information from multiple sources and offering  informational services, including data on individuals. These entities may  provide their services to a variety of prospective buyers, either to specific  business clients or to the general public through the Internet. More  prominent information resellers such as consumer reporting agencies and  entities like LexisNexis provide information to their customers for various  purposes, such as building consumer credit reports, verifying an  individual\u2019s identity, differentiating records, marketing their products, and  preventing financial fraud. These information resellers limit their services  to businesses and government entities that establish accounts with them  and have a legitimate purpose for obtaining an individual\u2019s personal  information. For example, law firms and collection agencies may request  information on an individual\u2019s bank accounts and real estate holdings for  use in civil proceedings, such as a divorce. Information resellers that offer  their services through the Internet (Internet resellers) will generally  advertise their services to the general public for a fee. Resellers, whether  well-known or Internet-based, collect information from three sources:  public records, publicly available information, and nonpublic information.  The aggregation of the general public\u2019s personal information, such as  SSNs, in large corporate databases and the increased availability of  information via the Internet may provide unscrupulous individuals a  means to acquire SSNs and other personal information and use them for  illegal purposes including identity theft.", "However, no federal law explicitly requires all information resellers to  safeguard all of the sensitive personal information they may hold. For  example, the Fair Credit and Reporting Act (FCRA) applies only to  consumer information used or intended to be used to help determine  eligibility for credit, and GLBA\u2019s safeguarding requirements apply only to  customer data held by GLBA-defined financial institutions.

Such risks are illustrated by the  following examples:  In February 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notified  employees that an agency computer was illegally accessed and employee  personal identity information had been stolen electronically. Two of the 48  files on the breached computer server contained personal information  about more than 45,000 FAA employees and retirees who were on the  FAA\u2019s rolls as of the first week of February 2006.

Walter  Reed officials were notified of the possible exposure on May 21 by an  outside company. Preliminary results of an ongoing investigation  identified a computer from which the data had apparently been  compromised. Data security personnel from Walter Reed and the  Department of the Army think it is possible that individuals named in the  file could become victims of identity theft. The compromised data file did  not include protected health information such as medical records,  diagnosis, or prognosis for patients.", "During fiscal year 2008, federal agencies reported 16, 843 incidents to the  U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)\u2014a 206 percent  increase over the 5,503 incidents reported in 2006.", "Thus, significant weaknesses continue to threaten the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of critical information and information systems  used to support the operations, assets, and personnel of federal agencies.", "The extent to which data breaches result in identity theft is not well  known, in large part because it can be difficult to determine the source of  the information used to commit identity theft. Available data and  interviews with researchers, law enforcement officials, and industry  representatives indicate that most breaches have not resulted in detected  incidents of identity theft. In 2007, we reported on data breaches in  selected sectors of the economy and the potential benefits of breach  notifications. As part of this review of the issue, we examined the 24  largest breaches that appeared in the news media from January 2000  through June 2005 and found that 3 breaches appeared to have resulted in  fraud on existing accounts, and 1 breach appeared to have resulted in the  unauthorized creation of new accounts.", "When data breaches do occur, notification to the individuals affected  and/or the public has clear benefits, allowing individuals the opportunity  to take steps to protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft.  Moreover, although existing laws do not require agencies to notify the  public when data breaches occur, such notification is consistent with  federal agencies\u2019 responsibility to inform individuals about how their  information is being accessed and used, and promotes accountability for  privacy protection. Similarly, in the private sector, representatives of  federal banking regulators, industry associations, and other affected  parties told us that breach notification requirements have encouraged  companies and other entities to improve their data security practices to  minimize legal liability or avoid public relations risks that may result from  a publicized breach of customer data. Further, notifying affected  consumers of a breach gives individuals the opportunity to mitigate  potential risk\u2014for example, by reviewing their credit card statements and  credit reports, or placing a fraud alert on their credit files. Requiring  consumer notification of data breaches may encourage better data  security practices and help deter or mitigate harm from identity theft;  however, such practices also involve monetary costs and other challenges  such as determining an appropriate notification standard.", "Based on the experience of various federal agencies and private sector  organizations in responding to data breaches, we identified the following  lessons learned regarding how and when to notify government officials,  affected individuals, and the public of a data breach.

For example, we recommended that the Director of  OMB develop guidance for federal agencies on conducting risk analyses to  determine when to offer credit monitoring and when to contract for an  alternative form of monitoring, such as data breach monitoring, to assist  individuals at risk of identity theft as a result of a federal data breach.  Other recommendations to agencies include that they need to implement  controls that prevent, limit, or detect access to computer resources, and  should manage the configuration of network devices to prevent  unauthorized access and ensure system integrity. In addition,  opportunities also exist to enhance policies and practices necessary for  implementing sound information security programs. To implement these  programs, agencies must create and maintain inventories of major  systems, implement common security configurations, ensure staff receive  information security training, test and evaluate controls, take remedial  actions for known deficiencies, and certify and accredit systems for  operation.
