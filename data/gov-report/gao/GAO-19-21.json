The main three steps in the process associated with these inspections are shown below. In addition to the environment of care inspections, VHA conducts other periodic assessments of facilities' major systems, such as plumbing and air conditioning.", "VHA inspections routinely identify deficiencies reflective of an aging infrastructure\u2014VHA's buildings are on average 55 years old. This situation in turn is leading to workload and staffing challenges in addressing maintenance and repair needs. For example, according to VHA's 2017 data, medical centers reported conducting approximately 11,000 total inspections for the year that resulted in about 128,000 identified deficiencies. Most of these deficiencies were closed within 14 business days, as required by VHA. However, nearly 30,000 of them were not closed or had been addressed through a plan for future work. Medical center officials added that correcting deficiencies may only be a temporary solution for issues related to aging structures that need extensive repairs and renovations. In addition, VA headquarters and field officials said that staff vacancies are common and can affect the efficiency and speed of maintenance and repairs.", "VHA provides guidance and selected oversight to ensure medical centers implement the process for environment of care inspections. However, VHA lacks performance goals, objectives, and measures that would enable it to provide effective oversight, address challenges, and assess how well it is achieving a clean, safe, and functional environment.

We also reviewed VHA\u2019s  environment of care inspections data for fiscal years 2016\u20132017 as  reported by medical centers related to their compliance with facility  maintenance standards. We focused this review on environment of care  inspections because these inspections are identified in VHA guidance as  critical to all aspects of patient care in a medical facility. As such,  environment of care standards are important considerations for VHA\u2019s  engineering staff when planning and executing maintenance and  operations functions. We assessed the reliability of environment of care  inspections data by reviewing documentation and interviewing  knowledgeable agency officials to identify steps VA takes to ensure the  quality and accuracy of the data, such as training inspectors on entering  inspections data. Through these steps, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this reporting objective.", "Further, we selected three Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN)  and six medical centers\u2014two medical centers within each VISN\u2014for  review and site visits.  We chose the three VISNs to include a range in  terms of geographic location and veteran demographics and ones with  higher numbers of identified deficiencies and percentages of deficiencies  not addressed within 14 days in fiscal year 2017. We chose the six  medical centers based on these factors as well as on their proximity to  the selected VISN\u2019s location, and to include both urban and rural centers.  We conducted in-person site visits at four of the six selected medical  centers and interviewed officials responsible for overseeing, planning,  and budgeting for facility maintenance and operations. We observed the  environment of care inspections process at two of the medical centers  during our site visits. The results of the information obtained at VISNs and  medical centers are not generalizable to the entire population of VISNs  and medical centers.

The Joint  Commission,  an organization that accredits medical centers and other  hospitals throughout the country, has developed standards that require  medical centers to undertake several actions that relate to engineering,  environmental management, and safety including: maintaining the patient environment by ensuring that a suitable  temperature is maintained, that areas are clean and appropriately  lighted, and furnishings and equipment are in good repair; managing utility systems to ensure operational reliability; and minimizing fire hazards and providing a safety system in case of fire.", "To help ensure medical centers maintain these standards, VHA requires  medical centers to conduct regular environment of care inspections of the  facility. According to VHA officials, because of the large size of many  medical centers, most conduct environment of care inspections in a  different part of their facility every week throughout the year. In 2016, a  VHA directive formally established VHA\u2019s Comprehensive Environment of  Care Program (Environment of Care Program) and outlined management  and oversight responsibilities for the program. Environment of care  inspections are a main component of the program.", "In addition to the environment of care inspections, VHA uses other  inspections to help execute and oversee facility operations and  maintenance functions. For example, every 3 years, VA contracts for  Facility Condition Assessments, where contractors evaluate all buildings  and major systems at a medical facility (e.g., structural, mechanical, plumbing, and others) and identifies needed repairs and replacements.  This inspection gives a graded score from A to F for VHA facilities, with  \u201cC minus\u201d as the average facility score received for overall infrastructure  conditions at VHA facilities as of 2015. This inspection focuses on major  systems, while environment of care inspections focus on day-to-day  facility conditions, including that of patient-care areas. Furthermore,  preventative maintenance inspections are usually conducted on systems,  such as boilers or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)  systems, and would vary in frequency based on the manufacturer  requirements. Medical center staff also noted that facility operations and  maintenance issues may be identified by staff in the course of their day- to-day duties and reported to engineering for repair.", "VHA medical centers employ staff trained in plumbing, carpentry, grounds  maintenance, and other trades needed to maintain facilities, as well as  housekeeping staff. These employees are responsible for carrying out the  work necessary to ensure medical centers comply with safety standards,  and VHA policies and inspection requirements.", "The majority of funding for medical centers, including funding for  operations and maintenance, is determined on the basis of past years\u2019  allocations, veteran populations served, and the types of services  provided. The budget for VA medical facilities has increased by  approximately 30 percent over the last 5 fiscal years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medical Centers Rely on Environment of Care Inspections to Identify Deficiencies but May Encounter Challenges in Completing Needed Repairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Environment of Care Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The medical center director or a designee, such as the medical center\u2019s  Environment of Care Coordinator, has the overall responsibility for  managing and leading weekly environment of care inspections at a  medical center. Each medical center should have an environment of care  committee, and the medical center director or a designee should facilitate  committee meetings to discuss the environment of care processes,  findings, trends, and any other related issues.

For  example, the checklist includes questions such as:", "Are there loose floor tiles/carpet?", "Are ceiling tiles stained or other signs of leaks?", "Are there any electrical hazards present?", "Team members record information on deficiencies that they identify into  an Environment of Care inspections database, which is used to document  and track the status of deficiencies.", "During interviews with medical center staff at all six of the medical centers  included in our review, officials told us they follow the environment of care  inspections process that VHA guidance outlines. At two of the medical  centers we visited, we accompanied inspections team on environment of  care inspections and observed staff following this process. The inspection  teams walked through the areas designated for inspection, for example  examining conditions of floors, ceilings and fire safety systems. Also, as  we discuss later in the report, VHA officials also monitor aspects of the  inspections process, such as who attends the inspection. VHA officials  told us they also collect data on performance measures related to  utilization of the environment of care checklists and environment of care  inspections process but no longer track these measures because medical  centers achieved 100 percent utilization of these measures in 2015.  Figure 1 below details the process used to identify and address  deficiencies, as outlined in VHA guidance.", "As previously mentioned, VHA guidance considers these inspections to  be critical to all aspects of patient care in a medical facility, and officials at  all six medical centers confirmed that they rely on these inspections to  identify needed repairs. For example, officials in one medical center noted  that the frequency and thoroughness of these inspections has helped  them determine day-to-day wear and tear issues and informed their  planning processes. Medical center staff noted that condition deficiencies  identified through this process are often minor but are nonetheless  important to maintenance of a clean and safe patient environment. For  example, a damaged or stained ceiling tile identified during an inspection  could be a potential safety hazard to patients or indicate an issue with  leaking pipes. The replacement of the tile itself is a minor repair, but that  repair could be an indication of an important maintenance issue at the  medical center. As table 2 below shows, the deficiencies commonly  identified through the inspections process include items that need to be  cleaned or dusted or walls that need minor repairs.", "Medical center staff we interviewed said, in general, the most common  environment of care deficiencies can be addressed by medical center  staff, but medical centers told us they sometimes use contractors if  warranted. In most cases, a deficiency can be addressed with simple  repairs such as patching and repainting walls, replacing stained and  damaged tiles, or by cleaning. On our site visits, we saw examples of the  types of issues that medical center staff address during environment of  care inspections. In one case, we were shown a recurring deficiency at  the medical center caused by moving hospital beds. Moving beds in and  out of rooms was damaging the plaster corners of a wall near the door.  We were also shown the solution, which was a metal corner guard the  medical center had installed in some rooms, and the center was working  to install corner guards in other locations as funds became available.  Figure 2 below shows examples of deficiencies we observed during  environment of care inspections at medical centers.", "Other types of condition deficiencies that are not directly in the  environment of care, such as a broken boiler, typically would not be  identified during environment of care inspections, but rather medical  center staff said they are identified during scheduled preventive  maintenance activities, or during other facility inspections. Regardless of  how they are identified, more serious repairs often require a different  funding and approval process than day-to-day maintenance. For  example, if significant damage occurred to a medical center\u2019s roof and the  cost of repairs is greater than $25,000, it would most likely be deemed a  non-recurring maintenance project and would require approval from either  the VISN or VA\u2019s central office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Addressing Identified Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["The buildings that VHA manages are, on average, 55 years old, and  many have substantial capital repair and improvement needs. A VA- commissioned report noted that there were significant barriers that facility  management staff faced in maintaining facilities to a high quality.  According to the report, while some of these barriers involved immediate  resource constraints such as budgets for staffing and conducting  maintenance and janitorial tasks, the root cause of many of these issues  is the general age and underlying condition of VHA facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Workload", "paragraphs": ["Engineering officials at medical centers told us that the amount of work  associated with conducting weekly inspections and addressing  environment of care deficiencies is substantial. For example, according to  VHA\u2019s data for fiscal year 2017, medical centers reported conducting  about 11,000 weekly inspections, during which more than 128,000  deficiencies were identified. Most deficiencies were closed within 14  business days, as required by VHA policy, but nearly 30,000 deficiencies  across all medical centers had not been addressed within 14 days or had  been addressed through a plan for future work.", "One significant factor contributing to the number of deficiencies and the  associated workload is the advanced age of many medical centers. A  VHA commissioned study found that the general age and underlying  condition of medical centers, including VHA buildings\u2019 being older than 50  years on average and lack of capital investment to address infrastructure  concerns, are the root causes of many barriers that facility management  staff faced in achieving their objectives of maintaining high quality  facilities, and exacerbate the workload issues at these medical centers.  This observation was echoed by medical center officials in our review. For  example at one medical center officials told us that in some cases,  correcting deficiencies found on an environment of care inspection is a  temporary solution for issues related to aging structures that need  extensive repairs and renovations. For example, a roof that needs to be  repaired due to leaks and other structural issues may result in an  increase in the number of interior ceiling tiles with water stains.  Maintenance staff must then continue to identify and replace stained  ceiling tiles, until the root cause, which is subject to a different funding  and approval process, is addressed.", "Also, medical center staff we interviewed said the administrative  requirements associated with the environment of care program  contributed to workload challenges. Medical center staff are responsible  for entering deficiency data into the Environment of Care inspections  database, which is used to document and track results from the  environment of care inspections. The same staff can also be responsible  for reconciling the environment of care inspections database with other  systems, like the medical center\u2019s work order system and other  inspections databases. Medical center staff said that each deficiency  can result in as many as four or more separate data entry actions in the  Environment of Care inspections database and in a separate system  used to track work orders. As an example of the administrative workload  related to the inspection process, the Long Beach medical center in California, whose main building was built in 1967, reported the most  deficiencies in its VISN. According to VHA data, this medical center  reported more than 3,500 environment of care deficiencies related to  facility condition in fiscal year 2017, and medical center officials said this  resulted in as many as 12,000 or more separate data-entry actions.", "Additionally, VHA\u2019s aging information technology systems exacerbate the  administrative workload. VA medical center officials told us that VHA\u2019s  work order system lacks interoperability with the Environment of Care  inspections database, resulting in the need to manually record information  on deficiencies in both systems. Officials we spoke with at VA medical  centers told us that this process can substantially add to post-inspection  workload and to the administrative burden associated with tracking and  closing out deficiencies. Medical center staff also noted that it can often  be the same staff member performing environment of care inspections,  conducting the work to correct deficiencies, and performing administrative  tasks.", "Limitations in VA\u2019s information technology systems, among other things,  led GAO to designate VA health care as a high-risk area. Information  technology limitations we previously identified at VA include the outdated,  inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system  interoperability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing", "paragraphs": ["Staffing shortages have also been recognized by VA\u2019s Central Office staff  as an issue that needs to be addressed across VA facilities. For example,  officials said that in addition to the engineering staff\u2019s shortages  discussed below, there is also a known shortage at many medical centers  of qualified cleaning and janitorial staff, a shortage that can affect the  ability for medical centers to quickly address some of the environment of  care deficiencies. Additionally, we have previously reported that VA is  collaborating with the Office of Personnel Management to address  challenges with recruiting and retaining engineering positions.", "Officials at medical centers included in our review discussed the difficulty  of recruiting and retaining employees to perform maintenance work, such  as painters, electricians, and other relevant maintenance trades. All six of  the medical centers reported vacancies during the last year in  engineering department positions that are needed to complete  maintenance and repairs, such as electricians and painters. The extent to  which these medical centers experienced vacancies, however, varied  widely. The lowest number of reported vacancies by a medical center was  two and the highest number of reported vacancies was 49. Factors cited  by medical center officials on why they had difficulty hiring and retaining  staff encompassed a range of issues, including loss of long-time staff due  to retirement, and a lack of qualified applicants for vacant positions. For  example, medical centers located in and around Los Angeles, California,  reported that their location\u2014in a high cost of living area with a competitive  private-sector jobs market\u2014affected their ability to recruit and retain  these employees. Conversely, medical centers located farther from urban  areas reported difficulty finding and retaining staff due to their relatively  rural locations and smaller overall population.", "Officials from all six medical centers said that while they endeavor to  address all environment of care deficiencies in accordance with the  inspection requirements, these vacancies affected their ability to perform  maintenance and repair functions. For example, officials from one  medical center reported that four out of seven electrician positions at their  medical center were vacant. The officials said in addition to their rural  location, their need for engineering staff knowledgeable in a range of  electrical systems made recruitment difficult. Their facility has buildings  that are over 50 years old, as well as newer buildings, with significantly  different electrical systems. The officials noted that while all electrical  work was eventually completed, the lack of staff slowed or deferred  repairs, or required contract labor. Another medical center noted that a  shortage of relevant engineering staff meant that work orders and  preventative maintenance functions were backlogged and that they had to  utilize overtime to accomplish required functions. When faced with  changing workload demands and staffing shortages, medical centers can,  and do, utilize contractors."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Takes Steps to Help Medical Centers Comply with Inspection Requirements but Does Not Have Goals or Measures to Determine Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["While VHA provides guidance and oversight to ensure medical centers  implement the environment of care inspection process, it lacks  performance goals, objectives, and measures that would enable it to  assess how well it is achieving its policy of a clean, safe, and functional  environment.

Table 3 below shows the three measures  VHA currently uses along with the related performance targets.", "We have previously reported that performance measures should focus on  outcomes to help agencies manage programs to achieve desired  results. VHA\u2019s current measures do not indicate whether desired  outcomes are being achieved or how effective inspections are but rather  whether staff are following policies related to inspections.

For example:", "One performance measure is based on the requirement that medical  centers address deficiencies within 14 days, either by fixing the  problem or by preparing an action plan describing how the problem  will be fixed. However, because this requirement can be met with an  action plan, it is not a useful measure for understanding the  deficiencies that have not yet been remediated.", "Similarly, the two performance measures on staff attendance at  inspections do not directly relate to the condition of the facility but  reflect the level of compliance with inspection requirements. We  spoke with officials at one medical center who said vacancies within  their information security office prevented them from meeting the  inspection team attendance measure.
