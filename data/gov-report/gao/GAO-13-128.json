This report examines the extent to which DOD has issued current guidance, including doctrine, policy, and strategy, for its homeland defense and civil support missions. To do this, GAO analyzed DOD homeland defense and civil support guidance and plans and met with select DOD and National Guard officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) protects the U.S. homeland through two distinct but interrelated missions: (1) homeland defense, which defends against threats such as terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber incidents; and (2) civil support, which involves supporting other federal agencies in responding to major domestic disasters, emergencies, and special events. DOD has issued and updated several key pieces of doctrine, policy, and strategy for homeland defense and civil support, but it has not updated its primary Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support since it was initially issued in 2005 and does not have a process--similar to that for its joint publications and directives-- to do so. The Joint Staff determined in August 2010 that joint publications on homeland defense needed a complete revision. The joint publication on civil support is also being revised. U.S. Northern Command, the combatant command responsible for homeland defense, is revising these publications to reflect changes in national and department priorities and to incorporate lessons learned from exercises and events such as Hurricane Katrina. Still, such key national and department-level strategies and significant events are not reflected in DOD's strategy, in part because the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs does not have a process for periodically assessing the currency of its homeland defense and civil support strategy and ensuring that needed updates are completed in a timely manner. Reliance on an outdated strategy could hinder DOD's ability to effectively plan for and respond to major disasters and emergencies.", "DOD issued some guidance on the dual-status commander construct--through which, during a civil support incident or special event, a single military officer has authority over both National Guard and active-duty military personnel, serving as a link between state and federal forces. Nevertheless, gaps in guidance remain because DOD has not yet developed comprehensive policies and procedures regarding the use and availability of dual-status commanders, including specific criteria and conditions for when and how a state governor and the Secretary of Defense would mutually appoint a commander. As a result, DOD's ability to adequately prepare for and effectively use dual-status commanders for a range of civil support events, including those affecting multiple states, may be hindered.", "While a 2010 DOD Directive, a 2007 joint publication, and an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provide some details on how DOD should respond to requests for civil support in the event of a domestic cyber incident, they do not address some aspects of how DOD will provide support during a response. First, DOD has not clarified its roles and responsibilities, and chartering directives for DOD's Offices of the Assistant Secretaries for Global Strategic Affairs and for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs outline conflicting and overlapping roles and responsibilities. Second, DOD has not ensured that its civil support guidance is aligned with national plans and preparations for domestic cyber incidents. Consequently, it is unclear whether DOD will be adequately prepared to support DHS during a cyber incident. This report makes several recommendations to address gaps in DOD's guidance for homeland defense and civil support, including for DOD to assess and, when needed, update its primary strategy; develop implementation guidance on the dual status commander construct; and align guidance on preparing for and responding to domestic cyber incidents with national-level guidance to include roles and responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This report makes several recommendations to address gaps in DOD's guidance for homeland defense and civil support, including for DOD to assess and, when needed, update its primary strategy; develop implementation guidance on the dualstatus commander construct; and align guidance on preparing for and responding to domestic cyber incidents with national-level guidance to include roles and responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Defending U.S. territory and citizens is the highest priority of the  Department of Defense (DOD), and providing appropriate defense  support of civil authorities is one of the department\u2019s primary missions.

DOD supports numerous civil support  missions, such as the recent response to wildfires in Colorado. However,  since DOD only supports other agencies in these types of missions, DOD  generally does not train, or equip specifically to satisfy civil support  mission requirements except for key specialized missions in chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear response.

Examples of DOD\u2019s civil  support missions include responding to major disasters and emergencies  (both natural and man-made); restoring public health and services and  civil order, such as animal/plant disease eradication and counterdrug  operations; and providing support for national special events, such as the  political conventions and international summits. See figure 1.", "DOD is a supporting agency which provides assistance to the lead federal  agency for a specific civil support mission. DOD provides support to DHS  and other federal agencies for the defense portion of the federal response  to a major disaster or emergency or special event when (1) state, local,  and other federal resources are overwhelmed or unique defense  capabilities are required; (2) assistance is requested by the lead federal  agency; or (3) U.S. Northern Command is directed to do so by the  President or the Secretary of Defense. The federal government\u2019s  response to major disasters and emergencies in the United States is  guided by DHS\u2019s National Response Framework, which involves a tiered  series of responses, beginning with local authorities, state authorities, and  outside assistance from other states. In accordance with the National  Response Framework and applicable laws including the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act),  various federal agencies may play lead or supporting roles, based on  their authorities and resources, and the nature of the threat or incident.  For example, DHS manages the federal response to terrorist attacks and  major disasters. In some instances, national defense assets may be  needed to assist DHS or another agency in the national response to an  incident. Defense resources are committed after DOD is directed to do so  by the President or the Secretary of Defense. When deciding to commit  defense resources to a request for assistance by a lead federal agency,  DOD officials evaluate the request against 6 criteria: legality, lethality,  risk, cost, military readiness, and appropriateness of the circumstances.  If it is determined that defense assistance is appropriate, typically U.S.  Northern Command and U.S. Pacific Command are responsible for  leading DOD\u2019s response within their designated areas of responsibility. In  most cases, support will be localized, limited, and specific.

The  Joint Staff oversees joint doctrine development within DOD, including the  joint publications for homeland defense and civil support. U.S. Northern  Command and U.S. Pacific Command are the two DOD geographic  combatant commands primarily responsible for carrying out DOD\u2019s  homeland defense and civil support missions. U.S. Strategic Command  and U.S. Cyber Command, a sub-unified combatant command under U.S.  Strategic Command, coordinate with U.S. Northern Command and DHS  for domestic incidents with a cyber component.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012  provided that a dual-status commander should be the usual and customary  command and control arrangement in situations when the armed forces  and national guard are employed simultaneously in support of civil  authorities, including missions involving major disasters and emergencies.  The Act indicates that, when an officer is appointed as a dual-status  commander, he or she serves on federal active duty, sometimes referred to  as Title 10 status, as well as on duty in or with the National Guard of a  state, sometimes referred to as Title 32 status. A dual-status commander  can be appointed in one of two ways: 1) an active duty Army or Air Force  officer may be detailed to the Army National Guard or Air National Guard  respectively, or 2) an Army or Air National Guard Officer may be called to  active duty. The Secretary of Defense must authorize, and the Governor  must consent to, designation of an officer to serve as a dual-status  commander. When operating in Title 32 status, National Guard personnel,  including dual-status commanders, are under the command and control of  the state governor. DOD and National Guard personnel operating in Title  10 status, including dual-status commanders, are under the command and  control of the President and the Secretary of Defense.

According to DOD officials, this process  includes requesting feedback across DOD regarding the currency of joint  publications every 2 years. In August 2010, the Joint Staff determined  that the joint publication on homeland defense, Joint Publication 3-27  needed a complete revision based on feedback they received from the  joint doctrine development community.

In addition to these planned events, DOD used the dual-status  commander for the 2012 Colorado wildfire response.", "DOD has coordinated with stakeholders at the state and federal levels to  issue guidance for the dual-status commander construct. For example, in  2010, DOD worked with DHS, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, and the Council of Governors to develop the Joint Action Plan for  Developing Unity of Effort. The plan provides a framework for state and  federal agencies to coordinate their response to domestic incidents and  describes the general arrangement of the dual-status commander  construct. Among other things, the plan discusses how dual-status  commanders can respond to planned and unplanned events, and it  identifies the need for specialized training and certification.

U.S.  Northern Command has also worked with the National Guard Bureau to  establish a curriculum that includes a sequenced schedule of classes for  dual-status commander training and certification.  .", "Nevertheless, gaps in guidance remain because DOD has not yet  developed comprehensive policies and procedures regarding the use and  availability of dual-status commanders.

However, DOD has not identified specific criteria and conditions for when the Secretary of Defense would agree with the governors of the  affected states to appoint a dual-status commander. Some combatant  command officials told us that the dual-status commander construct may  not be appropriate for all scenarios and that other existing command and  control arrangements can be used in responding to certain major  disasters or emergencies. For example, U.S. Pacific Command officials  stated that in 2011 when the tsunami warning resulting from the  earthquake that struck Japan was issued in Hawaii, no dual-status  commander was appointed; rather, U.S. Pacific Command coordinated its  response in Hawaii directly with that state\u2019s authorities.", "Additionally, gaps in guidance remain for the use of dual-status  commanders for incidents affecting multiple states and territories,  including complex catastrophes, because DOD has not yet developed  policies and procedures for these scenarios. The Joint Action Plan cites  the significant likelihood that DOD will be called on to support responses  to major disasters and emergencies affecting multiple states and  territories. The Joint Action Plan states that past multistate emergencies  such as Hurricane Katrina demonstrate that a coordinated and  expeditious state-federal response is crucial to saving and sustaining  lives, and it indicates that DOD and the several states will address the  use of the dual-status commanders for such scenarios. However, DOD\u2019s  concept of operations does not address how to use a dual-status  commander in these scenarios. According to DOD, they are continuing to  work with the Council of Governors to address the use of dual-status  commanders in complex catastrophes affecting multiple states.", "GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1. meeting, the council and federal officials agreed to a goal of at least 3  trained and certified dual-status commander candidates with at least one  being a general officer for each of the 54 U.S. states and territories, thus  providing primary and alternate dual-status commanders. As figure 4  shows, all 54 U.S. states and territories have at least one trained and  certified dual-status commander, 70 percent (38 of 54) have two or more  trained and certified commanders, and 13 percent (7 of 54) have three or  more commanders. As of June 2012, all of the trained and certified dual- status commanders shown in Figure 3 were National Guard officers.", "According to Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs and National Guard officials,  maintaining a pipeline of trained and certified dual-status commanders  drawn exclusively from the National Guard may be a challenge. The  National Guard has a limited number of officers from which to select dual- status commanders, and these National Guard officers have other roles  and responsibilities that may preclude them from being immediately  available for an unplanned incident requiring a civil support response. For  example, some individuals trained and certified to be dual-status  commanders serve as airline pilots and may not be in the area when a  dual-status commander is needed. During Hurricane Irene in 2011, the  trained and certified dual-status commander from one of the affected  states was at a training exercise and unavailable. While the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 made it clear that dual- status commanders could be appointed from among the National Guard  or active duty federal officers, as of May 2012, no active duty dual-status  commanders have been trained and certified thus far. Office of Secretary  of Defense and military service officials told us that it may be helpful to  have an active duty federal dual-status commander for incidents affecting  multiple states, such as a complex catastrophe. They stated that an  active duty federal dual-status commander might have greater flexibility  moving between multiple states and territories affected by an incident and  might offer a broader, national perspective consistent with the Secretary  of Defense\u2019s and the President\u2019s priorities. Training and certifying active  duty dual-status commanders would increase the number of dual-status  commanders and increase the likelihood that a dual-status commander  will be available to serve when needed.", "Without complete guidance on the use and availability of dual-status  commanders, including when it is appropriate to deviate from the \u201cusual  and customary arrangement,\u201d it remains unclear when a different  command and control arrangement would be more appropriate to provide  a unity of effort between state and federal forces in civil support events.  Also, without guidance on a process to determine the appropriate mix of  individuals trained and certified to be dual-status commanders from the  National Guard and active duty federal officers for the 54 U.S. states and  territories, DOD\u2019s ability to adequately prepare for and effectively use  dual-status commanders for a range of civil support events, including  those affecting multiple states, may be hindered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Relies on its Broad Civil Support Guidance for Domestic Cyber Incidents", "paragraphs": ["DOD has issued some guidance on preparing for and responding to  domestic cyber incidents.

DOD\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report  acknowledges that DOD needs more clearly defined roles and  responsibilities for operating in cyberspace. While DOD\u2019s guidance for its  civil support mission broadly describes how the department can support  other federal agencies during a civil support incident, DOD has not  updated its civil support guidance to reflect current DOD cyber roles and  responsibilities.

DOD officials said they plan to  omit the overlap when they update the 2009 directive. DOD officials told  us that current national-level exercises involving DOD, DHS, and other  federal agencies should help DOD clarify its roles and responsibilities and  subsequently update its guidance for domestic cyber incidents.  Nonetheless, until DOD clearly defines roles and responsibilities, the  department risks a delayed response while its officials determine which  entities to involve in responding to potentially time critical domestic cyber  incidents.

Further, while  DOD\u2019s efforts to implement the dual-status commander construct could  result in a more streamlined, comprehensive response to major disasters  and emergencies, particularly those affecting multiple states and  territories, until DOD clarifies how it plans to use dual-status commanders  and develops a process for determining the appropriate mix of National  Guard and active duty federal officers that it needs, the value of this  construct will be diminished. Finally, without specific guidance on DOD\u2019s  response to domestic cyber incidents, including clearly defined roles and  responsibilities, DOD may be unable to quickly and effectively support  DHS during domestic cyber attacks. As a result, DHS\u2019s ability to  effectively respond to domestic cyber attacks and minimize their impact  may be hindered. Enhancing DOD\u2019s overall preparedness, including  developing and maintaining current and complete guidance for its  homeland defense and civil support missions, would contribute to a more  efficient national response to major disasters and emergencies and a  more cost-effective use of federal resources for these critical missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should direct the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs, to develop a process  to periodically assess the currency of its Strategy for Homeland Defense  and Civil Support and to ensure that updates, when needed, are  completed in a timely manner.", "The Secretary of Defense should direct the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs and in collaboration  with other appropriate stakeholders such as U.S. Northern Command,  U.S. Pacific Command, and the National Guard Bureau, to develop  implementation guidance on the dual-status commander construct that, at  a minimum, includes: more specific criteria for determining when and how to use dual-status  commanders, especially for civil support incidents affecting multiple  states and territories and a process for determining the appropriate mix of National Guard and  active duty federal officers to meet DOD\u2019s anticipated needs.", "The Secretary of Defense should direct the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy to work with U.S. Strategic Command and its subordinate Cyber  Command, DHS, and other relevant stakeholders to update guidance on  preparing for and responding to domestic cyber incidents to align with  national-level guidance.

DOD stated  that it recognizes the need to ensure that strategic guidance is clear and  timely, and that going forward it will conduct an annual review to  determine the currency of the homeland defense and civil support  strategy.

In its written response, DOD stated that the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas'  Security Affairs has drafted a DOD instruction that, among other things,  establishes specific criteria for determining how and when to use dual- status commanders, as well as whom to authorize as dual-status  commanders.

In its written response, DOD agreed that some of its cyber  guidance needs updating to ensure that the military services, combatant  commands, and other DOD organizations are aware of their  responsibilities relative to domestic cyber incidents. Although DOD  acknowledged that there may be competing guidance within the  chartering directives for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs and the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Global Strategic Affairs, it stated that there is no confusion  within the Office of the Secretary of Defense regarding who manages  cyber policy. However, DOD did agree to further clarify cyber policy  responsibilities when it next updates these two chartering directives.

Specifically, we assessed national-level and DOD homeland defense and  civil support guidance against emerging issues in our discussions with  DOD, combatant command, and military service officials including the  dual-status commander construct and domestic cyber. We also reviewed  the assessments DOD received from the members of the joint doctrine  community to determine which emerging issues prompted complete  revisions of the joint publications on homeland defense and civil support  and how these issues were addressed in other sources of guidance  including directives, strategies, joint operating concepts, and national- level guidance.

We also met with DOD officials and assessed relevant documentation,  such as the instructions on joint doctrine development and updating  directives, to determine the extent that the department had established and  utilized a process to maintain current guidance. We used our assessment  and discussion with DOD officials to determine the impact these  established processes had on DOD\u2019s ability to maintain current doctrine  and directives.

Specifically, we analyzed data provided by U.S. Northern  Command, including the current number of individuals trained and certified  as dual-status commanders and processes used to train and certify them.  We used this data to determine how DOD was planning to use dual-status  commanders and to what extent they determined the appropriate mix of  active duty and National Guard dual-status commanders. We also  assessed current guidance against information obtained in interviews with  knowledgeable Joint Staff, Office of Secretary of Defense, combatant  command, and military service officials to determine how DOD was  planning to address identified gaps. To determine the currency and  completeness of the department\u2019s guidance for domestic cyber incidents,  we reviewed relevant guidance and met with DOD and DHS officials to  discuss gaps and the impact of gaps on civil support for cyber incident  responses. We determined which offices in DOD had a role for domestic  cyber, reviewed relevant DOD directives outlining those roles, and  analyzed whether there was any overlap within those offices or additional  clarification that was needed.
