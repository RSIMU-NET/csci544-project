The 6-week delay was attributable to problems with the project's most critical activity--the fire protection system. Under the current schedule, the construction of the House and Senate expansions spaces will be completed before the CVC's construction, but both the CVC and the expansion spaces will be available for occupancy at the same time because final acceptance testing of both is slated to be done concurrently. During the past month, the CVC team has made progress on the project's heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, interior floor stone and ceiling installation, and other interior and exterior construction work. In addition, AOC sent Congress an action plan for improving its execution of the project and the project's schedule, as the Subcommittee requested and we had recommended, and this plan is responsive to our recommendations. AOC is also considering other action not discussed in this plan. Despite this progress, problems have occurred in many important activities besides the CVC's fire protection system, according to AOC's construction management contractor. Although these delays did not add time to the project's schedule this month, additional delays could do so in the future. Recently identified issues associated with the CVC's HVAC system, fire protection system, and security system--including issues associated with their coordination and testing--also pose risks to the project's scheduled completion date.

We also reviewed AOC\u2019s construction management contractor\u2019s  periodic schedule assessments, potential change order log, and daily  reports on the progress of interior wall and floor stonework. We retained a  mechanical engineering consulting firm (Kincaid/Bryant) to help us assess  the CVC team\u2019s progress in completing the project\u2019s heating, ventilation,  and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. In addition, we reviewed the contract  modifications made to date and the estimates of cost increases provided  by AOC and its construction management contractor, including their  estimates of the costs related to delays, and their preliminary cost  estimates for recent changes to the CVC\u2019s fire protection and security  systems.", "At the Subcommittee\u2019s September 21 CVC hearing, we reported that our  assessment of the project\u2019s schedule and expected cost at completion was  somewhat constrained because the CVC team was still analyzing the  impact on the project\u2019s schedule and cost of the recently identified  changes required for certain components of the fire protection and  security systems. We also noted that the team expected to have firmer  schedule and cost information around mid-October. However, the CVC  team did not receive firmer information on the impact of the recent fire  alarm system changes on the schedule until late last week, noted some  remaining uncertainty about how long the pretesting of the fire alarm  system would take, and recently learned of significant changes that would  be needed in the security system and in the sequence for bringing the  CVC\u2019s air handling units online. In addition, the impact of these changes  on the project\u2019s cost is not yet fully known. Therefore, we could not  thoroughly assess the project\u2019s schedule or estimated cost at completion  and are basing our views on the information available as of November 9,  2006, recognizing that our views could change as more information on the  impact of these changes becomes available.", "Since the Subcommittee\u2019s September 21 CVC hearing, the CVC team has  continued to move the project\u2019s construction forward, but the project\u2019s  scheduled completion date has slipped by 6 weeks, to October 26, 2007,  and further delays are possible.

Although these delays did not add  time to the project\u2019s schedule this month, additional delays could do so in  the future. For example, the completion date for wall stone installation in  the East Front basement slipped by 38 workdays since the Subcommittee\u2019s  last CVC hearing, and an additional 17-workday slippage could delay the  CVC project\u2019s scheduled completion date. Similarly, work on the HVAC  system slipped 19 workdays, and an additional slippage of 46 workdays  could delay the project\u2019s scheduled completion date.

To improve AOC\u2019s ability to meet its  schedule and to reduce the risks to the project\u2019s schedule and cost facing  AOC now that the contract completion date is past, we are recommending  that AOC (1) promptly work with the CVC team to address the concerns  associated with the CVC\u2019s HVAC system and (2) carefully consider the  existing contractual remedies available to achieve completion of all  necessary work within the current estimated time frame and cost without  otherwise compromising any of the government\u2019s contractual rights or  remedies.", "Since the Subcommittee\u2019s September 21 CVC hearing, we have increased  our estimate of the total cost to complete the entire CVC project by about  $8 million to account for the delays and changes identified during this  period, but our estimate is rough because we have not had the  information or the time needed to fully assess the impact of these delays  and changes on the projects\u2019 cost. With this $8 million increase, we now  estimate that the total cost of the entire CVC project at completion is likely  to be about $592 million without an allowance for risks and uncertainties,  recognizing, however, that the extent of AOC\u2019s responsibility for the delay- related costs is uncertain. To date, about $531 million has been provided  for CVC construction. For fiscal year 2007, AOC has requested $26 million  in CVC construction appropriations, plus $950,000 in AOC general  administration appropriations for contractual support to complete  acceptance testing of the CVC\u2019s fire protection system on schedule. During  fiscal year 2007, AOC is also likely to need, but has not yet requested,  additional funds to pay for changes. At the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC  hearing, we roughly estimated that AOC would need an additional $5  million to $10 million in fiscal year 2007 over and above what it had  already requested for changes unless it decided to use funds slated for  other purposes, after obtaining the necessary congressional approvals.  AOC agrees with this rough estimate at this time and notes that it will  likely need additional money in fiscal year 2008 to replenish these funds  and to cover other costs if they materialize."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Construction Progress Has Not Been Sufficient to Offset Impact of Changes and Delays on the Project\u2019s Schedule and Completion", "paragraphs": ["Work on the CVC project has progressed in many areas, but the project  completion date has slipped to October 26, 2007, about 6 weeks beyond  the September 17, 2007, completion date discussed at the Subcommittee\u2019s  last CVC hearing. This 6-week slippage is due to continuing problems  associated with the CVC\u2019s fire protection system, but many other  important activities, including those associated with the HVAC system,  East Front, and security system, have been delayed as well. Last week, at  the request of the Subcommittee and as we had recommended, AOC  completed and sent to Congress an action plan for improving management  execution of the project and its schedule. The action plan was responsive  to our recommendation. However, it is too early to tell whether  implementing the plan will curtail the types of schedule slippages that  have occurred since the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing and throughout  the project. Moreover, although the CVC team and AOC\u2019s Fire Marshal  Division have agreed on a number of important elements of the CVC\u2019s fire  protection system, they have not yet agreed on all important elements.  Additionally, as noted, concerns have emerged regarding the CVC\u2019s HVAC  system, as well as the impact of the passage of the sequence 2 September  15, 2006, contract completion date. Accordingly, priority should be given  to accomplishing all of the identified critical tasks so that pretesting of the  facility\u2019s fire protection system can begin in the spring of 2007.  Additionally, to ensure that AOC gets a high-quality, fully functional  facility, it is essential that AOC effectively implement the actions it has  identified and give careful consideration to existing contractual remedies  available to it to achieve completion of all necessary work within the  current estimated time frame at a reasonable cost without otherwise  compromising any of the government\u2019s contractual rights or remedies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress: CVC Team Has Advanced Interior CVC and Other Construction Work and Has Begun to Implement an Action Plan for Strengthening Its Project Management", "paragraphs": ["According to information provided by AOC and its construction  management contractor and our observations, work on the project has  advanced, in terms of both the dollar value of the work in place and  individual project elements. In dollar terms, AOC\u2019s construction  management contractor reported that, as of October 31, the overall CVC  project was about 88 percent complete and the sequence 2 work was  about 84 percent complete\u2014up from about 86 percent and 77 percent,  respectively, as of the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing. Progress on  individual project elements includes the following:  Interior CVC work has moved forward, according to AOC\u2019s construction  management and sequence 2 contractors. For example, the CVC team and  AOC\u2019s Fire Marshal Division have reached or nearly reached agreement on  the design for several critical elements of the facility\u2019s fire protection  system. Agreement on these elements is necessary for the system\u2019s  installation to proceed. In addition, the mechanical subcontractor has  completed certain preparations for operating the CVC\u2019s air handling units,  all but two of which passed a required test for leaks as of Monday, and the  CVC team expects conditioned air to begin flowing to certain parts of the  facility later this month. The sequence 2 contractor has also installed  about 65 percent of the CVC\u2019s floor stone, up from about 43 percent at the  time of the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, and ceiling installation is  complete or essentially complete in the great hall, south side corridor  (lower level), both orientation theaters, and the food service area.

AOC developed this  plan at the Subcommittee\u2019s request in response to recommendations we  made to AOC at the Subcommittee\u2019s September 21 CVC hearing. These  recommendations were aimed at enhancing AOC\u2019s execution of the  schedule and project and at facilitating the Subcommittee\u2019s efforts to (1)  hold AOC accountable for managing the project and (2) work with AOC to  ensure that the schedule implications of proposed scope or design  changes are quickly determined and considered by all appropriate  stakeholders before final decisions on the proposed changes are made.  AOC\u2019s actions included    meeting weekly with the CVC team to deal exclusively with schedule    having its construction management contractor identify areas needed to  meet the project\u2019s schedule that the contractor believes are understaffed  or face obstacles to progress;  identifying sequence 2 and construction management personnel who are  responsible for meeting key schedule dates and resolving identified  problems;   basing the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s future award fee on meeting schedule  reassessing the scope, depth, and time frames associated with the  pretesting and final testing of the facility\u2019s fire and life-safety protection  systems; increasing communication among the CVC team, AOC\u2019s Fire Marshal  Division, and the U.S. Capitol Police; and    discussing proposed significant scope or design changes with Capitol  Preservation Commission representatives before such proposed changes  are adopted and getting the congressional leadership\u2019s approval for  discretionary changes requested by the Senate or House.", "The actions AOC has identified are generally responsive to our  recommendations and, if implemented effectively and quickly, should help  AOC improve its project and schedule management as well as help ensure  that the schedule and cost implications of proposed discretionary design  or scope changes are appropriately considered before final decisions on  them are made. However, we have concerns about the usefulness of one  step AOC is considering\u2014the possible establishment of a CVC peer review  panel to assess the approaches planned for the fire protection system\u2019s  pretesting and final testing. We have expressed our concerns to AOC, and  it has agreed to consider them.", "Besides the actions it identified in its November 2006 action plan, AOC has  been considering how to deal with the impact of passing the sequence 2  contract completion date, September 15, 2006. This is a complex issue, in  part because its resolution potentially involves preliminary determinations  about the causes of, and responsibility for, project delays during sequence  2 up to September 15. AOC has also been considering other factors, such  as the need to instill a sense of urgency and responsibility to meet the  contractor\u2019s currently established fall 2007 completion time frame; the  possibility of setting a specific date as the new contract completion date  and the implications associated with alternative dates; the constructive  manner in which the sequence 2 contractor has worked with AOC and the  rest of the CVC team to accomplish work and resolve problems; and the  need to ensure that the work necessary to get the facility completed is  done expeditiously at a reasonable cost. We have discussed these issues  with AOC and pointed out that it needs to decide how it intends to  proceed as quickly as possible and also consider the risks that various  options pose. In view of additional schedule slippages that have occurred  and issues that have arisen since the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, we  are making additional recommendations to AOC, which we will discuss  later in this testimony.", "In addition to the actions identified by AOC, the sequence 2 contractor has  reported adding five superintendents to its CVC staff in the last several  months to help achieve the schedule. Given the number and magnitude of  the changes that have occurred to the sequence 2 contract since it was  initially awarded and the extent to which problems have constrained  progress, we believe that this additional supervision should put the team  in a better position to meet schedule dates and address problems quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems: Required Changes to Fire Protection System and Continued Slippages in Other Important Activities Have Extended the Project\u2019s Schedule and Completion Date", "paragraphs": ["The additional time needed to make design changes to the CVC\u2019s fire  protection system has extended the project\u2019s completion date by about 6  weeks since the Subcommittee\u2019s September 21 CVC hearing\u2014from  September 17, 2007, according to the schedule in effect at that time, to  October 26, 2007, according to the October 2006 schedule issued last  week. In addition, AOC\u2019s construction management contractor reported  slippages in construction work for all of the 20 near-critical activity paths  it identified in its schedule report for October 2006. For many of these  activity paths, the schedule slipped at least 4 weeks. For example, the  contractor reported a 65-workday delay for two East Front elevators due  to late completion of necessary preceding work, a 66-workday delay for  fabrication and installation of bronze doors because of fabrication  problems experienced by the supplier, a 38-workday delay in ceiling close- ins in the upper level security lobby needed to resolve unexpected ceiling  problems, and a 38-workday delay in completing wall stone work in the  East Front basement area attributable to unanticipated design issues. The  contractor also reported a 130-workday delay in the delivery of custom  light fixtures, apparently the result of contractual issues between the  sequence 2 contractor and its supplier. According to the construction  management contractor, there are now five near-critical activity paths\u2014 including the HVAC system, East Front work, and work in the upper level  security lobby and assembly rooms, for which additional slippages of 17 to  53 workdays could further delay the CVC\u2019s completion date.", "Neither the September 17, 2007, nor the October 26, 2007, project  completion dates included any time for (1) installing artifacts in the  exhibit gallery after a certificate of occupancy has been issued, (2)  preparing for operations, or (3) dealing with risks and uncertainties.

As we indicated at the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, we  asked our mechanical engineering consultant to reassess the status of the  CVC\u2019s air handling units in early November 2006 because the CVC\u2019s HVAC  system affects many activities, has had a number of problems, and poses  significant risks to the project\u2019s successful completion. We asked the  consultant to compare the units\u2019 mechanical readiness to provide  conditioned air to the CVC as of November 1 with their readiness as of his  previous assessment, on September 6, 2006. On November 1, he found that  the installation of controls for the air handling units was nearing  completion, substantial work had been done to insulate 7 of the units, and  all of the units could be ready on schedule with committed effort by the  sequence 2 mechanical subcontractor. He noted, however, that except for  pressure and leak testing and controls installation, little visible work had  been done on 12 of the units to address the issues he had identified during  his September visit. He said he did not see a large number of workers in  the air handling unit areas and the work that was being done appeared to  be on pipe insulation. Moreover, he saw little coordination between work  on completing the air handling units and on the spaces they are to serve,  and he noted a number of concerns about the operational readiness of  both, indicating that delays in providing conditioned air to the facility and  in balancing of the air handling units could potentially delay the project\u2019s  schedule.", "Even though the HVAC system\u2019s installation and associated work are  progressing, a number of issues besides those observed by our mechanical  engineering consultant have arisen since the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC  hearing, heightening our concerns about the CVC team\u2019s ability to meet its  schedule for completing and commissioning the system. Because some of  the spaces to be served by the air handling units were not yet ready, the  sequence 2 contractor recently decided to change the sequence in which  some of the air handling units would be placed in service. However, as of  last week, the technical implications of this change had not been fully  determined. The commissioning contractor has questioned whether  enough people will be available to support the commissioning process   within the scheduled time frames, and, as noted, our mechanical  engineering consultant has raised operational readiness concerns. AOC\u2019s  construction management contractor has also expressed concerns about  these issues, and we have raised the issues in a number of CVC team  meetings, but the responses have not given us confidence that (1) all the  work associated with bringing the air handling units on line and  commissioning them has been sufficiently coordinated among the team  members; (2) all technical issues and risks associated with fully operating  the units have been adequately addressed; and (3) that sufficient staff will  be available to meet the scheduled dates.", "According to sequence 2 contractor personnel, these types of problems  and ongoing schedule adjustments to address day-to-day events are not  uncommon in large, complex construction projects. Not all the problems  with the air handling units have to be resolved fully before commissioning  work can proceed, they said, and air handling units are typically turned on  before other work is completed to provide conditioned air for materials  that need it. The sequence 2 contractor said it would work with the  mechanical subcontractor and other parties to ensure that the HVAC  system issues are resolved in a timely manner. Furthermore, according to  the contractor personnel, contractual provisions are in place to address  providing conditioned air to the CVC while construction work is  underway. We understand these points and recognize the progress that has  been made. However, in light of the recurring slippages in the HVAC  system\u2019s schedule, the system\u2019s importance to the pretesting and final  testing of the facility\u2019s fire protection system, and the concerns expressed  by AOC\u2019s construction management contractor and the commissioning  contractor, we believe prompt action is needed to resolve the concerns  and ensure that the schedule for completing the HVAC system work is  realistic and will be met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Completing the Expansion Spaces and the Library of Congress Tunnel", "paragraphs": ["The schedule for essentially completing the construction of the House and  Senate expansion spaces (currently scheduled for April 23, 2007) has  slipped about 6 weeks since the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, and  several activities important to completing these spaces have also been  delayed. For example, AOC\u2019s construction management contractor  reported another 14-workday delay in completing the circular stairs in the  atrium areas. Delays have also occurred in, for example, the installation of  the stone arch in the House lower level, because the work is taking longer  than expected, and in the installation of millwork in the House lower level,  because of fabrication delays. In addition, a special fire suppression  system was not installed because it had not been approved. Furthermore,  the sequence 2 subcontractor doing the expansion space work identified a  number of concerns that could affect the project\u2019s completion. For  example, the subcontractor reported that its schedule could be adversely  affected if significant scope or design changes continue. Assuming that  scope and design changes are controlled, the sequence 2 subcontractor  responsible for the expansion space work hopes to recover some of the  lost time and essentially complete its construction work in March 2007. In  addition, the project\u2019s schedule shows that the construction activity  (excluding testing) remaining after the April 2007 essential completion  date is primarily related to work necessary to complete the circular stair in  the House atrium. AOC anticipates that a design change will enable the  circular stairs in both the House and the Senate atriums to be completed  sooner than currently scheduled.", "Finally, although not critical to the CVC\u2019s opening, work being done to  connect the Library of Congress\u2019s Jefferson building to the tunnel linking it  with the CVC has fallen more than 3 weeks behind since the  Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, according to the construction  management contractor, at least in part, because certain stone work has  taken longer to install than anticipated. The subcontractor responsible for  this work, which is currently scheduled for completion on April 24, 2007,  expects to recover lost time and complete the work in March 2007.  Furthermore, the construction management and sequence 2 contractors  report that, for a number of reasons, the work on the tunnel itself has  slipped about 9 \u00bd weeks beyond the completion date in effect at the  Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Construction Progress Point to Further Delays unless AOC\u2019s Project Execution Significantly Improves", "paragraphs": ["The four indicators of construction progress that we have been tracking  for the Subcommittee, together with the risks and uncertainties that  continue to face the project\u2014which we will discuss shortly\u2014demonstrate  to us that AOC will be unlikely to meet its fall 2007 project completion  date unless it significantly improves its project execution. An update on  these indicators follows:  Sequence 2 contractor has continued to miss most milestones. Starting  with the Subcommittee\u2019s June 2005 CVC hearing, at the Subcommittee\u2019s  request, we and AOC have been selecting and tracking sequence 2  milestones to help the Subcommittee monitor construction progress.  These milestones include activities that were either on the project\u2019s  critical path or that we and AOC believe are critical to the project\u2019s timely  completion. As figure 1 shows, the sequence 2 contractor has generally  missed these milestones. For today\u2019s hearing, the contractor met or was  expected to meet 4 of the 18 milestones that were due to be completed,  according to the project\u2019s September 2006 schedule, and for 1 of these 4,  the work was completed ahead of schedule. However, the contractor was  late in completing work for 4 other milestones and had not completed or  was not expected to complete the work for the remaining 10 milestones by  November 15, 2006. (See app. I.) The sequence 2 contractor attributed the  slippages to a number of factors, including design issues and a need to  relocate ductwork, add steel support for wall stone, and resequence work.", "Value of completed work has increased since the last hearing, but trend  reflects the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s difficulties in meeting scheduled  completion dates. Another indicator of construction progress that we and  AOC\u2019s construction management contractor have been tracking is the  value of the completed construction work billed to the government each  month. Overall, the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s monthly billings, including the  bills for March through October 2006, indicate that construction work is  about 2 months behind the late finish curve, which indicates completion  around November 2007. While this indicator has some limitations (for  example, billings lag behind construction), it is generally regarded in the  construction industry as a useful measure of how likely a project is to be  completed on time. Figure 2 compares the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s billings  since May 2003 with the billings needed to complete construction work on  schedule and suggests that AOC faces challenges in meeting its fall 2007  completion date and is more likely to complete the facility later than its  current schedule shows.", "Installation of interior wall and floor stone is taking longer than  expected. Overall, about 86 percent of the CVC\u2019s interior wall stone has  been installed (in the CVC, East Front, atrium areas, and tunnels),  according to AOC\u2019s construction management contractor, and the  sequence 2 contractor installed nearly 85,000 of the 129,780 square feet of  interior floor stone required as of November 9. Although the sequence 2  contractor has installed almost all of the wall stone in the CVC itself and  all of the wall stone in the atrium areas, wall stone installation in the East  Front is significantly behind schedule. According to the sequence 2  contractor\u2019s January 2006 wall stone installation schedule, the East Front  wall stone was to be completely installed by July 10, 2006. As of November  10, about 4,700 pieces of wall stone remained to be installed in the East  Front\u2014the same quantity as we reported at the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC  hearing. During the 8 weeks since that hearing, the sequence 2 contractor  installed about 34,900 square feet of interior floor stone, or about 65  percent of the 52,060 square feet specified in the floor stone installation  plan that the contractor had previously provided to AOC. According to the  construction management contractor, the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s  installation of interior floor stone has been impeded by a lack of available  space and by some work taking longer than expected.", "Figure 3 shows the sequence 2 contractor\u2019s progress in installing interior  floor stone since February 13, 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project\u2019s Schedule Remains Vulnerable to Challenges, Risks, and Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["As we have indicated during the Subcommittee\u2019s previous CVC hearings,  we believe that the CVC team continues to face challenges, risks, and  uncertainties in quickly completing the project. Given the project\u2019s history  of delays, the difficulties the CVC team has encountered in quickly  resolving problems that arise, and the large number of near-critical  activities that can affect the project\u2019s overall completion, the CVC team\u2019s  efforts to identify potential problems early and resolve issues quickly will  be even more important from this point forward, because AOC has left no  \u201cslack\u201d in the schedule for contingencies. In our view, the remaining work  associated with the fire protection and HVAC systems poses the greatest  risks to meeting AOC\u2019s fall 2007 project completion date. The steps AOC  has taken to mitigate these risks have been helpful, but much work  remains to be done on these systems and on their linkages with other  building systems. In addition, the project continues to face risks and  uncertainties associated with other work important to its completion, such  as the East Front, and additional design or scope changes. The project\u2019s  current schedule does not provide the 2 to 3 months that a previous  schedule allowed for addressing ongoing challenges, risks, and  uncertainties. Accordingly, we plan to continue to monitor the CVC team\u2019s  efforts to meet its schedule for the fire protection, HVAC, security, and  other building systems and other key near-critical activities as well as the  timeliness of the actions taken by the CVC team to address problems,  concerns, and questions that arise. A brief update follows on the  challenges, risks, and uncertainties the CVC team continues to face and  the team\u2019s plans for addressing them:    Complex building systems remain a significant risk. The CVC will house  complex building systems, including HVAC, fire protection, and security  systems. These systems not only have to perform well individually, but  their operation also has to be integrated. If the CVC team encounters any  significant problems with them, either separately or together, during the  resolution of design issues, installation, commissioning, or testing, the  project could be seriously delayed. The unanticipated problems that  emerged in reviewing the design of the fire alarm system and in  programming it illustrate the impact such problems can have on the  project\u2019s schedule. AOC\u2019s Fire Marshal Division and the CVC team have  recently made considerable progress in reaching agreement on the design  of a number of important elements of the CVC\u2019s fire protection system that  are important to the purchasing and installation of wiring and equipment.  As of November 13, the Fire Marshal Division had approved or essentially  agreed to the designs of the sprinkler, smoke control, and emergency  public address systems as well as most aspects of the CVC\u2019s and East  Front\u2019s fire alarm systems that are related to the ordering and installation  of wiring and equipment. According to the Fire Marshal Division, any  outstanding comments on these system elements are minor. On the other  hand, agreement has not yet been reached on a number of other system  elements, including the sequence of operations for the CVC fire alarm  system, the design for the special fire protection system in the exhibit  gallery, and the plan for final acceptance testing of the facility\u2019s fire  protection system. A sequence 2 subcontractor has identified dates by  which certain elements must be approved to avoid further delays. Thus,  additional delays could occur if the team takes longer than expected to get  necessary remaining approvals or if the fire protection system does not  work effectively individually or in concert with the security or other  building systems. It is because of constraints such as these that we believe  it is so important to address open issues associated with the HVAC system  and to continue coordination with the U.S. Capitol Police on the security  system. Since the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, the Capitol Police  have identified another security problem that will require additional work.  The impact of this work, if any, had not been determined as of November  9.", "Building design and work scope continue to evolve. The CVC has  undergone a number of design and work scope changes. Since September  15, 2006, AOC\u2019s architectural contractor has issued five design changes or  clarifications. As of November 8, 2006, this contractor reported, another  four were in process. In addition, since the project began, AOC has  executed over 100 sequence 2 contract modifications for work that was  not anticipated. Some of these changes, such as changes in the exhibit  gallery and in the East Front, have resulted in delays. Furthermore,  although shop drawings have been approved for almost all project  elements, according to AOC, further design or scope changes in various  project elements are likely, given the project\u2019s experience to date. Project  design and scope changes are typically reflected in the development of  potential change orders (PCO), many of which result in contract  modifications. Figure 4 shows the PCOs submitted for consideration for  sequences 1 and 2 since September 2003. Although PCOs are not always  approved, they are often regarded as a reasonably good indicator of likely  future design or scope changes that can affect a project\u2019s cost and  schedule. Even more important, the adverse impact of scope and design  changes on a project\u2019s schedule is likely to increase as the project moves  toward completion.", "As the figure indicates, new PCOs for sequence 1 were submitted until  shortly before, and even for several months after, November 2004, when  AOC determined that the sequence 1 contract work was substantially  complete. Similarly, PCOs for sequence 2 are still being submitted, and we  have seen no indication that their submission is likely to stop soon. It  therefore appears likely to us that some of the design or scope changes  indicated in PCOs could lead to contract modifications that will affect the  project\u2019s schedule. AOC agrees that it is important to minimize the impact  of proposed design and scope changes.", "Trade stacking could delay completion. As we discussed during the  Subcommittee\u2019s previous CVC hearings, trade stacking could hold up  finish work, such as drywall or ceiling installation, electrical and plumbing  work, plastering, or floor stone installation. This work could be stacked  because of delays in wall stone installation. Trade stacking could also  increase the risk of accidents and injuries. Hence, it remains important, as  we said at previous CVC hearings, for the CVC team to closely monitor  construction to identify potential trade stacking and promptly take steps  to address it. The CVC team has also identified trade stacking as a high  risk. The sequence 2 contractor has developed plans that show when  various subcontractors will be working in various areas of the CVC.  According to the sequence 2 contractor, it has been continuing to meet  regularly with its subcontractors to identify and resolve potential issues.  The CVC team identified instances of trade stacking that occurred in an  effort to expedite certain East Front work and in doing millwork and stone  work in the orientation theaters. AOC\u2019s construction management  contractor has noted trade stacking as a potential issue associated with  the compressed time frame for bringing all of the air handling units on  line.", "Additional delays associated with the CVC\u2019s new utility tunnel have  resulted, or could result, in additional work or slippages. The delay in  starting up the utility tunnel\u2019s operations has necessitated the use of  temporary humidity control equipment for several areas to avoid damage  to finish work and ceiling tile. Such delays may subject certain work to the  risk of damage or may delay finish or ceiling work in areas not suitable for  the use of temporary humidity and temperature control equipment. For  example, the CVC team installed ceiling tile in portions of the great hall to  take advantage of the scaffolding in place, even though neither the  temperature nor the humidity was controlled in that area. According to the  CVC team, the installed tile could be damaged if the temperature or  humidity is not within specified levels, and certain exhibit gallery  woodwork has been delayed because conditioned air has not been  available. Although the CVC team expected in early August to be providing  dehumidified air to the exhibit gallery by mid-August, the sequence 2  contractor now expects to begin providing conditioned air to the CVC later  this month. However, as noted, the contractor has resequenced the order  for bringing some air handling units on line because some spaces\u2014 including the exhibit gallery, which was slated to receive conditioned air  first\u2014were not clean enough for the units to operate. The air handling unit  serving the exhibit gallery is now expected to come on line early in  December. Remaining risks include having sufficient manpower to meet  the scheduled dates for getting the HVAC system fully operational, having  sufficiently clean spaces, and being able to quickly overcome any  problems that may arise in getting the system properly balanced,  controlled, and commissioned, including providing enough manpower  without causing trade stacking.", "Late identification or slow resolution of problems or issues could delay  completion. Historically, the project has experienced or been at risk of  experiencing some delays resulting from slow decision-making. In  addition, some CVC team members believe that some of the problems that  have resulted in delays, such as certain problems associated with the East  Front or with problematic sequence 1 concrete work could have been  identified and addressed earlier than they were. In responding to these  comments, the sequence 2 contractor said that although earlier  identification of these types of problems is conceptually possible, it is  difficult in practice. Looking forward, we do not believe that the team will  be able to meet its scheduled completion date if it does not quickly decide  on issues; respond to concerns, questions, and submittals; or resolve  problems. In September 2006, AOC told the CVC team that starting  October 1, the architectural contractor would be decreasing its staff  support to the project. In our opinion, this change increased the risk of  slow responses to design questions or requests for design instructions at a  very critical time, particularly because we have not seen evidence of a  decrease in potential change orders. AOC believes that it will be able to  provide its CVC construction contractors with sufficient architectural  support to respond to appropriate questions or requests in time to avoid  delays. We believe that this situation needs close monitoring as well as  corrective action if problems arise. AOC has not reported any problems in  this area since the last CVC hearing, and has identified steps in its  November 2006 action plan aimed at identifying and resolving design  problems quickly.", "Finally, as we noted earlier in our testimony today, AOC\u2019s delay analysis is  even more critical given the passage of the sequence 2 September 15, 2006,  contract completion date and the need to obtain a complete facility  without further delays and unreasonable costs, including delay-related  costs. On April 11, 2006, AOC executed a contract modification authorizing  its construction management contractor to have one of its managers who  has not been involved in the CVC project assess the adequacy of this type  of information. The manager submitted his report to AOC in early June. He  reported generally positive findings but also identified desired  improvements. He made several recommendations to AOC, which AOC  has generally agreed with and plans to implement consistent with the  availability of resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project\u2019s New Schedule Appears Achievable Only under Certain Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The October project schedule shows that almost all physical construction  work on the CVC, the East Front, and the expansion spaces will be  completed by spring 2007 and that the pretesting and final testing of all fire  protection, life safety, and related systems for these areas will be carried  out between then and late October 2007. This schedule reflects the amount  of time that AOC\u2019s Chief Fire Marshal said he would need to perform his  acceptance testing, although the CVC team is working to see if certain  aspects of the testing can be done differently to save some time. The  October 2006 schedule also calls for completing the installation of artifacts  in the exhibit gallery by November 30, 2007. However, this schedule does  not allow any time for addressing problems, risks, or uncertainties  associated with obtaining a certificate of occupancy or for preparing for  operations.", "Given the uncertainty about how much time will be needed to pretest the  fire protection system, the concerns associated with the HVAC system, the  unknown effectiveness of AOC\u2019s recently identified actions to curtail  future schedule slippages, and the limited amount of time we had to assess  the October project schedule, we do not feel that we are in position to  suggest a definitive project completion date. However, in light of the work  we have done, we do not believe AOC will be able to complete the project  by fall 2007 if the actions it has identified are not effective in curtailing  future schedule slippages.

With this approximately $8 million  increase, we now estimate, on the basis of our limited review, that the  total cost of the entire CVC project at completion is likely to be about $592  million without an allowance for risks and uncertainties. We nevertheless  recognize that the project continues to face a number of uncertainties,  including uncertainty over the extent of AOC\u2019s responsibility for the delay- related costs. (We have not updated our estimate of the project\u2019s cost at  completion with an allowance for risks and uncertainties.)", "To date, about $531 million has been provided for CVC construction.

AOC has requested  this additional $26 million in its fiscal year 2007 budget for CVC  construction. AOC has also requested $950,000 in fiscal year 2007 general  administration appropriation funds to provide contractual support for the  Chief Fire Marshal\u2019s final acceptance testing of the CVC. During fiscal year  2007, AOC is also likely to need, but has not yet requested, additional  funds to pay for changes. At the Subcommittee\u2019s last CVC hearing, we  roughly estimated that AOC would need an additional $5 million to $10  million in fiscal year 2007 for changes unless it decides to use funds slated  for other purposes, after obtaining the necessary congressional approvals.  AOC agrees with this rough estimate at this time and notes that it would  likely need additional funding in fiscal year 2008 to replenish these funds  and to cover certain additional costs if they materialize.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes our prepared statement.
