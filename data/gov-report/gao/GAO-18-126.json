Two of the actions involve preserving supplies of LEU, and the other two involve diluting highly enriched uranium (HEU) with lower enriched forms of uranium to produce LEU. GAO reviewed these actions and found the actual costs and schedules for those taken to date generally align with estimates. NNSA and GAO have identified risks associated with two of these actions. One of these risks has been resolved; NNSA is taking steps to mitigate another, while others, such as uncertainty of future appropriations, are unresolved.", "NNSA's preliminary plan for analyzing options to supply unobligated enriched uranium in the long term is inconsistent with DOE directives for the acquisition of capital assets, which state that the mission need statement should be a clear and concise description of the gap between current capabilities and the mission need. The scope of the mission need statement that NNSA has developed can be interpreted to meet two different mission needs: (1) a need for enriched uranium for multiple national security needs, including tritium, and (2) a specific need for enriched uranium to produce tritium. The DOE directives also state that mission need should be independent of and not defined by a particular solution. However, NNSA is showing preference toward a particular solution\u2014building a new uranium enrichment capability\u2014and the agency has not included other technology options for analysis. Without (1) revising the scope of the mission need statement to clarify the mission need it seeks to achieve and (2) adjusting the range of options it considers in the analysis of alternatives process, NNSA may not consider all options to satisfy its mission need.", "Although the scope of the mission need statement is unclear, NNSA has prepared preliminary cost estimates for the two uranium enrichment technology options\u2014the large and small centrifuge\u2014that the agency considers to be the most feasible. However, these estimates are limited in scope and do not fully meet best practices for reliable cost estimates. Based on GAO's review of NNSA documents, NNSA appears to favor an incremental approach to reestablishing an enrichment capability that could ultimately meet all national security needs for enriched uranium. The estimates' scope is limited, however, in that they reflect only the costs of the first increment\u2014producing LEU for tritium\u2014and do not reflect the full costs of building a uranium enrichment facility that could meet the range of enriched uranium needs. GAO's cost guide\u2014which provides cost estimating best practices\u2014states that the scope of preliminary cost estimates should reflect full life-cycle costs. Also, NNSA's estimates for the two options minimally or partially met best practice characteristics for reliable cost estimates even when assessed for the more limited mission scope. For example, the estimates excluded certain costs and did not describe the calculations used. NNSA officials said that the cost estimates are preliminary and will be revised.

Uranium, at various levels of enrichment, is  important for the achievement of all of these missions. Specifically,  NNSA has identified several national security and other needs for  enriched uranium, including: (1) producing tritium which is a necessary  component of nuclear weapons, through an existing process in a  Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reactor that uses low enriched  uranium (LEU) as fuel; (2) supplying highly enriched uranium (HEU) to  meet the U.S. Navy\u2019s needs for its nuclear powered aircraft carriers and  submarines; and (3) providing \u201chigh assay\u201d LEU for medical isotope  production and research reactor fuel.

All  uranium is considered unobligated when neither the uranium nor the  technology or equipment used to enrich it carries an \u201cobligation\u201d to a  foreign country. These obligations are established under international  agreements that describe the conditions for civilian nuclear cooperation  between the United States and foreign partners. Uranium or uranium- related technology subject to peaceful-use obligations under such  agreements cannot be used for military purposes by the United States.  The United States lost its sole supplier of unobligated enrichment  services when the last operating enrichment plant using U.S. technology  ceased enriching uranium in May 2013. As a result, NNSA\u2019s supply of  unobligated LEU is finite and becoming increasingly scarce.

Natural uranium is comprised of  approximately 99.3 percent of the uranium-238 isotope and 0.7 percent of  the uranium-235 isotope\u2014which undergoes fission to release energy.  Uranium enrichment is the process of increasing the concentration of  uranium-235 in a quantity of natural uranium to make LEU to fuel nuclear  power plants, or to make HEU, which is used in nuclear weapons and as  fuel by the U.S. Navy. Generally, to produce enriched uranium, uranium is  extracted or mined from underground deposits, converted from a solid to  a gas, enriched to increase its concentration of uranium-235, and then  fabricated into fuel elements, such as rods for commercial nuclear  reactors, appropriate for their ultimate use. These steps make up the  nuclear fuel cycle (see fig. 1). After the fuel has been irradiated in a  nuclear power reactor, it is considered \u201cspent\u201d nuclear fuel. Spent fuel can  be chemically reprocessed, and the enriched uranium recycled for reuse.  The United States used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel but has not done  so since the mid-1970s, primarily to discourage other countries from  pursuing reprocessing because of concerns over nuclear proliferation, as  we have previously reported. Currently, in the United States, spent fuel is  stored as waste.", "LEU can also be produced by downblending HEU to LEU. This involves  mixing HEU with a \u201cdiluent\u201d or other forms of uranium\u2014such as natural  uranium\u2014to reduce the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope in the  uranium and produce an overall lower level of enrichment.", "Until 2013, uranium was enriched in the United States both for national  security and commercial purposes. Beginning in the 1940s, DOE and its  predecessor agencies provided uranium enrichment services\u2014first for  national security purposes and later for the emerging commercial nuclear  power industry\u2014using government-owned gaseous diffusion plants. In  1992, the U.S. government established the United States Enrichment  Corporation (USEC) as a government corporation to take over operations  of DOE\u2019s enrichment facilities and to provide uranium enrichment  services for the U.S. government and utilities that operate nuclear power  plants. In 1998, the corporation was privatized under the USEC  Privatization Act. From 1998 until 2013, DOE relied exclusively on USEC  to obtain enrichment services for the production of LEU needed to  produce tritium. In May 2013, USEC ceased enrichment at its last  commercially active enrichment plant in Paducah, Kentucky, which it had  leased from DOE since the time of USEC\u2019s establishment. USEC has  been the only company to enrich uranium with U.S. technology.", "Gas centrifuge technology, rather than gaseous diffusion technology, is  currently used around the world to enrich uranium. Gas centrifuges work  by spinning uranium hexafluoride in a gas form inside a centrifuge rotor at  an extremely high speed. The rotation creates a strong centrifugal force,  which separates the lighter uranium-235 molecules from the heavier  uranium-238 molecules. The enrichment achieved by a single gas  centrifuge is not sufficient to achieve the desired assay, so a series of  centrifuges are connected together in a configuration called a cascade. In  the United States, URENCO\u2014a European enrichment consortium\u2014 operates a gas centrifuge enrichment plant in New Mexico.", "The obligations governing the use of foreign uranium enrichment  technology and nuclear material in the United States are established  under international agreements between the United States and foreign  partners.

However,  tritium has a relatively short half-life of 12.3 years and decays at a rate of  about 5.5 percent per year. It must be periodically replenished to  maintain the designed capability of the weapons. Some tritium may be  recycled from dismantled weapons, but the inventory must also be  replenished through the production of new tritium.", "At present, NNSA produces tritium through the use of one of TVA\u2019s  electricity-producing nuclear reactors fueled with unobligated LEU. Small  quantities of tritium are the normal by-products of electricity-producing  nuclear power plants, such as those owned and operated by TVA. To  produce more tritium than usual and later collect it, specially designed  targets\u2014called tritium-producing burnable absorber rods (TPBAR)\u2014are  loaded with the unobligated LEU and irradiated in TVA\u2019s Watts Bar 1  reactor. Irradiated TPBARs are unloaded during normal fuel reloading  and shipped to NNSA\u2019s Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River  Site in South Carolina. There the tritium is extracted and prepared for use  in nuclear warheads and bombs (see fig. 2 for NNSA\u2019s tritium production  process).", "Prior to the use of TVA\u2019s reactor, the United States used other  government-owned reactors to produce tritium (see sidebar). In 1999,  TVA signed an interagency agreement with DOE to produce tritium at its  Watts Bar and Sequoyah commercial nuclear reactors. Since 2003,  TVA has been producing tritium for NNSA at its Watts Bar 1 reactor. TVA  does not have plans to use the Sequoyah reactors for tritium production  in the near term, according to a TVA document.", "History of U.S. Tritium Production   From 1954 until 1988, the United States  produced the majority of its tritium using  nuclear reactors at the Savannah River Site in  South Carolina. Smaller amounts of tritium  were also produced using nuclear reactors at  the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Hanford  Site in Washington. When the site\u2019s last  operating reactor\u2014known as K Reactor\u2014was  shut down due to safety concerns in 1988, the  United States lost its capability to produce  tritium for the nuclear weapons stockpile.", "The amount of tritium that NNSA needs changes based on national  security requirements. In fiscal year 2015, NNSA conducted a review of  the tritium inventory and anticipated future demand. At that time, NNSA  determined that to meet future tritium demand a second TVA reactor  would be required to irradiate TPBARs and produce additional tritium.  Using a second TVA reactor would increase the amount of unobligated  LEU needed for tritium production using this process, according to NNSA  documents.", "NNSA also supplies HEU for national security and other missions.

From 1988 to 1998,  DOE was able to meet its tritium requirements  by harvesting and recycling it from dismantled  nuclear warheads, as the United States  decreased the size of its nuclear arsenal.  However, because of tritium\u2019s short half-life,  DOE could not meet its long-term tritium  needs in this manner indefinitely.

Since there are no  commercial uranium enrichment facilities licensed to produce high-assay  LEU, it must be produced by downblending HEU. According to NNSA  documents, the HEU inventory allocated for research and isotope  production reactors using high-assay LEU is projected to be exhausted by  around 2030.

According to an NNSA official, NNSA is paying for  the REU program through a combination of funds provided through  annual appropriations and what the parties refer to as a \u201cbarter\u201d  arrangement, according to NNSA officials and documents. Under this  arrangement, NNSA is compensating the downblending contractor by  transferring title of the derived LEU to WesDyne, which will be retained as  unobligated LEU and eventually sold to TVA for tritium production  purposes. The REU downblending program will generate approximately  five reactor reloads of unobligated fuel for TVA, and will likely be used in  the early to mid-2030s, according to NNSA documents.", "Regarding the risks for the REU program, NNSA identified the uncertainty  of whether NNSA would be able to continue to conduct barters of derived  LEU to pay for downblending services. For example, the 2015 plan notes  that, while such transactions had worked well for previous downblending  campaigns, declining markets values for enriched uranium in recent years  had reduced industry\u2019s interest in being compensated for services with a  portion of the derived LEU. In addition, NNSA officials identified a lawsuit  challenging the legality of barters as a risk. This suit was dismissed in  July 2016. As a result, this specific risk no longer affects the  Department,  and according to NNSA officials, the agency anticipates  being able to continue compensating Nuclear Fuel Services with derived  LEU for the duration of the REU program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Downblending Offering for Tritium (DBOT)", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s second downblending action, which is planned to begin in 2019,  will involve HEU mainly composed of undesirable scrap, primarily in the  form of oxides, left over from uranium processing activities. NNSA  estimates that the planned DBOT program will generate approximately 10  reloads of unobligated fuel for TVA, likely to be used in the mid-2030s.  According to an NNSA document, the program is expected to run for a 6- year period from 2019 through 2025. However, the schedule for HEU  downblending under the DBOT action has not yet been finalized.  According to NNSA officials, as of January 2018 the agreement is still  being negotiated, but NNSA officials told us they anticipate that TVA will  manage Nuclear Fuel Services\u2019 down-blending activities in support of the  DBOT program as well as the resulting unobligated LEU and its  associated flags. NNSA\u2019s estimated costs for the DBOT downblending  program are $770 million, according to NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan.  NNSA plans to pay for the DBOT program solely with funds provided  through annual appropriations. NNSA does not currently plan to transfer  any LEU resulting from this downblending program as payment to the  contractor and will instead keep all the LEU for future tritium production.", "The DBOT program has not been initiated, so we could not assess  whether the program\u2019s actual costs and schedule align with the estimates  in NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan. However, NNSA officials said they have  confidence in the projected costs for the DBOT program since the estimates are based on previous downblending programs that NNSA has  conducted over the past decade.", "NNSA identified two risks, and we identified one additional risk, facing the  DBOT program. First, NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan identified the  uncertainty of annual appropriations in the amount of $770 million to  support this program. In addition, NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan identified a  second risk associated with the availability of material for the DBOT  program. The DBOT material will consist largely of scrap oxide left over  from weapons production processes, some to be generated in future  years. Because the schedules for those processes may change, the  amounts of material available for DBOT and the dates when it will be  available are subject to some uncertainty. Furthermore, we identified an  additional risk to the DBOT program that is not addressed in NNSA\u2019s  October 2015 plan. Specifically, NNSA did not indicate which nuclear fuel  cycle company would be used for the book storage of the LEU resulting  from the DBOT program, and there is no guarantee that a company would  be willing to engage in book storage for NNSA. A senior NNSA official  stated that this detail will be worked out once the DBOT contract is  finalized. NNSA and TVA officials noted that other fuel cycle facilities  have previously been uninterested in conducting book storage for NNSA,  so options may be limited. According to NNSA officials, if book storage  was unavailable in the future, NNSA could pay for the physical storage of  the LEU for the DBOT program. Since the costs of physically storing LEU  for the DBOT program are not included in NNSA\u2019s cost estimates, this  could increase the overall costs of the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Preliminary Plan to Analyze Options to Supply Enriched Uranium in the Long Term is Inconsistent with DOE Directives", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s preliminary plan\u2014as outlined in its domestic uranium enrichment  mission need statement\u2014to analyze options for supplying enriched  uranium in the long term is inconsistent with DOE directives.

Specifically, NNSA\u2019s October  2016 mission need statement\u2014developed by NNSA\u2019s Office of Domestic  Uranium Enrichment\u2014identified two mission needs: (1) a need for  enriched uranium for a range of national security and other missions,  including LEU for tritium production, HEU for the U.S. Navy, and high- assay LEU for research needs; and (2) a specific need for tritium.  Because the mission need is not clearly stated, it is not clear whether  NNSA intends to identify a future source of enriched uranium that could  meet a range of mission needs, or only meet the specific mission need for  tritium. According to DOE guidance for the mission need statement, the  mission need statement should be a clear and concise description of the  gap between current capabilities and the mission need. A senior NNSA  official acknowledged that the mission need statement was ambiguously  written because there are a range of mission needs for enriched uranium,  and the ultimate mission need that the analysis of alternatives process  will meet is unclear. Under either interpretation of the intent of the mission  need statement, the document does not fully comply with DOE directives.  According to DOE Order 413.3B, the mission need should be  independent of a particular solution and should not be defined by the  equipment, facility, technological solution, or physical end-item. This  approach allows the Office of Domestic Uranium Enrichment the flexibility  to explore a variety of solutions and not limit potential solutions.", "Under the first interpretation of NNSA\u2019s mission need statement (which  appears to be its preferred interpretation, according to NNSA documents),  NNSA needs a future source of enriched uranium for a range of  missions\u2014initially LEU to produce tritium, but later also to produce high- assay LEU for research needs and HEU for the U.S. Navy. Specifically,  the document states that if the United States decided to reestablish a  domestic uranium enrichment capability, it \u201ccould meet several national  security missions.\u201d Further, it states that \u201cfuture demand for additional  enrichment assays and volumes should be considered in the selection of  the enrichment capacity to meet national security needs.\u201d This suggests  that NNSA may be missing opportunities to consider options for providing  additional enriched uranium that do not entail reestablishing a uranium  enrichment plant.", "For example, while the mission need statement discusses some policy  options that would provide NNSA with a new source of enriched uranium  without building a new enrichment capability, it excludes at least one  policy option that was originally identified in NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan\u2014 reprocessing DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel to recover HEU (which could  also be downblended to produce LEU). Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel  could provide a significant quantity of enriched uranium without the need  for a new enrichment capability. It is not clear why NNSA excluded this  option from the mission need statement at this early point in the  development of alternatives. See appendix II for a discussion of other  options NNSA includes in its mission need statement that could provide  NNSA with a new source of enriched uranium without building a new  enrichment capability.", "Under the second, narrower interpretation of the mission need statement,  NNSA would need to obtain LEU solely to meet its mission need for  tritium. However, contrary to DOE directives that a mission need  statement be independent of a particular solution and not be defined by  equipment, facility, technological solution, or physical end-item, NNSA is  showing preference for a particular end-item\u2014enriched uranium\u2014to  continue the tritium production mission. The mission need statement  indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium  production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional  enriched uranium. This approach would exclude consideration of certain  technology options, such as one that may have the potential to produce  tritium without the need for enriched uranium. Specifically, during our  review, we identified a technology capable of producing tritium that does  not require enriched uranium and is being developed by Global Medical  Isotope Systems (GMIS). This technology was not included in NNSA\u2019s  mission need statement as an option to help NNSA meet its tritium  production requirements. An NNSA office separate from the Office of  Domestic Uranium Enrichment\u2014the Office of Nuclear Materials  Integration\u2014has funded the GMIS technology in a demonstration effort to  determine whether it can produce tritium in sufficient quantities to support  NNSA\u2019s needs.", "The GMIS technology is currently at a low TRL, and the tritium production  estimates have not been independently verified, but a senior NNSA  official and GMIS representatives told us that it produced \u201cappreciable  amounts of tritium\u201d during the demonstration. However, another senior  NNSA official stated that it would be more appropriate to consider the  GMIS technology in a process being conducted by another NNSA office\u2014 the Tritium Sustainment Office\u2014which is currently examining potential  options to meet tritium needs in 2055 and beyond, when TVA\u2019s Watts Bar  reactors may no longer be operating. This official, however, told us that  the program office has no plans to update its last technology evaluation  from 2014, which did not include consideration of the GMIS technology.  If the purpose of NNSA\u2019s mission need statement is to meet tritium  requirements, then NNSA may be missing the opportunity to assess a  technology that could meet the mission need without the need for  enriched uranium. Without revising the scope of the mission need  statement to clarify which mission need it seeks to achieve and adjusting,  as appropriate, the range of preliminary options being considered in the  analysis of alternatives, NNSA may not consider all options that could  satisfy its ultimate mission need."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Identified Two Uranium Enrichment Technologies as Most Feasible for Reestablishing a Uranium Enrichment Capability, but Both Face Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The mission need statement identifies six potential enrichment technology  options for reestablishing an unobligated uranium enrichment capability.  The technology selected could be used first to produce LEU to support  the tritium production mission, and potentially later used to produce high- assay LEU for research needs and HEU for the U.S. Navy, according to  NNSA documents. According to NNSA\u2019s mission need statement, these  six technologies were identified by a team of federal, national laboratory,  and contractor experts in uranium enrichment technologies in December  2014, later presented in the October 2015 plan, and then included in the  mission need statement.", "Among the six technologies, four\u2014restart of the Paducah Gaseous  Diffusion Plant, electromagnetic isotope separation, atomic vapor laser  isotope separation, and separation of isotopes by laser excitation\u2014are  unlikely to be feasible, according to NNSA documents (app. III provides  additional information on these four enrichment technologies). Some of  these technologies have produced enriched uranium in the past, but  extraordinary technical or financial barriers, past research failures, or  peaceful-use restrictions would likely preclude further consideration by  NNSA, according to NNSA documents.", "According to NNSA documents, NNSA has preliminarily identified the two  remaining uranium enrichment technologies as the most feasible options  to supply unobligated LEU for tritium production: the AC100 (\u201clarge\u201d)  centrifuge and a \u201csmall\u201d centrifuge design. However, both of these options  face challenges to deployment.", "Of the identified options, the AC100, or large centrifuge, is the technology  that is furthest along in development. Centrus Energy Corp.\u2014the private  company known as USEC Inc. prior to its bankruptcy in 2014\u2014developed  a large (about 40 feet tall) advanced centrifuge for uranium enrichment.  From June 2012 through September 2015, DOE invested approximately  $397 million to financially support a research, development, and  demonstration program for the large centrifuge technology at Centrus\u2019  demonstration facility\u2014the American Centrifuge Plant\u2014in Ohio (See fig.  4). However, in September 2015, DOE announced that it would not  continue funding the demonstration plant in Ohio past the end of that  month. According to a September 2015 DOE memorandum, the  department had obtained the testing data it needed and determined that  there was \u201cminimal incremental value\u201d in continuing demonstration  operations. Centrus was unable to continue operation of the  demonstration plant without further government support and, in February  2016, announced its intent to demobilize it. Appendix IV provides  additional information on the development of Centrus\u2019 AC100 large  centrifuge technology.", "According to NNSA\u2019s October 2015 report, at the conclusion of DOE\u2019s  support, Centrus had successfully demonstrated that the large centrifuge  technology had achieved a TRL of 7 to 8\u2014or the generally successful demonstration of a test facility. DOE has continued funding, at a lower  level, Centrus\u2019 further development of the large centrifuge technology at a  test facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, through September 2018. The  October 2016 mission need statement estimated that it would take 2 to 5  years to complete development of the technology. According to a senior  DOE official, though DOE has discontinued the majority of its funding, the  department has taken two actions to preserve the large centrifuge  technology\u2014preserving the intellectual property for this technology and  hiring some former Centrus employees\u2014to ensure that the technology  can be deployed if it is selected in the analysis of alternatives.", "However, we identified several challenges that could complicate future  efforts to deploy the large centrifuge technology\u2014challenges related to  the preservation of intellectual property, royalty costs for commercial  deployment, and the weakening of Centrus\u2019 U.S. supplier and knowledge  base.", "Intellectual property. A senior DOE official stated that there were two  issues with DOE\u2019s Office of Nuclear Energy original preservation of the  information. First, preservation of the schematics began before certain  technical issues with the demonstration plant were discovered, and  consequently, Centrus\u2019 proposed resolution of those issues was not  included in the documentation, according to DOE and NNSA officials.  Second, a DOE official and Centrus representatives stated that DOE\u2019s  contract with Centrus did not specify how the schematics were to be  preserved. Rather than preserving the schematics in an electronic  engineering format, Centrus preserved them in a different format that will  require them to be reconstructed in an engineering program, according to  the DOE official. NNSA officials acknowledged there were issues with the  2014 preservation effort and stated that negotiations were under way to  contract with Centrus for a second preservation effort that would include  updated schematics in the correct format and the documentation on the  proposed resolution of the technical issues.", "Royalty costs. Although DOE owns the intellectual property, by  agreement, Centrus is owed royalties if the large centrifuge technology is  deployed for commercial purposes. According to a June 2002 agreement  between DOE and USEC, these royalties would be capped at $665  million. In a January 2017 request for information from industry, NNSA  expressed interest in obtaining enriched uranium through a federal  government-private industry partnership. In January 2017, NNSA officials  said that they were not sure how royalties might affect such a partnership.  It is possible that if a private industry partner was only interested in  producing enriched uranium for the government alongside a commercial  operation, the royalties could discourage such a partnership, or that some  of the costs might be passed on to the government. However, the  royalties may be less than the cost of developing a new enrichment  capability, so such an arrangement may also attract partners interested in  entering the market but not in developing new technology.", "Supplier base. Centrus representatives told us that Centrus assembled  an extensive domestic supplier base during the demonstration program to  show that enrichment services could be unobligated. According to  Centrus representatives and a Centrus document, the company had  sourced components for the demonstration plant from over 900 different  suppliers and manufacturers in 28 states, and that following its closure,  many of these companies would go out of business or lose the capability  to produce the necessary parts. As a result, if the large centrifuge option  is selected, a domestic supplier base will have to be rebuilt, according to  Centrus representatives. NNSA officials acknowledged that\u2014as NNSA  conducts the analysis of alternatives process\u2014Centrus\u2019 supplier and  manufacturing base will continue to diminish.", "Knowledge base. Centrus representatives have raised concerns that the  closure of the American Centrifuge Plant and associated layoffs of  qualified workers may make it difficult to re-hire experienced centrifuge  workers in the future. According to a cost estimate review prepared by a  contractor for NNSA, the American Centrifuge Plant employed 370 full- time equivalent workers during the demonstration program. However, as  of January 2017, it employed approximately 117 staff, according to a  Centrus document. NNSA officials acknowledged that the loss of skilled  workers is a concern and stated that, as a mitigating measure, ORNL has  hired knowledgeable former Centrus personnel for further centrifuge  research projects at ORNL.", "The second most feasible option to supply unobligated LEU for tritium  production is the design for a small centrifuge technology. NNSA is  funding an experiment to develop a centrifuge design that it anticipates  will be smaller (from 6 to 14 feet tall), simpler, and potentially less  expensive to build and maintain than the large centrifuge, according to an  NNSA document. The experiment began at ORNL in 2016 and is based  on prior ORNL experience with centrifuges. According to NNSA and  ORNL documents, the small centrifuge experiment will take 3.5 years to  achieve a TRL of 3 to 4\u2014successful validation at laboratory scale\u2014and  cost approximately $42 million for this validation effort. During our visit to  ORNL in December 2016, laboratory representatives told us that  prototypes had not yet been constructed and showed us their preliminary  design work and initial construction of their facility. As of December 2017,  the first prototype of three or four planned sizes had been built and  tested, according to NNSA officials and ORNL representatives. Following  completion of the experiment, the mission need statement estimates that  it could take another 4 to 7 years to bring the technology to a TRL of 9  (ready to deploy).", "Like the large centrifuge technology, the small centrifuge technology  faces challenges that could complicate its deployment. For example,  according to NNSA officials and ORNL representatives, the small  centrifuge experiment is on an aggressive testing schedule to  demonstrate results and potential scalability to meet NNSA\u2019s planned  2019 deadline to select a preferred alternative in the analysis of  alternatives process. Further, according to NNSA officials and ORNL  representatives, if the small centrifuge design is selected, ORNL would  not build and operate the plant because it is focused on research and  development. Instead, NNSA would have to identify and contract with  another entity to license, transfer, and deploy the technology, according  to NNSA officials and ORNL representatives.

This incremental approach would start  with the selection of an enrichment technology in an enrichment plant  capable of meeting tritium production requirements but could be  expanded to meet the other governmental enriched uranium needs over  time, according to our review of NNSA documents. Best practices for  cost estimating state that programs following such an approach should  clearly define the characteristics of each increment of capability so that a  rigorous life cycle cost estimate can be developed. In addition, we have  recommended that agencies conducting incremental acquisitions  consider establishing each increment of increased capability with its own  cost and schedule baseline. However, the scope of NNSA\u2019s cost  estimates for the large and small centrifuges are limited only to an  enrichment plant capable of meeting the tritium production requirements, according to DOE and NNSA documents. The cost estimates do not  estimate the incremental costs of the additional enrichment capacity  necessary to meet additional enriched uranium needs such as HEU.  NNSA officials stated that the cost estimates were preliminary in nature  and that they anticipate developing more in-depth cost estimates as  NNSA progresses further in the analysis of alternatives process. By  limiting the scope of the cost estimates to one mission need\u2014LEU for  tritium\u2014and not addressing the additional costs to meet other enriched  uranium mission needs, NNSA\u2019s cost estimates may be underestimating  the life cycle costs of the technology options under evaluation\u2014which  could lead the agency to select a less cost-effective technology option.", "We also found that NNSA relied on a Centrus-provided scenario for the  large centrifuge cost estimate that was premised on assumptions that  were no longer valid, rather than using a scenario that more accurately  reflected conditions at the demonstration plant at the time of the analysis.  We found that the large centrifuge cost estimate had not been  substantially updated since fall 2014. According to DOE documents,  NNSA officials, and Centrus representatives, the estimate was originally  prepared by Centrus in the fall of 2014, and NNSA and its contractor  made minimal updates to this estimate in January 2015 and again in fall  2016. However, this meant that NNSA officials used a scenario that  assumed conditions that were no longer accurate as of October 2016, the  date of the mission need statement.", "This scenario, for example, assumed that the demonstration plant would  be left intact for 5 years\u2014in a cold standby state\u2014followed by a restart of  operations. However, in February 2016, Centrus had already publicly  announced that it would begin decontamination and decommissioning the  demonstration plant in spring 2016. An alternate scenario\u2014complete  demobilization of the demonstration plant followed by a restart of  operations after 10 years\u2014may have more closely reflected conditions at  the time. According to a December 2014 estimate provided by Centrus to  DOE and NNSA, this scenario presented the most risk, as it meant that  the site, staff, and supplier base would all have to be reconstituted after a  significant break\u2014which could be very difficult. According to this estimate,  the cost of the alternate scenario would likely be $2.6 billion greater.  NNSA officials stated that they had used the scenario that they thought  best fit the conditions at the time, and Centrus officials agreed that cold  standby was an appropriate scenario to use. However, by using the cold  standby scenario rather than the demobilization scenario, NNSA appears  to have underestimated the costs to build an enrichment facility by  several billion dollars.

DOE Order 413.3B states that cost estimates must be  developed, maintained, and documented in a manner consistent with the  methods and best practices identified in, among other things, our cost  guide. Reliable cost estimates are crucial tools for decision makers,  according to best practices. According to the cost guide best practices,  cost estimates are considered reliable if each of the four characteristics is  substantially or fully met. If any of the characteristics is not met, minimally  met, or partially met, then the estimates cannot be considered to be  reliable.

We shared our assessments with NNSA officials and a  representative from an NNSA contractor and discussed the findings. We  reviewed their comments and any additional information they provided  and incorporated them to finalize our assessments. NNSA officials  explained that the cost estimates are preliminary and are intended only to  be rough-order-of-magnitude estimates since the process is only in the  early stages and will be revised as the analysis of alternatives process  moves forward. NNSA officials stated that they are aware of the  limitations of the preliminary large and small centrifuge cost estimates.

A life cycle cost estimate can support  budgetary decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and  investment decisions. DOE Order 413.3B does not specifically require  a life cycle cost estimate at CD-0. Nonetheless, according to best  practices, having a complete life cycle cost estimate helps ensure that  all costs are fully accounted for and that resources are efficiently  allocated to support the project.", "We found that the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility  partially met the comprehensive characteristic because it included a  high-level description of the work to be performed, and presented a  brief summary description of the schedule, number of machines, and  activities. However, the estimate was not a life cycle cost estimate  because it excluded certain costs, such as retirement and close-out  costs. In addition, other than noting a government oversight fee, the  documentation does not specify whether the estimated costs are  government or contractor costs. The estimate contains a 17 percent  add-on, which an NNSA contractor told us accounts for DOE and  contractor oversight costs, but the estimate does not specify how  those costs are allocated.", "We found that the cost estimate to build a small centrifuge facility also  partially met the comprehensive characteristic. We found that the  estimate included costs for manufacturing, design, testing of the  centrifuges, and 11 years of operations but, similar to the large centrifuge  facility estimate, did not include retirement and close-out costs.", "Well-documented. Best practices state that data are the foundation  of every cost estimate and that the quality of the data affects an  estimate\u2019s overall credibility. Thus, the supporting documentation for  an estimate should capture in writing the source data used, an  assessment of the reliability of the data, and how the data were  normalized to make them consistent with and comparable to other  data used in the estimate. The documentation should describe in  sufficient detail the calculations performed and the estimating  methodology used to derive each project element\u2019s cost such that any  cost analyst could understand what was done and replicate it. Without  good documentation, management may not be convinced that the  estimate is credible; supporting data will not be available for creating a  historical database; questions about the approach or data used to  create the estimate cannot be answered; lessons learned and a  history for tracking why costs changed cannot be recorded; and the  scope of the analysis cannot be thoroughly defined.", "We found that the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility  minimally met this characteristic.

The sources of the data are not  documented, and no information is included about how the data were  normalized to make them comparable to other data used in the  estimate. We found that it would be difficult to recreate this estimate  because no supporting data or electronic cost models were  documented.", "Accurate. According to best practices, a cost estimate should provide  results that are unbiased; that is, the estimate should not be overly  conservative or optimistic. An estimate is accurate when, among other  things, it is based on an assessment of most likely costs, adjusted  properly for inflation, and contains few, if any, mathematical mistakes.  Best practices state that unless an estimate is based on an  assessment of the most likely costs and reflects the degree of  uncertainty given all of the risks considered, management will not be  able to make good decisions. Not adequately addressing risk,  especially risk that is outside the estimator\u2019s control or that were never  conceived to be possible, can result in point estimates that give  decision makers no information about their likelihood of success or  give them meaningless confidence intervals.", "We found the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility  minimally met this characteristic. We could not determine whether the  estimate is unbiased because no risk and uncertainty analysis had  been performed. Portions of the work breakdown structure\u2019s elements  are based on historical costs, but neither the historical data were  provided, nor was there a thorough description of how those historical  costs were adjusted or used. The contractor applied a 2 percent  inflation factor but did not document the source of this factor; a  representative of NNSA\u2019s contractor stated that another DOE office  recommended using that factor. We found no mathematical mistakes  in the overall calculations, but the model was not available to evaluate  the methodologies used.", "For the small centrifuge, we found the cost estimate minimally met  this characteristic. We found that no risk or uncertainty analysis had  been performed. The estimate uses a 2.4 percent inflation factor, but  there is no documentation about the origin of this factor. An  independent cost review performed by DOE\u2019s Office of Project  Management Oversight and Assessments stated that this inflation  factor was overly optimistic and recommended the use of a 4 percent  factor. We did not detect any mathematical errors in the overall  calculations, but the model was not available to evaluate the  methodologies.", "Credible. The credible characteristic reflects the extent to which a  cost estimate can be trusted, according to our cost guide. For  example, to be considered credible, the cost estimate should include  a sensitivity analysis that examines how changes to key assumptions,  parameters, and inputs affect the estimate. This analysis helps ensure  that a range of possible costs are identified, as well as risks and their  effects that may affect those costs. In addition, major cost elements  should be cross-checked by the estimator to validate the results, and  an independent cost estimate should be conducted by an outside  group. The absence of a sensitivity analysis increases the chance that  decisions will be made without a clear understanding of the impacts  on costs, and the estimate will lose credibility.", "The cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility partially meets this  characteristic. NNSA presents several case studies rather than  conducting a sensitivity analysis. These case studies only differ in one  key assumption\u2014schedule\u2014but do not differ in any other major  assumptions. The cost estimate documentation identified some major  cost elements as cost drivers, but no cross-check information had  been documented. DOE performed cross-checks in an independent  cost review.", "The cost estimate to build a small centrifuge facility minimally meets  this characteristic. There is no evidence in the supporting  documentation that a sensitivity analysis was completed. Some  programmatic risks were identified in the documentation.

However, according to Centrus  representatives, Centrus offered to provide updated cost estimates and  supporting data\u2014provided that they were appropriately protected\u2014but  NNSA declined the offer. According to an NNSA official, the agency has  not made a renewed effort to obtain this information because Centrus is  still a publicly-traded company that would like to commercialize the large  centrifuge technology.", "Regarding the small centrifuge, an NNSA official told us that the agency  did not have sufficient data to create a reliable preliminary cost estimate  because the small centrifuge experiment is still in the preliminary design  and development stages. In the absence of such data, ORNL based its  estimate on its decades-long expertise and experience with centrifuges,  as well as on the cost structure of the large centrifuge, according to  NNSA documents. NNSA and DOE officials stated that they expect to  have data by mid-2019 that would support a reliable cost estimate for  inclusion in the analysis of alternatives process, which is expected to  conclude in 2019.

Since 2013, the United States has not had a supplier of  unobligated LEU, which under the current approach is necessary to  power the TVA reactor that produces tritium. NNSA recognizes that its  unobligated LEU inventory is finite and declining and has taken actions to  extend existing supplies of unobligated LEU in the near term. These  actions have effectively bought the agency some time while it initiates an  analysis of alternatives process to develop a long-term solution.", "However, the scope of the mission need statement underpinning the  analysis of alternatives is unclear because it can be interpreted to fulfill  more than one mission, which is inconsistent with DOE directives that  such a statement should be a clear and concise description of the gap  between current capabilities and the mission need. The mission need  statement is also inconsistent with the directives\u2019 requirement that the  mission need should be independent of a particular solution and not be  defined by a technological solution or physical end-item. In addition, the  mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched  uranium to continue the tritium production mission and excludes  consideration of certain technology options, such as one that may have  the potential to produce tritium without the need for enriched uranium.  Without revising the scope of the mission need statement to clarify which  mission need it seeks to achieve and adjusting, as appropriate, the range  of options being considered in the analysis of alternatives, NNSA may not  consider all options that could satisfy its ultimate mission need.", "Further, the preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large  centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in  scope\u2014sized for a capacity to enrich uranium only for tritium  production\u2014and do not reflect the full costs of building a uranium  enrichment facility that could eventually meet a range of enriched uranium  mission needs. By ensuring that the scope of the cost estimates address  additional costs that align with other mission needs that the enrichment  capability may be intended to fulfill, NNSA can select a more effective  option. In addition, we found that the cost estimates produced for this  more limited scope do not fully meet the best practice characteristics of  reliable cost estimates.

According to the cost guide\u2019s best practices, four characteristics make up  reliable cost estimates\u2014they are comprehensive, well-documented,  accurate, and credible. To develop our assessments, we interviewed an  NNSA official and a representative of an NNSA contractor who prepared  the cost estimates about their methodologies and the findings that were  used to support the cost estimates presented in NNSA\u2019s mission need  statement. We analyzed the cost estimating practices used by NNSA  against the four characteristics of reliable cost estimates. We performed a  summary analysis because NNSA\u2019s cost estimates were at the rough- order-of-magnitude level. After conducting our initial analyses, we shared  them with NNSA officials to provide them an opportunity to comment and  identify reasons for observed shortfalls in cost estimating best practices.  We took their comments and any additional information they provided and  incorporated them to finalize our assessment. While rough-order-of- magnitude estimates should never be considered high-quality estimates,  rough-order-of-magnitude estimates can be considered reliable by fully or  substantially meeting industry best practices.

Gaseous  diffusion was the first uranium enrichment technology used for both  national security and commercial enriched uranium needs in the  United States, and involves passing uranium hexafluoride in a  gaseous form through a series of filters that is then cooled into a solid.  The Paducah GDP produced low enriched uranium (LEU) from the  mid-1950s until 2013. It was originally operated by the Department of  Energy (DOE), but leased to the United States Enrichment  Corporation (USEC) beginning in 1993. Gaseous diffusion facilities  used very large amounts of electricity, making them costly to operate.  According to DOE, by May 2012, it became clear that USEC was no  longer in a financial position to continue enrichment activities at the  Paducah GDP, and\u2014through a series of transactions\u2014DOE  transferred enough material to keep it operating long enough to  produce an additional 15-year supply of LEU for future tritium  production. In May 2013, USEC ceased enrichment at the Paducah  GDP citing the high costs of maintaining and operating an aging  plant. In October 2014, the Paducah GDP was returned to DOE, and  DOE is currently deactivating the plant in preparation for  decontamination and decommissioning, while it continues to complete  environmental cleanup that began in the late 1980s.", "In April 2015, when NNSA produced a technical evaluation of uranium  enrichment technology options, restarting the Paducah GDP was still  a hypothetical possibility. At that time, NNSA estimated that the  technology readiness level (TRL) for this option rated 7-8 on the TRL  scale. Restarting the Paducah GDP was advantageous, according to  NNSA, because of the facility\u2019s high production rate. For example,  according to DOE officials, if it had been operated for a relatively brief  period of time after May 2013, a significant stockpile of unobligated  LEU could have been produced to support tritium production for a  number of years. Since 2015, the plant and equipment have  significantly deteriorated, and restart of the Paducah GDP is no longer  a feasible option, according to NNSA documents and Oak Ridge  National Laboratory (ORNL) representatives. Due to degradation of  the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of  replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel,  and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort  would be required to reconstitute the plant, according to NNSA\u2019s 2015  technical evaluation and the 2015 plan. NNSA\u2019s 2015 evaluation  estimated that it would cost $425 million to $797 million to restart the  plant, and between $554 million to $1 billion annually to operate it. In  addition, even if the Paducah GDP were successfully restarted  without major failures, the plant could likely operate at full capacity for  only 1 to 3 years before incurring additional significant costs for  repairs, and obtaining replacement parts for critical process  equipment would be difficult. According to NNSA\u2019s April 2015  evaluation, operating the Paducah GDP beyond 1 to 3 years would  require major investments in the plant\u2019s facilities and infrastructure.", "Electromagnetic Isotope Separation (EMIS). Electromagnetic  isotope separation was used in the United States to enrich uranium  for the Manhattan Project, but was abandoned in favor of the then- less-costly gaseous diffusion technology. Electromagnetic separation  used magnetic and electronic forces to manipulate and separate  charged isotopes. An updated EMIS machine has been developed by  ORNL that was successful at the laboratory scale, and which had a  TRL of 7, according to NNSA documents and ORNL representatives.  However, when scaled to production levels, NNSA estimated that an  enrichment facility using EMIS would require over 60,000 machines  and cost approximately $150 billion to construct. Due to the exorbitant  estimated costs, this option is unlikely to be pursued by NNSA,  according to agency documents.", "Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS). Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory and later, USEC, developed the AVLIS  technology from 1973 through 1999. This technology relies on the  phenomenon that different isotopes of uranium absorb laser light at  different wavelengths. Because lasers can be finely tuned, the ability  to separate the uranium-235 isotope from the uranium-238 isotope is  potentially much greater than with gaseous diffusion or the gas  centrifuge process. However, despite the federal government  spending $1.7 billion on the technology, and USEC investing an  additional $100 million, it was not successful at the pilot scale stage  and USEC ended research and funding in 1999. According to NNSA\u2019s  October 2015 plan, AVLIS\u2019 TRL was estimated to be 5-6. If  development were restarted, AVLIS could reach a TRL of 9\u2014 ready to  deploy\u2014in 5 to 15 years, according to NNSA\u2019s October 2015 plan.  However, this would likely be too late to meet NNSA\u2019s 2038 to 2041  need date for additional unobligated LEU, and there is no estimate for  the cost of such a plant, according to agency documents. According to  NNSA\u2019s 2015 plan, there is no current effort to develop the AVLIS  technology.", "Separation of Isotopes by Laser Excitation (SILEX). Global Laser  Enrichment (GLE)\u2014a joint venture between General Electric, Hitachi,  and Cameco\u2014is developing this uranium enrichment technology that  also uses lasers to separate isotopes. The technology is proprietary  and was developed, in part, by an Australian company. In November  2016, DOE reached an agreement to sell its depleted uranium tails to  GLE for re-enrichment to natural uranium. According to a senior  SILEX official, GLE intends to build an enrichment plant by 2025  adjacent to the site of the former Paducah GDP to re-enrich these  tails. However, we previously found that the SILEX agreement  between the United States and Australia likely prohibits using LEU  produced using GLE\u2019s process for the subsequent production of  tritium, and the executive branch has long interpreted it as such."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Centrus\u2019 Centrifuge Development", "paragraphs": ["The AC100 centrifuge (large centrifuge) design was developed by USEC  Inc. (now Centrus), based off Department of Energy (DOE) centrifuge  research that was terminated in the 1980s. Standing about 40 feet tall,  its size means that it can produce more separative work units (SWU) per  centrifuge than other centrifuge designs\u2014making it the most advanced  centrifuge design in the world, according to Centrus. In contrast to  European and Japanese centrifuge designs, which are relatively small (2  to 4 meters long) and have separative work capacities in the range of 5  SWU per year to 100 SWU per year, the AC100 demonstrated a SWU  production rate greater than 340 per year.", "When it leased a DOE site at Piketon, Ohio, for its American Centrifuge  demonstration plant starting in 2004, USEC originally intended to build a  3.8 million SWU commercial uranium enrichment plant at that site with  enough land nearby to expand the facility to meet total U.S. low enriched  uranium (LEU) demand, including enough to meet national security  needs. The planned facility would have included over 14,400 centrifuges  in a facility covering over 2 million square feet. In 2010, and again in  2012, DOE and USEC signed cooperative agreements to share the cost  of supporting a research, development, and demonstration program for  the large centrifuge technology. DOE provided $280 million, or 80 percent  of the investment in the program, with the remaining $70 million, or 20  percent, provided by USEC. With this support, USEC began operating a  120-machine commercial demonstration cascade in October 2013.", "In the wake of significant adverse uranium market impacts resulting from  the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan in 2011, and in light of difficulties  in securing DOE loan guarantees for deploying a commercial plant,  USEC declared bankruptcy in March 2014 and later emerged as Centrus.  In April 2014, following the conclusion of the cooperative agreement, the  Secretary of Energy stated that DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory  would place Centrus under contract to operate the demonstration plant  and technology with a focus on meeting national security needs. In May  2014, Centrus entered into a contract with UT-Battelle\u2014DOE\u2019s contractor  for Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2014to run a program to preserve and  further advance the technology readiness of the AC100 technology. Also,  since 2002, Centrus has maintained a lease on a smaller test research  facility, K-1600, at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from DOE. According to a  DOE document, centrifuges can be assembled and balanced at K-1600,  and the test facility allows verification of centrifuge operations beyond  what was possible at the demonstration plant. The K-1600 facility is  located near Centrus\u2019 manufacturing hub, the American Centrifuge  Technology & Manufacturing Center, also in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.", "Because the May 2014 contract was set to expire in September 2015,  Centrus and UT-Battelle began negotiating a new contract to support  operations at the demonstration plant, the Technology and Manufacturing  Center, and K-1600 in early 2015. UT-Battelle and Centrus agreed to an  extension of research operations at K-1600 and the Technology and  Manufacturing Center until September 2016 for $35 million annually. In  addition, the Centrus lease of K-1600 was renewed until the end of  calendar year 2017. However, the parties were unable to agree on further  funding for the demonstration plant. On September 11, 2015, DOE  announced that it would not fund the demonstration plant in Piketon,  Ohio, after September 30 of that year. Centrus\u2014unable to operate the  demonstration plant without further government support\u2014announced its  intention to demobilize the plant in February 2016. Decontamination and  decommissioning of the demonstration plant began in April 2016. As part  of this work, Centrus is removing all of the equipment\u2014including the  centrifuges\u2014from the demonstration plant, and will finish disposing of the  machines at a secure government facility in October 2017, according to  Centrus officials. However, according to DOE officials, DOE has  preserved a number of the centrifuges and associated components at the  Technology & Manufacturing Center. Centrus documents anticipate that  the decontamination and decommissioning work will be substantially  complete by the end of 2017. According to NNSA officials, Centrus has  given verbal notice to DOE that it intends to terminate its American  Centrifuge demonstration plant site lease in 2019.", "An August 2015 DOE memo states that technical issues with the existing  centrifuges, peaceful-use restrictions on key components and DOE\u2019s  acquisition timeline meant that there was limited value in continuing to  support the demonstration cascade after 2015. Specifically, during  operation of the demonstration cascade, two technical issues were  identified that made the existing centrifuges undesirable for future use.  Rehabilitation of the centrifuges would have been cost prohibitive,  according to NNSA officials. In addition, key components of the existing  machines were constructed using foreign-sourced materials, which were  subject to peaceful-use restrictions. According to an August 2015 DOE  memo, the second cooperative agreement with Centrus did not require  that Centrus use unobligated materials, and Centrus initially assumed it  would use those machines in a larger commercial plant and not for  national security. Centrus representatives and DOE officials told us that  the company had since identified U.S. suppliers or workarounds for these  components. However, to be used in a national security facility, these  components would need to be remanufactured using those suppliers,  since not all components in the demonstration cascade were unobligated.  Further, under NNSA\u2019s timeline for a domestic uranium enrichment  capability, it could take until 2027 to begin construction of a uranium  enrichment plant. Thus, according to an August 2015 memo, DOE  concluded that it would not be economical to keep the demonstration  cascade operational, and that, after the passage of so much time, parts of  the centrifuges and the balance of the plant would also need to be  replaced during construction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Energy / National Nuclear Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Shelby S.
