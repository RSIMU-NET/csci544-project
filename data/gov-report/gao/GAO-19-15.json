Under the National Work Queue, multiple regional offices can work on a single claim instead of the claim remaining at one office for the duration of processing (see figure). GAO found gaps in guidance about whether a claims processor should fix an error made by another regional office, or return the claim to that office to be corrected. The former could result in missed opportunities to train staff who made the error, while the latter could result in processing delays.", "VBA primarily uses timeliness and accuracy measures to assess its regional offices' performance in processing disability compensation claims, but these measures do not adequately capture performance. The timeliness measure can be skewed because it is a snapshot of how long claims have been pending at an office on the last day of the month, and does not capture performance over a period of time. The accuracy measure is attributed to the office that finishes the claim, even though 88 percent of claims completed in fiscal year 2017 were processed at more than one office. VBA officials acknowledged that these measures are limited and said the agency is exploring alternatives, but VBA has no specific plan or time frame for determining and implementing new measures. Without measures to more accurately assess regional office performance, VBA may be limited in its ability to make efficient and effective decisions.", "Veterans service organizations (VSO) and staff working for Members of Congress (congressional caseworkers) interviewed by GAO were generally satisfied with regional office communication regarding disability compensation claims. However, VBA's policy on whom VSOs should contact during different points in the process did not always align with what occurs at the offices we visited or with VSO needs. This could result in VSOs not receiving consistent and timely responses from VBA. Evaluating this policy could help VBA assist VSOs in better serving veterans. In addition, congressional caseworkers GAO interviewed identified ways that communication could be improved or that additional support could be provided, such as a list of contacts at all regional offices for claim inquiries. VBA officials GAO interviewed described an open-door policy through which they may receive feedback from caseworkers, but the agency does not formally solicit periodic feedback from them. Without such feedback, the agency may miss opportunities to identify and address caseworker communication needs that could help them better serve veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to VBA to clarify guidance for correcting errors, develop and implement measures to better assess timeliness and accuracy at regional offices, and evaluate communication with VSOs and caseworkers.

For  example, as shown in figure 3, in fiscal year 2017, about 88 percent of all  disability compensation claims were processed by more than one office,  and over 75 percent were processed by three or more offices.

While VBA officials stated that they had initially planned to  continue to have a majority of claims processed at veterans\u2019 local regional  offices, after implementation of the National Work Queue they determined  that the system operates more effectively if veteran location is a lower  priority factor for claims distribution. Thus, very few claims are processed  entirely at a veteran\u2019s local regional office, unless the veteran has a  documented hardship that may necessitate expediting the claim or face- to-face interaction.", "VBA officials added that the National Work Queue formula distributes  claims based on VBA priorities.

In particular, we found gaps in guidance for  managing deferrals\u2014actions taken by claims processors in VBA\u2019s  electronic claims management system when they identify claims errors  that occurred earlier in the claims process. The deferral process began  with the National Work Queue since claims were, for the first time,  routinely being processed by multiple regional offices. Through deferrals,  when claims processors identify errors in a claim, they can use the  National Work Queue to return the claim for correction to the office that  made the error.

At all four of the  regional offices we visited, managers and claims processors said that  they generally would not defer a claim if the error could be corrected and  the claim moved forward. At one regional office, managers and claims  processors said that they would log a deferral in the electronic claims  management system, so the error would be tracked and the previous  claims processor could be notified and trained, but that they would also  correct the error themselves to move the claim forward.", "VBA provides some guidance to Rating Veterans Service  Representatives regarding the circumstances in which they should defer  claims, but does not have corresponding guidance for Veterans Service  Representatives. However, according to our analysis of VBA data from  fiscal year 2017, more than 75 percent of deferrals are logged during the  Initial Development, Supplemental Development, Award, or Authorization  phases\u2014when Veterans Service Representatives are typically processing  claims. Existing guidance for Veterans Service Representatives on  deferrals in the National Work Queue Playbook and other documents  focuses on the process for deferring a claim in the electronic claims  management system, rather than on situations that merit a deferral.  Specifically, VBA does not provide guidance on when Veterans Service  Representatives should defer a claim or consider other options, such as  correcting the error and moving the claim forward, with or without a  deferral. VBA officials stated that the policy regarding when to defer  claims is not prescriptive\u2014and they do not plan to provide additional  guidance\u2014because they want to allow regional offices the discretion to  decide what action is best for the veteran. However, federal internal  control standards state that agencies should design control activities to  achieve objectives and respond to risks. For example, a control activity  that is performed routinely and consistently generally is more precise than  one performed sporadically. As such, deferrals may not serve as an  effective control without being used consistently across VBA\u2019s regional  offices.", "VBA\u2019s lack of guidance on when to defer claims may lead to delays for  veterans and missed opportunities to train individuals who make errors. In  some cases, differences in regional office practices for when to defer  claims may lead to situations in which claims that could move forward are  instead sent back to the previous office, causing unnecessary delays for  veterans. In addition, we heard from managers or claims processors at  three offices we visited that claims may not always be deferred for  legitimate reasons and that the ability to defer claims may create  incentives for employees to defer a claim based on an insignificant error if  they want to avoid working on a complex claim. In other cases, more  significant errors may end up being fixed at a regional office without  providing feedback to the office that made the mistake.

In addition, these two areas  ranged from an estimated low of about 13 percent (5 of 40) of all errors  attributed to one regional office to an estimated high of about 55 percent  (16 of 29) of all errors attributed to another regional office. In addition,  while VBA officials said that it is reasonable to hold the office that  completes the claim accountable for errors, officials also said that when  STAR errors are identified, only the regional offices that actually made the errors are told about them in order to improve staff performance. This  suggests that VBA does not view the Veterans Service Representative  who completes the claim as fully responsible for all errors in the claims  process.", "According to VBA officials, the agency has been exploring the  development of a new accuracy measure that would enable it to assign  error scores to the offices that actually made the errors. For example,  VBA is considering using the STAR reviews to produce a claims phase- based score that would attribute the accuracy of individual phases of the  claims process to the offices completing those phases. However,  according to VBA officials, sampling by each phase of the claims process  would be more complicated than the current system of sampling by  regional office and would require additional staff. In addition, the agency  is also exploring leveraging its existing Individual Quality Reviews\u2014 currently used to assess the accuracy of individual staff\u2019s work\u2014to create  individual regional office accuracy scores. VBA officials added, however,  that there are challenges with converting these individual accuracy scores  to office scores, such as calculating scores by claims phase instead of by  employee position since an employee may conduct work in various  phases. VBA has not determined which alternate measure, if any, to use,  and does not have a timeline for addressing the challenges it has  identified with the alternate measures being considered, or for  implementing a new accuracy measure. Until VBA implements a new  measure to assess regional offices\u2019 accuracy, it will not have an accurate  picture of individual regional offices\u2019 performance, which could impair  decision-making, such as targeting resources to high- or low-performing  offices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Were Generally Satisfied with Communication at Selected Regional Offices, but VBA\u2019s Communication Policies Are Applied Inconsistently", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Veterans Service Organizations Were Generally Satisfied with Access to Regional Office Staff, but VBA\u2019s Communication Policy and Practice Are Not Aligned", "paragraphs": ["Despite being generally satisfied with regional office communication,  VSOs we spoke with also expressed some frustrations.

VSOs noted that the National Work Queue  reduced personal relationships and collaboration between VSOs and  regional office staff since claims are no longer fully processed at the  local regional office, and therefore VSOs can no longer simply walk  across the office to discuss a claim.", "Delayed responses. VSOs said there sometimes are delays in  receiving responses from regional offices, with staff taking different  lengths of time to respond to an inquiry, or not responding at all.  Sometimes, once VSOs receive a response, the claim is no longer  being processed at the regional office they contacted, so the response  is no longer useful.", "Decreased notice of activity. VSOs said that with the advent of  electronic claims processing, they no longer receive paper copies of  disability ratings and other documents that VBA sends to the veteran.  VSOs have access to such information in VBA\u2019s electronic claims  management system, but the system does not notify them when VBA  has sent documents to the veteran, such as requests for information  and evidence. VSOs said it is time-consuming for them to proactively  monitor a large number of veterans\u2019 electronic claims files for new  documents.", "VSOs may communicate with a regional office throughout the life of a  claim for various purposes and, according to VBA officials, regional  offices generally have discretion in establishing local policies for handling  VSO questions or inquiries. One exception to this local discretion is  during the 48-hour review period when VSOs can review a completed  disability rating before it is finalized. A November 2016 VBA policy states  that during the 48-hour review period, VSOs may contact a regional  office\u2019s Change Management Agent. The policy also states that VSOs  should not contact the Change Management Agent for claim status  updates, evidence submission, or any other type of inquiry unrelated to a  rating decision discrepancy. According to VBA officials, the policy to  contact the Change Management Agent during the 48-hour review period  was intended to streamline the inquiry process for VSOs, provide  consistent responses to them, and minimize disruptions for claims  processors. The previous policy required VSOs to first contact the Rating  Veterans Service Representative before the Change Management Agent  during the 48-hour review period.", "VSOs at three offices we visited reported contacting the Change  Management Agent for inquiries during the 48-hour review period, but  also reported contacting the Change Management Agent at other points  during the claims process. VSOs at all four offices we visited also  reported contacting other staff, such as claims processors or their  supervisors at their local regional offices, during the 48-hour review  period, unrelated to the Change Management Agent\u2019s availability or a  particular type of claim, which VBA officials stated were reasons for which  VSOs might contact an alternate VBA official. Federal standards for  internal control state that an agency should externally communicate the  necessary quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives, for  example, communicating with external parties using established reporting  lines, and periodically evaluating its communication methods.", "VBA officials told us that the November 2016 policy was intended to  address communication during the 48-hour review period, and that  regional office discretion for communication with VSOs outside of this  period was still in place, including contacting Change Management  Agents if regional offices determined this was best. However, regional  offices and VSOs do not consistently implement this policy. Moreover, the  policy states that VSOs are not to contact Change Management Agents  for claim status updates, evidence submission, or any other question  unrelated to a rating decision discrepancy. These types of inquiries  generally occur outside of the 48-hour review period, so this portion of the  policy conflicts with VBA officials\u2019 description of regional office discretion  for communication with VSOs throughout the life of a claim.", "Although VSO communication with Change Management Agents did not  always appear to match VBA\u2019s policy for communication during or outside  of the 48-hour review period, VSOs we spoke with seemed to value  regional offices\u2019 flexibility in communicating with them. However, it is  possible that the policy\u2019s lack of clarity or inconsistent application could  contribute to communication frustrations for VSOs, and that changes to  either the policy or its enforcement could better serve VSOs and regional  office staff. Evaluating its regional office communication policy with VSOs  and ensuring that the policy is clear, that it aligns with regional offices\u2019  practices, and that it effectively meets VSOs\u2019 communication needs,  could help VBA ensure that it is providing timely and consistent  responses to VSOs on behalf of the veterans they represent, while  minimizing disruptions to regional office staff.

Caseworkers generally contact the VBA  liaison at their local regional office when they inquire about claims\u2014 whether the claims are being processed at the local regional office or  another regional office. Caseworkers may also contact the VBA liaison at  the office where the claim is being processed once they find out from VBA  where that is.

According to VBA guidance on special  controlled correspondence in fiscal year 2017, VBA liaisons are to  respond to caseworkers\u2019 inquiries within 5 business days with a full or  interim response, for example. During its inspections of regional offices  during fiscal year 2017, the Office of Inspector General found that some  offices had not provided interim responses within 5 business days and, in  a few cases, had provided inaccurate responses. At some offices, the  Office of Inspector General made recommendations for improving  regional offices\u2019 responses to inquiries and, according to its reports,  regional offices planned and implemented changes, such as providing  additional training to staff and improving oversight of correspondence.", "Caseworkers we spoke with at three offices we visited identified ways that  regional offices could improve communication with them or ways that  VBA could provide them with additional information or support. For  example, while caseworkers generally contact their local regional office  with inquiries, caseworkers at two offices said that a regularly updated  contact list of VBA liaisons at all VBA regional offices could be helpful so  that they can immediately contact another regional office if they learn that  a claim is being processed there, or if their local VBA liaison is unable to  provide sufficient specifics on a claim. Some of these caseworkers  suggested that the list could either be posted to a non-public website or  sent to VBA regional offices to distribute to local caseworkers. According  to VBA officials, the agency does maintain a list of regional office VBA  liaisons, and updates it quarterly. The list is provided upon request, both  electronically and in hard copy, and caseworkers frequently request the  list, according to VBA officials. However, the caseworkers we spoke with  at all four offices we visited were not aware of this list.", "In September 2017, VBA developed an online toolkit for congressional  caseworkers to better assist them in serving their veteran  constituencies. The toolkit webpage provides a central location for  caseworkers to quickly locate information regarding available VA benefits  and services. For example, the toolkit provides a link to a description of  the disability compensation program and how to apply for benefits. VBA  officials reported that in September 2017, they provided information on  the toolkit to VA\u2019s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs for  distribution to congressional staff. However, caseworkers and VBA  liaisons at all four offices we visited were not aware of this online toolkit,  and caseworkers we spoke with at two offices we visited said that it could  have been useful to them if they had been aware of it or if it had  additional elements, such as regional office expectations for caseworker  inquiries.", "According to VBA officials, they have not received any feedback on the  toolkit beyond that initially provided by another VA office. This could be, in  part, because VBA does not have an outreach mechanism to actively  obtain perspectives from congressional caseworkers on their  communication with regional offices or their information or support needs,  or to determine whether the findings from the Office of Inspector General  are typical across regional offices. The Office of Inspector General  stopped performing its reviews of regional offices\u2014including evaluations  of communication with congressional caseworkers\u2014in fiscal year 2017 to  focus its efforts on VBA-wide audits, so this information is no longer  available to VBA. Federal standards for internal control state that an  agency should externally communicate the necessary quality information  to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives, for example, selecting the appropriate  methods to communicate externally, and periodically evaluating its  methods of communication so that the agency has the appropriate tools  to communicate quality information outside the agency.", "VBA officials reported an open-door policy in which caseworkers can  share concerns and requests as needed, and said that a formal outreach  mechanism is not necessary. Although caseworkers can approach  regional office staff with ideas for improvement, this informal mechanism  is not a consistent process and does not facilitate candid feedback, nor  does it include documentation of potential improvements and actions  taken.

For example, regional  offices\u2019 inconsistent use of deferrals when claims processors identify  errors could unnecessarily delay the decision on a veteran\u2019s claim or  prevent staff from receiving needed training. In addition, VBA has  developed several practices to assess performance at regional offices,  but some of this information could be of limited use if the agency  continues using its existing measures. Specifically, VBA\u2019s two primary  performance measures for regional offices do not allow the agency to  adequately measure claims timeliness and accuracy. Finally,  communication with VSOs and congressional caseworkers could be  improved by clarifying the VSO communication policy and aligning it with  practice and VSO needs, and conducting caseworker outreach in order to  provide more consistent and timely information to VSOs and  caseworkers.
