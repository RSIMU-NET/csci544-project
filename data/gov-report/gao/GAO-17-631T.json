Both types of audits determine  whether the diagnosis codes submitted by Medicare Advantage  organizations are supported by a beneficiary\u2019s medical record  documentation. Contract-level RADV audits seek to identify and  recover improper payments from Medicare Advantage organizations  and thus to deter them from submitting inaccurate beneficiary  diagnoses.

The federal  government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing  IT investments, which often suffered from ineffective management in  areas such as project planning, requirements definition, and program  oversight and governance. In many instances, agencies had not  consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully  acquiring IT.", "In addition to spending money on new IT development, federal agencies  reported spending the majority of their IT funds on operating and  maintaining a large number of legacy (i.e., steady-state) investments. Of  the more than $80 billion reportedly spent on federal IT in fiscal year  2015, 26 federal agencies spent about $61 billion on operations and  maintenance, more than three-quarters of the total amount spent. (See  figure 6).", "Further, federal legacy IT investments are becoming increasingly  obsolete; many use outdated software languages and hardware parts that  are unsupported. Specifically, in May 2016, we reported that many  agencies were using systems which had components that were, in some  cases, at least 50 years old. For example, we determined that DOD was  using 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the  operational functions of the nation\u2019s nuclear forces. In addition, Treasury  was using assembly language code\u2014a computer language initially used  in the 1950s and typically tied to the hardware for which it was developed.  Table 5 provides examples of legacy systems across the federal  government that agencies report are 30 years old or older and use  obsolete software or hardware, and identifies those that do not have  specific plans with time frames to modernize or replace these  investments.", "To address this issue, we recommended that 12 agencies identify and  plan to modernize or replace legacy systems, including establishing time  frames, activities to be performed, and functions to be replaced or  enhanced. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations or had no  comment.", "The spending on legacy systems has also increased over time.  Specifically, between fiscal years 2010 and 2017, operations and  maintenance spending has increased, while the amount invested in  developing new systems has decreased by about $7.3 billion since fiscal  year 2010. (See figure 7.)", "Recognizing the severity of issues related to the government-wide  management of IT, in December 2014, Congress enacted IT acquisition  reform provisions (commonly referred to as the Federal Information  Technology Acquisition Reform Act or FITARA) as part of the Carl Levin  and Howard P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2015. Among other things, the law requires action to: (1)  consolidate federal data centers, (2) enhance transparency and improve  risk management, (3) enhance agency chief information officer (CIO)  authority, (4) review IT investment portfolios, (5) expand training and use  of IT acquisition cadres, (6) purchase software government-wide, and (7)  maximize the benefit of federal strategic sourcing.", "In February 2015, we introduced a new government-wide high-risk area,  Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations. This area  highlights several critical IT initiatives in need of additional executive  branch and congressional oversight, including (1) reviewing troubled  projects; (2) increasing the use of incremental development; (3) providing  transparency relative to the cost, schedule, and risk levels for major IT  investments; (4) reviewing agencies\u2019 operational investments; (5)  consolidating data centers; and (6) streamlining agencies\u2019 portfolios of IT  investments. We noted that agencies have inconsistently implemented  these initiatives and that more work remained to demonstrate progress in  achieving successful IT acquisitions and operations outcomes.", "Further, our February 2015 High-Risk report stressed that, beyond  implementing FITARA, OMB and agencies needed to continue to  implement our prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to  effectively and efficiently invest in IT. Specifically, between fiscal years  2010 and 2015, we made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal  agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations,  including many to improve the implementation of the critical IT initiatives  mentioned earlier and other government-wide, cross-cutting efforts. We  noted that OMB and agencies should demonstrate government-wide  progress in the management of IT investments by, among other things,  implementing at least 80 percent of our recommendations related to  managing IT acquisitions and operations within 4 years.", "In February 2017, we issued an update to our High-Risk Series and  reported that, while progress had been made in improving the  management of IT acquisitions and operations, significant work still  remained to be completed. For example, as of December 2016, OMB  and the agencies had fully implemented 366 (or about 46 percent) of the  803 recommendations. This was a 23 percent increase compared to the  percentage we reported as being fully implemented in 2015. However, in  fiscal year 2016, we made 202 new recommendations, thus further  reinforcing the need for OMB and agencies to address the shortcomings  in IT acquisitions and operations. Our ongoing work has shown that OMB  and agencies\u2019 implementation of these recommendation will likely result  in billions of dollars in cost savings.", "To better ensure that IT investments are made in the most effective  manner possible, OMB has established several initiatives to improve the  acquisition and operations of IT and achieve cost savings. However,  these efforts have been implemented inconsistently and additional OMB  and agency progress is needed to more effectively and efficiently invest in  IT.", "Incremental development. OMB has emphasized the need to deliver  investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk;  deliver capabilities more quickly; increase the likelihood that cost,  schedule, and performance goals will be met; and facilitate the  adoption of emerging technologies. In 2010, it called for agencies\u2019  major investments to deliver functionality every 12 months and, since  2012, every 6 months. Subsequently, FITARA codified a requirement  that agency CIOs certify that IT investments are adequately  implementing incremental development, as defined in the annual  capital planning guidance issued by OMB. However, in August  2016, we reported that approximately 36 percent of active software  projects had not planned to deliver usable functionality every 6  months for fiscal year 2016, as required by OMB guidance.", "We also reported that, although OMB had issued guidance requiring  covered agency CIOs to certify that each major IT investment\u2019s plan  for the current year adequately implements incremental development,  only three of seven agencies selected for in-depth GAO review (the  Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Transportation)  had defined processes and policies intended to ensure that the  department CIO certifies that major IT investments are adequately  implementing incremental development. Accordingly, we  recommended that the remaining four agencies establish a policy and  process for certifying that major IT investments\u2019 adequately use  incremental development. Education and HHS agreed with our  recommendation, while DOD disagreed and stated that its existing  policies address the use of incremental development. However, we  noted that the department\u2019s policies did not comply with OMB\u2019s  guidance and that we continued to believe our recommendation was  appropriate. Treasury did not comment on the recommendation. In  total, we have made 23 recommendations to OMB and agencies to  improve their implementation of incremental development; and as of  May 2017, 17 of our recommendations remained open.", "Federal data center consolidation. Over time, the federal  government\u2019s increasing demand for IT has led to a dramatic rise in  the number of federal data centers (defined as data processing and  storage facilities over 500 square feet with strict availability  requirements) and a corresponding increase in operational costs. To  improve the efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of  federal data center activities, OMB established the Federal Data  Center Consolidation Initiative in February 2010. In a series of reports  over the past 6 years, we determined that, while data center  consolidation could potentially save the federal government billions of  dollars, weaknesses existed in several areas, including agencies\u2019 data  center consolidation plans and OMB\u2019s tracking and reporting on cost  savings.", "As of March 2017, the 24 federal agencies participating in OMB\u2019s data  center consolidation initiative had collectively reported closing 4,679  of the 10,058 total data centers and achieving approximately $2.8  billion in cost savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2012 through  2016. Further, as of December 2016, agencies were planning a total  of approximately $378 million in cost savings between fiscal years  2016 and 2018. However, this is significantly less than the  approximately $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 through 2018 planned  savings that agencies reported to us in November 2015 and OMB\u2019s  $2.7 billion cost savings goal for agencies to achieve by the end of  fiscal year 2018. Of the recommendations that we made to 10  agencies in March 2016 to complete their planned data center cost  savings targets for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, all remain open.  In total, we have made 111 recommendations to OMB and agencies  to improve the federal data center consolidation effort. As of May  2017, 45 of our recommendations remained open.", "IT investment portfolio management. In March 2012, OMB  launched an initiative, referred to as PortfolioStat, to maximize the  return on IT investments across the government\u2019s portfolio.  PortfolioStat is designed to assist agencies in assessing the current  maturity of their IT investment management process, making  decisions on eliminating duplicative investments, and moving to  shared solutions (such as cloud computing) within and across  agencies.", "In November 2013, we reported that agencies had identified  duplicative spending as part of PortfolioStat and that this initiative had  the potential to save at least $5.8 billion through fiscal year 2015;  however, weaknesses existed in agencies\u2019 implementation of the  initiative, such as limitations in the CIOs\u2019 authority. In April 2015, we  reported that, although agencies had achieved approximately $1.1  billion in PortfolioStat savings, inconsistencies in OMB\u2019s and  agencies\u2019 reporting made it difficult to reliably measure progress in  achieving savings. In total, we have made 69 recommendations to  improve OMB and agencies\u2019 implementation of PortfolioStat; and as  of May 2017, only 7 of our recommendations had been implemented.", "Management of software licenses. In May 2014, we reported on  federal agencies\u2019 management of software licenses and determined  that better management was needed to achieve significant savings  government-wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major agencies did not  have comprehensive license policies and only 2 had comprehensive  license inventories. As a result, agencies\u2019 oversight of software  license spending was limited or lacking, thus, potentially leading to  missed savings. The potential savings could be significant considering  that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal agency reported saving  approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license  agreements, even though its oversight process was ad hoc. We  recommended that OMB issue needed guidance to agencies and  made 135 recommendations to the agencies to improve their policies  and practices for managing licenses. As of May 2017, 123 of our  recommendations have not yet been implemented.", "In light of these issues, we convened a forum on September 14, 2016, to  explore challenges and opportunities for CIOs to improve federal IT  acquisitions and operations\u2014with the goal of better informing  policymakers and government leadership. Forum participants, including  13 current and former federal agency CIOs, members of Congress, and  private sector IT executives, identified key actions related to seven topics:  (1) strengthening FITARA, (2) improving CIO authorities, (3) budget  formulation, (4) governance, (5) workforce, (6) operations, and (7)  transition planning. For example, participants noted that challenges with IT operations, such as the use of increasingly obsolete systems, should  be addressed by, among other things, using a strategic approach for  legacy system migration and migrating more services to cloud computing  services.

DOD agreed with our findings, but did not agree with our  recommendation and has not taken action to implement it.
