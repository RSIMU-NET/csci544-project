Policy initiatives include assessing global intellectual property challenges and identifying countries with the most significant problems--an annual interagency process known as the \"Special 301\" review--and negotiating agreements that address intellectual property. In addition, many agencies engage in training and assistance activities, such as providing training for foreign officials. Finally, a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions, such as criminal investigations involving foreign parties and seizures of counterfeit merchandise. Agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts, although the mechanisms' usefulness varies. Formal interagency meetings--part of the U.S. government's annual Special 301 review--allow agencies to discuss intellectual property policy concerns and are seen by government and industry sources as rigorous and effective. In addition, a voluntary interagency training coordination group meets about once a month to discuss and coordinate training activities. However, the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council, established to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement, has struggled to find a clear mission, has undertaken few activities, and is generally viewed as having little impact. U.S. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas, but enforcement in many countries remains weak. The Special 301 review is widely seen as effective, but the impact of actions such as diplomatic efforts and training activities can be hard to measure. U.S. industry has been supportive of U.S. actions. However, future U.S. efforts face significant challenges. For example, competing U.S. policy objectives take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions. Further, other countries' domestic policy objectives can affect their \"political will\" to address U.S. concerns.

USTR identifies these countries with substantial  assistance from industry and U.S. agencies and publishes the results of its  reviews in an annual report. Once a pool of such countries has been  determined, the USTR, in coordination with numerous agencies, is required  to decide which, if any, of these countries should be designated as a Priority Foreign Country (PFC). If a trading partner is identified as a PFC,  USTR must decide within 30 days whether to initiate an investigation of  those acts, policies, and practices that were the basis for identifying the  country as a PFC. Such an investigation can lead to actions such as  negotiating separate intellectual property understandings or agreements  between the United States and the PFC or implementing trade sanctions by  the U.S. government against the PFC if no satisfactory outcome is reached.

Paraguay was designated as a PFC in 1998 owing to high  levels of piracy and counterfeiting resulting from an absence of effective  enforcement, its status as a major point of transshipment for pirated or  counterfeit products to other South American countries, and its inadequate  IPR laws.

They noted that enforcement agencies  such as Justice and DHS participate in the formal Special 301 review and  that officials at embassies or policy agencies consult and make use of the  publicly available DHS seizure data on IPR-violating products. For  example, a USTR official told us that USTR had raised seizures at U.S.  borders in bilateral discussions with the Chinese. Discussions addressed  time-series trends, both on an absolute and percentage basis, for the overall  seizure figures available from DHS. This official noted that the agency will  generally raise seizure figures with a foreign country if that country is a  major violator, has consistently remained near the top of the list of  violators, and/or has increasingly been the source of seized goods. In  addition, a Justice official noted that the department increasingly engages  in policy activities, such as the Special 301 annual review and the  negotiation of free trade agreements, as well as training efforts, to improve  coordination between policy and law enforcement agencies and to  strengthen international IPR enforcement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Faces Challenges to Further Progress", "paragraphs": ["The impact of U.S. activities is challenged by numerous factors.

Beyond internal factors, the  willingness of a foreign country to cooperate in improving its IPR is  affected by that country\u2019s domestic policy objectives and economic  interests, which may complement or conflict with U.S. objectives. In  addition, many economic factors, including low barriers to entering the  counterfeiting and piracy business and large price differences between  legitimate and fake goods as well as problems such as organized crime,  pose challenges to U.S. and foreign governments\u2019 efforts, even in countries  where the political will for protecting intellectual property exists."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Government Faces Internal Constraints", "paragraphs": ["Because intellectual property protection is one among many objectives that  the U.S. government pursues overseas, it is viewed in the context of  broader U.S. foreign policy interests where other objectives may receive a  higher priority at certain times in certain countries.

Officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI  also commented that counterterrorism, not IPR, is currently the key  priority for law enforcement.

U.S. efforts are more likely to be effective in encouraging  government action or achieving impact in a foreign country if support for  intellectual property protection exists there. Groups in a foreign country  whose interests align with that of the United States can bolster U.S. efforts.  For example, combating music piracy in Brazil has gained political  attention and support because Brazil has a viable domestic music industry  and thus has domestic interests that have become victims of widespread  piracy. Further, according to a police official in Rio de Janeiro, efforts to  crack down on street vendors are motivated by the loss of tax revenues  from the informal economy. The unintended effect of these local Brazilian  efforts has been a crackdown on counterfeiting activities because the  informal economy is often involved in selling pirated and counterfeit goods  on the streets. Likewise, the Chinese government has been working with a  U.S. pharmaceutical company on medicines safety training to reduce the  amount of fake medicines produced in China (see fig. 3).", "However, U.S. efforts are less likely to achieve impact if no such domestic  support exists in other nations. Although U.S. options such as removing  trade preference program benefits, considering trade sanctions, or visibly  publicizing weaknesses in foreign IPR protection can provide incentives for  increased protection of IPR, such policies may not be sufficient alone to  counter existing incentives in foreign countries. In addition, officials in  some countries view providing strong intellectual property protection as an  impediment to development. A Commission on Intellectual Property Rights  (established by the British government) report points out that strong IPR  can allow foreign firms selling to developing countries to drive out  domestic competition by obtaining patent protection and to service the  market through imports rather than domestic manufacture, or that strong  intellectual property protection increases the costs of essential medicines  and agricultural inputs, affecting poor people and farmers particularly  negatively. A lack of \u201cpolitical will\u201d to enact IPR protections makes it  difficult for the U.S. government to achieve impact in locations where a  foreign government maintains such positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Factors and Involvement of Organized Crime Pose Additional Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Many economic factors complicate and challenge U.S. and foreign  governments\u2019 efforts, even in countries where the political will for  protecting intellectual property exists. These factors include low barriers  to entering the counterfeiting and piracy business and potentially high  profits for producers. For example, one industry pointed out that it is much  more profitable to buy and resell software than to sell cocaine. In addition,  the low prices of fake products are attractive to consumers. The economic  incentives can be especially acute in countries where people have limited  income. Moreover, technological advances allowing for high-quality  inexpensive and accessible reproduction and distribution in some  industries have exacerbated the problem. Further, many government and  industry officials also believe the chance of getting caught for  counterfeiting and piracy, as well as the penalties even if caught, are too  low. For example, FBI officials pointed out that domestic enforcement of  intellectual property laws has been weak, and consequently the level of  deterrence has been inadequate. These officials said that criminal  prosecutions and serious financial penalties are necessary to deter  intellectual property violations.", "The increasing involvement of organized crime in the production and  distribution of pirated products further complicates enforcement efforts.  Federal and foreign law enforcement officials have linked intellectual  property crime to national and transnational organized criminal operations.", "According to the Secretary General of Interpol, intellectual property crime  is now dominated by criminal organizations, and law enforcement  authorities have identified some direct and some alleged links between  intellectual property crime and paramilitary and terrorist groups. Justice  Department officials noted that they are aware of the allegations linking  intellectual property crime and terrorist funding and that they are actively  exploring all potential avenues of terrorist financing, including through  intellectual property crime. However, to date, U.S. law enforcement has not  found solid evidence that intellectual property has been or is being pirated  in the United States by or for the benefit of terrorists. The involvement of  organized crime increases the sophistication of counterfeiting operations,  as well as the challenges and threats to law enforcement officials  confronting the violations. Moreover, according to officials in Brazil,  organized criminal activity surrounding intellectual property crime is  linked with official corruption, which can pose an additional obstacle to  U.S. and foreign efforts to promote enhanced enforcement.", "Many of these challenges are evident in the optical media industry, which  includes music, movies, software, and games. Even in countries where  interests exist to protect domestic industries, such as the domestic music  industry in Brazil or the domestic movie industry in China, economic and  law enforcement challenges can be difficult to overcome. For example, the  cost of reproduction technology and copying digital media is low, making  piracy an attractive employment opportunity, especially in a country where  formal employment is hard to obtain. According to the Business Software  Alliance, a CD recorder is relatively inexpensive (less than $1,000). The  huge price differentials between pirated CDs and legitimate copies also  create incentives on the consumer side. For example, when we visited a  market in Brazil, we observed that the price for a legitimate DVD was  approximately ten times the price for a pirated DVD. Even if consumers are  willing to pay extra to purchase the legitimate product, they may not do so  if the price differences are too great for similar products. We found that  music companies have experimented with lowering the price of legitimate  CDs in Russia and Ukraine. A music industry representative in Ukraine  told us that this strategy is intended to make legitimate products really  affordable to consumers. However, whether this program is successful in  gaining market share and reducing sales of pirated CDs is unclear. During  our visit to a large Russian marketplace, a vendor encouraged us to  purchase a pirated CD despite the fact that she also had the same CD for  sale under the legitimate reduced-price program. Further, the potentially  high profit makes optical media piracy an attractive venture for organized  criminal groups. Industry and government officials have noted criminal  involvement in optical media piracy and the resulting law enforcement  challenges.", "Recent technological advances have also exacerbated optical media piracy.  The mobility of the equipment makes it easy to transport it to another  location, further complicating enforcement efforts. Industry and  government officials described this phenomenon as the \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d  problem, noting that when progress is made in one country, piracy  operations often simply move to a neighboring location. According to a  Ukraine official, many production facilities moved to Russia after Ukraine  started closing down CD plants. These economic incentives and  technological developments have resulted in particularly high rates of  piracy in the optical media sector. Likewise, the Internet provides a means  to transmit and sell illegal software or music on a global scale. According to  an industry representative, the ability of Internet pirates to hide their  identities or operate from remote jurisdictions often makes it difficult for  IPR holders to find them and hold them accountable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To seek improved protection of U.S. intellectual property in foreign  countries, U.S. agencies make use of a wide array of tools and  opportunities, ranging from routine discussions with foreign government  officials, to trade sanctions, to training and technical assistance, to  presidential-level dialogue.

The effects of U.S. actions are most evident in  strengthened foreign IPR legislation and new international obligations.

We interviewed  officials from agencies participating in the Special 301 subcommittee of the  Trade Policy Staff Committee, the National Intellectual Property Law  Enforcement Coordination Council, the IPR Training Coordination Group,  and the IPR Center. While USTR did provide GAO with a list of agencies  that participated in Special 301 subcommittee meetings during the 2004  review, USTR officials requested that we not cite this information in our  report on the grounds that this information is sensitive.

U.S. officials noted that during  various visits to China in 2003, the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury  and the U.S. Trade Representative, as well as several subcabinet level  officials, urged their Chinese counterparts to develop greater IPR  protection. U.S. officials said that these efforts were part of an overall  strategy to ensure that IPR protection was receiving attention at the highest  levels of China\u2019s government. U.S. officials also noted that the U.S.  Ambassador to China has placed significant emphasis on IPR protection. In  2002 and 2003, the U.S. government held an Ambassador\u2019s Roundtable on  IPR in China that brought together representatives from key U.S. and  Chinese agencies, as well as U.S. and Chinese private sector  representatives. U.S. officials said that China Vice Premier Wu\u2019s  involvement in the 2003 roundtable was an indication that IPR was  receiving attention at high levels of China\u2019s government.

U.S.  government outreach and capacity-building efforts included sponsoring  speakers, seminars, and training on specific technical aspects of IPR  protection to raise the profile and increase technical expertise among  Chinese officials. The U.S. government targeted other programs to address  the lack of criminalization of IPR violations in China. For example, an  interagency U.S. government team (Justice, DHS, and Commerce)  conducted a three-city capacity-building seminar in October 2003 on  criminalization and enforcement. The program was cosponsored by the  Chinese Procuratorate, the Chinese government\u2019s prosecutorial arm. U.S.  government officials noted that the program was unique because the  seminar brought together officials from Chinese criminal enforcement  agencies, including customs officials, criminal investigators, and  prosecutors, as well as officials from administrative enforcement agencies.  In March 2004, the Copyright Office hosted a week-long program for a  delegation of Chinese copyright officials that provided technical assistance  and training on copyright-related issues, including the enforcement of  copyright laws, as well as outreach and relationship-building.", "The U.S. government has also provided outreach regarding IPR protection  to U.S. businesses in China, and Commerce has played a lead role in this  effort.

Rather, we state that USAID and the other U.S. government entities  undertake the primary U.S. government activities to improve the  protection and enforcement of U.S. intellectual property overseas. 2. As we noted in the report, the decentralized structure of USAID,  whereby individual country missions plan and implement training,  makes it difficult for Washington-based officials to contribute timely  information to the public training database or to inform the Training  Coordination Group about USAID\u2019s training efforts. Further, several  members of the Training Coordination Group are frustrated with the  extent of USAID's information sharing. 3. As we note in the report, USAID submits information annually  following the conclusion of its own data-gathering exercise. However,  this data-gathering exercise, which contributes to the USAID trade  capacity building database, does not provide information needed by the  Training Coordination Group, such as dates of training or contact  information, that would improve coordination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Sharla Draemel, Ming Chen, Martin de  Alteriis, Matt Helm, Ernie Jackson, Victoria Lin, and Reid Lowe made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
