In April 2014 GAO produced the first of the mandated reports describing the status of the Marine Corps' efforts to initiate an ACV program. This second mandated report discusses (1) the current ACV acquisition approach and (2) how the ACV acquisition approach compares to acquisition management best practices.", "To conduct this work, GAO reviewed program documentation and other materials for the ACV acquisition, including Acquisition Decision Memorandums, relevant analyses of alternatives, and a briefing on the most recent analysis of alternatives update. GAO also reviewed documentation and budget information for the AAV Survivability Upgrade Program and the Marine Personnel Carrier program. GAO identified acquisition best practices based on its prior body of work in that area and DOD guidance. GAO also interviewed program and agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO reported on the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) acquisition in 2014, the Marine Corps has adopted a new ACV acquisition approach consisting of three concurrent efforts that emphasize the requirement for improved protection from threats such as improvised explosive devices in the near term with improved amphibious capabilities over time. The first of the three efforts, the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) Survivability Upgrade Program, plans to upgrade legacy AAV protection and mobility. The second effort subdivides into two increments, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2. ACV 1.1 is a continuation of a previously suspended Marine Personnel Carrier program that intends to provide enhanced protected land mobility and limited amphibious capability. Testing on the ACV 1.1 will inform the development of the ACV 1.2, with the intent that the ACV 1.2 will demonstrate improved amphibious capability and at a minimum, achieve parity with the legacy AAV. The third effort, referred to as ACV 2.0, focuses on technology exploration to attain high water speed capability. Results of this high water speed research are intended to further inform the development of a replacement for the AAV fleet.", "GAO's analysis of the ACV 1.1 planned acquisition approach has demonstrated the Marine Corps\u2019 use of, and deviation from, best practices; however, ACV 1.1 is still in the initial stages of the acquisition process, limiting our ability to determine how fully this approach will adopt a best practices knowledge-based framework. GAO\u2019s prior work on best practices has found that successful programs take steps to gather knowledge that confirms that their technologies are mature, their designs stable, and their production processes are in control. The knowledge-based acquisition framework involves achieving the right knowledge at the right time, enabling leadership to make informed decisions about when and how best to move into various acquisition phases. Specifically, the Marine Corps' incremental approach for the ACV acquisition is consistent with best practices and can increase the likelihood of success. The adoption of an incremental approach has helped the program progress towards achieving the balance\u2014that is sought in accordance with best practices\u2014between customer needs and resources (e.g., technologies, cost, and schedule). In addition, the ACV acquisition\u2019s pursuit of high water speed capabilities via technology exploration is also aligned with best practices. In previous reports, GAO has found that DOD should separate technology development from product development, and fully develop technologies before introducing them into the design of a system. In contrast, the program plans to hold the ACV 1.1 preliminary design review after Milestone B\u2014the decision point allowing entry into system development\u2014which is a deviation from best practices that can increase technical risk. According to DOD officials, this approach was selected because no contracts will have been awarded prior to Milestone B and the use of non-developmental technology will reduce acquisition risks and result in a high level of knowledge prior to the Milestone B decision. The recent completion of key documents\u2014including an updated analysis of alternatives\u2014will permit a more robust analysis and assessment of the ACV program\u2019s use of additional acquisition best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

As weapons technology and threat  capabilities have evolved over the past four decades, the AAV is viewed  as having capability limitations in the areas of water speed and land  mobility, lethality, protection, and network capability. The AAV is a self- deployed tracked (non-wheeled) vehicle with three variants, each  describing its intended function\u2014Personnel, Command, and Recovery.  The AAV has a water speed of approximately six knots, and needs to be  deployed from within 7.4 nautical miles of the shore. This factor may  represent a significant survivability issue not only for the vehicle\u2019s  occupants, but also for naval amphibious forces that must move closer to  potential threats on shore to support the vehicle. Over time, emerging  threats\u2014such as next generation improvised explosive devices\u2014have  changed the performance requirements for a vehicle that moves from  ship to shore.", "According to DOD, the need to modernize USMC\u2019s capability of  transitioning from ship to shore is essential. In response to the need for  new and better capabilities, the USMC began development of the EFV in  2000. We reported on the EFV program in 2006 and 2010. The EFV was  to travel at higher water speeds\u2014around 20 knots\u2014which would have  allowed transporting ships to launch the EFV further from shore than the  AAVs it was to replace. However, following the expenditure of $3.7 billion  between fiscal years 1995 and 2011 and a 2007 breach of a statutory  cost thresholdcanceled by DOD due to affordability concerns. DOD authorized the  USMC to seek a new solution, emphasizing the need for cost- effectiveness and requiring the establishment of cost targets. The USMC  was granted flexibility in tailoring its acquisition approach to achieve those  goals.   that program was restructured and subsequently, in 2011,  In 2011, the USMC completed initial acquisition documentation providing  the performance requirements of a new replacement amphibious vehicle  called the ACV. The ACV would be self-deploying with a water speed of 8  to 12 knots\u2014permitting deployment beyond visual range of the shore\u2014 and would provide for sustained operations on shore with improved troop  protection. The ACV would not, however, be required to achieve high  water speed. An analysis of alternatives was completed for the ACV in  the summer of 2012. This analysis identified two potential solutions for  the ACV performance requirements. However, USMC leadership then  requested that an affordability analysis be completed to explore the  technical feasibility of integrating high water speed into the development  of the ACV. According to DOD officials, the analysis indicated that  achieving high water speed was technically possible but required  unacceptable tradeoffs as the program attempted to balance vehicle  weight, capabilities, and cost. Meanwhile, the USMC retained a  requirement to provide protected land mobility in response to the threat of  improvised explosive devices\u2014a requirement the AAV could not meet  due to its underbody design. In 2014 we reported that, according to  program officials, the program office was in the process of revising its  ACV acquisition approach based on this affordability analysis.

The ACV 1.1 is not  planning to have a self-deployment capability and as a result, will rely on  the assistance of connectors to move from ship to shore. The vehicle  expects to feature a troop-carrying capacity of 10 infantry, with the  objective of expanding this capacity to 13 infantry.

The analysis found that the vehicle performed well in land-based  scenarios, but as a non-amphibious armored personnel carrier, did not  perform as well in amphibious assault scenarios. In addition, the vehicle\u2019s  reliance on a connector craft to travel from ship to shore would extend the  time necessary to complete force landings and achieve objectives in  amphibious scenarios. Since a connector craft, such as the ship to shore  connector currently being developed by the Navy (see figure 2), would  have to transport these vehicles as well as personnel and other vehicles  and equipment, it would also increase the number of connector loads and  connector crew time. The analysis found that the increased use of  connectors would result in a significant delay relative to self-deploying  alternatives. Finally, the vehicle had less capacity than the other vehicles  assessed in the analysis. The vehicle held nine infantry\u2014similar to ACV  1.1\u2019s threshold capacity of 10\u2014while the other assessed vehicles held 17.  According to the analysis, reduced capacity would require a higher  number of vehicles to transport an infantry battalion. The larger number of  vehicles would then require additional space on transportation vessels,  potentially displacing other cargo and impacting logistical support and  manning, as well as increasing the number of these vehicles required in  the field. However, according to the analysis, the resulting vehicle  dispersion would reduce infantry exposure to improvised explosive  devices and increase the number of vehicles available to support a  counterattack.", "The USMC plans to acquire 204 ACV 1.1s and anticipates achieving  initial operational capability in fiscal year 2020. According to program  officials, the current estimated average procurement unit cost is between  $3.8 million and $7.2 million (fiscal year 2014 dollars). The ACV 1.1 effort  will enter the acquisition process at Milestone B, currently scheduled for  the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. According to DOD officials, the  planned use of existing, non-developmental technologies in ACV 1.1  reduces acquisition risk and facilitated the decision to enter the  acquisition process at Milestone B with the goal of fielding a solution more  quickly. The program office issued a Request for Proposal in the second  quarter of fiscal year 2015 and plans to award contracts to two vendors at  Milestone B and require each vendor to provide 16 prototype vehicles.  DOD officials stated that the large number of prototypes will facilitate and  expedite the testing process, allowing multiple tests to take place  concurrently, and allowing testing to continue in the event of a prototype  breakdown. They indicated that the USMC plans to begin testing the ACV  1.1\u2019s swim capability and other factors in fiscal year 2017.

This determination has not yet  been made. In previous reports, we have found that managing weapon  systems that are being developed in increments as separate acquisition  programs with their own cost and schedule baselines facilitates  management and testing and helps avoid unrealistic cost estimates.

According to DOD, high water speed  remains a critical capability. Technology exploration efforts are pursuing  design options that may enable high water speed capability without  accruing unacceptable trade-offs in other capabilities, cost or schedule.  According to USMC officials, vehicle weight is the key barrier to achieving  high water speed. Current technology exploration efforts include some  technology from the canceled EFV program and focus primarily on  various approaches addressing this weight challenge, including improving  the technology that lifts the vehicle body onto plane and reducing the  vehicle weight.

We have previously reported that  adopting a more evolutionary, incremental strategy that delivers  proven and operationally suitable capabilities when available\u2014but  acknowledges that more time is needed to deliver the full  capabilities\u2014can enable the capture of design and manufacturing  knowledge as well as increase the likelihood of success in providing  timely and affordable capability. The ACV acquisition demonstrates  this evolutionary approach, seeking smaller increases in capability  with improvements planned over time. In contrast, the canceled EFV  program sought significant increases in capability in a single  development process. The adoption of an incremental approach has  helped the program progress towards striking the balance between  customer needs and resources (e.g., technologies, cost and  schedule) that is sought at Knowledge Point 1. The ACV program has  demonstrated a willingness to trade customer needs\u2014such as high  water speed in the near term\u2014and utilize mature technologies in  order to identify an affordable solution that is available in the  necessary time frames.", "The ACV acquisition\u2019s pursuit of high water speed capabilities via  technology exploration is also aligned with best practices. In previous  reports, we have found that DOD should separate technology  development from product development, and fully develop  technologies before introducing them into the design of a system. A science and technology environment is more conducive to the ups  and downs normally associated with the discovery process. This  affords the opportunity to gain significant knowledge before  committing to product development and has helped companies  reduce costs and time from product launch to fielding.", "The ACV 1.1 acquisition is planning to hold its preliminary design  review 90 days after the Milestone B decision. According to program  officials, the program office is seeking a waiver to permit this  approach. Best practices recommend that the preliminary design  review is held prior to Milestone B to increase the knowledge available  to the agency at development start. In 2012, we reported that  beginning product development and setting the acquisition baseline  before completing this review increases technical risks and the  possibility of cost growth by committing to product development with  less technical knowledge than recommended by acquisition best  practices and without ensuring that requirements are defined,  feasible, and achievable within cost and schedule constraints.  According to DOD officials, the review will be held after Milestone B  because no contracts will have been awarded prior to that time. In  addition, they stated that the use of non-developmental technology  will reduce acquisition risks and result in a high level of knowledge  prior to the Milestone B decision. However, it is the program office\u2019s  intent that the engineering and manufacturing development phase be  contracted under a hybrid contract that includes cost-plus-fixed-fee  elements. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts are appropriate when  uncertainties in requirements or contract performance do not permit  the use of fixed-price contract types. These contracts are considered  high risk for the government because of the potential for cost  escalation. The selection of this contract type may denote some  program risk; however, we will not be able to determine the extent of  the risk and its potential impacts to the acquisition process until further  information is available.", "As the acquisition moves forward, we will continue to monitor the ACV  effort by assessing its use of acquisition best practices.", "According to program officials, a number of program documents,  including a final report on the recent ACV 2014 analysis of alternatives  update, were finalized to support a key program meeting that took place  in March 2015.
