ASPR has developed processes to review and approve states' and tribes' requests for personnel reassignment. Should ASPR receive a request for personnel reassignment, it would convene relevant officials from the HHS agencies and offices from which states were requesting reassignment, with the goal of the agencies and offices considering requests and ASPR communicating reassignment decisions within four days. However, ASPR's efforts to communicate these processes to the HHS agencies and offices that administer programs eligible for personnel reassignment have been limited.", "Program officials\u2014personnel responsible for day-to-day administration of programs eligible for reassignment\u2014from two HHS agencies told GAO that they were generally unaware of the reassignment authority, ASPR's processes and time frames for reviewing and approving requests, or the program officials' expected role in approving requests.", "ASPR officials said that the office did not conduct targeted outreach to HHS agencies and offices to inform them of its processes, requirements, or expectations, noting that these entities should be aware of them through other channels, such as during the vetting of guidance on the use of the reassignment authority through HHS. However, officials from one agency said program officials are typically not directly involved in the vetting process.", "Conducting outreach to HHS agencies and offices on ASPR's reassignment requests, review processes, and time frames would be consistent with federal internal control standards for information and communication, and would improve HHS agencies' and offices' awareness of expected roles, thereby preventing potential delays in decision making in the event of a public health emergency.", "ASPR has assigned responsibility for reviewing after-action reports to HHS agencies and offices\u2014an expectation program officials were also unaware of\u2014and does not plan to conduct its own evaluations of the reports. HHS requires states and tribes that use the authority to submit after-action reports containing information on how the reassignment assisted their emergency response. In assigning report review responsibility to HHS agencies and offices, ASPR officials said that the HHS agencies and offices will be better able to identify the effect of the reassignments on their programs and take corrective actions as needed. However, ASPR's approach does not address the need to comprehensively assess the impact of reassignment on emergency response across HHS. Conducting its own evaluations of the after-action reports would be consistent with the federal internal control standard for monitoring, and would allow ASPR to determine whether the reassignment authority provides helpful resources for states' public health emergency response, as well as assess the effect of the authority across all participating HHS agencies and offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS direct ASPR to (1) conduct outreach to HHS agencies and offices to inform them of ASPR's processes, expectations, and requirements for the reassignment authority; and (2) develop a plan to evaluate after-action reports to assess the authority's impact on emergency response and medical surge.

ASPR\u2019s initial communications provided general information only on the  availability of the reassignment authority. In addition to publishing the  availability of the 2013 proposed guidance on the reassignment authority  in the Federal Register, ASPR and CDC jointly developed supplemental  information for HPP and PHEP awardees in 2014 that included  information about the availability of the reassignment authority, the  eligibility of states and tribes to request this authority, and the publication  of the proposed guidance. More recently, ASPR officials noted that they  included information on personnel reassignment during an exercise at a  2015 preparedness summit convened by the National Association of  County and City Health Officials, and presented information about the  reassignment authority during a 2015 homeland security conference.", "ASPR\u2019s initial communication efforts, however, may have not reached a  broad audience of states and tribes, or contained up-to-date information.  For example, public health officials from all states or tribes may not have  attended the 2015 preparedness summit or participated in the exercise. In  addition, while some public health officials may attend homeland security  conferences, these events are typically targeted to homeland security,  law enforcement, and emergency management officials. These officials  may be located in separate departments from public health officials,  depending on how the state is organized, and are unlikely to be the  officials who would be requesting personnel reassignment or submitting  after-action reports. ASPR officials told us that the office also provided  the attendees at the June 2015 homeland security conference with  information contained in the 2013 proposed guidance; however, ASPR  subsequently updated the guidance to include certain changes that were  issued in the 2016 final guidance. For example, the final guidance  contains information about ASPR\u2019s process for coordinating and  reviewing reassignment requests and approvals, anticipated time frames  for doing so, and expectations for HHS agencies to participate in the  approval process. The final guidance also increased the amount of time  states and tribes have to submit after-action reports from 90 to 120 days  after the personnel reassignment period ends, and provides notice that  submitting required after-action reports is tied to the award of program  funds. ASPR officials told us that the availability of the authority was not  dependent on the publication or finalization of the guidance, and that  states and tribes would become familiar with processes and requirements  as a result of using the authority in actual public health emergencies.", "Public health officials from the five states we reviewed were unaware of  ASPR\u2019s planned processes for reviewing reassignment requests and  after-action reports, and most noted that additional direct outreach to  provide information or required request forms would be useful. While  these officials were generally aware of the reassignment authority  provided by PAHPRA, none of them were aware that the reassignment  guidance had been finalized in April 2016 until we shared this information  with them in summer 2016. Officials from three of these five states were  also not aware of the 2013 proposed guidance, which had established  specific requirements for submitting requests and after-action reporting  responsibilities. Officials from three states we reviewed said that they  generally anticipated having enough personnel to respond to public health  emergencies and would likely not need to request further assistance.  However, officials from one of these states, as well as officials from the  two remaining states in our review, told us that they would potentially use  the authority in protracted public health emergencies that were at least  several weeks in duration or catastrophic enough to overwhelm state  resources. For example, officials from one state believed that the  authority would be useful in protracted emergencies even with their  estimation that it would take 10 to 14 days both for the state to prepare  the reassignment request and for HHS to approve it.", "Since the time that we spoke to selected states for this review, ASPR has  developed additional information and documents for the reassignment  authority and plans to increase its communication efforts. For example, in  addition to the September 2016 written procedure to guide HHS\u2019s review  and approval processes, ASPR finalized a personnel reassignment  request template in October 2016 and posted it on the ASPR temporary  reassignment website. ASPR officials told us that the office included the  reassignment authority and guidance as part of a discussion on grants  management at a late October 2016 meeting for state directors of public  health preparedness held by the Association of State and Territorial  Health Officials. ASPR officials also said that they planned to provide  information about the reassignment authority and guidance at the next  annual National Association of County and City Health Officials  preparedness summit scheduled for April 2017, and during regular  meetings that ASPR and CDC hold with HPP and PHEP awardees.", "ASPR provided limited information to the HHS agencies and offices that  administer eligible funding programs about the processes for reviewing  and approving requests, reviewing states\u2019 and tribes\u2019 after-action reports,  or specific details about requirements for reassignment requests or after- action reports. The federal internal control standard for information and  communication states that effective communication with internal parties is  necessary to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives. This standard calls for  management to communicate information down and across reporting  lines to enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving objectives.  ASPR officials told us that HHS agencies and offices should be aware of  the requirements for reviewing and approving states\u2019 and tribes\u2019 requests  because ASPR vetted the proposed guidance throughout the department.  ASPR officials also said that HHS agencies and offices had the  opportunity to review the final guidance, which incorporated public  comments, during the vetting process that occurred from 2014 to 2016. In  August 2016, ASPR finalized language regarding the availability of the  reassignment authority for eligible funding programs and requested that  HHS disseminate this language to HHS agencies and offices for them to  include in their future funding opportunity announcements. In addition,  ASPR officials told us that it vetted its September 2016 written procedure  through HHS. ASPR plans to continue to provide information about the  authority to HPP and PHEP awardees in regular meetings but has no  plans to provide additional information to the HHS agencies and offices  that administer other programs eligible for reassignment.", "HHS program officials who are likely to be asked by ASPR to review and  approve temporary reassignment requests and review after-action reports  may not be aware of their responsibilities for these activities through such  vetting of the guidance, and these officials may not have seen either  version of the guidance or the written procedure. For example, HRSA  officials we interviewed said that program officials are not directly involved  in their agency\u2019s vetting process, which usually occurs at the senior  management level. ASPR officials told us they would contact relevant  HHS grants management staff, including program officials, when they  received a reassignment request. However, the agency has not created a  roster of specific program officials: those grants management and other  staff responsible for day-to-day management of eligible funding programs  who would be charged with approving reassignment requests. Instead,  ASPR officials said the office would coordinate with the other HHS  agencies and offices that may be able to help facilitate the approval  process with their agency\u2019s grants management staff and program  officials. In addition, neither the final guidance nor the written procedure  provides direction on how HHS agencies and offices are to review states\u2019  and tribes\u2019 after-action reports.", "Our interviews with officials from selected CDC and HRSA programs  confirmed that these officials were not aware of the reassignment  authority and the related guidance, ASPR\u2019s expectations regarding rapid  convening of program officials to make decisions on reassignment  requests, or their responsibilities for reviewing after-action reports. While  officials from CDC\u2019s and HRSA\u2019s public health emergency response  offices told us that they were aware of the authority and the guidance,  they acknowledged that they had not discussed any information regarding  the authority with the agencies\u2019 program officials. HRSA\u2019s emergency  coordinator told us that he is generally familiar with the purpose of after- action reports. As such, while HRSA does not have a plan to review the  after-action reports, the agency is aware that it can use these reports to  determine what effect, if any, personnel reassignment had on meeting the  program\u2019s original goals, identify any needed corrective actions, and  execute those actions, according to this official. However, without more  specific outreach on the part of ASPR about decision making for  reassignment requests, reporting requirements, and its process for  reviewing after-action reports, HHS officials that administer the funding  programs may be unaware of their expected roles in reviewing and  approving reassignment requests and reviewing after-action reports,  which may negatively affect states\u2019 and tribes\u2019 public health emergency  response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ASPR Does Not Plan to Evaluate the Impact of the Reassignment Authority on Public Health Emergency Response", "paragraphs": ["ASPR will not be able to fully assess the impact of personnel  reassignment on public health emergency response because it does not  plan to conduct its own evaluations of states\u2019 and tribes\u2019 after-action  reports. Instead, according to ASPR officials, it plans to assign  responsibility for reviewing these reports to the HHS agencies and offices  that administer the programs from which personnel were reassigned,  because ASPR believes that these other HHS agencies and offices are  better able to identify the effect of the reassignment on their funding  programs and take corrective action as needed.", "However, ASPR is the federal office with primary responsibility for  overseeing medical and public health preparedness and response.  Therefore, its assigning of sole responsibility for reviewing after-action  reports to other HHS agencies and offices is contrary to the federal  internal control standard for monitoring, which calls for management to  evaluate the results of monitoring activities to identify internal control  issues and for the oversight body to conduct evaluations across the  organization and take corrective action. Because some of the  information that ASPR requires states and tribes to report\u2014specifically,  those elements related to the effect of personnel reassignment on  emergency response and medical surge capacity\u2014is generally outside  the responsibility of the other HHS agencies and offices, this information  may not be fully or appropriately monitored and assessed across the  department if ASPR does not conduct its own evaluations. Specifically,  without evaluating after-action reports to determine the impact on  emergency response, ASPR will not be able to comprehensively  determine whether the reassignment authority is useful in providing  resources for states and tribes to respond to public health emergencies  and improve medical surge.

We identified two peer-reviewed  articles that provided examples of how HPP or PHEP funds assisted in  public health emergency response. In one article, representatives from  the North Dakota Department of Health reported on how HHS funding  helped it prepare for and respond to river floods in 2009, 2010, and 2011,  including in the areas of medical surge, medical material management,  and volunteer management. For example, to manage medical surge,  North Dakota had previously used HPP and PHEP funding to purchase  kits to convert buses into emergency transport vehicles that allowed for  wheelchair and stretcher transport, which the state used in its response to  the 2011 floods. According to the article, these converted buses were less  costly than ambulances used in previous floods. In addition, North Dakota  had previously implemented a patient tracking database, which required  all hospitals, long-term care facilities, and emergency medical services  responders in the state to agree to use a triage and tagging process. The  database and triage process provided unique identifiers and transport  requirements for each patient, as well as identifying patients requiring  priority placement, such as those patients undergoing dialysis. During the  2011 floods, North Dakota used the database to document patients\u2019  evacuation to alternate health care facilities and then to discharge (or  death). In the area of volunteer management, North Dakota had  previously used HPP funding to contract with licensure boards to provide  regular and automatic uploads of licensure information from licensure  databases, which allowed the state to expand its pool of volunteer health  professionals during the 2011 flood response from those volunteers  previously registered with the state. In addition, in 2011, North Dakota  improved its credentialing process to allow for rapid, provisional  credentialing of \u201cspontaneous\u201d medical volunteers\u2014those volunteers who  showed up to response sites to assist but were not previously registered  in the volunteer database.", "Another article described how HPP funding helped various North Carolina  organizations, such as North Carolina\u2019s Wake County Department of  Emergency Medical Services and hospitals in the Raleigh-Durham area,  prepare for and respond to an explosion at an industrial plant in June  2009. Under the HPP component of surge planning for burn injuries, the  burn surge program developed by North Carolina included providing  education for those clinicians working outside of burn centers, planning  for emergency medical services surge, medical triage, and regional  hospital coordination. As a result of this planning, all 68 individuals injured  during the explosion were evaluated at the three level I trauma centers  and three community hospitals in the Raleigh-Durham area by the end of  the day. According to the article, the state\u2019s planning efforts contributed  to an effective response and positive patient outcomes, including  improvements in response times from prior public health emergencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples from interviews with state public health officials", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all five states in our review provided examples of how HPP  or PHEP funding assisted in public health emergency response.", "According to officials from the Florida Department of Health, after the  June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which  resulted in 50 fatalities, the department activated its emergency  mortuary operations response system, a public-private partnership  that had been previously established by HPP and PHEP funding.  Officials told us that the department received the request for  resources at 8 a.m. on the morning after the shooting and had  mortuary response volunteers onsite 90 minutes later to assist with  autopsies and victim identification.", "After an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, in 2013, the  state was able to assemble dozens of ambulances, set up a field  hospital, and convene clinicians to treat casualties in a matter of hours  through capabilities and systems previously established by HPP and  PHEP funding, according to an official from the Texas Department of  State Health Services.", "In addition, public health officials from the three other states in our  review\u2014California, New York, and Washington\u2014provided information  on how HPP and PHEP funding helped support emergency response.  Specifically, these states were able to use HPP and PHEP funding to  establish systems and purchase resources to coordinate evacuations  of health care facilities during wildfires in California and Washington  and hurricanes Irene and Sandy in New York; access provider  networks to provide timely behavioral health care after the December  2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California; and coordinate  and manage volunteers to assist with victim identification after a  March 2014 landslide decimated a town of 43 people in Washington."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other sources of information", "paragraphs": ["ASPR also collects examples of how HPP funding has enhanced medical  and public health emergency response on its website. For example, HPP  funding has been used to establish communications systems, systems for  tracking and triaging patients, and coalitions of health care facilities to  assist in the response to the May 2015 derailment of an Amtrak train in  Philadelphia; to purchase interoperable communications equipment to  assist in making evacuation decisions during wildfires in Colorado in  2013; and to establish a drive-through seasonal influenza vaccination site  in Virginia in October 2015."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": ["Elizabeth H.

We found that, among other things, HHS had no plans to analyze the impact of any reassignments on emergency response. We recommended it develop such a plan."]}
