Some of this  illness can be linked to produce. For example, beginning in the summer of  2017, a Salmonella outbreak linked to imported papayas sickened more  than 200 people in 23 states and killed 1, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention; in 2011, 147 people fell ill and 33 died  as a result of eating cantaloupes contaminated with Listeria. Other  produce-related outbreaks in recent years have involved cucumbers, hot  peppers, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts, and packaged salads. The Food  and Drug Administration (FDA), an agency within the Department of  Health and Human Services, is responsible for ensuring the safety of  produce, along with many other foods. Overall, FDA is responsible for  ensuring the safety of more than 80 percent of the U.S. food supply.", "Because produce is often consumed raw, without processing to reduce or  eliminate contaminants, preventing contamination is key to ensuring safe  consumption. In January 2011, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act  (FSMA) was signed into law, representing the largest expansion and  overhaul of U.S. food safety law since the 1930s. FSMA, according to  FDA, marked a historic turning point by focusing on preventing rather  than reacting to foodborne illnesses. FSMA does so, in part, by requiring  FDA to promulgate new rules that, combined, provide a framework for  industry to implement preventive measures and for FDA to oversee  implementation. In response to FSMA, FDA developed seven  foundational rules; among them is the rule entitled Standards for the  Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human  Consumption\u2014also known as the produce rule. This rule, which FDA  promulgated in November 2015, established the first enforceable national  standards for on-farm growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of  domestic and imported produce. Among other things, the rule  established standards related to agricultural water quality; the use of soil  amendments, such as raw manure; the presence of domesticated and  wild animals; worker training, health, and hygiene; and sanitation of  equipment, tools, and buildings.", "Some in the produce industry have raised questions and expressed  concerns about the produce rule standards, including questions about the  types of produce covered by the rule. Others have expressed concerns  about the costs necessary to comply with the rule, particularly for smaller  businesses.

In November 2016, we issued  our first report. We found that FDA developed an information  clearinghouse, called the Technical Assistance Network (TAN), to  evaluate and respond to questions and concerns from businesses  regarding implementation of the produce rule and other FSMA rules. In  addition to using the TAN to respond to questions, FDA uses TAN  questions to help inform the development of FSMA policy, guidance, and  training to help businesses understand and comply with the produce rule  and other FSMA rules. FDA officials told us the agency was developing a  survey, along with other metrics, to assess the effectiveness of the TAN.", "This follow-up report examines (1) the steps FDA has taken since GAO\u2019s  2016 review to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the  produce rule; (2) the steps FDA has taken to assess the effectiveness of  its efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the  rule; and (3) the challenges FDA officials reported facing in evaluating  and responding to business concerns regarding the rule.", "To examine the steps FDA has taken since GAO\u2019s 2016 review to  evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the produce rule,  we reviewed information on FSMA and the produce rule on FDA\u2019s  website; attended relevant food safety conferences, including the  Association of Food and Drug Officials conference in Houston, Texas;  interviewed FDA officials involved in implementation of the rule; and  obtained data from FDA on the number of questions submitted to the  TAN. To better understand the types of issues businesses were  communicating to FDA, we also examined the full text of questions and  concerns about the rule that businesses submitted to the TAN. We  classified the questions and concerns into categories based on the type  of question, such as requests for additional information or clarification  regarding the produce rule. We assessed the reliability of the TAN data  by interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our report. In  addition, we interviewed representatives from four organizations assisting  FDA with implementation of the rule and an official from one state  department of agriculture. We also interviewed representatives from two  produce industry associations and a farming organization from the  northeastern United States. We selected groups with large  memberships; those representing both large and small business; those  representing specific produce commodities, such as sprouts; those  involved with educating businesses on produce rule implementation; and  those representing different geographic locations across the United  States. The information we obtained from these interviews is not generalizable to all produce industry associations, businesses, or others  affected by the produce rule, but it provides illustrative examples. To  examine the steps FDA has taken to assess the effectiveness of its  efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns, we interviewed  FDA officials to learn about any ongoing or planned efforts. To examine  the challenges FDA faces in evaluating and responding to business  concerns, we interviewed FDA officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to November  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The produce rule  established standards to help ensure the safe growing and handling of  produce. For example, the rule requires that businesses take steps to  ensure that agricultural water that comes into contact with produce is safe  and of adequate sanitary quality for its intended use. As part of this, the  rule established microbial water criteria to determine the presence of  generic E. coli, which is the most commonly used indicator of fecal  contamination, and referenced a testing method published by the  Environmental Protection Agency to test for the presence of generic E.  coli. The rule also established standards specific to sprouts, which are  especially vulnerable to contamination because of the warm, moist, and  nutrient-rich conditions needed to grow them. In addition to the general  requirements of the produce rule, the rule also includes requirements for  businesses specifically related to preventing contamination of sprouts,  which have been associated with foodborne illness outbreaks.", "The rule applies to businesses that grow, harvest, pack, or hold produce,  including produce that will be imported or offered for import, with some  exemptions based on the produce commodity and the size of a business.  For example, the rule does not apply to produce that is rarely consumed  raw, such as asparagus or black beans, and produce that is to be  consumed on the farm. In addition, the rule does not apply to  businesses that have an average annual monetary value of $25,000 or  less of produce sold during the previous 3-year period.", "FDA\u2019s implementation of the produce rule will occur over several years.  According to the rule, compliance dates are phased in from 2017 through  2022 based on business size and other factors. Compliance dates for  certain agricultural water standards and for sprouts differ from the  compliance dates for other provisions in the rule. For example,  compliance for large businesses under certain agricultural water  standards with covered activities not involving sprouts is due in January  2020; compliance for small businesses under certain agricultural water  standards with covered activities not involving sprouts is due in January  2021; and compliance for very small businesses under certain agricultural  water standards with covered activities not involving sprouts is due in  January 2022. In 2019, FDA intends to start inspecting produce  businesses, other than those growing sprouts. At that time, FDA is to  assess compliance with the produce rule, with the exception of the  agricultural water standards, for all produce other than sprouts.

According to FDA  officials, developing a working relationship with states to implement the  rule is of critical importance because states may have an understanding  of farming practices as a result of their historically close relationship with  farms. To facilitate coordination with states, FDA established the State  Produce Implementation Cooperative Agreement Program. The program  is to provide funds to support a variety of state activities, including  educating and providing technical assistance to produce businesses, to  the 43 participating states. Through the program, FDA obligated  approximately $22 million in 2016 to 42 states and approximately $31  million in 2017 to 43 states to help these states implement the rule.", "In addition, in September 2014, FDA entered into a 5-year cooperative  agreement with the National Association of State Departments of  Agriculture\u2014an organization representing state agriculture departments  in all 50 states and 4 U.S. territories. Under this cooperative agreement,  the association is working with FDA to support implementation of the  produce rule by, among other things, providing technical assistance to  states to help them implement their produce safety programs.

Questions spanned a  variety of topics related to the rule, with the most commonly asked  questions pertaining to the rule\u2019s agricultural water standards. For  example, some businesses submitted questions to clarify whether a  specific water testing method they intended to use was acceptable. Other  commonly asked questions related to the types of produce covered by the  rule and whether a particular business was subject to the produce rule or  a related FSMA rule known as the preventive controls for human food  rule, which mandates new food safety requirements for food facilities,  such as food processing businesses. For example, one business owner  who grows almonds and also processes them submitted a question about  whether the business is subject to the produce rule or the preventive  controls rule. In addition, we found that most submissions (281 questions,  or 88 percent) contained requests for additional information or clarification  from FDA about implementing the produce rule. Examples of questions  about the produce rule that were submitted by businesses are shown in  figure 3.", "According to FDA data, as of June 2017, the agency had responded to  about 84 percent (312) of the 372 questions specifically about the  produce rule submitted by businesses to the TAN since it began  operating.

As of June 2017, FDA had responded to 81 percent  (4,307) of all 5,291 questions submitted to the TAN, with a median  response time of 16 business days. Officials we interviewed said that  FDA\u2019s longer median response time for produce rule questions submitted  by businesses was because the agency needed additional time to  address several unique produce rule questions that were not considered  during the rulemaking process.", "To understand produce businesses\u2019 concerns in detail, FDA officials said  they track questions submitted to the TAN. For example, these officials  said they track the number of questions requesting more information  about implementing the standards in the produce rule. These officials said  that FDA is using these data to inform the development of resources to  help businesses comply with the rule. For example, the officials told us  that they are developing a set of commonly asked TAN questions about  the produce rule that businesses can examine on FDA\u2019s website prior to  submitting their questions to the TAN.

In  addition to serving an educational role, PSA training sessions help  FDA evaluate and respond to business concerns. For example, FDA  officials told us the agency uses questions submitted to the TAN to  inform PSA course content, thereby helping to ensure that the training  sessions address the most commonly asked questions. In addition,  FDA officials and PSA representatives we interviewed said that PSA  trainers are able to respond to questions from industry participants  during the training sessions. These representatives said that they  forward questions that PSA trainers are not able to answer during  training sessions to FDA using the TAN and through regular meetings  with FDA officials.

For example,  FDA officials said that, since we last reported on the produce rule, they  have attended industry conferences and held outreach meetings with  produce industry associations and they learned about specific concerns,  such as businesses\u2019 need for additional training on the produce rule and  for information on how to identify materials that are suitable to properly  sanitize surfaces with which produce comes into contact.", "On-farm Readiness Reviews: According to agency officials, these are  voluntary reviews during which state inspectors and educators,  accompanied by FDA officials, review businesses\u2019 progress toward  meeting the produce rule standards to promote compliance with the rule.  States and FDA piloted the program in 2016 and, according to agency  officials, they plan to roll out the full program in late 2017 or early 2018.  In addition to helping businesses comply with the rule, FDA officials said  these reviews have helped the agency learn about businesses\u2019 questions  and concerns. For example, officials said they learned during these  reviews that some businesses needed additional information regarding  water testing methods under the rule, including information on the number  of water samples to be collected and the locations of testing laboratories.", "Produce Safety Network: Recognizing regional differences in growing  practices, FDA established the Produce Safety Network in 2017 to  address the unique needs of produce businesses in various parts of the  country, according to agency officials.

The network is made up of FDA produce safety experts and  specialized investigators based in different parts of the country who help  evaluate and respond to questions from businesses, state regulators, and  other stakeholders in their regions, according to agency officials. For  example, according to FDA officials, these produce safety experts learned  about business questions regarding FDA\u2019s list of produce the agency  considers rarely consumed raw and not subject to the produce rule. In  response to these concerns, the network developed a fact sheet outlining  FDA\u2019s rationale for developing the list.", "Guidance: According to FDA officials, the agency has been working on  guidance to assist businesses in complying with the produce rule. FDA  officials said guidance allows FDA to respond to questions and concerns  related to the rule. For example, in January 2017, FDA published draft  guidance on sprout-specific requirements under the rule. FDA officials  told us they conducted outreach to sprout businesses before releasing  this guidance to let businesses know why the guidance was issued and  that it was available for public comment. In developing the guidance, FDA  also took into account public comments made during the rulemaking  process, according to FDA officials. An SSA representative we  interviewed confirmed this, saying that the draft guidance was responsive  to comments made by sprout businesses during rulemaking that asked  FDA to include specific examples of how businesses were to comply with  requirements. This representative said the draft guidance contained  relevant examples. In addition, in early September 2017, FDA published  guidance to help small businesses comply with the produce rule. The  guidance provides small businesses with information about who must  comply with the rule, training required, and which businesses are eligible  for qualified exemptions from the rule, among other things.

FDA  also said that it would use the extended compliance period to work with  produce businesses as it considers the best approach to respond to their  concerns about the standards. The extended compliance period will also  allow FDA to provide additional outreach and training.", "FDA officials we interviewed said that their decision to review the water  standards and extend compliance dates was in response to industry  concerns. They also said that they learned about these concerns through  some of the steps they have taken, which we identify in this report. For  example, FDA officials said they heard numerous questions and concerns  from businesses about the water standards during educational farm visits.  Also, as we note above, questions about the water standards were the  most common produce rule-related questions submitted to the TAN.

In addition, according to documentation from an industry meeting  with FDA, some businesses have expressed concerns about costs  associated with the new water testing requirements. Some businesses  have also expressed concerns that the water testing method described in  the standards has not traditionally been used by industry and that finding  laboratories that use this method will be difficult. The standards allow for  the use of alternative testing methods, but some businesses have  expressed concerns that FDA has not specified these alternative testing  methods, thereby leaving businesses uncertain about what methods will  be acceptable to FDA. Along with its announcement of a review of the  water standards, in September 2017, FDA announced a list of eight water  testing methods it determined to be equivalent to the method described in  the standards.

Farms, however, are not required to register. According to FDA officials,  the lack of a registration requirement for farms limits the data the agency  has to inform its implementation of the produce rule. For example, FDA  officials we interviewed said that not having data regarding farms can  make it difficult for FDA to connect businesses with the educational and  technical assistance resources to help them comply with the rule. FDA  officials told us the agency\u2019s State Produce Implementation Cooperative  Agreement Program should help address this challenge. The program,  which provides resources to each participating state to support a variety  of state activities related to implementing and enforcing the produce rule,  includes funding for states to develop and maintain an inventory of  businesses subject to the rule. According to the program\u2019s funding  announcement, inventory data will be used to determine education and  outreach needs related to the produce rule as well as to plan compliance  and enforcement activities. FDA officials told us that states participating in  the program have started to build their inventories of farms. According to  these officials, participating states plan to have their inventories  completed before they begin inspections of produce businesses. For  states not participating in the cooperative agreement program, FDA  officials said the agency is developing farm inventories.", "Providing consistent and region-specific responses to business  questions and concerns: FDA officials told us that it can be a challenge  to ensure that FDA and its state partners provide consistent responses to  businesses\u2019 questions that are also tailored to account for regional  differences in growing conditions. For example, officials said that if a  business in one part of the country receives information from one of  FDA\u2019s state partners, it can be a challenge to ensure that businesses in  other parts of the country also receive the same information, whether  from states or from FDA. At the same time, however, information provided  to businesses may need to be tailored to account for regional differences  in growing conditions. FDA officials told us that, to address this challenge,  FDA\u2019s Produce Safety Network staff are stationed around the United  States and work closely with states participating in FDA\u2019s Cooperative  Agreement Program. According to these officials, this relationship  provides a mechanism for states and FDA to share information about the  produce rule and helps ensure that information provided by states is  consistent with FDA\u2019s interpretation of the rule. In addition, these officials  stated that having network staff in different growing regions allows those  staff members to develop expertise in the growing conditions and  practices in their regions, which in turn enhances their ability to provide  outreach and technical assistance that is specifically tailored to the  unique needs of those regions. For example, according to FDA officials, if  a state in the Cooperative Agreement Program receives a question about  the rule from a business, Produce Safety Network staff work with the  state and FDA subject matter experts to craft a response that the state  can provide to the business and that is tailored to the growing practices  and conditions in the region. This approach helps ensure that FDA and its  state partners speak with one voice about the produce rule and that the  information provided is sensitive to regional differences in the produce  industry, officials said."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to HHS.
