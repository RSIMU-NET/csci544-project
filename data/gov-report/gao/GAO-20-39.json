DOD also delayed and lengthened a planned period for the department to make changes to beneficiary information in TRICARE's eligibility system. According to DOD and its contractors, this delay contributed to problems with enrollment processing backlogs that were not addressed until several months after health care delivery began.", "DOD experienced challenges during the T-2017 transition that resulted from weaknesses with its transition guidance and oversight. Specifically, DOD's guidance does not always specify the amount and types of data outgoing contractors have to share with incoming contractors. This led to contractor disagreements over data transfers, which DOD did not always resolve in a timely manner. Contractors reported that these issues contributed to problems after health care delivery began for the T-2017 contracts, such as with processing referrals. DHA also determined that some of DHA's oversight requirements, such as for specialty care referrals, were not feasible or effective, which limited some testing of contractors' readiness for health care delivery. This occurred in part because DOD's relevant subject matter experts did not review the requirements.", "DOD addressed most of the problems that occurred after health care delivery began by requiring the contractors to develop and implement corrective action plans.

The start of the T-2017 transition was initially planned for  August 2016, with a health care delivery start date of August 2017.

For the PRV,  contractors validated their own readiness for specific requirements  within each area. For example, the contractor had to validate that it  had a complete provider directory online and operational 60 days prior  to the start of health care delivery at a 95 percent accuracy rate. The  number of requirements varied by critical area. For the PRAV, DHA  subsequently assessed and verified contractors\u2019 validation prior to the  start of health care delivery.", "DHA also established financial penalties\u2014referred to as transition  performance guarantees\u2014for five of the seven critical areas.

Because the T-2017 contracts  were awarded prior to the enactment of the NDAA 2017, DHA had to  incorporate TRICARE Select requirements into the ongoing T-2017  transition process, including developing updated guidance for contractors.  As a result of the time needed to plan for and implement a new benefit,  DHA delayed timeframes for the following key transition activities.", "DHA postponed the start of health care delivery by 3 months.", "DHA moved the start of health care delivery from October 1, 2017 to  January 1, 2018 (see fig. 2). According to DHA officials, DHA made  this change to align the start of health care delivery with the  implementation of TRICARE Select to minimize the impact that two,  successive changes could have had on the continuity of care for  beneficiaries. On March 30, 2017\u2014three months into the transition\u2014 DHA sent a letter to the contractors informing them of this decision.", "DHA also directed its incoming contractors to submit modified  transition schedules and risk management plans.", "DHA had to delay the start of a planned enrollment freeze and  lengthen its duration. According to DHA officials, in a typical  transition, DMDC requires 3 to 4 days to make adjustments to  beneficiaries\u2019 records in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting  System, including assigning beneficiaries to incoming contractors and  regions for the T-2017 contracts. During this time, which is referred  to as an enrollment freeze, contractors cannot access this system to  process any enrollments. For the T-2017 transition, DHA and DMDC  officials stated that, given the termination of two benefit options and  the new enrollment requirements for TRICARE Select, DMDC needed  additional time to adjust every beneficiary enrollment record (over 9  million). Therefore, DHA delayed the start of the T-2017 enrollment  freeze from August to December 2017 and increased its duration from  3 to 4 days to 19 days\u2014December 1-19, 2017 (see fig. 2).", "Contractors had less time to process enrollments and make  other system changes. Once an enrollment freeze has ended,  incoming and outgoing contractors have a designated period of time,  referred to as a dual operations period, to process beneficiaries\u2019  enrollments and make other systems changes, such as assigning  Prime beneficiaries to a primary care manager (PCM). Due to the  extended enrollment freeze, contractors had a shorter dual operations  period\u2014less than 2 weeks in December 2017 rather than 6 to 8  weeks beginning in August 2017 (see fig. 2). According to contractors,  the shorter dual operations period for T-2017 transition contributed to  a backlog of enrollment requests and PCM assignments that they  were unable to process prior to the start of health care delivery. To  mitigate the financial effect on beneficiaries, DHA issued point of  service waivers and waived referral requirements for TRICARE Prime  enrollees for both regions and provided an enrollment grace period for  beneficiaries so they did not have to pay higher copayments for  receiving care from non-network providers or care that was not  referred by a PCM.", "DHA\u2019s communications to TRICARE beneficiaries were delayed.  TRICARE Select complicated and delayed DHA\u2019s communications to  beneficiaries about TRICARE program changes, which led to  customer service problems after the start of health care delivery. DHA  engaged in various efforts to inform beneficiaries of the new changes,  such as through website updates, blog posts, and direct mailings.  However, DHA\u2019s \u201cafter action\u201d report acknowledged that on multiple  occasions its communication division posted incorrect information on  its website because of changing policy language. In addition, DHA  planned to send a direct mailing to beneficiaries to inform them of  TRICARE program changes in October 2017. However, DHA and  DMDC officials told us that this date was delayed due to the additional  time needed to prepare for TRICARE Select. As a result, DHA mailed  information to beneficiaries starting in December 2017, and some  beneficiaries did not receive this mailing until after the start of health  care delivery, according to DHA. An organization representing  TRICARE beneficiaries told us that some beneficiaries were unaware  of the various benefit changes that went into effect on January 1,  2018 because of inadequate communication from DHA. Contractors  also told us that the delayed communication to beneficiaries  contributed to the high volume of customer service calls they received  after the start of health care delivery.", "DHA officials told us that they took several steps to minimize the risks  these delays and the implementation of TRICARE Select created,  including the use of various transition oversight meetings to discuss and  track related challenges. For example, the regional transition  management staff participated in a monthly Risk Review Board meeting  to discuss concerns related to the schedule of transition activities, such  as the impact of TRICARE Select on the time needed for performance  testing in critical areas. DHA also discussed transition risks related to  TRICARE Select during weekly meetings with contractors throughout the  transition. Furthermore, in August 2017, DHA hosted an Enrollment  Summit for all stakeholders involved with the transition and  implementation of TRICARE Select, where they discussed the schedule  of transition steps and the coordination needed to implement the  interrelated T-2017 and NDAA 2017 requirements.", "In addition, DHA kept contractors informed about TRICARE Select as  they developed the related policies. Beginning in June 2017, DHA  provided contractors with draft guidance on the new benefit to keep them  informed of potential changes and obtain their feedback. According to  DHA, this also allowed contractors to plan for and begin implementing the  program changes they would be required to make once the policies were  finalized. DHA issued the final TRICARE Select policies to its contractors  in late October 2017, which left contractors with less than 3 months to  implement the finalized changes prior to the start of health care delivery  on January 1, 2018.

Furthermore, according  to contractors, DHA did not always resolve contractors\u2019 guidance-related  disagreements in a timely manner. Contractors said this contributed to  delays in implementing some transition steps and problems after the start  of health care delivery. DHA faced challenges related to the following  data transfer issues:", "Referral and authorization data. The contractors in the West region  disagreed on how many years of historical referral and authorization  data the outgoing contractor would provide the incoming contractor  because this was not specified in the guidance, according to the  contractors and DHA\u2019s contracting officers. While the contractors in  the East region mutually agreed on the years of data to transfer, the  West region contractors did not. As a result, the incoming West region  contractor reached out to DHA for resolution on August 2, 2017 by  letter, and continued to discuss it with DHA officials during weekly  meetings, as documented in meeting minutes we reviewed. However,  DHA did not address the issue until December 12, 2017, at which  point DHA rejected the incoming contractor\u2019s request for additional  historical data because the outgoing contractor would not have  enough time to provide it by the start of health care delivery on  January 1, 2018. The incoming contractor reported that not receiving  the anticipated historical referral information contributed to several  problems related to referrals after the start of health care delivery.  First, it contributed to delays in processing referrals within timeliness  standards. Second, the lack of data made it difficult for contractors  to help MTFs address customer referral inquiries, which negatively  affected the contractor\u2019s relationship with MTFs. Finally, the contractor  had limited ability to resolve beneficiaries\u2019 customer service questions  related to referrals and had to reissue authorizations for some  referrals.", "Claims data. The incoming and outgoing West region contractors  also disagreed on which elements of claims data needed to be  transferred. For example, the incoming contractor requested  information from the claims notes section, which the outgoing  contractor stated contained some proprietary information. According  to the incoming contractor, this section typically contains information  important for claims processing, such as medical necessity reviews\u2014 medical record reviews to determine that health care services are  appropriate for payment. When the outgoing contractor refused to  provide the claims notes, the incoming contractor raised the issue  several times to DHA during weekly meetings and through letters, as  documented in meeting minutes and correspondence we reviewed.  However, DHA determined that the outgoing contractor did not need  to provide the information requested, as the non-proprietary  information was available in other claims data sections. According to  the incoming contractor, without access to more detailed historical  information from the claims notes, there were instances in which they  were unable to adjust payment determinations for certain claims paid  prior to transition, which resulted in provider and beneficiary  dissatisfaction.", "Beneficiary payment information. The incoming contractors faced  challenges obtaining payment information for TRICARE beneficiaries  who paid their health insurance premiums using credit cards or  electronic funds transfers. According to a contracting officer, DHA  initially directed the outgoing contractor to transfer beneficiary  payment data to the incoming contractor. However, the outgoing  contractors told us that they were unable to transfer this data due to  banking laws and proprietary information security standards. DHA  agreed that the outgoing contractors could not legally transfer this  information and resolved the problem by requiring incoming  contractors to reach out directly to beneficiaries to obtain the payment  information. According to incoming contractor officials, this created  additional, unanticipated effort, since they had to contact beneficiaries  for this information directly, which diverted transition resources, such  as enrollment staff, away from ongoing transition activities. In addition,  contractors reported that this put certain TRICARE plan beneficiaries  at risk since those who did not resubmit their payment information  risked disenrollment and gaps in health care coverage. The  contractors and DHA made attempts to notify affected beneficiaries  that they needed to contact the contractor to reestablish their  automated premium payments. However, approximately 224,000  beneficiaries\u2019 credit card or electronic funds transfer enrollments for  premium payments did not continue after January 1, 2018. To give  beneficiaries more time to provide this information, DHA provided a  150-day grace period for premium payments. Still, certain  beneficiaries were disenrolled from TRICARE plans for failure to  establish a recurring form of payment. For example, more than 15,000  beneficiaries were disenrolled in the East region.", "In its \u201cafter action\u201d report, DHA acknowledged that it did not always  provide specific and accurate requirements for data transfers in its  transition guidance and that this should be addressed for the next  transition. However, the report did not address the difficulties related to  resolving contractors\u2019 questions and disagreements on these issues. For  example, DHA officials told us that they followed an informal process for  tracking and handling issues raised by contractors during the transition,  which was explained in the initial transition specifications meeting in  December 2016. However, the outgoing and incoming contractors in the  West region expressed concerns about this process, explaining that it  was difficult to resolve issues, particularly with the amount of time it took  for DHA to provide a response, such as with the referral and authorization  disagreement. Federal standards for internal control note that an agency  should implement control activities through policies, such as by providing  guidance with greater specificity for data transfers. These standards also  indicate that agencies should remediate deficiencies in a timely manner,  such as the prompt resolution of contractors\u2019 guidance-related disputes  so as to not disrupt the transition schedule. Without more specific  guidance and a process that ensures timely dispute resolution, DHA risks  disagreements and delays for future contract transitions, which could  hinder health care delivery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some of DHA\u2019s Requirements for Determining Contractors\u2019 Readiness for Health Care Delivery Were Not Feasible or Effective", "paragraphs": ["DHA experienced challenges executing its new T-2017 transition  oversight methods\u2014PRV/PRAV and performance guarantees\u2014as  planned because of fundamental problems with how some requirements  were written and the implementation of TRICARE Select. As a result,  some of the requirements were not feasible or effective in assessing  contractors\u2019 readiness for health care delivery.  1.  Certain PRV/PRAV requirements were not feasible as originally  written or were not aligned with the corresponding performance  guarantee, according to DHA officials. For example, one of the PRV  requirements in the critical area of medical management focused on  testing the contractors\u2019 web-based systems for exchanging  information electronically with the government and providers, but this  was not always possible as some information continues to be  transferred in hard copy, such as by fax. In addition, the performance  guarantee related to provider network development did not align with  the corresponding PRV/PRAV requirements. A DHA official told us  that aligning the performance guarantee and PRV/PRAV  requirements would have resulted in a higher financial penalty for one  of the contractors.  2.  Contractors noted that some PRV/PRAV requirements were not  complete or effective measures of readiness. For example,  contractors told us that requirements for claims and referrals did not  effectively test the actual volume of administrative tasks that they  would have to process after the start of health care delivery.  According to the West region contractor, one of the referral PRAV  tests required contractors to demonstrate that they could process 300  referrals during DHA\u2019s onsite review, whereas they typically need to  process 9,000 referrals a day after the start of health care delivery.  3.  The original PRV/PRAV requirements did not account for TRICARE  Select, since the contracts were awarded prior to the enactment of the  NDAA 2017. Furthermore, due to the delayed and extended  enrollment freeze that ended on December 19, 2017, DHA  determined that contractors could not demonstrate a fully operational  enrollment system sixty days prior to the start of health care delivery  as originally required. Additionally, the contractors had limited access  to DHA\u2019s information technology systems for testing scenarios that  included TRICARE Select. As a result, contractors had to test the  majority of the critical areas (claims, enrollment, customer service,  and referral management) with information technology systems that  did not include TRICARE Select, which was not a true test of their  readiness.", "To address issues with feasibility and TRICARE Select, DHA modified the  PRV requirements for four of the seven critical areas during transition.  Specifically, DHA modified all of the PRV requirements for enrollment,  referral management, and claims processing as well as one PRV  requirement for medical management. DHA also waived the  corresponding performance guarantees for the three of these critical  areas that had such guarantees (enrollment, referral management, and  claims processing). As a result, the contractors were not subjected to  financial penalties for not meeting the requirements for these critical  areas.", "According to DHA officials, the problems with the PRV/PRAV  requirements experienced during the T-2017 transition occurred in part  because DHA subject matter experts did not review the requirements  prior to the release of the final request for proposal. As a result, officials  said that it was not until after the contracts were awarded that subject  matter experts determined that some of the requirements could not be  performed as written. Nonetheless, DHA officials and contractors agreed  that the PRV/PRAV processes are good conceptual measures, and  should continue to be used for the next transition with improvements to  their feasibility and effectiveness. Having subject matter experts review  contractors\u2019 readiness requirements for feasibility and contract alignment  could help ensure that these requirements are appropriate measures of  contractor readiness. In addition, DHA\u2019s \u201cafter action\u201d report included  feedback and lessons learned from officials and contractors on the  PRV/PRAV requirements, which DHA could incorporate for future  transitions. Federal standards for internal control state that an agency  should internally communicate quality information to enable personnel to  perform key roles in achieving objectives.

One exception where DHA did not issue formal corrective  action requests was for problems both contractors experienced with  processing enrollment backlogs after the start of health care delivery due  to the extended TRICARE Select enrollment freeze during transition.", "Although most of the problems have been resolved, some problems have  persisted into the second year of health care delivery, which DHA and  contractors reported they are continuing to address.", "Provider directory accuracy. Both contractors have continued to fall  short of the requirement for 95 percent accuracy of their online  provider directories\u2014problems they also experienced during the  transition. As of June 2019, the West region contractor\u2019s directory  was 76 percent accurate and the East region\u2019s was 64 percent  accurate, according to DHA officials. Both contractors expressed  concern about the methodology used to assess their performance  against this requirement and stated that the 95 percent standard is too  high. DHA officials acknowledged that the 95 percent standard is high  and that the provider directory corrective action requests may remain  open indefinitely because of the high standard, though they continue  to monitor the corrective action requests.", "Claims processing timeliness and accuracy. The East region  contractor has struggled to meet timeliness and accuracy standards  for processing claims. The contract requires contractors to process 98  percent of claims within 30 calendar days of receipt and 100 percent  of claims within 90 days with a 98 percent accuracy rate. As of June  2019, the contractor was meeting the 30 day timeliness requirement  and was close to meeting the 90 day timeliness requirement (99.99  percent within 90 days). However, the contractor continued to miss  the performance standard for claims processing accuracy, according  to DHA officials. DHA officials told us that the department had  completed multiple on-site reviews and continues to monitor this issue  to ensure the contractor improves its ability to meet claims processing  standards. Contractor officials acknowledged that they needed to  improve their oversight of claims functions and improve training and  job aids with their claims processing subcontractor, which was a new  partner for their T-2017 contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A smooth transition of health care delivery between outgoing and  incoming managed care support contractors helps ensure continuity of  care for TRICARE beneficiaries.
