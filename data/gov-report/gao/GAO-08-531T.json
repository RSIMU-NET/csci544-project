At the program's start, the Coast Guard chose to use a system integrator, Integrated Coast Guard Systems, to design, build, deploy, and support Deepwater in a system-of-systems approach. In a series of reports, we have noted the risks inherent in this approach. With the Deepwater program under way, the Coast Guard's priorities and focus shifted after September 11 toward homeland security missions, such as protecting the nation's ports and waterways. The 2002 Maritime Transportation Security Act and the 2006 SAFE Port Act required a wide range of security improvements. GAO is monitoring the acquisition of Deepwater and the Coast Guard's ability to carry out its numerous missions. This testimony addresses: (1) changes the Coast Guard is making as it assumes a larger role in managing the Deepwater Program and (2) challenges the Coast Guard is facing in carrying out its various missions. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed key documents, such as Deepwater acquisition program baselines, human capital plans, and Coast Guard budget and performance documents. For information on which GAO has not previously reported, GAO obtained Coast Guard views. The Coast Guard generally concurred with the information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["With a recognition that too much control had been ceded to the system integrator under the Deepwater Program, the Coast Guard began this past year to shift the way it is managing the acquisition. Significant changes pertain to: (1) increasing government management of the program as part of the Coast Guard's reorganized Acquisition Directorate; (2) acquiring Deepwater assets individually as opposed to through a system-of-systems approach; (3) improving information to analyze and evaluate progress; and (4) developing an acquisition workforce with the requisite contracting and program management skills. Many of these initiatives are just getting under way and, while they are positive steps, the extent of their impact remains to be seen. The Coast Guard will likely continue to face challenges balancing its various missions within its resources for both the short and long term. For several years, we have noted that the Coast Guard has had difficulties fully funding and executing both homeland security missions and its non-homeland security missions. GAO's recent and ongoing work has shown that the Coast Guard's requirements continue to increase in such homeland security areas as providing vessel escorts, conducting security patrols of critical infrastructure, and completing inspections of maritime facilities here and abroad. In several cases, the Coast Guard has not been able to keep up with these security demands, in that it is not meeting its own requirements for vessel escorts and other security activities at some ports. In addition, there are indications that the Coast Guard's requirements are also increasing for selected non-homeland security missions. Since 2001, we have reviewed the Deepwater Program and have informed Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Coast Guard of the risks and uncertainties inherent with such a large acquisition. In March 2004, we made a series of recommendations to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has taken actions on many of them. Three recommendations remain open, as the actions have not yet been sufficient to allow us to close them. In past work on Coast Guard missions, GAO made recommendations related to strategic plans, human capital, performance measures, and program operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard\u2019s management  and oversight of its Deepwater Program and its ability to carry out its  numerous homeland security missions. The Deepwater Program, ongoing  since the late 1990s, is intended to replace or modernize 15 major classes  of Coast Guard assets\u20145 each of vessels and aircraft, and 5 other projects,  including communications systems. The Coast Guard plans to use its  Deepwater assets to help meet non-homeland security missions, such as  environmental protection, as well as new homeland security missions in  the wake of September 11. After September 11, the Coast Guard\u2019s  priorities and focus had to shift suddenly toward protecting the nation\u2019s  vast network of ports and waterways. Coast Guard cutters, aircraft, boats,  and personnel normally used for non-homeland security missions were  shifted to homeland security missions, which previously consumed only a  small portion of the agency\u2019s operating budget. We will be issuing reports  later this month related to the Coast Guard\u2019s homeland security missions,  including its inspection of domestic maritime facilities, foreign ports, and  foreign vessels, and we plan to provide a more complete analysis of the  Deepwater issues raised in this statement in a report later this year.", "Specifically, our focus today will be on    Coast Guard initiatives to improve its acquisition process, oversight  structure, program management information, and acquisition  workforce as it assumes a larger role in managing the Deepwater  Program; and    Coast Guard challenges in carrying out the various homeland security  missions for which it is now responsible in the post-September 11  environment, such as conducting security patrols of critical  infrastructure and providing vessel escorts.", "Our statement is based in part on ongoing work for this committee on the  Deepwater Program and recent work on the Coast Guard\u2019s homeland  security missions. To conduct our work on the Deepwater issues, we  reviewed key Coast Guard documentation such as the Major Systems  Acquisition Manual, acquisition program baselines, and human capital  plans. We also interviewed Coast Guard acquisition officials, contracting  officers, and other key staff. This work was conducted between October  2007 and March 2008. We also relied on our past work regarding the  Deepwater Program. Appendix II lists selected reports related to  Deepwater. Our work on the Coast Guard\u2019s homeland security missions is  based on a series of reviews we have conducted in the aftermath of  September 11. This work involved discussions with Coast Guard and other  federal officials at both headquarters and field units in domestic and  international locations, reviews of related program documents, analysis of  program data bases (including reliability assessments), and discussions  with other domestic and international stakeholders in the maritime  industry. All work for this statement was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. For issues where our observations are based on work  that has not been previously reported, we obtained Coast Guard views on  our findings and incorporated technical comments where appropriate.

The Coast Guard\u2019s  responsibilities fall into two general categories\u2014those related to  homeland security missions, such as port security, vessel escorts, security  inspections, and defense readiness; and those related to non-homeland  security missions, such as search and rescue, environmental protection  (including oil spill response), marine safety, and polar ice operations.", "To carry out these responsibilities, the Coast Guard operates a number of  vessels and aircraft and, through its Deepwater Program, is currently  modernizing or replacing those assets. At the start of Deepwater, the Coast  Guard chose to use a system-of-systems acquisition strategy that would  replace its assets with a single, integrated package of aircraft, vessels, and  communications systems through Integrated Coast Guard Systems  (ICGS), a system integrator that was responsible for designing,  constructing, deploying, supporting and integrating the assets to meet  Coast Guard requirements. The decision to use a system integrator was  driven in part because of the Coast Guard\u2019s lack of expertise in managing  and executing an acquisition of this magnitude. In a series of reports since  2001, we have noted the risks inherent in the systems integrator approach  and have made a number of recommendations intended to improve the  Coast Guard\u2019s management and oversight. In particular, we raised  concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to keep costs under control in future  program years by ensuring adequate competition for Deepwater assets and  pointed to the need for better oversight and management of the system  integrator. We, as well as the DHS Inspector General and others, have also  noted problems in specific acquisition efforts, notably the National  Security Cutter and the 110-Foot Patrol Boat Modernization, which the  Coast Guard Commandant permanently halted in November 2006 because  of operational and safety concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Is Taking Steps To Increase Management Of The Deepwater Program", "paragraphs": ["Over the past year, the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater Program has been in the  midst of a major shift, from heavy reliance on a system integrator to  greater government control and a greater government role in decision- making. Coast Guard officials acknowledged that the initial approach gave  too much control to the contractor. The Coast Guard has made a number  of significant program decisions and taken actions, including:    an increase in the Coast Guard\u2019s management role through a  reorganization of its acquisition directorate;    a restructured approach to the review and approval of individual    planned improvements to the use and quality of information on  program performance, and  initiatives to develop a workforce with the requisite acquisition and  program management skills.", "Although many of the changes the Coast Guard has undertaken are  positive and may assist the program in meeting its goals, these initiatives  are in their preliminary stages, with many processes and procedures yet to  be implemented. Maintaining momentum will be important in improving  the Deepwater Program; we will continue to evaluate the Coast Guard\u2019s  progress in all of these areas as part of our ongoing work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Increased Its Program Management Role of Deepwater under a Reorganized Acquisition Directorate", "paragraphs": ["As of July 2007, the Coast Guard began consolidating acquisition  responsibilities into a single Acquisition Directorate, known as CG-9, and  is making efforts to standardize operations within this directorate.  Previously, Deepwater acquisitions were managed separately from other  Coast Guard acquisitions by the Deepwater Program Executive Office. The  Coast Guard\u2019s goal for the reorganization is that it will provide greater  consistency in the Coast Guard\u2019s oversight and acquisition approach by  concentrating acquisition activities under a single official and allowing  greater leveraging of knowledge and resources across programs. Figure 1  depicts the changes.", "As part of asserting a larger management role in Deepwater, the Coast  Guard has taken additional steps, such as the following.", "Integrated product teams\u2014a key program management tool\u2014are in the  process of being restructured and re-chartered. In the past, the teams  were led and managed by the contractor, while government team  members acted as \u201ccustomer\u201d representatives. Now, the teams are led  by Coast Guard personnel. The teams are responsible for discussing  options for problem solving relating to cost, schedule, and performance  objectives. For example, one team oversees management of the  National Security Cutter project.", "The Coast Guard has formally established a technical authority for  engineering to oversee issues related to Deepwater; Coast Guard  officials told us a similar authority for C4ISR is pending. The role of the  technical authority in program acquisition is to review, approve, and  monitor technical standards and ensure that assets meet these  standards, among other duties. Previously the contractor had some  decision making power and the Coast Guard held an advisory role. In  some cases this led to bad outcomes. For example, Coast Guard  officials told us their engineering experts had raised concerns during  the National Security Cutter\u2019s design phase about its ability to meet  service life requirements and recommended design changes, but they  were ignored. If the recommendations had been heeded, changes to the  ship\u2019s design could have been made earlier and some additional costs  may have been avoided.", "Coast Guard project managers, who manage individual Deepwater  assets, now have increased responsibility and accountability for  acquisition outcomes. Previously, the project managers\u2019 role was less  significant. For example, the contractor, not the project manager,  provided Coast Guard management with quarterly updates on the  status of assets. Now, project manager charters for individual assets  outline project managers\u2019 responsibilities and authorities, including  ensuring projects are on time and within budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard has Restructured Review Process for Deepwater Assets", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is moving away from the ICGS contract and the systems-  of-systems model to a more traditional acquisition strategy, where the  Coast Guard will manage the acquisition of each asset separately. Agency  officials told us that they are in the process of re-evaluating their long term  relationship with ICGS, including an assessment of the value of continuing  this contractual relationship. The government is under no further  obligation to acquire services under this contract, as the minimum  specified quantity of services was met during the 5-year base term.  However, Coast Guard officials told us they may continue to issue task  orders under the contract for specific efforts, such as logistics, or for  assets that are already well under way. The Coast Guard recently  demonstrated this new approach by holding its own competition for the  Fast Response Cutter-B (FRC-B), in lieu of obtaining the asset through the  ICGS contract. The Coast Guard issued a request for proposals in June  2007 for the design, construction, and delivery of a modified commercially  available patrol boat. Coast Guard officials told us they are currently  evaluating proposals and expect to award the contract by the third quarter  of fiscal year 2008, with the lead cutter expected for delivery in 2010. The  Coast Guard plans to hold other competitions outside of the ICGS contract  for additional assets in the future, including the Offshore Patrol Cutter.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s transition to an asset-by-asset acquisition strategy is  enabling increased government visibility and control over its acquisitions.  Cost and schedule information are now captured at the individual asset  level rather than at the overall, system-of-systems program level. For  example, while cost and schedule breaches in the past were to be reported  at the Deepwater system-of-systems level only, the Coast Guard is now  reporting breaches by asset, as occurred recently with the cost increase on  the C-130J long range surveillance aircraft and the first National Security  Cutter.", "In implementing this new acquisition approach, the Coast Guard also plans  to start following the processes set forth in its Major Systems Acquisition  Manual (MSAM), which include acquisition milestones, documentation  requirements, and cost estimates for individual assets. Previously, the  Coast Guard was authorized to deviate from the MSAM requirements for  the Deepwater Program. Reviews were required on a schedule-driven  basis\u2014planned quarterly or annually\u2014as opposed to the more disciplined,  event-driven process outlined in the MSAM. In addition, the Coast Guard  scheduled key decision points only occasionally and focused primarily at  the Deepwater Program as a whole, as opposed to at an individual asset  level. Coast Guard officials told us that little, if any, documentation of key  decisions was maintained. The MSAM process requires reports on specific  elements of program knowledge at milestones in the acquisition process,  supplemented by annual briefings. For example, reports on the maturity of  technology and estimates of an asset\u2019s life cycle cost are required at  Milestone 2, before an asset enters the capability development and  demonstration phase. Figure 2 depicts the key phases and milestones of  the MSAM process.", "Although the Coast Guard\u2019s decision to follow a more formalized and  asset-driven acquisition process is a positive step, the Coast Guard faces  challenges in implementing the process. The transition to the MSAM  process is estimated to take at least 2 years to complete, as the Coast  Guard is determining where Deepwater assets are in the process and is  having to create basic documentation that was not required under the  prior process\u2014such as statements of requirements and technology  assessments\u2014to bring assets into compliance. For example, the National  Security Cutter is in the production phase, but the Coast Guard is  reviewing what documentation should be completed for milestones that  already passed. Coast Guard officials also acknowledged the hurdles they  face in bringing C4ISR efforts under the MSAM process, as this asset may  require a broader Deepwater-level approach to tie individual assets  together.", "GAO\u2019s work on best practices for major acquisitions has demonstrated  that a knowledge-based approach to decision making, where specific  knowledge is gathered and measured against standards at key points in the  acquisition process to inform decisions about the path forward, can  significantly improve program outcomes. While the MSAM process  contains some characteristics of a knowledge-based approach, there are  key differences that could affect acquisition outcomes. For example, the  Milestone 2 decision to approve low-rate initial production precedes the  majority of the design activities in the capability development and  demonstration phase. We will continue to evaluate the Coast Guard\u2019s  process as compared to established commercial best practices in our  ongoing work.", "The MSAM requires, as part of the acquisition approval process, the Coast  Guard to report to DHS on all major program decisions beginning with the  start of an acquisition program. Coast Guard and DHS officials told us that  the processes and procedures for coordinating acquisitions with DHS\u2019s  Investment Review Board, which is tasked with reviewing major  acquisition programs, are currently undergoing revision. According to the  Coast Guard, DHS approval of acquisition decisions is not technically  necessary because the department delegated oversight responsibility for  the Deepwater Program to the Coast Guard in 2003. Recently, however,  the Coast Guard has increased communication and coordination through  good will and informal procedures such as personal working relationships.

These initiatives include     establishing an Office of Acquisition Workforce Management to    contracting for development of a strategic tool to forecast acquisition  workforce needs in terms of numbers and skill sets;     utilizing hiring flexibilities such as reemployed annuitants, relocation  bonuses, and direct hire authority; and     developing certification requirements for the entire Acquisition  Directorate (not just for project managers) to help develop what it calls  \u201cbench strength\u201d in the acquisition workforce.", "Some of these initiatives have begun to see concrete results; for example,  key Acquisition Directorate leadership positions have been filled and,  through use of hiring flexibilities, over 100 vacant civilian acquisition  positions have been filled, 40 of them using direct hire authority. However,  as Table 1 shows, the Acquisition Directorate still has not fully staffed its  billets, including a range of positions\u2014such as contract specialists,  financial analysts, systems engineers, and program management staff\u2014 that the directorate has designated as \u201chard-to-fill.\u201d", "The Acquisition Directorate has also identified a need for about 189  contractor billets for fiscal year 2008.

For example, the Coast Guard is developing a workforce  forecasting tool, which it plans to use to answer key questions about its  strategic acquisition workforce needs.

This legislation, enacted in November 2002, established a port security  framework that was designed, in part, to protect the nation\u2019s ports and  waterways from terrorist attacks by requiring a wide range of security  improvements. The SAFE Port Act, which was enacted in October 2006,  made a number of adjustments to programs within the MTSA-established  framework, creating additional programs or lines of efforts and altering  others. The additional requirements found in the SAFE Port Act have  added to the resource challenges already faced by the Coast Guard, some  of which are described below:     Inspecting domestic maritime facilities: Pursuant to Coast Guard  guidance, the Coast Guard has conducted annual inspections of  domestic maritime facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with  their security plans. The SAFE Port Act added additional requirements  that inspections be conducted at least twice per year and that one of  these inspections be conducted unannounced. More recently, the Coast  Guard has recently issued guidance requiring that unannounced  inspections be more rigorous than before. Fulfilling the requirement of  additional inspections and potentially more rigorous inspections, may  require additional resources in terms of Coast Guard inspectors.", "Inspecting foreign ports: In response to a MTSA requirement, the  Coast Guard established the International Port Security Program to  assess and, if appropriate, make recommendations to improve security  in foreign ports. Congressional directives have called for the Coast  Guard to increase the pace of its assessments of foreign ports.  However, to increase its pace, the Coast Guard may have to hire and  train new staff, in part because a number of experienced personnel are  rotating to other positions as part of the Coast Guard\u2019s standard  personnel rotation policy. Coast Guard officials also said that they have  limited ability to help countries build on or enhance their own capacity  to implement security requirements because the program does not  currently have the resources or authority to directly assist countries  with more in-depth training or technical assistance.", "Fulfilling port security operational requirements: The Coast  Guard conducts a number of operations at U.S. ports to deter and  prevent terrorist attacks. Operation Neptune Shield, first released in  2003, is the Coast Guard\u2019s operations order that sets specific security  activities (such as harbor patrols and vessel escorts) for each port and  specifies the level of security activities to be conducted at each port. As  individual port security concerns change, the level of security activities  also change, which affects the resources required to complete the  activities. Many ports are having difficulty meeting their port security  requirements, with resource constraints being a major factor.", "Meeting security requirements for additional Liquified Natural  Gas (LNG) terminals: The Coast Guard is also faced with providing  security for vessels arriving at four domestic onshore LNG import  facilities. However, the number of LNG tankers bringing shipments to  these facilities will increase considerably because of expansions that  are planned or under way. As a result of these changes, Coast Guard  field units will likely be required to significantly expand their security  workloads to conduct new LNG security missions.", "Boarding and inspecting foreign vessels: Security compliance  examinations and boardings, which include identifying vessels that  pose either a high risk for noncompliance with international and  domestic regulations or a high relative security risk to the port, are a  key component in the Coast Guard\u2019s layered security strategy. An  increasing number of vessel arrivals in U.S. ports may impact the pace  of operations for conducting security compliance examinations and  boardings in the future. For example, in the 3-year period from 2004  through 2006, vessel arrivals rose by nearly 13 percent and, according  to the Coast Guard, this increase is likely to continue. Moreover,  officials anticipate that the increase in arrivals will also likely include  larger vessels, such as tankers, that require more time and resources to  examine. At present, it is unclear to what extent increased demands on  resources may impact the ability of Coast Guard field units to complete  these activities on vessels selected for boarding.", "Establishing interagency operational centers: The SAFE Port Act  called for establishment of interagency operational centers, directing  the Secretary of DHS to establish such centers at all high-priority ports  no later than 3 years after the Act\u2019s enactment. The Coast Guard  estimates the total acquisition cost of upgrading 24 sectors that  encompass the nation\u2019s high priority ports into interagency operations  centers will be approximately $260 million. Congress funded a total of  $60 million for the construction of interagency operational centers for  fiscal year 2008. The Coast Guard has not requested any additional  funding for the construction of these centers as part of its fiscal year  2009 budget request. However, as part of its fiscal year 2009 budget  request, the Coast Guard is requesting $1 million to support its  Command 21 acquisition project (which includes the continued  development of its information management and sharing technology in  command centers). So, while the Coast Guard\u2019s estimates indicate  that it will need additional financial resources to establish the  interagency operational centers required by law, its current budget and  longer term plans do not include all of the necessary funding.", "Updating area maritime security plans: MTSA, as amended,  required that the Coast Guard develop, in conjunction with local public  and private port stakeholders, Area Maritime Security Plans. The plans  describe how port stakeholders will deter a terrorist attack or other  transportation security incident or secure the port in the event such an  attack occurs. These plans were initially developed and approved by  the Coast Guard by June 2004. MTSA also requires that the plans be  updated at least every 5 years. The SAFE Port Act added a requirement  to the plans that specified that they identify salvage equipment able to  restore operational trade capacity. The Coast Guard, working with  local public and private port stakeholders, is required to revise its plans  and have them completed and approved by June 2009. This planning  process may require a significant investment of Coast Guard resources,  in the form of time and human capital at the local port level for existing  plan revision and salvage recovery development as well as at the  national level for the review and approval of all the plans by Coast  Guard headquarters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-Homeland Security Mission Requirements also Continue to Increase", "paragraphs": ["While the Coast Guard continues to be in the center of the nation\u2019s  response to maritime-related homeland security concerns, it is still  responsible for rescuing those in distress, protecting the nation\u2019s fisheries,  keeping vital marine highways operating efficiently, and responding  effectively to marine accidents and natural disasters.

First, now  that the Coast Guard has made the decision to assume a greater  management and oversight role of the Deepwater Program, sustained  effort on a number of fronts will be needed for some time to come.  Whether the Coast Guard will achieve its goals is largely contingent on  continued strong leadership and a commitment to adhering to a  knowledge-based acquisition approach that was lacking in the past. In  addition, the Coast Guard originally turned to the private sector to manage  Deepwater, in part, because the government lacked requisite expertise.  Thus, the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to build an adequate acquisition workforce  is critical, and over time the right balance must be struck between  numbers of government and contractor personnel.", "Similarly, the right balance must be struck between homeland and non- homeland security missions. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001  terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard understandably shifted its focus to  homeland security missions at the expense of non-homeland security  missions. Congress passed and the President signed legislation that  supported and reinforced this shift that further increased Coast Guard  missions related to security. Our recent work on the Coast Guard\u2019s  homeland security programs has indicated that these missions continue to  increase demands on resources. To further complicate the Coast Guard\u2019s  resource and mission balancing act, unexpected events such as terrorist  attacks or natural disasters could result in major shifts in resources and  operations. Thus, the Coast Guard will continue to face the challenge  inherent in being a multi-mission force.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our testimony.
