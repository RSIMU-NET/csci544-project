In particular, it is managing Sentinel requirements by making sure that changes to established baselines are justified and approved on the basis of costs, benefits, and risks, and it is ensuring that different levels of requirements and related design specification and test cases are properly aligned with one another. In addition, the bureau is analyzing commercially available product alternatives in relation to requirements, costs, and other factors to ensure that the most cost-effective mix of products is being used to minimize requirement gaps. In doing so, it is taking steps to understand the dependencies among the commercial products, thus ensuring that they can interoperate effectively. Also, the bureau is not modifying the commercial products that it is selecting and using to develop Sentinel, which should allow it to minimize future maintenance costs by taking advantage of future product releases and other vendor product support. Last, it is taking steps to ensure that Sentinel integration with FBI legacy systems will occur when needed, for example, by establishing agreements with legacy system owners. Collectively, implementation of these acquisition methods should increase the chances of cost effectively delivering required Sentinel capabilities on time. However, the implementation of most of these acquisition methods is generally not governed by bureauwide policies and guidance that address all relevant practices. To the credit of program officials, this void in corporate policies and guidance has not affected Sentinel, as they are implementing all of the key practices either through reliance on their prime contractor's approaches or through Sentinel-specific plans. If policies and guidance relative to each of these methods for acquiring commercial component-based systems were incorporated into FBI-wide policies and guidance, the bureau could increase its chances of employing them on a repeatable basis across all applicable system investments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is 3 years into its 6-year, $451  million system acquisition program to replace its antiquated, paper-based  legacy systems for supporting mission-critical intelligence analysis and  investigative case management activities.

The nine life-cycle phases are concept  exploration, requirements development, acquisition planning, source  selection, design, development and test, implementation and integration,  operations and maintenance, and disposal. The life-cycle phases are  associated with one or more control gates and/or program/project reviews.  They are also linked to key stakeholder processes, including information  security management, and recognized system development and acquisition  best practice areas. The framework\u2019s elements are discussed in more  detail below and depicted in figure 2.", "The seven control gates are mechanisms for executive-level control and  direction, decision making, coordination, and confirmation of successful  performance of activities to date.

In addition, our research shows  that best practices are a significant factor in successful acquisition  outcomes, including increasing the likelihood that programs and projects  will be executed within cost and schedule estimates. Examples of  acquisition best practices or methods that are relevant to commercial  component-based systems, like Sentinel, are managing system  requirements, analyzing the trade-offs between system requirements and  commercial products, analyzing dependencies among commercial  products, limiting modification of commercial products, and integrating  commercial component-based systems with legacy systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Reports Have Identified the Need for Improvements in FBI Corporate IT and Sentinel- Specific Management", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 2005, we have reported on shortfalls in the FBI\u2019s efforts to  define and implement key IT management controls, such as centralizing IT  responsibility and authority under the Chief Information Officer, defining  and implementing an enterprise architecture, establishing IT investment  management, defining and implementing systems development and  acquisition practices, and strategically managing human capital, and have  made recommendations to address these shortfalls that the FBI has largely  agreed with. In September 2005, we reported that the FBI had taken a  range of steps to establish these institutional management controls. For  example, it has centralized IT responsibility and authority under the Chief  Information Officer, who has taken steps to define and implement an  enterprise architecture, establish IT investment management, define and  implement systems development and acquisition practices, and  strategically manage human capital. In doing so, the FBI recognized the  importance of IT to its organizational transformation efforts, and made it  one of the bureau\u2019s top 10 priorities. Consistent with this, the FBI\u2019s  strategic plan contains explicit IT-related strategic goals, objectives, and  initiatives (both near term and long term) to support the collection,  analysis, processing, and dissemination of information.

Further, it provides for  only allowing changes to those baselines that have traversed a series of  reviews and approvals by a hierarchy of contractor and program office  review boards. More specifically, a proposed change request must be  technically analyzed and approved by two levels of contractor review  boards before it can be submitted to the FBI for program office review.  Change requests submitted to the program office are first logged in by the  configuration management team and analyzed for technical content. Once  the content is validated, the team assesses the request\u2019s impact on  program cost, schedule, and scope, and coordinates the reviews by the  two program office review boards. The Engineering Review Board  assesses the impact of the proposed change and makes recommendations  to the Configuration and Change Management Board, which reviews the  changes and, if within its authority, approves the request. Otherwise, the  program office submits the request to the FBI\u2019s enterprise review board  for approval. Under the process, each board\u2019s decisions are to be based on  the proposed change\u2019s costs and benefits, as well as its risks to the  program\u2019s ability to meet existing cost and schedule commitments. Once a  change has been approved by the FBI, it is given to the contractor for  incorporation into the baseline system configuration. (See fig. 3 for a  summary of this process.)", "To assist in implementing this process, the program office and the  contractor are using a software tool that tracks and manages the change  control process, ensuring that only approved changes are reflected in the  baselines. We observed the operation of this tool and its capabilities,  tracking one of the five actual change requests associated with Phase 2,  Segment 1. In doing so, we witnessed the tool perform key functions and  found that both the change control process and the tool were being  implemented properly for the change request we observed.", "The program office\u2019s configuration management plan also describes a  process for ensuring that requirements are traceable. To implement the  configuration management plan and its requirements traceability process,  the program office is using the above cited automated tool. This tool  allows each requirement to be linked from its most conceptual, high-level  definition to its most detailed, technical definition, as well as to design  specifications and test cases.

Since the increments that have been  completed to date (i.e., Segment 1 increments) have required little  integration with legacy or external systems, the development and testing  of interfaces have not yet been necessary.", "By taking steps to manage the integration of Sentinel with legacy systems,  the program office will be better positioned to ensure that Sentinel is  deployed on time and performs as intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Policies and Guidance Do Not Address Most Key Acquisition Methods", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of the practices that relate to effective requirements  management, not all of the key practices that were earlier discussed in  association with (1) requirements/commercial product trade-off analysis,  (2) commercial product dependency analysis, (3) commercial product  modification, and (4) legacy system integration management are fully  reflected in any bureauwide policy or guidance. The extent to which the  practices related to each of these five acquisition methods are addressed  in FBI policies and guidance is discussed below:    The FBI\u2019s life-cycle management directive addresses both requirements  change control and requirements traceability. Specifically, the directive  requires that projects manage and control requirements changes, including  reviewing and controlling changes to baselined requirements and  conducting and documenting impact analyses for any requirements change  requests. The directive also speaks to the need for requirements to be  traceable forward and backwards across the project life cycle, including  the use of a requirements management tool that supports traceability  across functions and interfaces as well as requirements tracking and  reporting.", "For requirements/commercial product trade-off analysis, the FBI\u2019s life- cycle management directive partially addresses key practices. Specifically,  the directive includes an appendix that provides a structural template  outlining the content of a trade study or analysis to help choose among  competing commercial component solutions for meeting a given mission  need or problem. According to the template, analyses should be  undertaken early in a system\u2019s life cycle (during the concept exploration  phase) and should be updated and used throughout a system\u2019s life-cycle  phases. Further, its content should include, among other things, a  statement of the problem being addressed or the purpose of the study, the  evaluation or selection criteria and related weighting factors being used,  the alternative solutions being evaluated and their characteristics, a  comparative analysis of the solutions to include weighted scoring of each,  and a recommended course of action. However, the directive does not  explicitly address, for example, (1) analyzing the gaps between defined  requirements and the capabilities of commercial component alternatives  to understand each component\u2019s feasibility, (2) ensuring that the analyses\u2019  selection criteria include the relative quality and costs of competing  alternatives relative to system requirements and the organization\u2019s  operational environment (current and future), and (3) involving relevant  stakeholders in the analysis and decision-making process.", "For commercial product dependency analysis, neither the FBI\u2019s life-cycle  management directive nor the related handbook addresses the key  practices associated with this acquisition method. While FBI officials  stated that they rely on contractors to perform the practices associated  with this method because the practices are engineering oriented, it is  important for the bureau to provide its program managers with policy and  guidance relative to the method so that they can be positioned to  effectively manage and oversee the contractors\u2019 efforts.", "For commercial product modification, the FBI\u2019s Business Process  Reengineering Executive Playbook partially addresses the method\u2019s  associated practices. Specifically, it states that the FBI is to limit the  modification of commercial component systems, adding that modifying a  commercial product negates the advantages of using such systems and  introduces major problems in maintaining the system\u2019s software. However,  neither the FBI\u2019s life-cycle management directive nor the reengineering  playbook explicitly addresses two other key practices: (1) ensuring that  any modification is justified on the basis of the life-cycle impact on system  costs and benefits and (2) working proactively with the product\u2019s vendor  to incorporate planned modifications into the next release of the product.", "For legacy system integration management, the FBI\u2019s Transition and  Sequencing Plan partially addresses two key practices. Specifically, this  plan recognizes the importance of identifying the legacy systems that will  need to be integrated, and in particular, identifies those systems relative to  Sentinel. In addition, the plan also recognizes the need to understand the  dependencies among systems as a means to determining their sequencing,  and, in this regard, provides time frames of when systems that are to be  impacted by Sentinel will be, among other things, interfaced to it.  However, the FBI\u2019s policy and guidance documents do not address the  other two key practices associated with this method: (1) defining system  interfaces and (2) developing and testing the interfaces.", "By not defining these practices in FBI corporatewide policies and  guidance, the chances that they will be implemented on a repeatable basis  across all bureau IT programs and projects are reduced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Successfully implementing large-scale IT programs depends in large part  on the rigorous implementation of acquisition management best practices.  For systems like Sentinel, which are to minimize the development and use  of customized software, relevant best practices extend to those that are  unique to commercial component-based systems. Following such practices  minimizes a program\u2019s exposure to risk and helps deliver promised  capabilities and benefits on time and within budget. This is especially  important for the Sentinel system, which is to provide long-overdue,  mission-critical intelligence and investigative services across the FBI.", "Employing such practices in a repeatable fashion across all programs  requires that these practices be institutionally defined and that their use be  enforced and measured. The FBI has, for the most part, not  institutionalized defined key practices associated with  requirements/commercial product trade-off analysis, commercial product  dependency analysis, commercial product modification, and legacy system  integration. To the credit of Sentinel program officials, this void in  corporate policies and guidance is being effectively overcome, as the  program is implementing these key practices either through reliance on its  prime contractor\u2019s approaches or through Sentinel-specific plans. If these  Sentinel practices are successfully incorporated into FBI-wide policies and  guidance, then their chances of being employed on a repeatable basis  across all applicable FBI system investments will be increased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To leverage key commercial component-based acquisition methods being  implemented on Sentinel, and increase the chances of these practices  being implemented on all FBI IT programs, we are making four  recommendations.

To accomplish this, we focused on the  following five key information technology (IT) management areas: (1)  requirements management, (2) requirements/commercial product trade-off  analysis, (3) commercial product dependency analysis, (4) commercial  product modification, and (5) legacy system integration.", "To address our objective, we researched relevant best practices, including  published guidance from the Software Engineering Institute and GAO- issued reports associated with each of these five areas. To identify the  FBI\u2019s efforts, we obtained and reviewed FBI IT management policies and  guidance, including its Information Technology Life Cycle Management  Directive (Version 3.0), Project Manager\u2019s Handbook, and Business  Process Reengineering Executive Playbook, and compared them to the  practices in each of the five IT management areas to determine the extent  to which they were included in FBI guidance.", "We also reviewed program office and prime contractor planning and  program management documentation, including the Sentinel Systems  Engineering Management Plan (Version 3) and Sentinel Configuration  Management Plan (Version 3). In addition, we interviewed Sentinel  program officials as well as prime contractor representatives, as  appropriate, to determine how the FBI had defined its approach to  managing each of these five areas and how it had actually implemented  them on Sentinel. In reviewing the FBI\u2019s implementation on Sentinel, we  focused primarily on Phase 2, Segment 1, which was the segment being  developed at the time we began our review. We also performed the  following additional audit work:    For requirements management, we reviewed: (1) the Sentinel  Configuration Management Plan, (2) the contractor\u2019s Requirements  Satisfaction Report, and (3) the contractor\u2019s System Design Document. In  addition, to determine the extent to which the requirements were  traceable, we randomly selected 55 requirements from the program  office\u2019s Requirement\u2019s Traceability Matrix and traced them backwards to  the Sentinel System Requirements Specification and forward to design  specifications and test cases. This sample was designed with a 5 percent  tolerable error rate at the 95 percent level of confidence, so that if we  found 0 problems in our sample we could conclude statistically that the  error rate was less than 5 percent. Based upon the weight of all other  factors included in our evaluation, our verification of 55 out of 55  requirements was sufficient to demonstrate traceability. Further, we  tracked one of the five change requests associated with Phase 2, Segment  1 to determine whether the change had been reviewed and approved  consistent with the established requirements change control process. In  addition, we interviewed program officials involved in the requirements  management process to discuss their roles and responsibilities for  managing requirements.", "For trade-off analysis, we reviewed: (1) the Sentinel Lessons Learned  document, (2) the Forms Tool Capability Trade Study, (3) the Search Tool  Capability Trade Study, and (4) the Design Concept Description and  Architecture. In addition, we interviewed the prime contractor\u2019s Chief  Architect for Sentinel to discuss trade studies.", "For commercial product dependency analysis, we reviewed: (1) two  Sentinel Interface Control Documents and (2) the Interface Design  Document. We also reviewed the above cited trade studies with respect to  efforts to prototype the interaction among commercial products that were  being studied. In addition, we interviewed the prime contractor\u2019s Chief  Architect for Sentinel to discuss how trade studies took commercial  product dependencies into account.", "For commercial product modification, we reviewed the Systems  Engineering Management Plan and interviewed the FBI Chief Information  Officer and Sentinel Deputy Program Manager about their commercial  product modification policies.", "For legacy system integration, we reviewed the Sentinel (1) Design  Concept Description and Architecture, (2) Interface Design Document, (3)  Software Design Document, and (4) Test and Evaluation Master Plan.
