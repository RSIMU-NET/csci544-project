Since 1998, Congress has appropriated over $1 billion for the media campaign. However, a 2003 report by the Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed some concerns about the media campaign, including concern that a large portion of the campaign's budget had been used for consulting services rather than the direct purchase of media time and space.

These four prime contractors provided an array of services that fell within three broad categories: (1) advertising, (2) public communications and outreach, and (3) evaluation services to gauge the campaign's effectiveness. The prime contractors also acquired additional specialized expertise from 102 subcontractors. Some of the specific tasks performed by the contractors and their subcontractors included conducting qualitative and quantitative research for advertising creation, working with the entertainment industry to portray the negative consequences of drug use in television and movies, and conducting an evaluation intended to measure the effectiveness of the media campaign. Based on our analysis of contracts covering fiscal years 2002 through 2004, we estimated that $520 million was awarded to the four prime contractors, of which an estimated $373 million--72 percent--was committed to purchasing media time and space for campaign advertisements. The remaining $147 million--28 percent--was for the services provided by the prime contractors.

Among these  approaches is an effort to reduce and prevent drug use among America\u2019s  youth by conducting educational and community action programs,  including a National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.

Since then, over $1 billion has  been appropriated for the media campaign. In a committee report for the  fiscal year 2004 appropriations cycle, the Senate Appropriations  Committee asserted that drug use was increasing in spite of the campaign  and that some observers had concluded that the campaign was having no  noticeable impact. In addition, the report asserted that a large portion of  the campaign\u2019s budget pays for outside media and advertising consultants.  As such, the report expressed concern about the amount of resources  consumed by consultants and the extent to which funds were spent for  consulting services rather than media time and space for advertisements.  Given these issues, the committee report directed us to review how  consultants were used in support of the media campaign. This report  focuses on the following question: What services did contractors and their  subcontractors provide in support of ONDCP\u2019s media campaign and what  were the estimated award amounts for these services for fiscal years 2002  through 2004? We are currently conducting a separate review examining  the design and execution of ONDCP\u2019s primary effort to evaluate the media  campaign\u2019s effectiveness.", "To respond to the question for this report, we met with and obtained  documentation from officials at ONDCP headquarters and contractor and  subcontractor officials in Washington, D.C., and New York City that  supported the media campaign.

We  obtained information about the roles and responsibilities of each of the  four prime contractors from the background, scope of work, and task  description sections of their respective contracts. Additionally, to describe  services provided by the 102 subcontractors, we developed a data  collection instrument (DCI) to allow us to analyze these services uniformly  by capturing the following information: (1) the subcontract agreement  date(s), (2) the prime contractor issuing the subcontract(s), and (3) what  task categories captured the tasks listed in the subcontract agreement(s).", "We supplemented our analysis of the prime contracts and subcontracts  with information from interviews with officials from ONDCP and PDFA  and representatives from several prime contractors and subcontractors.", "We estimated the amounts awarded to each of the four prime contractors  based on the award data contained in their contracts and any subsequent  modifications to these contracts related to awards. Each of the four prime  contracts was a \u201ccost plus fixed fee\u201d contract, meaning that with the  exception of a fixed fee, payments were disbursed in the form of  reimbursements for invoiced costs. Therefore, the award amounts listed in  the contract agreements were estimates of the amounts the contractors  would actually receive in reimbursements. Because these estimates were  constantly revised based on the status of campaign projects or other  information, contract modifications were used to update the contract  award data. For the purposes of this review, we used the latest contract  modifications to estimate the prime contractors\u2019 awards as they contained  the most recent information. Each of these contracts covered multiple  years. Awards for each year of the contract were estimated at the  beginning of the contract, and those yearly estimates were modified  throughout the life of the contract. The year time frames established by  the contracts (with the exception of the Westat contract) did not  correspond to government fiscal years and differed with each contractor.  For example, Ogilvy & Mather\u2019s contract year was from January to January  and Fleishman-Hillard\u2019s contract year was from December to December.  In order to estimate the prime contractors\u2019 award amounts by fiscal year,  it was necessary to prorate the award data listed in the contracts and  modifications. By prorating the award data, we obtained estimated award  data for each month and were then able to calculate estimated award  amounts by fiscal year. An example of this type of calculation appears  below.", "The major limitation of this method of analysis is that it assumes an equal  distribution of the total estimated award over the term of the contract,  which may not reflect the actual schedule of reimbursements to the  contractor. Another limitation of our analysis is that it relies on estimates  of the actual costs (i.e., estimated award amounts). We decided to use  estimated award data instead of the expenditure data provided by ONDCP  because the expenditure data were not complete.", "We estimated the amounts awarded to each of the 102 subcontractors  based on the award data contained in their subcontracts and modifications  to these subcontracts. In 18 cases where subcontract award data were  insufficient, we used invoices and vouchers provided by the prime  contractors to estimate expenditure data. Subcontract award data were  determined to be insufficient if (1) the subcontract did not contain any  estimated award data or (2) the subcontract listed a rate of compensation  for services but did not specify a maximum term or compensation.", "We classified the award data contained in the subcontracts of the 102  subcontractors into five types: (1) cost-reimbursable, (2) cost plus fixed  fee, (3) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery, (4) firm fixed price, and   (5) rate-based. We analyzed each type of award data differently to produce  estimated award data for the 102 subcontractors for fiscal years 2002  through 2004. We analyzed the subcontracts containing cost-reimbursable,  cost plus fixed fee, and indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery award data  using the same method used to analyze the prime contractor award data.", "We analyzed the subcontracts containing firm fixed price award data using  the prorating method described above only if the term of the subcontract  covered multiple fiscal years. Many of these subcontracts had terms that  fell completely within a single fiscal year, in which case we assigned the  total award amount listed in the subcontract to the appropriate fiscal year.  Firm fixed price subcontracts are agreements in which the subcontractor  receives a fixed amount for the services it provides. Regardless of the time  the subcontractor requires to complete its assigned tasks or whether the  subcontractor incurs additional unexpected costs in the completion of its  assigned tasks, it will not receive any additional funds without a  subsequent modification to the subcontract. Consequently, the award data  contained in the firm fixed price subcontracts represents the actual  amount the subcontractor should have received.", "We analyzed subcontracts containing rate-based awards in a two-step  process to produce estimated awards by fiscal year. Subcontracts  containing rate-based data contain (1) a rate of compensation for the  subcontractor (for example, $200 per hour), (2) a maximum term (such as  10 hours) or maximum compensation (such as $2,000), and (3) a term or  period of performance (i.e. the period of time during which the  subcontractor will provide its service, such as between June 1, 2002, and  June 30, 2002). We calculated the maximum possible award by multiplying  the rate of compensation by the maximum term (unless the subcontract  specified a maximum compensation). We considered this calculation of  maximum possible awards as the total estimated award amounts for all  rate-based subcontracts. If the term (period of performance) of the  subcontract fell within a single fiscal year, then the total estimated award  of the contract was assigned to the appropriate fiscal year. If the term  (period of performance) of the subcontract covered multiple fiscal years,  then the total estimated award was prorated as previously described, and  total estimated awards for each fiscal year were calculated. An example of  this type of analysis appears below.", "In the 18 cases where we used invoices and vouchers to estimate  expenditure data because subcontract award data were insufficient, we  grouped the invoices and vouchers of each subcontractor by fiscal year  and totaled the invoice/voucher amounts for each fiscal year.", "The methods of analysis used to produce estimated award data for  subcontractors for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 have many of the same  limitations as the method used to analyze the prime contract award data  (i.e., much of the subcontract award data had to be prorated and some of  the subcontract award data represented estimated reimbursements). In  addition, we had to substitute expenditure data in the case of 18  subcontracts that did not contain sufficient award data. Consequently, we  based some of our calculations related to total subcontractor estimates on  different types of data (expenditure or award). We decided to use  estimated award data whenever possible to ensure data consistency (i.e.,  to avoid comparing contractor awards based on estimated award data  with subcontractor awards that were based on expenditure data).", "We conducted our work from March 2004 through February 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Three Phases of Advertising Development", "paragraphs": ["To develop anti-drug television, print, Internet, and radio ads, the media  campaign employs a three-phase advertising development and research  process. The three phases of the advertising development and research  process are (1) the exploratory research phase (pre-ad creation); (2) the  qualitative and quantitative research and expert review phase (during ad  creation); and (3) the media planning, placement, and tracking phase  (post-ad creation).", "The initial exploratory phase consists of extensive research to understand  the subject matter and covers many sources of information, including   (1) consumer insights, (2) national studies, (3) behavioral change experts,  and (4) subject matter experts. PDFA is a major source for this  background research. In addition, the Behavioral Change Expert Panel  (BCEP), assembled by Ogilvy & Mather, is composed of a number of  individuals possessing specialized expertise relevant to specific aspects of  the media campaign, such as the sociology of behavior change in youth or  communicating with minority audiences. The BCEP is responsible for  developing a Behavioral Brief, which is a background document that  describes the major insights of research and literature to consider when  developing advertising intended to reach youth audiences. The final goal  of the exploratory research phase is for Ogilvy & Mather and PDFA to  produce a Creative Brief for each advertising series. The Creative Brief is  a compilation of information provided by subject matter experts, including  (1) information relevant to the specific messages of the campaign and   (2) relevant portions of the qualitative research provided by PDFA  regarding consumer insights and national studies. The pro bono agencies  responsible for the creative development of a given advertising series use  the Creative Brief and the Behavioral Brief to inform their efforts.", "The second phase involves ad creation and qualitative and quantitative  research. PDFA is responsible for soliciting pro bono advertising agencies  that create the advertising concepts using the Creative and Behavioral  Briefs. The media campaign uses multiple pro bono advertising agencies to  develop advertisements. One example of a media campaign advertising  series is the \u201cMonitoring/Love\u201d series of advertisements\u2014a message  targeting parents, promoting awareness of their children\u2019s activities. A  single pro bono ad agency developed all of the advertisements within this  series. After initial advertising concepts are developed, the Formative  Creative Evaluation Panel (FCEP) and the BCEP review these initial  concepts. Next, feedback from FCEP and BCEP is used to revise the  advertising concepts. Any recommendations or observations that may be  relevant to future campaign efforts are to be kept for possible applications  to new Creative Briefs during the initial exploratory research phase (i.e.,  the feedback loop in this iterative process).", "Once the advertising concepts have been reviewed and revised,  production estimates are calculated and reviewed for maximum cost  efficiency. Once this process is completed, ONDCP is responsible for  reviewing the ad concepts and approving funding for production of the  advertisements. After advertisements are produced, they are submitted for  copytesting, a process used to determine whether advertisements meet  effectiveness standards for distribution. In the copytesting process, large  sample audiences (usually consisting of 300 youths and 150 parents per  copytest session) view the ads and are surveyed regarding their responses  to the advertisement, drug attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Copytesting  relies on a comparison of exposed audiences and nonexposed control  audiences to determine effectiveness of advertisements. According to  Ogilvy & Mather (the contractor responsible for implementing  copytesting), the audience is split evenly across ethnic, gender, and age  categories. One-half of the audience is exposed to the advertisement and  the other half is not. Copytesting researchers then survey and compare the  drug beliefs and intentions of each group to determine the effectiveness of  the advertisement. If an advertisement does not meet effectiveness  standards set by ONDCP, the advertisement is not aired. To successfully  pass the copytesting process, an advertisement must significantly  strengthen anti-drug beliefs or weaken intentions to use marijuana without  creating any adverse effects.
