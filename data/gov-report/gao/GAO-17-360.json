In 2014 and 2016, two outbreaks of avian influenza led to the deaths of millions of poultry in 15 states and prompted emergency spending to control the disease. While the health risk to humans is low, humans have been infected with these viruses, sometimes fatally. A spike in fatal human infections in Asia began in late 2016.", "GAO was asked to review several issues related to avian influenza. This report examines (1) how outbreaks of avian influenza have affected human health, animal health, and the U.S. economy, (2) the extent to which USDA has taken actions to address any lessons learned from its responses to the outbreaks in 2014 and 2016, and how it plans to evaluate the actions' effectiveness, and (3) ongoing challenges and associated issues, if any, federal agencies face in their efforts to mitigate the potential harmful effects of avian influenza. GAO reviewed global and domestic data on the effects of avian influenza and USDA reports and corrective action data associated with its responses to the recent outbreaks, and interviewed federal officials and stakeholders from state agencies and the poultry industry."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["When avian influenza outbreaks occur, they can have significant effects on human and animal health and the U.S. economy. With regard to human health, avian influenza rarely affects humans, but the World Health Organization estimates that two particular types of the virus have caused more than 2,100 human infections and more than 800 deaths since 1997, primarily in Asia and the Middle East. With regard to animal health, avian influenza outbreaks can lead to large numbers of poultry deaths as a result of efforts to control and prevent the spread of the disease. For example, from December 2014 to June 2015, more than 50 million birds were destroyed in the largest outbreak in U.S. history. The effect of avian influenza on the health of other animal species varies. Swine are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses that, if mixed, could create a new virus to which humans are vulnerable. An outbreak can also have significant economic consequences; for example, the economic impacts of the 2014 outbreak in the United States have been estimated to range from $1.0 to $3.3 billion.", "USDA identified 15 areas with lessons learned from its responses to the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks of avian influenza and 308 associated corrective actions. For example, one lesson learned in the area of depopulation (mass culling of flocks) is that there were not enough skilled personnel available for depopulating infected poultry, leading to delays and possibly increasing the spread of disease. USDA has identified as completed about 70 percent of the 308 corrective actions to address all of the lessons learned. However, the agency has not evaluated the extent to which completed corrective actions\u2014such as encouraging states to form depopulation teams\u2014have helped resolve the problems identified, and it does not have plans for doing so. GAO has previously found that agencies may use evaluations to ascertain the success of corrective actions, and that a well-developed plan for conducting evaluations can help ensure that agencies obtain the information necessary to make effective program and policy decisions. Such a plan would help USDA ascertain the effectiveness of the actions it took to resolve problems identified during recent outbreaks.", "On the basis of GAO's analysis of federal efforts to respond to outbreaks and of stakeholders' views, GAO identified ongoing challenges and associated issues that federal agencies face in mitigating the potential harmful effects of avian influenza. For example:", "One challenge is that federal efforts to protect poultry from avian influenza rely on voluntary actions by a wide range of poultry producers to take routine preventative measures\u2014known as biosecurity\u2014 to protect their flocks from disease. USDA has two major initiatives under way to encourage improvements to biosecurity.", "An associated issue that federal agencies face is that the chickens used to produce the eggs needed to manufacture critical human influenza vaccine are susceptible to influenza outbreaks. The Department of Health and Human Services is supporting the development of new vaccine manufacturing technologies to reduce reliance on eggs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USDA develop a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the corrective actions it has taken. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Avian influenza is a highly infectious and, in some circumstances, fatal  disease in poultry, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and other  domesticated fowl. Most avian influenza viruses have low pathogenicity,  meaning that they cause no signs or only minor clinical signs of infection  in poultry. In contrast, highly pathogenic avian influenza can cause a high  death rate in poultry. Two separate outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian  influenza in the United States, one in 2014 and another in 2016, led to the  deaths of millions of domesticated poultry in 15 states, caused economic  losses for the U.S. poultry industry, and prompted emergency  government spending on control measures. According to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), while the risk posed to the general public by the avian  influenza viruses that circulated in the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks was low,  people in other countries have been infected, sometimes fatally, by  similar viruses. For example, a similar avian influenza virus caused a  spike in human infections and fatalities in China in late 2016 and early  2017, particularly among people in direct contact with poultry. The U.S.  outbreaks did not cause infections in humans. However, we previously  found in June 2007 that health experts were concerned that if a subtype  of avian influenza develops the capacity to spread easily from person to  person, a pandemic could occur. According to the World Health  Organization, controlling the virus in poultry is the principal way to reduce  opportunities for human infection and, therefore, for a pandemic to  emerge.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for acting to  prevent, control, and eradicate any disease or pest of livestock, including  foreign animal diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, in  domestic livestock and poultry. In doing so, USDA typically partners with  states and industry in eradicating such diseases, with the agency\u2019s level  of involvement dependent upon states\u2019 preparedness and the size of the  outbreak. USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),  state and local animal health officials, and the poultry industry collaborate  to eradicate avian influenza by, for example, depopulating (culling)  affected poultry flocks to halt spread of the disease, cleaning and  disinfecting premises and equipment, and testing for the presence of the  virus. USDA compensates\u2014indemnifies\u2014poultry producers for birds and  eggs lost to the disease and pays for cleaning, disinfection, and testing.", "CDC collaborates with USDA and with state and local public health  agencies to monitor people who are involved in activities to control and  eradicate an outbreak to determine whether they experience influenza- like illness that may be associated with an outbreak in poultry. The  Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) U.S. Geological Survey and U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service collaborate with USDA, HHS, state and local  governments, and private interests to conduct surveillance of wild birds  and other animals for avian influenza.", "You asked us to review several issues related to avian influenza.

Specifically, to provide information on  human health, we reviewed global and U.S. data on avian influenza- related human mortality and morbidity dating back to 1918, the first  recorded pandemic of probable avian origin. Regarding animal health, we  reviewed USDA data and scientific literature on highly pathogenic avian  influenza outbreaks among poultry dating back to 1924, the first recorded  outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the United States. For  low pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks among poultry, we obtained  USDA data starting in 2002 that were readily available in proceedings of  the U.S. Animal Health Association\u2019s annual meetings. For information  regarding influenza in other mammals, we reviewed agency information,  scientific literature, and interviewed federal, state, and industry officials.  For wild birds, we reviewed scientific literature on federal monitoring from 2006 to 2011 and monitoring data from 2014 to 2016, when Interior\u2019s U.S.  Geological Survey and USDA began their current wild bird surveillance  program. Regarding impacts on the U.S. economy, we focused on the  2014 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza since it was the  largest recent outbreak. We reviewed a variety of economic literature for  information on the estimated costs of the 2014 outbreak to U.S.  agriculture and consumers. We obtained data on USDA obligations for its  responses to that outbreak, the January 2016 outbreak, and a May 2016  low pathogenic avian influenza outbreak. To assess the reliability of the  data sources noted above, we reviewed the data and supporting  documentation and interviewed officials familiar with the data, and we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for providing  information on the effects of avian influenza on human and animal health  and the economy. We also asked for observations on the federal  responses to the outbreaks of avian influenza through interviews with  officials from USDA, HHS, Interior, and state and industry representatives  in six states. We selected the six states\u2014California, Indiana, Iowa,  Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio\u2014either because they were affected  by the 2014 and 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks or  because they have large poultry industries.", "To examine the extent to which USDA has taken actions to address any  lessons learned from its responses to the 2014 and 2016 avian influenza  outbreaks and how it plans to evaluate the effectiveness of such actions,  we reviewed USDA\u2019s after action reports of its responses to the 2014  outbreak in western and midwestern states and the 2016 outbreak in  Indiana. We also reviewed USDA\u2019s Corrective Action Program database  for tracking the agency\u2019s progress in completing tasks identified in its after  action reports and USDA documentation of specific steps taken in  response to lessons learned. To examine USDA\u2019s tracking of corrective  actions in the database, we conducted an in-depth review of a  nongeneralizable sample of 10 corrective actions listed in the database.", "For this sample, we randomly selected actions from each of six  preparedness and response areas that fit within the scope of our overall  review and that USDA classified in its database as priority 1 items with a  status of \u201cclosed,\u201d \u201ccompleted,\u201d or \u201cin progress.\u201d We requested and  reviewed agency documents and information from officials describing the  steps taken to close, complete, or make progress on the actions in our  sample. Our review of this sample of actions provides general information  about the steps USDA has taken related to these 10 actions; however,  the results from this sample are not generalizable to all corrective actions  in the database. To assess the overall reliability of the Corrective Action  Program database for use in our report, we reviewed management  controls over the information systems that maintain the data and  interviewed USDA officials who manage the database.

Avian influenza viruses can also be moved from place to  place\u2014including between farms\u2014by people, equipment, vehicles, feed,  insects, rodents and other animals, water, and wind-blown dust as shown  in figure 1. Poultry producers may implement biosecurity measures to  reduce the risk that diseases such as avian influenza will be transmitted  to their flocks. For example, producers may disinfect vehicles arriving at  and leaving a farm or direct employees to disinfect boots and hands  before entering a poultry barn. During an outbreak in poultry, additional  biosecurity measures may be used to prevent the disease from further  spreading. For example, USDA personnel and contractors working to  control an outbreak would be expected to restrict their movements among  locations to prevent carrying the virus to an uninfected site.", "One form of highly pathogenic avian influenza has become endemic in  several countries, including China, Indonesia, and Vietnam; this means  that the virus has become entrenched in poultry populations in those  countries. USDA considers highly pathogenic avian influenza a \u201cforeign  animal disease\u201d in the United States, meaning U.S. poultry are normally  free from the disease. The United States, as a member of the World  Organisation for Animal Health, has agreed (through USDA), along with  other member countries, to notify the organization and its members of any  detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Member countries also  agree to report cases of low pathogenic H5 or H7 avian influenza found in  poultry or other birds because these viruses have the potential to mutate  to a highly pathogenic form in poultry and may infect other species.

Therefore, when a flock is infected with notifiable H5  or H7 avian influenza, the goal of the poultry industry and government  agencies is to control and eradicate the virus as rapidly as possible in  order to prevent its spread and regain the confidence of trading partners  that any future imports of poultry or poultry products will be virus free. To  this end, USDA and other federal, state, and industry partners aim to act  quickly in the affected area to, among other things: (1) quarantine  susceptible animals; (2) implement biosecurity measures; (3) depopulate  infected and exposed birds; (4) dispose of contaminated and potentially  contaminated materials, including animal carcasses; and (5) clean and  disinfect the infected premises.

In addition, a 1976 outbreak of  H1N1 swine influenza at Fort Dix, New Jersey, infected up to 230 humans  and killed 1 person. More recently, according to CDC documents, more  than 360 people in the United States were infected with influenza A  (H3N2) variant influenza from August 2011 through September 2016, with  one fatality. Also according to CDC, these infections have mostly been  associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Outbreaks Have Cost the Federal Government and the U.S. Economy Billions of Dollars", "paragraphs": ["Outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the United States in 2014 and  2016 cost the federal government about $930 million, according to USDA  documents, and the 2014 outbreak cost the economy from $1 billion to  $3.3 billion, according to two studies by USDA and a private firm.  According to USDA budget documents for fiscal years 2015 and 2016,  the agency obligated a total of about $869 million for the responses to the  2014 outbreak in 15 states, the January 2016 outbreak in Indiana,  and a  May 2016 outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza in Missouri. As  shown in table 4, the largest portion of these obligations was for response  operations, including depopulation, disposal, composting, and cleaning  and disinfection. Indemnity payments to poultry producers were another  large category of obligations. Nearly all of the funds were transferred from  the Commodity Credit Corporation.", "In addition, USDA obligated about $60 million in funds transferred from  the Commodity Credit Corporation in fiscal year 2015 on fixed costs\u2014 such as salaries, benefits, and supplies\u2014and other activities related to  preparing for the possible return of the virus in the fall of 2015, such as  wild bird surveillance and vaccine research.", "With respect to the U.S. economy, two separate analyses have examined  and produced national estimates of the economic impacts from the highly  pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that began in 2014. A national  analysis conducted by USDA economists measured the 2014 outbreak\u2019s  impact to U.S. livestock and feed sectors, including poultry and poultry  products, at $1 billion. The estimates in the analysis take into  consideration producer and consumer behavior as prices and production  changed in response to the reduction in production and the trade  embargoes linked to the outbreak. The effects were measured throughout  the course of the outbreak, allowing for estimates based on changes over  time. According to this analysis, U.S. turkey producers lost an estimated  $214 million in sales (a decline of 6.8 percent from 2014 levels), and  broiler producers lost $276 million (a decline of 1.5 percent from 2014).", "While broilers were only negligibly affected by the virus, as separately  reported by APHIS, the sector still suffered losses because of large  decreases in demand from countries that extended full or partial bans on  poultry and poultry products, including broilers, from the United States. In  addition, because crops (e.g., corn and soybeans) are essential to the  poultry sector, those commodities also experienced losses estimated at  $373 million because of the reduction in number of birds fed. On the other  hand, the reduced egg supply caused by the outbreak raised the price of  eggs for consumers and, according to the analysis, led to an increase of  $53 million in sales for U.S. egg and layer producers (an increase of 26.7  percent from 2015 levels).", "The second national analysis contained a preliminary estimate of $3.3  billion in total economy-wide losses through June 29, 2015, from the 2014  outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. This included direct  losses to the turkey and egg processing sectors of $1.6 billion, with  losses of $530 million for turkeys and $1.04 billion for laying hens. The  $3.3 billion estimate included macroeconomic impacts due to losses to  other indirect sectors, such as retail and foodservice, but did not include  activities such as clean-up, restocking, or future lost production while the  producer prepares to resume production at a pre-disease level. Also,  unlike the first analysis noted above, this analysis did not include  consumer or producer responses to changes in prices or production, such  as increases in egg prices due to production losses.", "Starting from the beginning of the avian influenza outbreak in December  2014, 18 trading partner nations imposed bans on all shipments of U.S.  poultry and products, and 38 trading partners imposed partial, or regional,  bans on shipments from states or parts of states experiencing outbreaks.  According to USDA officials, as of January 2017, China, Kyrgyzstan,  Russia, and Thailand continued to impose national bans on U.S. poultry  imports that were attributed to concerns about highly pathogenic avian  influenza, and Jamaica had imposed a state ban on U.S. poultry imports  from several Midwestern states. Total U.S. poultry and product exports  declined in value from about $6.4 billion in 2014 to $4.9 billion in 2015.  The largest of these declines was from the U.S. broiler meat industry,  which fell from $4.1 billion to $3.0 billion over that period. While a USDA  report attributed part of this decline in exports to a strong U.S. dollar, the  report also noted that the avian influenza outbreak that began in 2014  caused the poultry industry to lose market share to other poultry exporters  such as Brazil. According to a September 2016 USDA report, export  levels of broiler chickens\u2014the largest poultry export sector\u2014were  modestly rebounding in 2016 from the levels that followed the end of the  highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in 2015, although these 2016  levels were still at their lowest since 2011. In addition, according to the  USDA report, turkey exports remained weak compared to the pre-avian  influenza trends, and egg exports in July 2016 were 6 percent lower than  the previous year. USDA noted that some major importing countries had  lifted trade bans since the 2014 outbreak and that other factors, such as  the strength of the dollar, have also affected exports. USDA officials  involved in the response also said that the negative effect on U.S. poultry  exports was partially mitigated by the fact that some countries imposed  regional, rather than national, bans on U.S. poultry products. In addition,  the agency\u2019s implementation of secure food supply plans allowed poultry  producers to move non-infected products during the outbreaks. A goal  of these plans is to continue business operations from locations that are  not infected with disease.", "After the March 2017 detections of highly pathogenic H7N9 avian  influenza in two commercial flocks in Lincoln County, Tennessee,  numerous countries imposed trade restrictions on U.S. poultry exports.  For example, the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) imposed restrictions on  poultry imports from the entire United States. Some countries, such as  South Africa, Taiwan, and Uruguay, placed restrictions on poultry imports  from the entire state of Tennessee while others, such as Jamaica and the  European Union, imposed restrictions on certain geographic areas or  counties.

To identify the lessons learned from both the widespread  outbreak that began in 2014 and the limited 2016 outbreak in Indiana,  USDA proactively collected feedback about its performance during and  after the outbreaks from federal and state animal health officials and from  industry representatives involved in the responses. The agency then  summarized this feedback into after action reports that included  observations about strengths and weaknesses in the responses. The  identified lessons learned covered a wide range of response areas,  including the depopulation  of infected birds, disposal of bird carcasses,  and surveillance of flocks for infection. For example, according to USDA  documents, rapid depopulation is critical to help prevent or mitigate the  spread of the disease by eliminating infected, exposed, or potentially  exposed animals. However, USDA noted that during the 2014 outbreak,  there were substantial delays in completing depopulation, with producers  reporting that it took as long as 11 days to begin depopulation on many  premises.", "USDA developed a corrective action program to identify, prioritize, and  implement corrective actions that are intended to address the root causes  of the lessons learned. The agency identified 308 corrective actions  across 15 response areas and created a corrective action database to  track the actions (see table 5 for the list of 15 response areas and  examples of lessons learned and corrective actions associated with each  area.)", "USDA prioritized the corrective actions according to their implications for  future outbreaks and, for the highest priority actions, their time frame for  completion. Specifically, USDA defined priority 1 corrective actions as  those that would have immediate, critical implications for a future  outbreak and that could be completed in less than 1 year; priority 2  actions as those that would have positive implications for a future  outbreak or would have immediate, important implications but that may  not be completed within 1 year; and priority 3 actions as those that are  under consideration or that would have less critical implications for a  future outbreak.", "According to our review and summary of USDA\u2019s corrective action  database, the agency has marked as completed about 70 percent of its  corrective actions, including about 86 percent of the priority 1 actions (see  table 6). As of January 2017, USDA did not have time frames for  completing about 82 percent of the uncompleted priority 2 and priority 3  corrective actions. For example, USDA has not established a time frame  for completing a priority 2 corrective action related to depopulation that  calls for the agency to develop training materials for contracted  responders to help ensure there are enough skilled personnel available  for depopulation. This action is marked as \u201cin progress\u201d in the database.  When we raised this issue during the course of our review, USDA officials  responsible for the database said they are working with the groups in  charge of taking corrective actions to identify time frames for the  remaining priority 2 and priority 3 actions, but they said that it is complex  and difficult to do so in light of other agency disease response activities.  For example, they said that responding to an outbreak of New World  screwworm in Florida in fall 2016 had caused the agency to pause some  of its efforts to address corrective actions from the highly pathogenic  avian influenza outbreaks. Nonetheless, agency officials acknowledged  that time frames are important and said they will continue to develop  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Does Not Have Plans to Evaluate the Effectiveness of its Corrective Actions", "paragraphs": ["USDA has taken steps to implement corrective actions, but it does not  have plans to evaluate the extent to which completed corrective actions  have effectively helped to resolve the problems the agency identified in its  responses to the recent outbreaks. We have previously found that  agencies may use evaluations to ascertain the success of corrective  actions, and that a well-developed plan for conducting evaluations can  help ensure that agencies obtain the information necessary to make  effective program and policy decisions. An evaluation plan should  include, among other things, evaluative  criteria or comparisons, or how or  on what basis program performance will be judged or evaluated. We also  found that one approach agencies can use to evaluate changes in events  that occur infrequently and unpredictably, such as disease outbreaks, is  to conduct simulations or exercises to assess how well an agency\u2019s plans  anticipate the nature of its threats and vulnerabilities. Homeland Security  Exercise and Evaluation Program guidance, which USDA officials told us  they used in developing the corrective action program, states that  agencies should put in place a system to test and validate corrective  actions that have been implemented. This guidance states that  agencies can identify the corrective actions that require validation and  then conduct exercises to test whether those corrective actions have led  to improvements.", "In our review of a nongeneralizable sample of 10 completed corrective  actions designated as priority 1, it was unclear to what extent such  actions were effective because, while USDA marked in its database that it  had completed the corrective actions, it had not evaluated the extent to  which these actions achieved the desired outcome. For example, one  lesson learned that USDA identified was that many producers lack a  strong culture of biosecurity. However, although USDA completed  corrective actions associated with that lesson\u2014creating a joint biosecurity  website with the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association and putting greater  emphasis on biosecurity in conferences with producers\u2014it did not  evaluate to what extent taking these actions created a strong culture of  biosecurity among producers. In another lesson learned, USDA identified  that states and producers encountered impediments in transporting bird  carcasses to landfills, such as federal and state rules restricting the  movement of bird carcasses along transportation routes in close proximity  to other producers. USDA completed corrective actions associated with  that lesson\u2014providing guidance, training, and encouragement to states  and producers to develop disposal plans\u2014but did not evaluate to what  extent taking these actions helped overcome the impediments observed.  In addition, depopulation experts we interviewed raised concerns about  whether USDA\u2019s planned and completed corrective actions will effectively  address the challenges with depopulation experienced during the 2014  and 2016 outbreaks. For example, these experts questioned whether a  sufficient number of federal employees and contracted responders have  been trained in using depopulation equipment to address a lesson  learned that there were not enough skilled personnel available for  depopulation during recent outbreaks.", "USDA documents state that the 2016 outbreak provided an opportunity to  see that some of the corrective actions taken following the 2014 outbreak  resulted in an improved response. For example, according to USDA\u2019s  after action report on the 2016 outbreak, the changes that USDA made to  the process for compensating poultry producers for losses after the 2014  outbreak resulted in a faster and more efficient process during the 2016  outbreak. Nonetheless, USDA officials acknowledged that they are not  certain whether completing other corrective actions will be sufficient to  address the lessons learned from both outbreaks. They acknowledged  the importance of evaluating corrective actions to determine whether  additional steps are needed but said that the agency does not yet have  plans to do so. Agency officials also told us that evaluating the  effectiveness of these corrective actions will need to be a continuous  process and should be considered within the broader context of USDA\u2019s  emergency preparedness for disease response. For example, USDA  officials told us they intend to incorporate lessons learned and corrective  actions from the agency\u2019s response to the 2016 New World screwworm  outbreak into the corrective action database for highly pathogenic avian  influenza, so that the database becomes a broader tool that the agency  can use to track corrective actions related to its overall disease response  efforts.

Because of their migratory  behavior, wild birds infected with avian influenza can spread the disease  across long distances, including from as far away as Asia. Federal  agencies and others are authorized under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to  sample ducks, geese, and other migratory birds to confirm the presence  of an infectious disease, including influenza. According to Interior  officials, the Act also provides agencies the authority to control migratory  birds infected with avian influenza, but the officials noted that experience  has shown that such efforts are ineffective. As reported in a text on avian  influenza, humans have had and will continue to have minimal impact on  control of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in wild bird  populations.", "Use of Vaccines to Eradicate Avian  Influenza  According to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA), poultry vaccination has  been part of control or eradication programs  for avian influenza viruses in a number of  countries. Effective vaccination can decrease  transmission betw een animals by decreasing  their susceptibility to infection and reducing  the amount of virus an infected animal may  shed. Vaccination has been used in some  successful eradication campaigns for low   pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in the  United States but never for highly pathogenic  avian influenza outbreaks such as those that  occurred in 2014 and 2016, according to  USDA.  Stakeholders w e interviewed characterized  the decision to use poultry vaccines to control  and eradicate the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks  as having both scientific and economic  components. From a scientific perspective, a  vaccine needs to be able to protect against a  specific influenza virus to be effective and  merit use. In June 2015, USDA announced  that the vaccines available at the time w ere  not w ell matched to the virus that w as  infecting poultry in numerous states. As an  example of the economic implications of  vaccines, USDA also announced in June  2015 that significant trading partners had  indicated that, if USDA began vaccinating,  they w ould ban all U.S. poultry and egg  exports until they could complete a risk  assessment. For these and other reasons,  USDA decided against using vaccines.  USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service  continues to develop enhanced vaccines for  use in poultry against avian influenza. A 2014  USDA report concluded the poultry industry  needs highly effective vaccines that can  prevent transmission and that can be mass- delivered in w ater, in eggs, or in feed.", "Although federal agencies are unlikely to control avian influenza viruses  in wild birds, they can monitor the viruses circulating in this population.  Specifically, USDA, Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, and state and tribal agencies collaborated on a national  program for wild bird surveillance that sampled more than 283,000 wild  birds from April 2006 through March 2011, when the program ended.  The federal effort resumed in December 2014 in response to the  outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza on the West Coast of  North America. In response to the outbreaks, personnel from USDA and  Interior re-convened the Interagency Wild Bird Avian Influenza Steering  Committee in January 2015. The Steering Committee developed a wild  bird surveillance plan for avian influenzas that may pose a threat to  human health or domestic poultry. The plan encourages federal and  state agencies and others to use a variety of sampling methods to test  live and dead wild birds for avian influenza. According to data recorded as  of March 24, 2017, the surveillance program had collected test results  from more than 88,000 wild birds since December 2014. The data for that  time period show that the program detected 102 cases (about 0.12  percent) of highly pathogenic avian influenza from the same lineage that  caused the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks in the United States (see app. II for  details on the results of this surveillance program). On the other hand,  monthly detection rates for low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses in  wild birds were often above 10 percent for those tested. According to  USDA and Interior officials, continued monitoring of wild birds will help  identify the presence of avian influenza subtypes and help agencies to  mitigate the persistent challenge that wild birds pose to domesticated  poultry. The state veterinarians we interviewed from California, Indiana,  Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio generally agreed with the  need for wildlife surveillance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliance on Voluntary Actions by a Wide Range of Poultry Producers to Prevent Flocks from Avian Influenza Infections Is a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to ensure routine biosecurity and prevent poultry flocks  from becoming infected with avian influenza face an ongoing challenge  because these efforts depend on voluntary actions by a wide range of  poultry producers. While USDA\u2019s approach to addressing this challenge  varies for different types of poultry producers, such as those who manage  large commercial operations and those who manage small backyard  flocks, the approach primarily relies on using incentives and education to  promote voluntary actions.", "According to USDA officials, state stakeholders, and poultry industry  representatives we interviewed, sound biosecurity practices are important  for all types of poultry facilities. This is also evident from the 2014 and  2016 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which affected large  commercial and small backyard flocks, including turkeys, laying hens, and  ducks. USDA found that lapses in routine preventative biosecurity allowed  the initial introduction of disease and enabled it to spread from farm to  farm. To gather information on biosecurity practices, USDA analyzed self- assessments completed by 850 poultry producers on the status of their  biosecurity practices. While large producers generally indicated more  frequently than small producers that they had certain practices in place,  the nongeneralizable data showed that important practices were not  consistently in place. For example, less than 60 percent of respondents  had biosecurity officers or training in place. According to USDA\u2019s self- assessment document, biosecurity officers and training could help reduce  the threat of infection by improving biosecurity practices. Similarly, less  than 60 percent of respondents had delineated lines of separation in their  facilities to reduce the risk of contamination. Lines of separation are  intended to reduce the risk that contaminated materials come into contact  with poultry. In addition, less than 60 percent of respondents said that  they had practices in place for personnel to shower or change into clean  clothes immediately prior to arriving at a poultry site, or upon arrival, to  reduce the risk of introducing an avian influenza virus.", "While USDA can impose biosecurity measures during its response to an  emergency, the agency does not have the authority to require producers  to routinely employ preventative biosecurity measures. Instead, USDA  relies on producers to take voluntary action to prevent the introduction of  avian influenza and other diseases. Toward that end, USDA recently  initiated two interrelated efforts\u2014independent of the corrective action  program described above\u2014that may help overcome this challenge  among commercial farms. In addition, USDA has continued its efforts,  through public education and outreach, to encourage backyard poultry  farmers to practice biosecurity.", "USDA\u2019s first initiative to improve biosecurity involves linking producers\u2019  eligibility  for indemnity payments to a biosecurity plan. Specifically, USDA  issued an interim rule in February 2016 requiring large poultry producers  seeking indemnity payments in the future to provide a statement that, at  the time highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in their facilities,  they had in place and were following a written biosecurity plan to address  the potential spread of the virus. According to USDA officials, this  regulatory change provides a strong incentive to members of the poultry  industry to have a biosecurity plan in place. As of February 2017, USDA  continues to operate under the interim rule issued in February 2016.", "The second and related initiative concerns changes to the National  Poultry Improvement Plan. According to USDA officials, poultry industry  representatives who commented on the interim indemnity rulemaking  suggested that the agency use the National Poultry Improvement Plan to  promote biosecurity. The improvement plan is a voluntary program  administered by USDA under which participating commercial poultry  flocks are tested to ensure they are free from diseases, including H5 and  H7 subtypes of avian influenza. If a flock tests negative for avian  influenza, USDA certifies to trading partners and others that the flock is  free of the disease. In September 2016, delegates to the program\u2014who  included poultry industry representatives\u2014gave interim approval to add a  set of 14 biosecurity principles to the plan\u2019s national program standards.  The biosecurity principles call for, among other things, training poultry  producers about biosecurity; taking steps to protect against infection from  wild birds, rodents, and insects; cleaning vehicles and equipment to  reduce risk; and managing manure and litter to prevent the exposure of  susceptible poultry to disease agents. Those principles would apply to the  poultry producers who participate in the program; according to USDA  officials, most commercial poultry producers participate. According to  USDA officials, these initiatives will encourage commercial producers to  adopt preventative biosecurity measures.", "Commercial poultry flocks may also be raised outdoors and thus are at  greater risk of contact with wild birds infected with avian influenza. For  example, turkeys and chickens must have access to outdoor space to be  certified by USDA as organically raised. Organically raised poultry are a  rapidly growing segment of the industry, according to USDA documents.  Stakeholders told us that they were concerned that producers of  organically raised poultry do not have to follow the same biosecurity  principle\u2014namely, keeping birds indoors\u2014that producers of conventional  poultry are encouraged to follow. USDA has acknowledged that  organically raised birds are at a greater risk than birds raised indoors.  USDA\u2019s policy is that if it is determined that temporary confinement of  birds is needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of organic flocks,  then producers and certifiers may work together to determine an  appropriate method and duration of confinement of such flocks without a  loss of organic certification.", "Stakeholders we interviewed told us backyard poultry flocks are a  concern for contracting and spreading avian influenzas to commercial  poultry because these flocks are raised outdoors and are more likely to  come into contact with wild birds. According to USDA\u2019s website, raising  backyard poultry is a growing trend across the United States. USDA  manages the \u201cBiosecurity for Birds\u201d campaign to help raise awareness  among backyard, hobby, and pet bird owners about the risks of avian  influenza. The biosecurity principles that USDA promotes to backyard  poultry producers include separating the domesticated flock from other  birds, including game birds and wild waterfowl, because the latter can  carry disease.

Pandemic  influenza vaccines may be manufactured using several technologies. To  date, the most commonly used technology has relied on fertilized eggs as  a raw material. According to HHS officials, 90 to 95 percent of the  current national stockpile of pandemic influenza vaccines is derived from  eggs. According to an HHS official, the agency has a stockpile of egg- based and cell-based pre-pandemic influenza vaccines supplied by four  companies. Of the four companies, however, only one has an egg-based  vaccine manufacturing facility in the United States. If an influenza  pandemic is declared, according to this official, the U.S. government may  not be able to rely on foreign countries to allow exports of pandemic  vaccine because each country will likely prioritize those vaccines for its  own population.

To  address that risk, HHS has contracted with the company to protect the  egg supply chain and ensure a year-round supply of vaccine-quality  fertilized eggs for the company to use in its vaccine manufacturing  process. HHS awarded the current 3-year, $42 million contract for a year- round supply of eggs in September 2014. The contract requires that the  company have a risk management plan; the company\u2019s plan contains  both a physical security program and a biosecurity program to provide  protection against man-made and natural threats.", "HHS officials said they are confident that the company\u2019s biosecurity  program is sound. According to company representatives, the company  mitigates risks by limiting the density of the birds on each farm and by  using farms that are not in close proximity. In addition, company  employees routinely audit the flocks and incubation facilities, and the  company periodically tests the flocks of layer hens for avian influenza  using USDA\u2019s National Poultry Improvement Plan testing procedures.  Furthermore, according to HHS officials, the agency conducts annual  security audits of a portion of the facilities in the company\u2019s network.", "According to company representatives, the company has standard  operating procedures for biosecurity in its network of egg suppliers that  are based on state department of agriculture guidelines. Company  representatives said that because the company contracts with its  suppliers and can require specific conditions, it has more control over  what is done on the farms and in the incubation facilities than it does with  farms that only comply with either USDA or state agriculture department  requirements.

However, the  agencies face the issue that funding for a voluntary surveillance program  will be exhausted in fiscal year 2017. According to HHS officials, this  surveillance program is the only federal source of data for understanding  the types of influenza circulating in swine. Because influenza is endemic  in swine worldwide, swine producers are not required to report the  disease to USDA, and USDA is not required to report swine influenza to  the World Organisation for Animal Health. However, since 2009, when  H1N1 swine-origin influenza caused a global human pandemic, USDA  has used funding from HHS to collect voluntary data from the U.S. swine  industry on the incidence of swine influenza. As we reported in May  2013, there are limitations in the reliability of the data collected by this  voluntary program; in particular, it may not accurately represent all of the  conditions circulating across the country. Nevertheless, this program  has provided useful data on the presence of various subtypes of influenza  virus in swine herds, according to HHS and USDA officials. Moreover,  representatives from the pork industry we interviewed stated the  surveillance data are beneficial to both public and animal health.  However, according to USDA officials, funding for the swine surveillance  program is expected to be fully expended in fiscal year 2017. USDA  officials said that the agency will once again seek additional funding for  the program in fiscal year 2018 and beyond, through appropriated  funding, but that funding beyond fiscal year 2017 is uncertain. In addition,  the U.S. Animal Health Association provided support for the program\u2019s  continuation through a 2016 resolution asking Congress to appropriate  funding for the swine surveillance program; furthermore, according to its  representative, the National Pork Producers Council has advocated for  continued funding for the program. According to HHS officials, the agency  will continue to be supportive of USDA\u2019s efforts to continue the program.  It is too early to say whether USDA will continue to gather data on  influenza in swine beyond fiscal year 2017."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has taken important steps to mitigate the  significant risks posed by avian influenza to the health of humans,  animals, and the economy. However, experience in the United States and  around the world has shown that it is challenging to protect domesticated  poultry from infection and control the disease when it does strike. USDA  proactively identified numerous lessons learned, across a wide range of  response areas, from the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks of avian influenza,  and it identified more than 300 associated corrective actions. USDA has  marked as completed about 70 percent of these actions, but it does not  have plans for evaluating the extent to which its completed corrective  actions have effectively helped to resolve the problems the agency  identified in its responses to the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks. By developing  a plan for evaluating completed corrective actions and, as part of this  plan, considering whether any completed corrective actions require  validation through simulations or exercises, USDA could better assess  the effectiveness of these actions. This is particularly important in light of  new outbreaks among commercial poultry in 2017 that continue to  challenge the nation\u2019s efforts to control this devastating disease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator  of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to develop a plan for  evaluating completed corrective actions to determine their effectiveness  and, as appropriate, consider whether any completed corrective actions  require validation through simulations or exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA, HHS, and Interior for review  and comment.

The  steering committee developed a wild bird surveillance plan for avian  influenzas that may pose a threat to human health or domestic poultry.  The plan encourages federal and state agencies and others to use a  variety of sampling methods to test live and dead wild birds to detect both  low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza. According to data  recorded as of March 24, 2017, the surveillance program had collected  test results from more than 88,000 wild birds since December 2014. The  number of monthly highly pathogenic avian influenza detections was  highest during the period from December 2014 through June 2015 before  declining during the period from July 2015 through March 24, 2017,  despite an increase in testing over this period of time. In total, the  program detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in 102 birds, or 0.12  percent of those tested. (See table 8 for a summary of the monitoring  data.) The surveillance program also detected low pathogenic influenza A  virus in some wild birds; program data show that the percentage of wild  duck samples that tested positive for low pathogenic influenza A virus in  each month ranged from about 7 percent to about 30 percent in 2015 and  2016 (data not shown in table 8). The state veterinarians we interviewed  from six states (California, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, and  Ohio) generally agreed with the need for wildlife surveillance. At the same  time, while monitoring can serve as an early warning system to alert  poultry owners and public health agencies, among others, of the  presence of influenza A viruses in wild birds, it cannot eliminate wild birds  as potential sources of the virus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Mary Denigan-Macauley  (Assistant Director), Kevin Bray, Ross Campbell, Barbara El Osta, Kevin  R.
