Specifically, it has corrected or mitigated 18 of 34 weaknesses previously reported as unresolved at the time of our prior audit. For example, SEC has adequately validated electronic certificates from connections to its network, physically secured the perimeter of its operations center and put in place a process to monitor unusual and suspicious activities, and removed network system accounts and data center access rights from separating employees. In addition, the commission has made progress in improving its information security program. To illustrate, it has developed, documented, and implemented a policy on remedial action plans to ensure that deficiencies are mitigated in an effective and timely manner, and provided individuals with training for incident handling. Nevertheless, SEC has not completed actions to correct 16 previously reported weaknesses. For example, it did not adequately document access privileges granted to users of a key financial application, and did not always implement patches on vulnerable workstations and enterprise database servers. In addition to the 16 previously reported weakness that remain uncorrected, GAO identified 23 new weaknesses in controls intended to restrict access to data and systems, as well as weaknesses in other information security controls, that continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SEC's financial and sensitive information and information systems. The commission has not fully implemented effective controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized access to computing resources. For example, it did not always (1) consistently enforce strong controls for identifying and authenticating users, (2) sufficiently restrict user access to systems (3) encrypt network services, (4) audit and monitor security-relevant events for its databases, and (5) physically protect its computer resources. SEC also did not consistently ensure appropriate segregation of incompatible duties or adequately manage the configuration of its financial information systems. A key reason for these weaknesses is that the commission has not yet fully implemented its information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating as intended. Specifically, SEC has not effectively or fully implemented key program activities. For example, it has not (1) filled the vacancy for a senior agency information security officer, (2) fully reported or assessed risks, (3) sufficiently tested and evaluated the effectiveness of its information system controls, and (4) certified and accredited a key intermediary subsystem.

For example, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation has identified multiple sources of cyber  threats, including foreign nation states engaged in information warfare,  domestic criminals, hackers and virus writers, and disgruntled employees  working within an organization. Concerns about these threats are well  founded for a number of reasons, including the dramatic increase in  reports of security incidents, the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools,  and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. For example, the number of incidents reported by federal  agencies to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT), has increased dramatically over the past 3 years, increasing from  3,634 incidents reported in fiscal year 2005 to 13,029 incidents in fiscal  year 2007 (a 259 percent increase).

Recognizing the importance of securing federal agencies\u2019  information systems, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) in December 2002 to strengthen the security of  information and systems within federal agencies.

This review was performed for the purpose of  supporting the opinion developed during our audit of SEC\u2019s internal  controls over the preparation of its 2008 financial statements.", "To determine the status of SEC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previously  reported information security weaknesses, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, practices, and guidance. We  reviewed prior GAO reports to identify previously reported weaknesses  and examined the commission\u2019s corrective action plans to determine  which weaknesses it had reported were corrected. For those instances  where SEC reported that it had completed corrective actions, we assessed  the effectiveness of those actions by reviewing the appropriate documents  and interviewing the appropriate officials.", "To determine whether controls over key financial systems were effective,  we tested the effectiveness of selected information security controls. We  concentrated our evaluation primarily on the controls for financial  applications, enterprise database applications, and network  infrastructure\u2014Momentum; Phoenix; Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis,  and Retrieval (EDGAR); Fee Momentum; and the general support  system\u2014that directly or indirectly support the processing of material  transactions reflected in the agency\u2019s financial statements. Our evaluation  was based on our Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual,  which contains guidance for reviewing information system controls that  affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computerized  information.", "Using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards  and guidance and SEC\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards, we  evaluated controls by  testing the complexity and expiration of password settings on selected  servers to determine if strong password management was enforced;    analyzing users\u2019 system authorizations to determine whether users had  more permissions than necessary to perform their assigned functions;   observing methods for providing secure data transmissions across the  network to determine whether sensitive data were being encrypted;   observing whether system security software was logging successful  testing and observing physical access controls to determine if computer  facilities and resources were being protected from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft;  inspecting key servers and workstations to determine whether critical  patches had been installed or were up to date;   examining access privileges to determine whether incompatible functions  were segregated among different individuals; and   observing end user activity pertaining to the process of preparing SEC  financial statements.", "Using the requirements identified by the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  and NIST, we evaluated SEC\u2019s implementation of its security program by  reviewing SEC\u2019s risk assessment process and risk assessments for three  key systems that support the preparation of financial statements to  determine whether risks and threats were documented consistent with  federal guidance;   analyzing SEC\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards to  determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel  responsible for securing information and information systems;   analyzing security plans to determine if management, operational, and  technical controls were in place or planned and that security plans were  updated;   examining training records for personnel with significant security  responsibilities to determine if they received training commensurate with  those responsibilities;    analyzing security testing and evaluation results for three key systems to  determine whether management, operational, and technical controls were  tested at least annually and based on risk;    examining remedial action plans to determine whether they addressed  vulnerabilities identified in security testing and evaluations; and   examining contingency plans for three key systems to determine whether  those plans had been tested or updated.", "We also discussed, with key security representatives and management  officials, whether information security controls were in place, adequately  designed, and operating effectively. We conducted this audit from July  2008 to March 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
