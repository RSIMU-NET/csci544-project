This report examines, among other objectives, (1) VHA's, Medicare's, and TRICARE's claims processing timeliness; (2) factors that have impeded VHA's claims processing timeliness and community providers' experiences; and (3) VHA's recent actions and plans to improve its claims processing timeliness. GAO obtained fiscal year 2015 data on VHA's, Medicare's, and TRICARE's claims processing timeliness. GAO also visited 4 of 95 VHA claims processing locations (selected based on variation in geographic location, performance, and workload); reviewed VHA documents and 156 claims from the 4 locations; and interviewed officials from VHA, Medicare, TRICARE, and selected community providers and state hospital associations. Results from GAO's analysis cannot be generalized to all VHA claims processing locations or community providers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that veterans are provided timely and accessible health care services, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has purchased care from non-VA community providers through its care in the community programs since as early as 1945. VHA's agency-wide data show that in fiscal year 2015, it processed about 66 percent of claims within the agency's required time frame of 30 days or less, whereas data from Medicare and TRICARE (the Department of Defense's health care system) show that their contractors processed about 99 percent of claims within 30 days or less. However, VHA's data likely overstate its performance because they do not account for delays in scanning paper claims, which officials say account for approximately 60 percent of claims. GAO's analysis of 156 claims from four VHA claims processing locations indicated that it took an average of 2 weeks for VHA staff to scan paper claims into VHA's claims processing system, and GAO observed multiple bins of paper claims that had been awaiting scanning at one site for over a month. In a 2014 report, GAO recommended that VHA take action to ensure that all of its claims processing locations comply with its policy of scanning claims into VHA's claims processing system upon receipt. While VHA agreed with this recommendation and attempted to reiterate the policy through various means, GAO's more recent findings suggest that VHA did not monitor the operational effectiveness of these corrective actions. VHA officials said that they have since begun requiring managers at their claims processing locations to periodically certify in writing that all incoming paper claims have been date-stamped and scanned on the day of receipt.", "VHA officials and claims processing staff from the four locations GAO visited indicated that technology limitations, manual processes, and staffing shortages have delayed VHA's claims processing. For example, VHA's claims processing system lacks the capacity to automatically adjudicate claims. VHA staff instead must rely on manual processes, which they say delay payments to community providers. In addition, community providers and state hospital association respondents who participated in GAO's review said they had experienced various issues with VHA's claims processing system. For example, almost all providers described the administrative burden of submitting claims and related medical documentation to VHA and a lack of responsiveness from VHA's claims processing locations when the providers contacted them to follow up on claims.", "While VHA has recently implemented interim measures to address challenges that have delayed claims processing\u2014such as eliminating certain medical documentation requirements and filling staff vacancies\u2014the agency does not expect to deploy solutions to address all challenges until fiscal year 2018 or later. VHA is currently examining options for modernizing its claims processing system but has not yet communicated to Congress or other external stakeholders a sound plan that clearly addresses the components identified in past GAO work (such as a detailed schedule, estimated costs, and measures of progress). This is concerning, given VA's past failed attempts to modernize key information technology systems. While the agency expects to significantly increase its reliance on community providers to deliver care to veterans in the future, it risks losing their cooperation if it does not improve its payment timeliness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA develop a written plan for modernizing its claims processing system that includes a detailed schedule, costs, and performance measures.

However, some  VA medical facilities have faced problems with long wait times for  providing care to veterans, and others may be unable to provide certain  specialty care services. To help ensure that veterans are provided timely  and accessible care, the agency has purchased health care services from  non-VA community providers through its care in the community programs  since as early as 1945. While the eligibility requirements and types of  care purchased through the programs currently vary, in general VA  purchases community care when (1) wait times for appointments at VA  medical facilities exceed VA standards; (2) a VA medical facility is unable  to provide certain specialty care services, such as cardiology or  orthopedics; or (3) a veteran would have to travel long distances to obtain  care at a VA medical facility. Under certain circumstances, VA is also  authorized to reimburse community providers for emergency care they  deliver to veterans. When veterans obtain care from community  providers, these providers submit claims to VA for reimbursement on a  fee-for-service basis. VHA staff at 95 claims processing locations  throughout the country are responsible for processing and paying these  claims.", "VA\u2019s expenditures for its care in the community programs, the number of  veterans for whom VA has purchased care, and the number of claims  processed by VHA have all grown considerably in recent years. In fiscal  year 2015, VA obligated about $10.1 billion for care in the community for  about 1.5 million veterans. Three years earlier, in fiscal year 2012, VA  spent about $4.5 billion on care in the community for about 983,000  veterans\u2014about 50 percent fewer veterans than were served in fiscal  year 2015. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015, the number of  processed claims for VA care in the community programs increased by  about 81 percent.", "The substantial increase in utilization of VA care in the community  programs poses challenges for VHA, which has had ongoing difficulty  processing claims from community providers in a timely manner. A 2010  report by the VA Office of the Inspector General found that VHA needed  to take action to address the timeliness of its claims processing. In 2011,  the National Academy for Public Administration described numerous  weaknesses in VHA\u2019s claims processing system, which delayed  payments to community providers. In 2014 and 2015, we reported that  some providers delivering services through VA care in the community  experienced lengthy delays (i.e., in some cases, months or years)  receiving payment on their claims.  During a June 3, 2015 hearing of the  House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs\u2019 Subcommittee on Health, several  witnesses testified about VHA\u2019s continued lack of timeliness in paying  claims for VA care in the community services. The VA Budget and Choice  Improvement Act required VHA to develop a plan for consolidating its VA  care in the community programs (of which there are currently about 10),  and VHA submitted this plan to Congress on October 30, 2015. As part  of this plan, VHA said it would examine potential strategies for improving  the timeliness and accuracy of its payments to community providers.", "The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice  Act) included a provision for us to report to Congress about the timeliness  of VA\u2019s payments for claims submitted by community providers when  veterans access care outside the VA health care system, and to compare  the timeliness of VA\u2019s payments to community providers to the timeliness  of payments providers receive from Medicare and TRICARE, the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) health care system. In February 2016,  we presented preliminary observations from this work at a hearing of the  House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs\u2019 Subcommittee on Health. This  report examines:  1.  similarities and differences between VHA\u2019s, Medicare\u2019s, and  TRICARE\u2019s systems for processing health care claims;  2.  how VHA\u2019s claims processing timeliness in fiscal year 2015 compared  to Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s, and whether these entities pay interest  penalties on late payments;  3.  the factors that have impeded the timeliness of VHA\u2019s claims  4.  providers\u2019 experiences with VHA\u2019s claims processing; and  5.

We also interviewed officials from the  contractor that is responsible for processing all TRICARE claims and  officials from 1 of the 16 contractors that are responsible for processing  Medicare claims.", "To examine how VHA\u2019s claims processing timeliness compared to  Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s, and whether these entities pay interest on  late claims, we reviewed applicable policies, interviewed agency officials,  and obtained fiscal year 2015 data on claims processing timeliness.  Agency officials reported to us the amounts that VHA, CMS, and DHA  spent in fiscal year 2014 for interest penalties paid on late payments to  providers. The claims processing timeliness data we obtained provided  information on the percentage of paid and denied claims in fiscal year  2015 that met each agency\u2019s claims processing timeliness requirements.  To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed knowledgeable  agency officials about their respective data sources and methods for  collecting data. We found CMS\u2019s and DHA\u2019s data to be sufficiently reliable  for reporting Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s claims processing timeliness in  fiscal year 2015. However, as we discuss in this report, we determined  that VHA\u2019s timeliness data had limitations. As there were no other data  available from VHA, we used these data for making comparisons to  Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s claims processing timeliness in fiscal year  2015, but we also note the limitations of VHA\u2019s data in making the  comparisons.", "To examine factors that have impeded the timeliness of VHA\u2019s claims  processing and payment, we used VHA data on the timeliness of  payments for claims that were processed between February 2014 and  February 2015\u2014the most recent data that were available when we began  our study\u2014to select a non-random sample of four VHA claims processing  locations where we conducted site visits in May and June 2015. (See  table 1.)", "At each of these four sites, we interviewed managers and staff  responsible for claims processing and reviewed documentation  associated with a non-random sample of approximately 20 inpatient  claims and 20 outpatient claims that were paid between February 2014  and February 2015. We reviewed documentation for 156 claims in all  and interviewed managers or staff at the four VHA claims processing  locations to identify factors affecting the timeliness of payments for these  claims. To assess the reliability of VHA\u2019s data on claims that were paid  between February 2014 and February 2015, we interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials, manually reviewed the content of the  claims data, and electronically tested the data for missing values, outliers,  and obvious errors. We concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable  for selecting the samples of VHA claims we reviewed. Because the claims  processing locations and samples of claims we reviewed at each location  were not selected to be representative, we cannot generalize our findings  to all VHA claims processing locations or to all claims for VA care in the  community programs.", "To gather information about community providers\u2019 experiences with  obtaining payments for their VA care in the community claims, we (1)  interviewed officials from a non-random sample of 12 community  providers that had submitted claims to the four VHA claims processing  locations we visited and (2) collected written statements from 12 state  hospital associations, which collectively represent the views of at least  117 different hospitals or health care systems. We selected the non- random sample of community providers we interviewed from among the  providers that had submitted the most claims between February 2014 and  February 2015 to the four VHA claims processing locations we visited.  Because the community providers and state hospital associations that  participated in our review were not selected to be representative, we  cannot generalize our findings to all providers participating in VA care in  the community programs.", "To examine VHA\u2019s recent actions and plans to improve its claims  processing and payment timeliness for VA care in the community, we  reviewed relevant VA and VHA documentation and interviewed VHA  officials.

Previously, VISNs and  medical facilities were responsible for managing both their own budgets  for VA care in the community and the staff who processed these claims.  After this transition, VHA\u2019s Chief Business Office for Purchased Care  became responsible for overseeing VA\u2019s budget for care in the  community programs and more than 2,000 staff working at 95 claims  processing locations nationwide.", "The Choice Act also expressed the sense of Congress that VA shall  comply with the Prompt Payment Act\u2019s implementing regulations (or any  corresponding similar regulation or ruling) when paying for health care  pursuant to contracts entered into with community providers. Generally,  these regulations require executive branch agencies to add interest  penalties to payments made to vendors after the contractually established  payment date, or 30 days after the date the agencies receive a proper  invoice, if the contract specifies no due date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of VA Care in the Community Services, Reimbursement Rates, and Medical Documentation Requirements", "paragraphs": ["VHA has numerous programs through which it purchases VA care in the  community services. As described in a recent independent assessment of  VHA\u2019s health care system, which was mandated by the Choice Act, these  programs offer different types of services, have varying eligibility criteria  for veterans and community providers, and establish different rules  governing payment rates. In addition, for all types of VA care in the  community services except individually authorized outpatient care,  community providers must include medical documentation with the claims  they submit to VHA or its third party administrators (TPA). (See appendix  I for a side-by-side comparison of various features of these VA care in the  community programs.) In what follows we describe the primary ways VHA  purchases care in the community services, the applicable payment rates,  and the extent to which VHA requires community providers to submit  medical documentation as a condition of claims payment.", "Individually authorized care. The primary means by which VHA has  traditionally purchased care from community providers is through  individual authorizations. When a veteran cannot access a particular  specialty care service from a VA medical facility\u2014either because the  service is not offered or the veteran would have to travel a long  distance to obtain it from a VA medical facility\u2014the veteran\u2019s VA  clinician may request an individual authorization for the veteran to  obtain the service from a community provider. If this request is  approved and the veteran is able to find a community provider who is  willing to accept VA payment, VA will pay the provider on a fee-for- service basis. Generally, VA pays Medicare\u2019s applicable rates for  these services, unless the community provider has an existing  contract and negotiated rates with a VA medical facility. For  individually authorized inpatient care, VHA requires community  providers to submit discharge summaries, at a minimum, as a  condition of payment. For individually authorized outpatient care, the  authorization itself states whether the community provider must  submit any medical documentation as a condition of payment.", "Emergency care. When care in the community is not preauthorized,  VA may reimburse community providers for two different types of  emergency care: 1) emergency care for a condition related to a  veteran\u2019s service-connected disability and 2) emergency care for a  condition not related to a veteran\u2019s service-connected disability. The  latter care is commonly referred to as Millennium Act emergency  care.", "For service-connected emergency care, VA generally pays applicable  Medicare rates, unless the community provider has an existing  contract and negotiated rates with a VA medical facility. For  Millennium Act emergency care, VA generally pays the lesser of the  amount for which the veteran is personally liable (if a third party such  as motor vehicle insurance or workers\u2019 compensation insurance first  paid for some portion of the care) or 70 percent of applicable  Medicare rates. For claims for both types of emergency care,  community providers are required to submit accompanying medical  documentation, so that clinicians at VHA\u2019s claims processing locations  can determine whether or not the condition treated is related to the  veteran\u2019s service-connected disability and whether it meets the  prudent layperson standard of an emergency. (See appendix II for a  more detailed description of the criteria that must be met before VHA  will pay claims for these two types of emergency care.)", "Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3). In September 2013, VA  awarded contracts to two TPAs to develop regional networks of  community providers of specialty care, mental health care, limited  emergency care, and maternity and limited newborn care when such  care is not feasibly available from a VA medical facility. VA and the  TPAs began implementing the PC3 program in October 2013, and it  was fully implemented nationwide as of April 2014. In August 2014,  VA expanded the PC3 program to allow community providers of  primary care to join the networks. PC3 is a program VA created under  existing statutory authorities, not a program specifically enacted by  law. To be eligible to obtain care from PC3 providers, veterans must  meet the same criteria that are required for individually authorized VA  care in the community services.", "When they join the PC3 networks, community providers agree to be  reimbursed at rates they negotiate with the TPAs, which are  reportedly a percentage of applicable Medicare rates. As a condition  of their contracts with VA, the two TPAs are required to collect  medical documentation from the community providers and return it to  VA in a timely manner. Upon receipt, staff at VA facilities are  responsible for scanning the associated medical documentation and  entering it into the veteran\u2019s VA electronic health record so that it is  available for VA clinicians to view.", "Veterans Choice Program. The Choice Act provides, among other  things, temporary authority and funding for veterans to obtain health  care services from community providers to address long wait times,  lengthy travel distances, or other challenges accessing care at a VA  medical facility. Under this authority, VHA introduced the Veterans  Choice Program in November 2014. As stated in VA\u2019s December  2015 guidance, the program currently allows eligible veterans to  obtain health care services from community providers if the veteran  meets any of the following criteria:  the next available medical appointment with a VA provider is more  than 30 days from the veteran\u2019s preferred date or the date the  veteran\u2019s physician determines he or she should be seen; the veteran lives more than 40 miles driving distance from the  nearest VA facility with a full-time primary care physician;  the veteran needs to travel by air, boat, or ferry to the VA facility  that is closest to his or her home;  the veteran faces an unusual or excessive burden in traveling to a  VA facility based on geographic challenges, environmental  factors, or a medical condition;   the veteran\u2019s specific health care needs, including the nature and  frequency of care needed, warrants participation in the program;  or  the veteran lives in a state or territory without a full-service VA  medical facility.", "To administer the Veterans Choice Program, VHA modified its contracts  with the two TPAs it selected to administer the PC3 program.

FBCS does not automatically apply relevant criteria and determine  whether claims are eligible for payment. Rather, staff at VHA\u2019s claims  processing locations must make determinations about which payment  authority applies to each claim and which claims meet applicable  administrative and clinical criteria for payment. (See table 2 for a  description of these steps.)

For example\u2014even  though paper claims account for a relatively small proportion of the overall  number of claims submitted by Medicare and TRICARE providers\u2014 Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s claims processors must scan incoming paper  claims and verify that information from the claims was captured  accurately when the claims were scanned, just as staff at VHA\u2019s claims  processing locations must do. In addition, like VHA, Medicare\u2019s and  TRICARE\u2019s claims processors send notifications to providers after claims  have been processed, to inform them of whether payments were  approved or denied for each service listed on the claim.", "Even though these three agencies follow similar steps to process claims,  the volume of claims that the agencies process varies widely, and the  actual systems they use to carry out these steps differ markedly in  several key respects. (For a summary of selected similarities and  differences between VHA\u2019s, Medicare\u2019s, and TRICARE\u2019s systems for  processing health care claims, see appendix IV.) Based on our review of  applicable documentation and interviews with officials from CMS, DHA,  and two contractors that process Medicare and TRICARE claims, we  identified the following key differences between VHA\u2019s claims processing  system and those of Medicare and TRICARE. These key differences  are described below.", "Use of contractors. Unlike VHA, which employs its own staff to  process claims for VA care in the community services, both Medicare  and TRICARE use contractors to process claims for care purchased  from community providers. CMS uses contractors called Medicare  Administrative Contractors (MAC) to process claims for health care  items and services. For TRICARE, DHA contracts with three managed  care support contractors (MCSC), which are responsible for  establishing regional networks of civilian providers, managing  referrals, and providing customer service, among other things. To pay  claims submitted by TRICARE\u2019s network providers, the three MCSCs  have each subcontracted with a single claims processing contractor.", "Number of claims processing locations. Contractors responsible  for processing Medicare and TRICARE claims operate in fewer  locations than do staff at VHA\u2019s claims processing locations. Most  Medicare Part A and Part B claims are processed by one of 12  jurisdiction-based MACs or 4 MACs that specialize in processing  durable medical equipment claims, and all TRICARE claims are  processed by a single contractor. In contrast, VHA employed claims  processing staff in 95 different locations as of November 2015, and  community providers in a given state may submit claims to multiple  VHA claims processing locations depending on the type of VA care in  the community and where they render services. As we have reported  previously, CMS established its current regional model for MACs in  2006 to improve services to beneficiaries and providers and achieve  operational efficiencies and cost savings by better balancing claims  processing workloads among fewer contractors than it had used in the  past. Prior to that time, there were 51 contractors responsible for  processing Medicare claims.", "Rate of electronic claim submission and the capacity to accept  medical documentation electronically. While VHA\u2019s, Medicare\u2019s,  and TRICARE\u2019s claims processing systems can all accept claims  submitted by providers electronically, the rate of electronic submission  is much higher in Medicare and TRICARE. According to CMS and  DHA officials, the vast majority of Medicare and TRICARE claims are  submitted electronically. The officials said that providers submit about  99 percent of Medicare Part A claims, 98 percent of Medicare Part B  claims, and between 91 and 95 percent of TRICARE claims  electronically. In contrast, according to VHA officials, about 40 percent  of claims from providers participating in VA care in the community are  submitted electronically. In addition, Medicare and TRICARE  contractors\u2019 systems can accept medical documentation  electronically, unlike VHA\u2019s claims processing system. VHA\u2019s inability  to accept medical documentation electronically discourages  community providers from submitting claims electronically because  VHA cannot process many types of VA care in the community claims  until medical documentation is received. Given the high rates of  electronic submission of claims and medical documentation among  Medicare and TRICARE providers, the Medicare and TRICARE  contractors do not need to devote as many staff resources to  scanning paper claims and medical documentation and verifying that  information was captured accurately as do VHA\u2019s claims processing  locations.", "Prior authorization. Unless services delivered by community  providers meet the coverage criteria for one of VHA\u2019s two emergency  care programs, all VA care in the community services must be  authorized in advance of when veterans access the care in order for  claims to be paid. Medicare, on the other hand, generally does not  require prior authorization for the services it covers, and TRICARE  generally only requires prior authorization for specialty care  services.", "Automatic claim adjudication. Compared to VHA\u2019s system, the  claims processing systems used in Medicare and TRICARE are more  automated. While staff at VHA\u2019s claims processing locations must  manually apply administrative and clinical criteria to every claim to  determine whether the claims should be paid, officials from the  Medicare and TRICARE contractors we interviewed described their  organizations\u2019 high degrees of automatic claim adjudication. Medicare  officials estimated that the MACs process about 95 percent of claims  with no manual intervention, while officials from the contractor  responsible for processing TRICARE claims estimated that their  organization has automated about 75 percent of the claims  adjudication process.", "Medical documentation as a condition of payment. While VHA  requires providers to submit medical documentation for most types of  claims for VA care in the community services, Medicare and  TRICARE do not. According to CMS and DHA officials, Medicare and  TRICARE providers are only required to submit medical  documentation for a small percentage of claims, such as those  flagged during a prepayment review for an examination of medical  necessity.", "Web-based provider self-service portals. Unlike VHA, Medicare  and TRICARE contractors both offer Web-based provider self-service  portals. Officials from both of the Medicare and TRICARE contractors  we interviewed said that their organizations had established Web- based provider self-service portals, which officials told us have  decreased providers\u2019 reliance on telephone-based customer service.  With these portals, providers are able to access information about the  status of their claims 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In contrast,  VHA\u2019s claims processing locations only offer telephone-based  provider customer service.", "Dedicated customer service staff. Unlike VHA, Medicare and  TRICARE have dedicated customer service staff. The two Medicare  and TRICARE contractors each maintain units with dedicated  customer service staff, while staff in other units focus on claims  processing. Officials from the two contractors said that within their  customer service units, certain individuals are designated to handle  calls from providers with more specialized, complex inquiries, while  others focus on calls from providers who are inquiring about more  routine issues.

According to CMS  and DHA officials, the vast majority of Medicare and TRICARE claims are  submitted electronically.", "However, the difference between VHA\u2019s claims processing timeliness and  that of Medicare and TRICARE is likely greater than what VHA\u2019s available  data indicate. Specifically, VHA\u2019s data likely overstate the agency\u2019s claims  processing timeliness because they do not account for delays in scanning  paper claims, and VHA officials told us that paper claims account for  approximately 60 percent of claims for VA care in the community  services. VHA\u2019s policy states that determinations of claims processing  timeliness should be based upon the date the claim is received, but  VHA\u2019s systems can only calculate timeliness on the basis of the date the  claim is entered into FBCS. When community providers submit paper  claims, VHA policy requires claims processing staff to manually date- stamp them and scan the paper claims into FBCS on the date of receipt.  Because FBCS cannot electronically read the dates that are manually  stamped on paper claims, the scan date becomes the date used to  calculate claims processing timeliness. To the extent that paper claims  are not scanned into FBCS upon receipt, this elapsed time is not reflected  in VHA\u2019s timeliness calculations.", "Our review raises questions about whether staff at VHA\u2019s claims  processing locations are following the agency\u2019s policy for scanning paper  claims into FBCS upon receipt. We do not know the extent of delays in  scanning paper claims at all of VHA\u2019s claims processing locations.  However, our analysis of the non-generalizable sample of 156 claims for  VA care in the community services from the four VHA claims processing  locations we visited suggests that it may have taken about 2 weeks, on  average, for staff to scan the paper claims in our sample into FBCS. This  estimate is based on the number of days that elapsed between the dates  that community providers created 86 of the 94 paper claims in our sample  and the dates the claims were scanned into FBCS. Based on this  analysis, we found that the number of days between the creation date  and the scanned date for the paper claims in our sample ranged from 2  days to 90 days.", "Our observations at one claims processing location we visited were  consistent with our analysis of the sampled claims. For example, we  observed about a dozen bins of paper claims and medical documentation  waiting to be scanned, and some of these bins were labeled with dates  indicating they were received by the claims processing location about a  month before our visit. Additionally, this claims processing location was  the only one of the four claims processing locations we visited that  manually date-stamped all of its paper claims upon receipt. Staff at  another claims processing location told us that they only date-stamp  paper claims for emergency care upon receipt because these claims are  only eligible for payment if they have been received within a certain  amount of time after the date of service. However, the staff said they do  not date-stamp non-emergency care claims because to do so would be  too time-consuming. Staff at the other two claims processing locations  told us that they did not date-stamp any claims.", "These findings from the four claims processing locations we visited for  this review are consistent with the claims processing deficiencies we  identified in our 2014 report on the implementation of the Millennium Act  emergency care benefit. Specifically, we found that the VHA claims  processing locations we reviewed for the 2014 report were rarely date- stamping incoming paper claims and were not promptly scanning a  significant percentage of the paper claims we reviewed into FBCS. In our  report, we recommended that VHA implement measures to ensure that all  incoming claims are date-stamped and scanned into FBCS on the date of  receipt, and VA agreed with our recommendations. Soon after we issued  our 2014 report, VHA reiterated its date-stamping and scanning policies  on national calls with managers responsible for claims processing, posted  articles in its biweekly bulletin for managers and staff, and conducted  online training for staff that communicated the importance of date- stamping and promptly scanning claims. However, the observations from  our most recent review of a new sample of claims at four other claims  processing locations suggest that VHA had not monitored the operational  effectiveness of their corrective actions to address our recommendation.  VHA officials said that when they became aware of our more recent  findings, they began requiring managers at their claims processing  locations to periodically certify in writing that all incoming paper claims  have been date-stamped and scanned on the day of receipt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unlike Medicare and TRICARE, VHA Has Historically Not Paid Interest Penalties on Most Late Payments to Community Providers but Recently Changed This Policy", "paragraphs": ["Prior to October 2015, VHA did not pay interest penalties on most late  payments to community providers, while Medicare and TRICARE have  done so. Specifically, until October 2015, VHA paid no interest on claims  it paid late for community care delivered by non-contract providers  through individual authorizations. According to VHA officials, the agency  had not paid interest penalties on these individually authorized services  because VA did not interpret the Prompt Payment Act as applying to  these payments. However, in October 2015, VA\u2019s Office of General  Counsel issued a new legal opinion specifying that the Prompt Payment  Act does apply to claims for VA care in the community services that were  (1) individually authorized in advance, or (2) delivered by community  providers who have contracted with the TPAs to participate in Veterans  Choice Program networks. Since then, from October 2, 2015 through  November 21, 2015, VHA paid approximately $409,000 in interest  penalties on claims for this care, according to VHA officials.", "To facilitate interest penalty payments on claims for individually  authorized VA care in the community services, VHA established a  process to automatically pay the penalties when these claims are paid  more than 30 days after receipt. However, as we noted earlier in this  report, paper claims that officially meet VHA\u2019s timeliness standard could  have been in VHA\u2019s possession weeks before being scanned into FCBS,  so VHA may not be paying interest on all claims that are paid more than  30 days after the claims were actually received. This issue will likely  persist until VHA ensures that all incoming paper claims are date- stamped and scanned into FBCS on the date of receipt, as we  recommended in 2014.", "While VHA has not historically paid interest penalties on claims that are  paid late, Medicare and TRICARE officials said their agencies have for  many years considered the care provided under their programs to be  subject to the Prompt Payment Act. In fiscal year 2014, CMS reported it  paid about $3.3 million in interest penalties to Medicare providers (with  overall payments for fee-for-service Medicare services totaling $357.3  billion), and DHA reported it paid about $386,000 in interest penalties to  TRICARE providers (with overall payments for TRICARE services totaling  about $10.5 billion). For both Medicare and TRICARE, the sum of  interest penalties\u2014relative to overall expenditures for services\u2014was  relatively low in fiscal year 2014 because these programs generally paid  providers in a timely manner.

These  identified limitations are described in more detail below.", "VHA cannot accept medical documentation electronically. While  VHA has the capacity to accept claims from community providers and  the TPAs electronically, it does not have the capacity to accept  medical documentation electronically from the providers and TPAs.  As a result, this documentation must be scanned into FBCS, which  delays claims processing, according to VHA staff. Although VHA  policy requires VHA staff to promptly scan paper claims into FBCS  when received, delays can occur because staff do not have time to  scan the high volume of claims and medical documentation received  each day, and the capacity of scanning equipment is limited. For  example, VHA staff at one claims processing location we visited told  us that on Mondays (their heaviest day for mail since they do not  receive mail on weekends), they do not scan any incoming claims with  accompanying medical documentation. Instead, they generally scan  only claims that do not have accompanying medical documentation on  Mondays and then scan claims with accompanying medical  documentation into FBCS on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. In some  cases, the medical documentation community providers must submit  can be extensive, which may further delay its entry into FBCS.  Officials from one community health care system told us that the  medical documentation they submit with claims can be between 25 to  75 pages for each patient. With most types of claims requiring medical  documentation, staff at VHA\u2019s claims processing locations may need  to scan a significant number of pages of incoming medical  documentation each day.", "Authorizations for VA care in the community services are not  always readily available in FBCS. Staff at three of the four VHA  claims processing locations we visited told us that processing and  payment can also be delayed when authorizations for VA care in the  community services are unavailable in FBCS. Before a veteran  obtains services from a community provider, staff at a VA medical  facility must indicate in the veteran\u2019s VA electronic health record (a  system separate from FBCS) that the services have been authorized,  and then these staff must manually create an authorization in FBCS.  However, VHA officials and staff told us that these authorizations are  sometimes unavailable in FBCS at the time claims are processed,  which delays processing and payment. The authorizations are  unavailable because either (1) they have been electronically  suspended in FBCS, and as a result staff at the VA medical facility  that authorized the care must release them before any associated  claims can be paid, or (2) the estimated date of service on the  authorization does not match the date that services were actually  rendered, and new authorizations must be entered by staff at the  authorizing VA medical facility before the claims can be paid.", "In our non-generalizable sample of 156 claims, 25 claims were  delayed in being processed because an authorization was not initially  available in FBCS, resulting in an average delay of approximately 42  days in claims processing. Additionally, 8 of the 12 community  providers we interviewed said they were aware that some of their  payments had been delayed because authorizations were not  available in FBCS when their claims arrived at the VHA claims  processing location.", "FBCS cannot automatically adjudicate claims. FBCS cannot  automatically adjudicate claims, and as a result, VHA staff must do so  manually, which VHA staff told us can slow claims processing, make  errors more likely, and delay claims payment. After information from  claims and supporting medical documentation has been scanned and  entered into FBCS, the system cannot fully adjudicate the claims  without manual intervention. For example, FBCS lacks the capability  to electronically apply relevant administrative and clinical criteria for  Millennium Act emergency care claims, such as automatically  determining whether a veteran is enrolled in the VHA health care  system and whether they had received services from a VA clinician in  the 24 months prior to accessing the emergency care. Instead, staff  processing these claims perform searches within FBCS and manually  select rejection reasons for any claims that do not meet VHA\u2019s  administrative or clinical criteria for payment.", "Among the 156 claims we reviewed at four claims processing  locations, it took an average of 47 days for claims processing staff to  determine that the claims met the administrative and clinical criteria  for payment. In addition, even after claims are approved for payment,  they require additional manual intervention before the community  providers can be paid. For example, in cases where FBCS cannot  automatically determine correct payment rates for VA care in the  community services, VHA staff manually calculate VHA\u2019s payment  rates and enter this information into FBCS. Staff we interviewed also  told us that it usually takes about 2 days for claims to return from VA\u2019s  program integrity tool, which is a system outside FBCS where claims  are routed for prepayment review of potential improper payments. If  corrections must be made after the claims return from this  prepayment review, payments can be delayed further.", "Weaknesses in FBCS and VHA\u2019s financial management systems  have also delayed claims payments. According to staff at three of  the four claims processing locations we visited, payments on some  VA care in the community claims are delayed because FBCS and  VHA\u2019s financial management systems do not permit officials to  efficiently monitor the availability of funds for VA care in the  community services. To centralize its oversight of VA care in the  community, the Choice Act directed VA to transfer the authority for  processing payments for VA care in the community from its VISNs  and VA medical centers to VHA\u2019s Chief Business Office for Purchased  Care, a change VA implemented in October 2014. However,  according to VHA officials from that office, monitoring the use of  funds\u2014at a national level\u2014has remained largely a manual process  due to limitations of FBCS and the use of separate systems to track  obligations and expenditures. According to VHA officials, VHA uses  historical data from FBCS to estimate obligations in VHA\u2019s financial  management systems on a monthly basis, and these estimates have  been unreasonably low for some services, given the unexpected  increase in utilization of VA care in the community services over the  course of fiscal year 2015. In addition, these officials said that FBCS  does not fully interface with VHA\u2019s financial management systems  used to track the availability of funds, which results in staff having to  manually record the obligations for outpatient VA care in the  community services in these systems on a monthly basis. Together,  these two issues have impeded the ability of VHA to ensure that funds  are available to pay claims for VA care in the community as they are  approved, according to VHA officials responsible for monitoring the  use of funds. We found that payments for 5 of the 156 claims we  reviewed from four claims processing locations were delayed because  of these issues, resulting in payment delays that ranged from 1 to 215  days.", "Inadequate equipment delays scanning of both paper claims and  medical documentation. VHA officials also told us that inadequate  scanning equipment delayed claims processing and adversely  affected VHA\u2019s claims payment timeliness. At the time of our review,  staff responsible for scanning paper claims and medical  documentation at one of the four claims processing locations we  visited told us that they did not have adequate scanning equipment. At  this location, the scanners that staff showed us were small enough to  be placed on desktops, while the trays for feeding documents into the  scanners could only handle a limited number of pages at one time.  With an estimated 60 percent of claims and 100 percent of medical  documentation requiring scanning, these staff said that they struggled  to keep up with the volume of paper coming in to their claims  processing location.", "Staffing shortages adversely affect claims processing timeliness.", "In addition to the technological issues described above, VHA officials  and staff also told us that staffing shortages have adversely affected  VHA\u2019s claims processing timeliness. According to VHA officials, the  overall number of authorized positions for claims processing staff did  not change after the October 2014 organizational realignment that  transferred claims processing management and oversight  responsibilities to the Chief Business Office for Purchased Care.  However, VHA officials said that VHA\u2019s claims processing workload  increased considerably over the course of fiscal years 2014 and 2015.

Almost all of the community providers we  interviewed (11 out of 12) and all of the state hospital association  respondents that participated in our review described the  administrative burden of submitting claims and medical  documentation to their respective VHA claims processing locations.  For example, one community provider told us that VHA claims only  accounted for about five percent of their business, but the provider  told us it employed one full-time staff member who was dedicated to  submitting claims to VHA and following up on unpaid ones. This same  provider employed a second full-time staff member to handle  Medicaid claims, but these accounted for about 85 percent of the  provider\u2019s business.", "According to many of the community providers that participated in our  review, obtaining payment from VHA often requires repeated  submission of claims and medical documentation. Officials from one  community provider we interviewed said that at one point, they had  been hand delivering paper medical documentation with paper copies  of the related claims to their VHA claims processing location, but VHA  staff at this location still routinely rejected their claims for a lack of  medical documentation. Similarly, six state hospital association  respondents also reported that their members\u2019 claims were often  rejected, even though they always sent medical documentation to  their VHA claims processing location by certified mail.

Community providers  who participated in our review also explained that they rarely received  written notifications from VHA about claims decisions. To inform  community providers and the TPAs about whether their claims have  been approved or rejected, staff at VHA\u2019s claims processing locations  print notices, known as preliminary fee remittance advice reports, and  mail them to the providers and TPAs. However, community  providers who participated in our study stated that they rarely received  these paper reports in the mail, and even though they received VA  payments electronically, it was not clear without the remittance advice  reports which claims the payments applied to or whether VHA denied  payment for certain line items on some claims. Unlike Medicare and  TRICARE, VHA has no online portal where community providers can  electronically check the status of their claims to find out if the claims  are awaiting processing or if VHA needs additional information to  process them.

On  March 1, 2016, VA announced that it had modified its contracts with  the TPAs so that community providers participating in the Choice  Program will no longer be required to submit medical documentation  before their VA care in the community claims can be paid. VA expects  this will expedite the processing of claims from Choice Program  providers. VHA\u2019s data indicate that the number of VA care in the  community authorizations routed to the Choice Program first  exceeded the number of authorizations for other types of VA care in  the community in November 2015, and in January 2016 (the most  recent month for which data were available) about 56 percent of VA  care in the community authorizations were routed to the Choice  Program. VHA has not eliminated the medical documentation  requirement for all other types of VA care in the community, requiring  community providers to submit medical documentation before VHA  will pay claims for (1) individually authorized inpatient VA care in the  community, (2) PC3 care, (3) Millennium Act emergency care, and (4)  service-connected emergency care. As discussed earlier in this  report, VHA\u2019s inability to electronically accept medical documentation  from most community providers and the administrative burden of  scanning a high volume of paper medical documentation have caused  delays in VHA\u2019s processing of claims for VA care in the community.", "Staffing increases.

VHA officials said they used  information gathered from this industry day to inform the development of  a draft performance work statement and a draft operations manual for a  consolidated VA care in the community program. VA publicly posted  these documents in February 2016 and accepted written comments,  questions, and other feedback from industry for about two weeks.

VA\u2019s consolidation plan represents a major undertaking that depends, in  part, on obtaining congressional approval for legislative changes and  budget requests and revamping VA\u2019s information technology systems.  Leading practices call for careful planning and for developing an  implementation strategy to help ensure that needed changes are made in  a timely and cost-effective manner. When facing major challenges similar  to the ones VHA faces to modernize its claims processing system,  leading practices call for results-oriented organizations to focus on  developing robust, comprehensive plans that (1) define the goals the  organization is seeking to accomplish, (2) identify specific activities to  obtain desired results, and (3) provide tools to help ensure accountability  and mitigate risks. In prior work, we have determined that sound plans  include the following components (among others):", "Goals, objectives, activities, and performance measures.

In 2010, VA  canceled a broad information technology improvement effort that  would have improved both of these systems and at the time was  estimated to cost between $300 million and $400 million. By  September 2, 2009 (just before the project\u2019s cancellation) VA had  already spent almost $91 million of the $300 million to $400 million  that was originally estimated. A previous initiative to modernize these  systems was underway between 1998 and 2004, but after reportedly  having spent more than $249 million on development of the  replacement system, VA discontinued the project because the pilot  system failed to support VHA\u2019s operations.", "According to VHA officials, instead of investing in administrative systems  such as the claims processing system, outpatient scheduling system,  financial management systems, or the inventory and asset management  system, VA has prioritized investments in information technology  enhancements that more directly relate to patient care. As such, VHA  officials said they have had little success in gaining approval and funding  for information technology improvements for these administrative  systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VHA\u2019s average claims processing timeliness in fiscal year 2015 was  significantly lower than Medicare\u2019s and TRICARE\u2019s timeliness and far  below its own standard of paying 90 percent of claims within 30 days. If  this situation persists, it could have very real consequences on veterans\u2019  access to care. Presently, VHA (through its TPAs), is attempting to  improve veterans\u2019 access to care by establishing a robust network of  community health providers under its VA care in the community  programs. However, absent a responsive provider customer service  component and timely payment of claims, many community providers  may opt not to participate in VA\u2019s network, thereby narrowing the choices  veterans have for seeking care from community providers. In turn, this  could lead to longer wait times for veterans to receive care and a greater  reliance on VA medical centers, some of which have already experienced  long wait times for veterans seeking care. Moreover, millions of dollars in  interest penalties resulting from the late payment of claims by VHA could  dilute the funding available for the direct delivery of care to veterans.", "To its credit, VHA has implemented several short-term initiatives intended  to address ongoing challenges and improve its timeliness in paying  community providers. These initiatives include increasing the number of  staff processing claims, purchasing new scanning equipment, holding  claims processing staff accountable through new productivity standards,  and developing a tracking system to monitor claims processing  performance. By VHA\u2019s own admission, however, these short-term  initiatives will not resolve all challenges that have long impeded its claims  processing timeliness, and many of these initiatives are not sustainable  over the longer term. VHA plans to address the remaining challenges  through its longer term effort to implement a consolidated VA care in the  community program in fiscal year 2018 or later.", "VHA\u2019s sweeping changes are likely to be costly, and to achieve the goals  of this initiative it will be important to have a high level of planning and  effective project management, and communication with multiple  stakeholders. As we have reported in prior work, VHA\u2019s plans to achieve  goals of a similar magnitude\u2014such as the modernization of its systems  for outpatient appointment scheduling, financial management, and  inventory and asset management\u2014have been derailed by weaknesses in  project management and a lack of effective oversight. Therefore, if VHA\u2019s  current initiative is to be successful, it is essential that VHA develop a  sound implementation plan and an effective project management strategy  as it proceeds. Otherwise, the agency risks spending valuable resources  on new systems and processes that may not significantly improve VHA\u2019s  claims processing timeliness. As part of its implementation plan, it is  critical that VHA identify implementation steps and develop the ability to  measure and externally communicate its progress to the Congress and  other stakeholders. It is also important that VHA be held accountable for  achieving major components of the initiative and adhering to its timeline,  as stated in its 2015 plan for consolidating VA care in the community  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help provide reasonable assurance that VHA achieves its long-term  goal of modernizing its claims processing system, the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs should direct the Under Secretary for Health to ensure  that the agency develops a sound written plan that includes the following  elements: a detailed schedule for when VHA intends to complete development  and implementation of each major aspect of its new claims processing  system;  the estimated costs for implementing each major aspect of the  system; and  the performance goals, measures, and interim milestones that VHA  will use to evaluate progress, hold staff accountable for achieving  desired results, and report to stakeholders the agency\u2019s progress in  modernizing its claims processing system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA, HHS, and DOD for comment.

The primary means by which VHA has traditionally purchased care from community providers is  through individual authorizations. When a veteran cannot access a particular specialty care service  from a VA medical facility, the veteran\u2019s VA clinician may request an individual authorization for the  veteran to obtain the service from a community provider. In addition, when care in the community is  not preauthorized, VA may purchase two different types of emergency care from community  providers: 1) emergency care for a condition that was related to a veteran\u2019s service-connected  disability and 2) emergency care for a condition not related to a veteran\u2019s service-connected  disability. The latter care is commonly referred to as Millennium Act emergency care. See Veterans  Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub. L. No. 106-117, 113 Stat.1545 (1999) (codified, as  amended at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1725) for emergency care not related to a service-connected disability. See  38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1728 for emergency care related to a service-connected disability.  Medical documentation may not be in the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS) because either (1) the  community provider has not yet submitted the documentation or because (2) staff at the VHA claims  processing location have not yet scanned it into FBCS. According to VHA officials, if a claim has been  submitted electronically and a community provider does not submit medical documentation within 45  days of the claim being suspended, FBCS will automatically reject the claim. In these cases, the  community provider must resubmit both the claim and medical documentation.  Examples of relevant administrative and clinical criteria include whether the claim met VA\u2019s timely  filing requirement, whether the veteran has other insurance or legal recourse against a third party,  and whether services were rendered beyond the point at which the veteran was stable enough to be  transferred to a VA or other federal facility.  VHA staff use FBCS to generate notifications for the community provider and veteran about whether  the claim was paid or rejected. These notifications are called preliminary fee remittance advice  reports and include a listing of claim dates and services, the reasons why payments for any services  were rejected, and the payment amounts for approved services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comparison of the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA), Medicare\u2019s, and TRICARE\u2019s Systems for Processing Claims for Health Care Purchased in the Community", "paragraphs": ["One contractor subcontracted by  the three managed care support  contractors (MCSC).
