The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the primary federal entity responsible for ensuring that first responders, such as police, fire, emergency medical, and public health personnel, have the capabilities needed to provide a coordinated, comprehensive response to any large-scale crisis. In the last 4 years DHS has awarded $11.3 billion to state and local governments to enhance capabilities, primarily to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from acts of terrorism. Presidential directives instruct DHS to develop a national all-hazards approach--preparing all sectors of society for any emergency event including terrorist attacks and natural or accidental disasters. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What actions has DHS taken to provide policies and strategies that promote the development of the all-hazards emergency management capabilities of first responders? (2) How do first responders' emergency management capabilities for terrorist attacks differ to capabilities needed for natural or accidental disasters? (3) What emphasis has DHS placed on funding awarded to state and local first responders to enhance all-hazards emergency management capabilities?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has undertaken three major policy initiatives aimed at creating a national, all-hazards coordinated and comprehensive response to large-scale incidents: (1) a national response plan (what needs to be done); (2) a command and management process (how it needs to be done); and (3) a national preparedness goal (how well it should be done). GAO reviewed these products and determined that each supports a national, all-hazards approach. DHS has developed plans to implement three related programs to enhance first responder capabilities: (1) to assess and report on the status of first responders' capabilities; (2) to prioritize national resource investments; and (3) to establish a national training and exercise program. Implementing these programs will likely pose a number of challenges for DHS including integrating internal and external assessment approaches, assessing state and local risks in a national context to effectively prioritize investments, and establishing common training requirements across responder disciplines. Because terrorist attacks share some common characteristics with natural and accidental disasters, 30 of DHS' 36 capabilities first responders need to support preparedness and response efforts are similar. GAO's analysis found that the baseline capabilities required for terrorist attacks and natural or accidental disasters are more similar for response and recovery and differ most for prevention. Because terrorist attacks are planned, intentional acts, all of DHS' prevention capabilities focus on terrorist attacks, while almost all other baseline capabilities focus on all hazards. Legislation and presidential directives call for DHS to place special emphasis on preparedness for terrorism and DHS has directed that the majority of first responder grant funding be used to enhance first responder capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, grants funds can have all-hazards applications."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been concern among  senior federal officials that another terrorist attack on U.S. soil could  occur. According to testimony by the Director of the Central Intelligence  Agency, it may be only a matter of time before a terrorist group tries to use  chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons in the United States.  Concerns like these have prompted increased federal attention on national  emergency preparedness\u2014that is, the nation\u2019s ability to prevent, protect  against, respond to, and recover from large-scale emergency events.  Through legislation and Presidential directives, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) has become the primary federal entity  responsible for ensuring that first responders, such as police, fire,  emergency medical, and public health personnel, have the capabilities  needed to provide a coordinated, comprehensive response to any large- scale crisis and to mount a swift and effective recovery effort. In the last 4  years, DHS agencies have awarded $11.3 billion to state and local  governments to enhance their national emergency preparedness  capabilities, primarily for terrorist attacks.", "Long before the events of September 11, 2001, terrorism preparedness was  included in the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s planning  approach to prepare for all types of emergency events, commonly referred  to as an all-hazards approach. Since the attacks, the intensified federal  attention and federal spending for national preparedness has largely  emphasized preparedness for terrorist attacks. However, the nation\u2019s  recent experience with large-scale natural disasters, for example, wildfires  in California in 2003, hurricanes in Florida in 2004, and floods in New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York in 2005 provides a justification for  taking an all-hazards approach to national preparedness that considers the  risks of natural and accidental disasters, as well as terrorism.", "Consistent with this approach, two Homeland Security Presidential  Directives (HSPD) issued in 2003 require DHS to take an all-hazards focus  in implementing the directives. HSPD-5, issued in February 2003, required  DHS to establish a single, comprehensive approach to and plans for the  management of emergency events whether the result of terrorist attacks or  large-scale natural or accidental disasters. Appendix I contains the text of  HSPD-5. HSPD-8, issued in December 2003, established policies to  strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond  to threatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks and large-scale natural  or accidental disasters. Among other things, it required DHS to coordinate  the development of a national domestic all-hazards preparedness goal that  would establish measurable readiness priorities and targets that  appropriately balance the potential threat and magnitude of terrorist  attacks and large-scale natural or accidental disasters with the resources  required to prevent, respond to, and recover from them. The directive also  designated the Secretary of Homeland Security as the principal federal  official for coordinating the implementation of all-hazards preparedness in  the United States. Appendix II contains the text of HSPD-8.", "Because of the nation\u2019s increased focus on preparedness for terrorist  attacks as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, you requested that  we examine the extent to which DHS has considered all types of  emergency events, including both terrorist attacks and natural or  accidental disasters, in developing and implementing its approach to  enhance and sustain first responder capabilities. This report explores the  following questions:  1.  What actions has DHS taken to provide policies and strategies that  promote the development of all-hazards emergency management  capabilities of first responders?  2.  How do first responders\u2019 emergency management capabilities for  terrorist attacks differ from capabilities needed for natural or  accidental disasters?  3.  What emphasis has DHS placed on funding awarded to state and local  first responders to enhance all-hazards emergency management  capabilities?", "The scope of our work was focused on the extent to which the actions  taken by DHS to enhance first responder skills and abilities encompassed  all hazards, whether the result of nature, accident, or terrorist action. To  address these objectives, we analyzed DHS\u2019s efforts to implement HSPD-5  and HSPD-8, including the process used to develop national preparedness  policies and the plans, goals, and standards resulting from the process, as  well as grant programs to enhance the preparedness of first responders.  We interviewed DHS officials from the Emergency Preparedness and  Response Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Office  for Domestic Preparedness, and the Office of State and Local Government  Coordination and Preparedness to obtain their views regarding the  process and its products, along with information on DHS assistance  programs. To obtain the views of first responders, we interviewed officials  from professional organizations that represent first responders on a  national level and reviewed relevant reports and studies on homeland  security and domestic preparedness. Finally, we conducted structured  interviews with 69 first responder departments and state level emergency  management officials in ten states, selected by non-probability sampling to  include metropolitan areas that crossed state boundaries, tribal  governments, states that face a variety of hazards, sparsely and densely  populated states, and states with townships and city government  structures, among other criteria. These first responder departments  responded to the questions in our structure interview guide and provided  additional observations during the course of our interviews. The results of  these interviews cannot be generalized to first responders not  participating in the interviews. An expanded discussion of our scope and  methodology is presented in appendix III.

Historically, FEMA developed mitigation programs designed to  minimize risk to property or individuals from natural or manmade hazards.  These mitigation programs included the post-disaster Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program and the pre-disaster Project Impact program. In addition,  the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as  amended, established the process for states to request a presidential  disaster declaration in order to respond and recover from a large-scale  emergency event. However, in response to the events of September 11,  2001, the federal government has provided billions of dollars to state and  local governments for planning, equipment, and training to enhance the  capabilities of first responders to respond to terrorist attacks and, to a  lesser extent, natural and accidental disasters. These extensive resources  reflect a growing federal role in promoting emergency preparedness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "First Responders are Responsible for Carrying out Emergency Management Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s first responders have the lead responsibilities for carrying out  emergency management efforts. The role of first responders is to prevent,  protect against, respond to, and assist in the recovery from emergency  events. Traditionally, first responders have been trained and equipped, in  the event of an emergency\u2014natural or accidental disasters and terrorist  attacks\u2014to arrive on the scene and take action immediately. In the first  hours of an event, first responders from various disciplines, which could  include police, fire, emergency medical personnel and public works, must  attempt to enter the scene, set up a command center, establish a safe and  secure perimeter around the site in order to save lives and protect  property, evacuate those within or near the site, tend to the injured and  dead and transport them to care centers or morgues, restrict and redirect  traffic and pedestrians, reroute and restore public utilities, remove debris,  and begin the process of recovery.", "Since September 11, 2001, the roles and responsibilities for first  responders to prevent emergency events and protect the public and  property have expanded. In July 2002, prior to the creation of DHS, the  President developed a National Strategy for Homeland Security which  recommended steps that federal, state and local governments, private  companies and organizations, and individual Americans should take to  improve homeland security. The National Strategy identified the need to  improve tactical counterterrorist capabilities of the various federal, state,  and local response assets that can intercede and prevent terrorists from  carrying out attacks. These assets include state and local law enforcement  and emergency response personnel which the National Strategy considers  crucial to preemption of terrorists, no matter if they are part of the local  SWAT team or the FBI\u2019s Hostage Rescue Team.", "First responder organizations across the county are to various degrees,  trained, staffed, and equipped to prepare for and respond to various  events. These organizations may differ in governmental role, size,  structure, and capabilities. For example, activities of local law  enforcement departments in smaller communities may be limited to day- to-day law enforcement while, in larger communities, departments may  include specialized teams such as bomb squads or special weapons and  tactics units. Likewise, local fire departments may be volunteer operations  with basic firefighting capabilities or, in larger communities, may include  teams specializing in hazardous materials response, search and rescue, or  structural collapse. The local public health system can consist of public or  private emergency medical services that provide immediate victim care  and transport victims to the area\u2019s public or private hospitals to receive  patient care, along with the state and local medical staff that monitor and  detect disease outbreaks. Supporting the response and recovery efforts of  first responders are other state and local officials who provide  preparedness planning, administration, and the communications systems  needed to command and control activities on the scene.", "Natural and accidental disasters have provided all levels of government in  many locations with experience in preparing for different types of  emergency events. However, terrorist attacks potentially impose a  relatively new level of fiscal, economic, and social disruption within this  nation\u2019s boundaries. Today\u2019s threat environment includes not only the  traditional spectrum of large-scale manmade and natural hazards\u2014 wilderness and urban fires, floods, oil spills, hazardous materials releases,  transportation accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, pandemics,  and accidental or natural disruptions to the nation\u2019s energy and  information technology infrastructure\u2014but also the deadly and  devastating arsenal of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high- yield explosive weapons as exemplified by the attacks on New York City  and Oklahoma City.

The Act also charged the directorate with consolidating existing  federal government emergency response plans into a single, coordinated  national response plan, as called for by HSPD-5.

NIMS is a policy document that defines roles and  responsibilities of federal, state and local first responders during  emergency events. The intent of this system described in the document is  to establish a core set of concepts, principles, terminology and  organizational processes to enable effective, efficient, and collaborative  emergency event management at all levels. These concepts, principles, and  processes are designed to improve the ability of different jurisdictions and  first-responder disciplines (e.g., fire and police) to work together in  various areas\u2014command, resource management, training, and  communications. The NRP is designed to integrate federal government  domestic prevention, protection, response, and recovery plans into a  single operational plan for all hazards and all emergency response  disciplines. Using the framework provided by NIMS, the NRP describes  operational procedures for federal support to state, local, and tribal  emergency managers and defines situations where the federal authorities  are to provide support and situations where the federal authorities are to  assume control. The NRP organizes capabilities and staffing and  equipment resources in terms of functions that are most likely to be  needed during emergency events, describes common processes and  specific administrative requirements (e.g., public affairs, financial  management, public health, etc.), and outlines core procedures. The NRP  also augments NIMS by defining roles and responsibilities for specific  types of emergencies.", "To develop NIMS and NRP, DHS assembled a variety of stakeholders from  federal, state, and local levels such as national professional associations,  and state and local responders representing the full range of response  disciplines. During the development of NIMS, stakeholder groups reacted  to initial drafts developed by DHS. The final draft of NIMS incorporated, in  part, key elements of a widely-used, interdisciplinary system of  command\u2014first used in conjunction with wildfires in California during the  1960s\u2014into a standardized, national system that would apply across all  emergency response disciplines and levels of government. Similarly, the  NRP was based on a consensus among stakeholders of best practices to  apply in integrating prevention, protection, response, and recovery plans  into one all-discipline, all-hazards plan.", "HSPD-5 requires all federal departments and agencies to adopt and use  NIMS in their individual preparedness efforts, as well as in support of all  actions taken to assist state and local governments. Further, the directive  requires federal departments and agencies to make adoption of NIMS by  states a condition, to the extent permitted by law, of federal preparedness  assistance beginning in fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2005 DHS required  states and other jurisdictions that receive direct funding to incorporate  NIMS into existing training programs and exercises, emergency operations  plans, and intrastate mutual aid agreements; to institutionalize the use of  the Incident Command System; and will require states and other  jurisdictions to certify as part of their fiscal year 2006 grant applications  that they have met the fiscal year 2005 NIMS requirements. However, final  requirements for fiscal year 2006 self certification have not been  formulated, according to DHS officials. DHS encouraged, but did not  require, local governments to implement these activities to the maximum  extent possible.", "We assessed NIMS and NRP to determine the extent to which the policy  documents discuss and emphasize different types of emergency events.  Our analysis showed that both documents had been developed in a  manner that reflects an all-hazards approach. For example, both NIMS and  NRP use the generic term \u201cincident management\u201d rather than specifying  the cause(s) of events, such as a terrorist act, accident, or natural disaster.  Moreover, NIMS and NRP are designed to promote interdisciplinary efforts  that consider the involvement of multiple jurisdictions and multiple  responders. The common processes and specific administrative  requirements listed in NRP also are described in terms that are not specific  to any type of threat or emergency. For example, according to NRP, the  plan is to be implemented during \u201cincidents of national significance.\u201d", "First responders we visited affirmed that NIMS and the NRP do take an all  hazards approach\u2014that is, they apply to natural and accidental disasters,  as well as terrorist attacks. For example, 12 first responder officials we  interviewed told us that they have long used the incident command system  upon which NIMS was based for a variety of emergency events. Similarly,  one homeland security director in a large urban city said NIMS had only  had a moderate impact on their operations because the city has already  been using an incident command system in its all-hazards approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Is Developing an All- Hazards National Preparedness Goal and Related Products Using Capabilities-Based Planning", "paragraphs": ["To comply with the requirements established in HSPD-8, DHS is  developing a National Preparedness Goal. While NIMS defines \u201chow\u201d to  manage a large-scale emergency event and NRP defines \u201cwhat\u201d needs to be  done, the National Preparedness Goal is intended to generally define \u201chow  well\u201d it needs to be done. DHS issued an interim version of the goal in  March 2005. The interim version will remain in effect until superseded by  the Final National Preparedness Goal, which DHS intends to issue in  October 2005. According to officials from DHS\u2019s Office of State and Local  Government Coordination and Preparedness, the final version is expected  to remain largely the same as the interim; however, the office is working  with its state and local government stakeholders to define appropriate  jurisdictional tiers, and plans to add this information to the final version of  the goal. According to the Interim National Preparedness Goal, the  primary purpose of establishing tiers is to account for reasonable  differences in target levels of capability (or system-specific elements of  capability) among groups of jurisdictions based on differences in risk  factors such as total population, population density, and critical  infrastructure. Our review of the interim goal indicates that it reflects an  all-hazards focus by consistently citing both natural and accidental  disasters and terrorist attacks as emergencies and the extent to which the  nation\u2019s first responders must develop their capabilities to address all  hazards.", "To develop the goal and determine the tasks and capabilities needed by  first responders on a nation-wide basis, DHS is using an approach known  as capabilities-based planning. The purpose of this approach is to provide  capabilities suitable for a wide range of threats and hazards, in an  environment of uncertainty and within an economic framework that  necessitates prioritization for allocation of finite resources, according to  DHS. As figure 3 shows, DHS\u2019s application of the capabilities-based  planning process model to the development of the goal and related  products involves three stages: (1) defining target levels of capability;   (2) achieving target levels of capability; and (3) assessing preparedness.", "DHS began the first stage of the capabilities-based planning process  identifying concerns using 15 National Planning Scenarios that were  developed by the Homeland Security Council, as illustrated in table 1.", "The 15 scenarios include 12 terrorist attacks (incorporating chemical,  biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive, and cyber attacks) and   3 natural disasters\u2014an earthquake, a hurricane and a pandemic influenza  outbreak. According to DHS, the Homeland Security Council excluded  scenarios for which they considered well-developed and tested response  capabilities to be already available and scenarios where the set of  response capabilities would be a subset of one of the 15 scenarios chosen.  Examples of excluded scenarios are industrial and transportation  accidents and frequently occurring natural disasters, such as floods, the  nation\u2019s most frequent natural disaster. According to DHS officials, there  was less concern about planning for natural disasters because there is a  tremendous amount of experience, actuarial data, geographical and  seasonal patterns, and other information that is not available in the  context of terrorism. Officials told us that the department chose to focus  the identification of its concerns on event consequences rather than event  probabilities, given the high degree of uncertainty related to preparing for  terrorist events.", "According to DHS\u2019s National Preparedness Guidance, the planning  scenarios are intended to illustrate the scope and magnitude of large-scale,  catastrophic emergency events for which the nation needs to be prepared.  Some state and local officials and experts in the field of emergency  preparedness said that the scenarios did not appear to reflect an  assessment of risk or a relative ranking related to risk. As a result, they  questioned whether the scenarios were appropriate inputs for  preparedness planning, particularly in terms of their plausibility and the  number of scenarios (12 of 15) that are based on terrorist attacks.  Officials in DHS\u2019s Office of State and Local Government Coordination and  Preparedness said that the scenarios were not ranked according to risk,  noting that this was unnecessary given the purposes for which the  scenarios were developed. They stated that the 15 planning scenarios are  not meant to be proscriptive, predictive, or exhaustive nor were they  intended to be ranked according to risk. According to DHS\u2019s National  Preparedness Guidance, the objective of developing the scenarios was to  provide a minimum number of credible scenarios that covered the range of  response requirements. DHS\u2019s executive summaries of the planning  scenarios state that the scenarios were not ranked according to risk and  probability because they were developed to test the full range of response  capabilities and resources for federal, state, and local governments as well  as the private sector, each of which could have different risks and  rankings.", "As it moved to the step in the process to develop a sense of preparedness  needs and potential capabilities, DHS created a list of tasks that would be  required to manage each of the 15 National Planning Scenarios. Then, in  consultation with federal, state, and local emergency response  stakeholders, it consolidated the list to eliminate redundancies and create  a Universal Task List of over 1,600 discrete tasks. This list was further  refined to identify critical tasks that would need to be performed at  various levels of government to prevent, protect against, respond to, and  recover from large-scale emergency events. Next, DHS identified target  capabilities that encompassed these critical tasks. The relationship  between the scenarios, tasks, and capabilities is shown in figure 4.", "According to DHS, the Universal Task List is intended to include all  unique, potential tasks at all levels of government that are needed to  prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from all large-scale  emergency events, although every task would not necessarily be  applicable to each of the 15 planning scenarios and no single jurisdiction  or agency would be expected to perform every task. From this universe of  potential tasks, DHS worked with stakeholders to identify a subset of  about 300 critical tasks that must be performed during a large-scale event  to reduce loss of life or serious injuries, mitigate significant property  damage, or are essential to the success of a homeland security mission.", "The final step of the first stage of DHS\u2019s planning process is to decide  goals, requirements, and metrics. To complete this step, DHS, working  with its stakeholders, developed a Target Capabilities List that identifies  36 capabilities needed to perform the critical tasks for the events  illustrated by the 15 scenarios. An example of a desired outcome for the  target capability of mass prophylaxis\u2014prevention of or protective  treatment for disease\u2014is to effectively reach an entire affected population  in time to prevent loss of life and injury. The relationship between the  Universal Task List, critical tasks, and target capabilities for the pandemic  flu scenario is illustrated in figure 5.", "The Target Capabilities List, according the National Preparedness Goal,  provides guidance on the specific capabilities and levels of capability that  federal, state, local, and tribal first responders will be expected to develop  and maintain. DHS has defined these capabilities generically and  expressed them in terms of desired operational outcomes and essential  characteristics, rather than dictating specific, quantifiable responsibilities  to the various jurisdictions. In the final version of the National  Preparedness Goal, DHS plans to organize classes of jurisdictions that  share similar characteristics such as total population, population density,  and critical infrastructure into tiers to account for reasonable differences  in capability levels among groups of jurisdictions. According to the Interim  National Preparedness Goal, the purpose of defining these groups of  jurisdictions is to be able to appropriately apportion responsibility for  development and maintenance of capabilities among levels of government  and across these jurisdictional tiers, because both the risk and the  resource base vary considerably among jurisdictions across the United  States.", "According to observations from 12 of the first responder departments we  interviewed, radiological and biological attacks are among potential  emergency events they may face which they are least prepared for and  most concerned about their capabilities. However, because these types of  attacks may require that a greater number of capabilities be exercised  simultaneously or that a greater number or wider variety of first  responders be employed to provide specific capabilities, these capabilities  would necessarily be drawn from regional, federal, or private resources. In  this regard the National Response Plan defines the roles and  responsibilities of federal, state, local, private-sector, and  nongovernmental organizations and citizens involved in support of  domestic incident management, noting particularly that when state  resources and capabilities are overwhelmed, state governors are  responsible for requesting federal assistance when it becomes clear that  state or tribal capabilities will be insufficient or have been exceeded or  exhausted.", "As we have previously reported, state and local resources alone will likely  be insufficient to meet the terrorist threat, given the specialized resources  that are necessary to address some types of terrorist attacks, the range of  governmental services that could be affected, and the vital role played by  private entities in preparing for and mitigating risks. Because no single  jurisdiction or agency would be expected to perform every task,  possession of a target capability could involve enhancing and maintaining  local resources, ensuring access to regional and federal resources, or some  combination of the two. DHS encourages planning for regional  cooperation and notes in the NRP that mutual aid agreements provide  mechanisms to mobilize and employ resources from neighboring  jurisdictions to support the incident command. Facilitating effective  regional coordination may present some challenges. For example, our  work in the National Capital Region found that no regional coordination  methods had been developed for planning for the use of 15 of the   16 funding sources we reviewed. While the National Capital Region has  experience with working together for regional emergency preparedness  and response, officials from the National Capital Region told us that they  had not worked together to develop plans and coordinate expenditures for  the use of federal funds.", "DHS also issued National Preparedness Guidance in April 2005 that  provides information, instructions and examples on how to prepare for  implementation of the goal at the federal, state and local levels of  government. The guidance identifies the most urgent needs for enhancing  national first responder preparedness capabilities in terms of 7 national  priorities: (1) implementation of NRP and NIMS; (2) implementation of the  interim National Infrastructure Protection Plan; (3) expanding regional  cooperation; (4) strengthening capabilities in interoperable  communications; (5) strengthening capabilities in information sharing and  collaboration; (6) strengthening capabilities in medical surge and mass  prophylaxis; (7) strengthening capabilities in detection and response for  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive weapons. Our  review also indicated that the National Preparedness Guidance largely  reflects an all-hazards approach and was developed in a manner that  recognizes a range of possible threats and origins. Six of the 7 national  priorities established and described by the guidance are generally  applicable to all hazards. In addition to implementation of the 7 national  priorities, the guidance identifies other all-hazards planning requirements  for federal, state, and local governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Implementation Plans May Address the Need for a Risk-Based, Strategic National Approach to Enhancing First Responders\u2019 All- Hazards Capabilities, But It Faces Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We reported in our 21st century challenges work that federal investments  in national preparedness have not been guided by a clear, risk-based  strategic plan.

To support its planning efforts in the second stage of  implementing HSPD-8, DHS has developed program implementation plans  for (1) a national assessment and reporting of capability status, (2) an  approach for balancing national investments in capabilities, and  (3) programs for national training, national exercises, and collection and  dissemination of lessons learned and best practices.", "To develop these program implementation plans, DHS established task  teams composed of various stakeholders from within DHS as well as  representatives from state and local first responders and representatives  from their professional associations such as the International Association  of Fire Chiefs and Chiefs of Police, and the International Association of  Emergency Managers.

According to DHS,  aggregating this data at all levels will provide information needed to  allocate resources, execute training and exercises, and develop an annual  status report on the nation\u2019s preparedness.

A key challenge will be  establishing a standardized approach for measuring and reporting the risks  faced by diverse states and localities in order to effectively prioritize and  allocate federal resources. Given that the 15 national planning scenarios  DHS used to identify capability gaps were selected without regard to  relative risk (i.e. probability of occurrence), it is not yet clear how DHS  will prioritize investments in capability gaps on a national level. We have  consistently advocated a risk management approach as a basis for  ensuring that specific programs and related expenditures are prioritized  and properly focused. Although risk management is an evolving practice,  we have encouraged the application of certain key elements of a risk  management approach, including a risk assessment that defines risks  based on the likelihood that they will occur and the consequences of their  occurrence. Another key element of the risk management approach we  have advocated is the identification of risk mitigation alternatives and the  ability to select among those alternatives based on risk, cost, and  effectiveness. The intent of DHS\u2019s planned all-hazards decision framework  to prioritize and optimize investments based on population, critical  infrastructure, and other significant risk factors appears to offer the  opportunity for such an approach to managing risk. However, as DHS does  not expect to fully implement its balanced investment program before  October 2008, it continues to operate its federal preparedness assistance  programs without a solid risk-based decision framework, and we were  unable to evaluate whether and the extent to which such a framework will  incorporate these key elements of risk management.

Just as partnerships  offer opportunities, they also create challenges based upon the different  interests reflected by each partner. From the federal perspective, there is  the concern that state and local governments may not share the same  priorities for use of federal funds.

Officials stated, even prior to fiscal year  2005, grant requirements allowed for dual usage and state grantees are  responsible for contacting DHS when questions regarding application of  grant guidelines arise. They also said that although the DHS equipment list  was not created with the intention that equipment would be used for non- terrorism purposes, flexibility for dual use was reasonable, acceptable,  and expected.

One first responder official worried that  their department is buying new equipment but were concerned that DHS  might not provide future funding for them to sustain the equipment. In  another locality, officials told us that equipment they had purchased could  not be maintained without continued DHS assistance.

In February  2005, we reported that in fiscal year 2004, DHS completed site visits to   44 of 56 states and territories that received grants as part of its monitoring  of states\u2019 grant reporting and state homeland security strategy  implementation. We also reported that in fiscal year 2004 DHS revised its  method of reporting on grant expenditures, moving away from requiring  itemized lists of expenditures toward a more results-based approach  where grant managers must demonstrate how grant expenditures link to  larger projects that support one or more goals in the states\u2019 homeland  security strategies. Finally, in the absence of some basic, comparable  standards for first responder performance, it has been difficult to assess  the effect of grant expenditures on first responder capabilities and  performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Prior to September 11, 2001, the federal government\u2019s role in supporting  emergency preparedness and management was limited primarily to  providing guidance and grants for planning, mitigation, and equipment  before large-scale disasters like floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes, and  response and recovery assistance after such disasters.  Since September  11, 2001, the federal government has awarded billions of dollars to state  and local governments for planning, equipment, and training to enhance  the capabilities of first responders to respond to terrorist attacks and, to a  lesser extent, natural and accidental disasters. These extensive resources  reflect a growing federal role in promoting emergency preparedness.  However, as we reported in our 21st century challenges work, this federal  financial assistance has not been guided by a clear, risk-based strategic  plan that would provide a basis for realistic budgeting and resource  planning. Ultimately, the federal government must determine how much  developing and maintaining the national emergency preparedness  capabilities needed for homeland security will cost and what the nation\u2019s  federal, state and local governments can afford to pay. DHS, as the  primary executive department with responsibilities for national emergency  preparedness efforts, faces the challenge of working with state and local  governments to coordinate preparedness activities and formulate realistic  budgets and resource plans to share these costs and support and sustain  implementation of an efficient and effective an all-hazards national  preparedness program.", "DHS\u2019s development of an all-hazards national preparedness goal, along  with related products and program implementation plans and  requirements, if properly planned and executed, may help guide the  development of realistic budget and resource plans. However, DHS may  confront several challenges in its attempts to fully realize the preparedness  goal and implement the three programs described by its program  implementation plans. For example, DHS\u2019s assessment and reporting  implementation plan, intended to accurately identify the status of  capabilities at the state, regional, and local levels is vital for establishing a  baseline and providing an ongoing feedback loop, upon which decisions at  these multiple levels of government about preparedness needs will rest.  However, DHS plans to rely extensively on self-reported data. Therefore,  as the team that devised DHS\u2019s assessment and reporting implementation  plan pointed out, it is likely to be a challenge for DHS to determine how to  aggregate data from multiple governmental and nongovernmental  emergency preparedness actors. An effective assessment system will also  have to balance self-assessment approaches with appropriate external  assessment checks in order to provide consistent and accurate data that  can drive these budgeting and resource planning decisions.", "A related challenge DHS may face is in continuing to coordinate efforts to  enhance first responder all-hazards capabilities among and across various  states and jurisdictions and to manage stakeholder expectations. First,  DHS\u2019s tiered approach to defining first responders\u2019 required capabilities\u2014 either to possess or to secure access\u2014suggests that finding effective  approaches for local jurisdictions to work together to develop funding  plans and coordinate expenditures for the use of federal funds for regional  emergency preparedness and response will be an important step in the  process of developing a realistic budget. However, as our work on  emergency preparedness in the National Capital Region demonstrates,  facilitating effective regional coordination can be particularly challenging.  Additionally, as we have reported, achieving national preparedness and  response goals hinges on the federal government\u2019s ability to work  collectively with state and local governments in order to leverage  resources and expertise. Inconsistent expectations about dual use and  concerns about how to coordinate the national training and exercise  program, among other things, illustrate the importance of careful attention  to establishing and maintaining strong nonfederal partnerships.", "Finally, DHS\u2019s proposal for a national system to balance resource  investments may help to provide a strategic, risk-based approach to  prioritize federal, state and local resource investments, to the extent that  the department uses a systematic, comprehensive risk management  approach. We have consistently advocated such a risk based approach to  guide federal investments in homeland security that would consider  threats, vulnerabilities, and criticalities, as well as the expected value of  investments in developing first responders\u2019 capabilities to prevent terrorist  attacks and to protect critical infrastructure balanced with the potential  costs of developing and maintaining capabilities for responding and  recovering from all types of emergency events. Such an approach could  provide a basis to formulate realistic budget and resource plans at the  national level. The intent of DHS\u2019s planned all-hazards decision framework  to prioritize and optimize investments based on population, critical  infrastructure, and other significant risk factors appears to offer the  opportunity for such an approach to managing risk; however establishing a  standardized approach for measuring and reporting the risks faced by  diverse states and localities in order to effectively prioritize and allocate  federal resources will be a key challenge. Moreover, as DHS does not  expect to fully implement its balanced investment program before 2008, it  continues to operate its federal preparedness assistance programs without  a solid risk-based decision framework, and it is not yet clear whether and  to what extent, when established, the proposed framework will  incorporate the key elements of risk management that we recommend."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, which had no comments or  concerns with the information included in this report.

We  selected states and localities to reflect variations in dimensions such as:  geographic diversity; population density including metropolitan and non- metropolitan locations; fiscal capacity differences between states; critical  infrastructure issues such as ports and international borders;  governmental structure differences at the local level (local focus versus  strong county government structure); differences in the states\u2019 homeland  security/emergency management organization and leadership models; and  a sample of states containing sovereign American Indian tribal lands.  Within each state we selected a sample of two to three localities, such as a  combination of jurisdictions for our visits, in order to maximize the range  of dimension described above. For example, we visited one of the large  urban areas within the state along with an adjacent suburban jurisdiction.  We also visited medium, small cities, rural jurisdictions or Indian tribes.  These local site visits included seven localities that received Urban Area  Security Initiative funding for fiscal years 2004 and 2005\u2014Detroit,  Michigan; Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; San Diego,  California; Tampa, Florida; New York, New York; and Seattle,  Washington\u2014that we identified after selecting which states to visit. At the  local jurisdictions we visited, we requested to meet with first responder  officials from the following departments: fire and emergency medical  services, law enforcement, emergency management, public health and  public works. We also selected two American Indian tribes that possessed  their own public safety departments\u2014police and fire\u2014to identify some of  the challenges and issues that these jurisdictions face. Our selection of  localities was to some extent dependent on the availability of officials to  meet with us, travel schedule limitations, and our effort to avoid any  respondent\u2019s bias due to overlaps with recent and current GAO  engagement teams. Because of the manner in which we selected our  locations, our results, however, cannot be generalized beyond the  individual locations.", "Using a structured interview guide, we solicited local first responder  officials\u2019 insights and perspectives on a variety of topics, including: the  extent to which DHS uses an all-hazards approach in assisting state and  local first responders\u2019 emergency management capabilities, how DHS  coordinates its activities, how locations use federal homeland security  grant funds, what mechanisms DHS has in place to ensure that grant funds  are spent in accordance with grant guidelines, how local departments  assess and report their preparedness status, what gaps, if any, they believe  exist between current and needed capabilities in selected locations, and  what challenges, if any, they face in their emergency management  responsibilities.", "Using a similar structured interview guide, we asked similar questions to  states\u2019 office of emergency management, their homeland security office,  their State Administrative Agency point of contact who is the official  recipient of DHS grants, and state-level public health officials.", "In addition, we met with officials from various professional organizations  that represent state government organizations and first responders to  capture their insights and perspectives on the extent to which DHS has  used an all-hazards approach in assisting state and local first responders\u2019  emergency management capabilities, and how DHS coordinates these  activities externally with state and local first responders.", "To determine what actions DHS has taken to provide policies and  strategies that promote the development of the all-hazards emergency  management capabilities of first responders, we reviewed DHS products  developed to comply with Presidential Homeland Security Directives 5 and  8.

We also obtained  and analyzed documents related to the development of the National  Preparedness Goal and its related products that were developed by DHS  and the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and  Preparedness in order to implement HSPD-8.
