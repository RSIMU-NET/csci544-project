Individual investors, through direct purchases or investment funds, own 75 percent of the estimated $3.7 trillion in municipal securities in the U.S. market. In the secondary market, where these securities are bought and sold after issuance, trading largely occurs in over-the-counter markets that are less liquid and less transparent than the exchange-traded equity securities market. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required GAO to review several aspects of the municipal securities market, including the mechanisms for trading, price discovery, and price transparency. This report examines (1) municipal security trading in the secondary market and the factors that affect the prices investors receive, and (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission\u0092s (SEC) and self-regulatory organizations\u0092 (SRO) enforcement of rules on fair pricing and timely reporting. For this work, GAO analyzed trade data, reviewed federal regulators\u0092 programs for enforcing trading rules, and interviewed market participants and federal regulators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the secondary market for municipal securities, both institutional and individual investors trade through brokers, dealers, and banks (broker-dealers). However, GAO analysis of trade data showed that institutional investors generally trade at more favorable prices than individual investors. Broker-dealers said these differences generally reflected the higher average transaction costs associated with trading individual investors\u0092 smaller blocks of securities. Market participants added that institutional investors have more resources, including networks of broker-dealers, and the expertise to independently assess prices. In recent years, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)\u0097an SRO that writes rules regulating the broker-dealers that trade municipal securities\u0097has required timely and public posting of trade prices in an effort to make post-trade price information more widely available. However, unlike the equities market, the relatively illiquid municipal market lacks centrally posted and continuous quotes, and other sources of pretrade price information are not centralized or publicly available to individual investors. In 2010, SEC began a review of the municipal securities market, in part to examine pretrade price information. MSRB has also begun a study that includes a review of the market structure to determine whether access to additional pretrade price information could improve pricing and liquidity. Both SEC and MSRB plan to complete these studies in 2012.", "Several regulators share responsibility for overseeing the municipal securities market. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u0097an SRO that regulates 98 percent of the broker-dealers that trade municipal securities\u0097and federal banking regulators enforce broker-dealer compliance with MSRB rules under their respective jurisdictions through electronic surveillances of trade data and routine examinations. SEC evaluates the quality of FINRA and MSRB\u0092s municipal regulatory programs through its SRO inspection program, which has recently evolved to a risk-based approach. SEC last inspected MSRB and FINRA\u0092s fixed-income surveillance program, which encompass municipal securities trading, in 2005. SEC staff said that staffing constraints have prevented them from conducting inspections of these SROs sooner, although they have recently begun a new inspection of FINRA\u0092s fixed-income surveillance program. SEC\u0092s limited monitoring of FINRA and MSRB between inspections may not be sufficient to support its new risk-based inspection approach. For example, SEC\u0092s last inspection of FINRA\u0092s fixed-income surveillance program predated the financial crisis\u0097and its ensuing volatility in the municipal market\u0097but SEC had collected limited information since its last inspection that would help it assess the quality of FINRA\u0092s broker-dealer oversight. SEC currently receives periodic reports from FINRA that provide statistical information on its regulatory activities related to municipal securities trading. According to SEC staff, while they might be able to use the reports to identify significant deviations in FINRA\u0092s efforts, they cannot use them solely to determine the effectiveness of FINRA\u0092s municipal securities program. Without ongoing collection and analysis of information to assess the effectiveness of SROs\u0092 regulatory programs, SEC may be unable to identify and act on regulatory problems in a timely manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SEC collect and analyze information on SROs\u0092 fixed-income regulatory programs on an ongoing basis to better inform its risk-based inspection approach.

There is no central  facility that publicly posts quotes on all securities trading, as there is in  some equities markets.

In addition, as debt instruments municipal securities are generally considered less risky than equity  securities. For example, issuers of debt securities have a contractual  obligation to return the principal value of the security to the holder at  maturity, while issuers of equity securities do not.

Municipal  broker-dealers generally determine the prices at which they are willing to  trade by making relative assessments of a security\u2019s market value, drawing  on various sources of information and incorporating their compensation for  facilitating the trades.identified as relevant to their pricing determinations included (1) recent  post-trade price information on same or comparable securities, (2)  available pretrade price information on the security or comparable  securities, (3) the characteristics and credit quality of the security, (4)  relevant market information, and (5) the cost of trading the security.", "Several factors that broker-dealers we spoke with  First, when determining prices, broker-dealers said they often began by  reviewing recent post-trade information on the same or similar securities. In  2005 MSRB began requiring broker-dealers to report price data on most  municipal securities transactions within 15 minutes to RTRS and, in 2008,  made this post-trade pricing information freely available on the EMMA  website. Broker-dealers we spoke with said that the price of a recently  reported interdealer trade for a security was a particularly good indication of  its value for that segment of the market. However, if a security has not  traded recently, they said they instead look for recent trades in comparable  securities. Broker-dealers we spoke with also said they typically access  MSRB\u2019s trade data through Bloomberg, which makes available tools to  perform advanced searches and analytics on the data.", "These broker-dealers also said that they frequently used industry  benchmarks\u2014typically yield curves\u2014-constructed in part from the post- trade prices of selected securities as a reference for pricing similar  securities. Representatives of broker-dealers we interviewed explained  that post-trade information provided them with an understanding of real- time trends in the demand for similar types of securities. For example, a  major electronic trading platform offers several tools for assessing the  prices of its listed offerings using post-trade information. Users can see  recently reported trades for similar securities, compare the offer price with  a widely used benchmark curve, and receive alerts if the offering price  exceeds the most recently reported trade by a specified threshold.", "Second, broker-dealers may use available pretrade price information on  the same or similar securities to infer market value. In the absence of  tradable quotes for outstanding securities, pretrade price information in  the municipal securities market includes bids from bids wanted and offer  prices. However, unlike post-trade information, pretrade price information  is not centralized, not publicly available, and not as available to broker- dealers (and to other market participants) as post-trade price information.  To estimate the market value for a security they want to sell, broker- dealers may solicit bids\u2014or may ask a broker\u2019s broker to solicit bids\u2014 through a bid wanted. Broker\u2019s brokers may also provide broker-dealers  with otherwise publicly unavailable information on third-party bids and  offers from past bids wanted as well as the highest bid and the lowest  offer available at a given time for securities in their areas of expertise. For  example, a broker\u2019s broker who regularly puts a security out for bid  wanted can provide information to broker-dealers on the bids received  even if the security has not traded in the last 2 months. Additionally,  broker-dealers obtain information about offer prices mainly through their  relationships and daily communications with other broker-dealers or  broker\u2019s brokers, their investors who may inform them of competing  offers, and listed offerings on electronic trading platforms or Bloomberg.", "Third, information on the credit quality of a security may affect its market  value, particularly any changes to the credit quality of the security since it  last traded. Broker-dealers can infer the credit quality of a security by  reviewing information from issuers\u2019 financial disclosures posted on the  EMMA website, which they typically access via Bloomberg. Issuer  disclosures that may affect a security\u2019s market value include information  on principal and interest payment delinquencies, changes in credit  ratings, and unscheduled draws on debt service reserves reflecting  financial difficulties, among other factors. Broker-dealers stated that their  ability to understand the credit risk of a particular security rested primarily  on their ability to obtain timely, comprehensive issuer disclosures.  However, they noted that municipal issuers\u2019 disclosures are sometimes  outdated and incomplete. They added that conducting an independent  assessment of the credit quality of municipal securities has become  increasingly important given the decline in the availability and use of bond  insurance following the recent financial crisis.", "Fourth, broker-dealers identified overall market conditions and events as  important factors to consider when inferring the market value of a  security. For example, an increase in interest rates since the last time a  security has traded will, other things being equal, reduce its value.  Another important factor broker-dealers consider is overall supply and  demand. For example, broker-dealers we interviewed told us that they  monitored the primary market because investor demand for new issues  affects prices for similar securities in the secondary market. Broker- dealers also told us that by being visible and frequently transacting in the  market, they could maintain continuous dialogue with their customers  about prices, helping to gauge the interest of investors and other broker- dealers in certain securities at given prices. Finally, broker-dealers said  that external factors such as \u201cheadline risk\u201d\u2014the risk that a news story  will affect prices in a market\u2014can also affect prices in the municipal  securities market. An example of headline risk cited by broker-dealers we  interviewed was a December 2010 report by a financial markets analyst  predicting widespread defaults among municipal issuers. This report  caused many individual investors to withdraw their money from these  funds, in turn depressing prices.", "Fifth, in determining prices, broker-dealers we spoke with said they  typically consider trading costs associated with every municipal securities  trade, such as fees to MSRB, and operational costs. They said that in  general, it is less costly for broker-dealers to trade a given volume of  securities in a few large blocks than in a large number of small blocks.  For example, an institutional broker-dealer with a $2 million block of  securities to sell may have to find only one buyer for the securities, while  a retail broker-dealer with a similar block of securities might have to find  100 individual investors to purchase these securities in smaller blocks of  $20,000. They explained that the higher costs related to the smaller  trades include not only the time and other related costs of finding many  more interested buyers, but also the risk that the broker-dealer incurs in  holding the securities in his inventory during that time. Last, broker- dealers we spoke with told us that they could spend considerable  amounts of time with individual investors explaining the characteristics  and relative risks of the securities, answering questions, and complying  with regulatory requirements that govern broker-dealer transactions with  individual investors. In contrast, they said they do not have to spend as  much time with institutional investors, who are typically more  knowledgeable and experienced market participants. In order to be  profitable, broker-dealers consider these costs when establishing prices.", "These broker-dealers also noted that they used their professional  judgment to determine the weight of any factor in determining the price for  a security, given the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.  For example, while a recent trade price on a similar security may drive a  security\u2019s trade price in one case, the same information may become less  relevant in the case of a security that has more recently suffered a credit  downgrade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Investors Generally Trade at Less Favorable Prices than Institutional Investors", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed MSRB data for secondary market trades involving newly  issued fixed-rate securities during the period from 2005 through 2010.  We found that (1) relative to institutional investors, individual investors  generally paid higher prices when buying\u2014and received lower prices  when selling\u2014municipal securities; (2) broker-dealers received larger  spreads (i.e., the difference between the purchase and selling price of a  security based as a percentage of the purchase price) when trading  smaller blocks of municipal securities; and (3) the prices that individual  investors paid for a given security tended to be more dispersed\u2014that is,  to vary more\u2014than the prices that institutional investors paid.", "First, our analysis revealed that for broker-dealer sales to investors, the  relative price declined on average with trade amount, and that the  opposite occurs for broker-dealer purchases from investors. That is,  investors paid higher prices when buying smaller blocks of securities  from broker-dealers\u2014and received lower prices when selling them\u2014 than they paid or received for larger trades. Table 1 shows average  relative price for trades involving newly issued fixed-rate securities  issued in 2010. The table shows that as trade size increased, relative  prices that investors paid for municipal securities declined steadily and  relative prices that investors received for selling their securities  increased steadily. For example, on average, investors paid 101.9  percent of a security\u2019s reoffering price and received 99.4 percent of a  security\u2019s reoffering price for $5,000 worth of securities, while they paid  100.1 percent of a security\u2019s reoffering price and received 100.5 percent  of a security\u2019s reoffering price for $2 million worth of securities. As  discussed earlier, individual investors typically trade municipal securities  in amounts of $100,000 or less, and institutional investors typically trade  in amounts of $1 million or more. Consequently, individual investors are  likely paying higher prices than institutional investors when they  purchase municipal securities and receiving lower prices than  institutional investors when they sell municipal securities.", "Our analysis also found that broker-dealers received larger spreads when  trading small blocks of municipal securities. Because individual  investors tend to trade smaller amounts than institutional investors,  individual investors tended to pay higher spreads than institutional  investors. For example, our analysis showed that the average spread for  a $20,000 trade of a fixed-rate security in 2010 was around 2 percent and  for a $5 million trade around 0.01 percent. Table 2 shows how these  spreads affect investors\u2019 return as measured by the yield to maturity (the  yield received after the security matures) on two hypothetical trades of  $20,000 and $5 million of the same securities purchased by an individual  investor and an institutional investor, respectively.", "In addition, our analysis showed a wider range of prices for smaller trades  than for larger trades from 2005 through 2010. That is, prices for larger  trades tended to be more concentrated, while prices for smaller trades  tended to be more dispersed. To the extent that individual investors trade  smaller amounts than institutional investors, this relationship indicates  that individual investors were more likely to pay a wider spectrum of  prices for a given security than institutional investors. Table 3 shows price  dispersion for trades involving newly issued fixed-rate municipal securities  issued in 2010. The table shows prices that investors paid (and, to a  lesser extent, received) for municipal securities were more dispersed for  smaller trades than for larger trades.", "These findings are consistent with previous research on municipal  securities trades. For example, researchers analyzing trades of municipal  securities found that broker-dealers received larger spreads on smaller  trades than they received on larger trades. In addition, researchers  analyzing trades of recently issued municipal securities found that prices  for smaller trades were more dispersed than prices for larger trades."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Investors Generally Have Less Information and Expertise to Assess Prices than Institutional Investors", "paragraphs": ["Various factors could contribute to the differences in prices that individual  investors receive relative to institutional investors. Some researchers  have suggested that these differences are not entirely accounted for by  differences in dealer costs between large and small trades. One study  suggests the lower spreads that institutional investors pay may also be  due to the lack of price transparency in the market, which allows better  informed investors to obtain more favorable trade prices. Another study  adds that institutional investors\u2019 continuous engagement in the market  and frequent interaction with broker-dealers also provide them with more  bargaining power than individual investors. This study also suggests that  the more dispersed prices that individual investors experience could  indicate that, in the nontransparent municipal securities market, broker- dealers may have more opportunities to charge higher prices when  dealing with less knowledgeable investors. The authors explained that the  wider range of prices individual investors receive when they buy or sell  the same security could reflect broker-dealers\u2019 ability to detect diverse  levels of sophistication among individual investors, with less  knowledgeable individuals potentially more likely to trade at less favorable  prices than more market-savvy individuals.", "A third study, however, concludes that differences in prices are not  entirely due to the lack of transparency in this market. The study notes  that municipal securities often pass through a chain of dealers before  being placed with investors and suggests that such interdealer trading  may contribute to differences in prices for individual and institutional  investors. This study finds that the prices investors pay increase with the  amount of interdealer trading that preceded their purchases, and also that  more interdealer trading is associated with greater price dispersion. The  study also finds that successive interdealer trades tend to involve smaller  and smaller trades, thus suggesting that investors trading smaller  amounts\u2014individual investors\u2014are likely to pay higher prices and also  more dispersed prices than investors trading larger amounts\u2014institutional  investors.", "We found several factors that likely affected individual investors\u2019 ability to  gain and use information to independently assess offers and bids they  received from their broker-dealers for municipal securities they were  interested in purchasing or selling. While MSRB has increased the  amount of information available to all investors through its EMMA  website\u2014including price information on past trades and issuer  disclosures\u2014institutional investors we spoke with generally had more  resources and expertise to assess prices than individual investors. In  particular, they had (1) access to more sources of pretrade price  information in the form of offerings and bids provided through their large  networks of broker-dealers, (2) access to more user-friendly post-trade  information through third-party vendors and their networks of broker- dealers, and (3) more market expertise to help them incorporate other  available information.", "First, institutional investors told us that when buying securities they  accessed the fragmented municipal market through their large networks  of broker-dealers. For the institutional investors we interviewed, these  networks range from 30 to over 100 national and regional broker-dealers  who compete for their business by providing them with a wide range of  municipal securities offerings from the primary and secondary markets.For example, institutional investors typically receive daily secondary  market offerings from their broker-dealers through Bloomberg, which  provides an interface that allows users to pull together and organize these  offerings for easy analysis\u2014an important feature in a large,  heterogeneous market where price discovery depends heavily on relative  assessments of similar securities.", "Relative to institutional investors, individual investors typically have  access to fewer sources of pretrade price information. Unlike institutional  investors that have access to and can compare thousands of daily  offerings from their large networks of broker-dealers, individuals typically  have brokerage accounts with a few broker-dealers, perhaps only one,  that may or may not offer online access to their offerings. Individuals  with online access to a brokerage firm\u2019s offerings can search for  securities that meet certain parameters and compare the results. They  may be able to repeat this exercise with other broker-dealers, although  they are unlikely to obtain competing prices for the same security. In  contrast, some investors without access to online offerings told us that  they relied on their broker-dealers. These investors can compare prices of  similar securities only insofar as their brokers share this information with  them. However, some retail broker-dealer firms have taken steps to  attract individual investors by combining offerings from electronic trading  platforms with their own offerings, thus expanding the pool of securities  available to their customers. According to one of the largest municipal  electronic trading platforms, which caters to retail broker-dealers,  individuals can access the platform\u2019s inventory through several major  brokers, most full-service brokers, and many independent financial  advisers.", "Similarly, institutional investors wanting to sell municipal securities  generally have multiple ways to obtain pretrade price information in the  form of bids. Their access to large networks of broker-dealers and tools  for obtaining bids from more than one dealer allows them to contact  potential buyers and independently assess the bids they receive for their  securities. Institutional investors we interviewed said that they also  frequently carried out their own bids wanted by using Bloomberg to solicit  bids from broker-dealers in order to gauge demand and potentially  receive a bid at which they were willing to sell. Additionally, these  institutional investors told us that they might offer securities directly to  broker-dealers to find interested parties among the firms or their  customers. Finally, institutional investors can ask a broker-dealer to offer  the security for sale through a broker\u2019s broker or an electronic trading  platform.", "By contrast, individual investors typically do not have independent access  to multiple bids and thus may be less able to assess the prices they  receive for securities they want to sell. When individuals sell securities,  they typically rely on the broker-dealer responsible for the account that  houses the securities to find a market. A retail broker-dealer may offer the  securities to other broker-dealers or customers or may solicit bids through  a broker\u2019s broker or an electronic trading platform. However, because  selling small blocks of securities is generally more difficult than selling  larger blocks, broker-dealers we interviewed said that they might be able  to obtain only a few bids for the individual investor. Although the broker- dealer may explain to the individual his process for obtaining bids,  individual investors may have difficulty judging the level of demand for  their securities or the level of effort their broker-dealers made to find  potential buyers.", "Similar to broker-dealers, institutional investors we interviewed told us  that they can access MSRB\u2019s historical trade information through the  EMMA website and centrally through Bloomberg, which allows users to  compare post-trade prices for two or more securities that share similar  characteristics using a search function. Institutional investors also said  that their established relationships and continued negotiation with their  broker-dealers often revealed market patterns from post-trade prices that  helped them assess prices. For example, some large institutional  investors told us that broker-dealers typically let them know about large or  otherwise meaningful trades that they believed might affect prices of  similar securities before these trades appeared on RTRS (postings must  occur within 15 minutes of the trade). Some of these investors said that  even though MSRB\u2019s RTRS system did not disclose total transaction  amounts for trades over $1 million\u2014which the system reports as trade  amounts of \u201c$1+ million\u201d\u2014they typically were aware of the amount and  the price of these large transactions through their relationships with  broker-dealers. Market participants have said that this information is  important, because prices in large trades affect prices for many other  similar securities because of the relative nature of pricing in this market.  Institutional investors are also able to benefit from broker-dealers\u2019  commentaries on trades or on demand trends in the market through  Bloomberg.", "In contrast, individuals\u2014who are likely to find Bloomberg prohibitively  expensive\u2014can obtain post-trade information on any outstanding security  from the EMMA website but may encounter limitations. While individual  investors may use the EMMA website to look for past trade prices of a  security to assess the current price, this information is likely not useful  unless the latest trade is relatively recent, as we have seen. Currently, the  EMMA website does not have search capabilities designed to allow users  to identify comparable securities. Further, individual investors could  misinterpret post-trade pricing data if they were unaware that reported  prices for investor transactions reflected dealers\u2019 compensation for the  trade as well as the estimated market value of the security. MSRB is  currently evaluating improvements that would make the EMMA website  more meaningful and useful for individual investors.", "Institutional investors we spoke with generally employed professional  staff, such as credit analysts and traders, who specialized in evaluating  credit risk and trading municipal securities and maintained models to   Institutional investors we interviewed stated evaluate offering prices. that in general they could form an immediate initial judgment about the  price of a municipal security because they were entrenched in the market  on a daily basis and had accumulated expertise to inform their decision  making. These investors told us that they applied a wealth of market  history to determine a security\u2019s relative value. They said that, for  example, they knew the approximate price at which an A-rated hospital  security in California with a 30-year maturity is trading and could update  prices for the same or similar securities by looking at technical features  (like call features), the issuers\u2019 financial profile, and the market strength  on the day of the trade, among other things.", "By contrast, individual investors have access to issuer financial  disclosures through MSRB\u2019s EMMA website and other publicly available  issuer information but may lack the expertise to understand and update  prices using this information. Besides issuer disclosures, individuals have  access to free investor information websites, such as the Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association\u2019s (SIFMA)  investinginbonds.com, which makes available various market benchmark  yield curves, among other things. Many of these resources may also be  available to individuals through their broker-dealers\u2019 online websites.  However, some institutional investors we spoke with believed that  professional expertise was required to use this information to assess  prices, especially for securities that had not traded recently. For example,  even with timely access to issuer disclosures, it is not clear that individual  investors with relatively limited market expertise would be able to  estimate how a rating downgrade translated into a lower price for a  security.", "Additionally, individual investors may undertake varied degrees of  research during the few hours that they typically have to make an  investment decision. For example, some investors we spoke with did not  look at historical trade information or issuer disclosure information when  they bought bonds and instead relied on the recommendation of their  broker-dealer. Others, however, chose a few potential securities from  their broker-dealer\u2019s online offerings and checked historical trade  information and disclosure information for those securities. One of the  more knowledgeable among the individual investors we spoke with stated  that he treated the last interdealer trade price as a benchmark for pricing  and used this information with varying degrees of success to negotiate  prices with brokers. For example, one individual said he had successfully  used the last traded price to bargain for better prices with his broker and  found that if he was buying bonds for a par value of $200,000, for  example, he might be able to save $100 (or 0.05 percent of par value).", "Market participants explained that individual investors faced additional  challenges in independently assessing the value of a security since the  decline in the use and availability of bond insurance following the recent  financial crisis. In the past, individual investors could choose to buy an  insured security and rely on the insurer\u2019s guarantee without fully  understanding the security\u2019s underlying value. Individual investors may  review issuer disclosures through the EMMA website to help in  independently assessing risk, but some individual investors have  expressed frustration at their inability to identify and understand the  relevant pieces of information from the typically long and technical issuer  disclosures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC, MSRB, and Market Participants Are Considering Ways to Improve Pretrade Price Transparency", "paragraphs": ["SEC and MSRB have ongoing studies examining the municipal security  market.

It is also  intended to assist MSRB in evaluating whether pricing and liquidity in the  market could be improved with higher levels of pretrade price  transparency. MSRB staff said that the initial phase of the study would  likely be completed in 2012.

In an October 2010  speech discussing SEC\u2019s review of the municipal securities markets, one  commissioner noted that post-trade transparency in this market had  improved considerably since MSRB\u2019s implementation of real-time trade  reporting and the EMMA website. However, because of the low liquidity  levels of many municipal securities, these trade data could be weeks or  months old and therefore not helpful to investors. In part for this reason,  the commissioner said, improving pretrade transparency was an  important goal. MSRB staff observed that only a few limited venues  allowed even knowledgeable and experienced market participants such  as broker-dealers to see bid and offer information for municipal trades.  They added that because the municipal securities market operates  through over-the-counter trading, even the broker-dealers could not see  bid and offer information for the entire market.", "One challenge to improving pretrade price transparency is determining  whether and how to make this information available to the general public  in a timely manner, particularly for thinly traded securities. That is, given  that most municipal bonds are traded infrequently once they have been  initially distributed, two-sided quotes are not continuously available in this  market. One suggestion that arose was to create a national listing service  where all municipal broker-dealers could list their entire municipal  securities offerings for public viewing and allow investors to search for  securities that fit their investment parameters and to compare prices and  yields. To make selling securities easier for investors, one field hearing  participant suggested allowing investors to place bids on offerings, while  another suggested establishing a limit order mechanism for this market. These suggestions would necessitate creating a centralized trading  venue.

Further, this market  participant said that an exchange would promote pretrade price  transparency through the public dissemination of bid and offer  information. Other market participants agreed that an exchange would  broaden individual investors\u2019 access to the market and noted that an  exchange would allow them to more easily find offerings for comparable  securities with the characteristics they wanted.

For example, Rule G-30 specifies four factors  that broker-dealers must consider when determining a fair and  reasonable price, including the broker-dealer\u2019s best judgment as to the  fair market value of the securities at the time of the transaction. In  addition, in its interpretive notices, MSRB has identified other factors that  may be relevant to this determination, such as the resulting yield\u2014or  annual rate of return\u2014of the security to a customer. To determine  whether a broker-dealer is in compliance with Rule G-30 on a specific  trade, regulators must consider how well the broker-dealer has applied all  of the relevant factors as well as the facts and circumstances of the  transaction. Table 4 lists the written factors that regulators consider in  enforcing this rule. For instance, as part of their consideration of whether  broker-dealers use their best judgment in pricing securities, OCIE  examiners stated that when they found a potentially excessive markup,  they checked to see whether the market had moved or significant  information about the issuer had become available just before the  transaction.", "We observed how examiners assessed broker-dealers\u2019 application of  some of these factors in our review of selected FINRA examinations with  G-30 violations. For example, FINRA examiners identified six potential G- 30 violations\u2014all in the form of excessive markups\u2014at one firm they  examined. When they asked the firm to explain the markups, which  ranged from about 4 percent to nearly 10 percent, the firm stated that all  of the transactions in question involved low-rated or unrated bonds and  occurred in late 2008, when the market was highly volatile.stated that because it had no customers for the bonds at the time it   The firm also  purchased them, it had assumed additional risks, and that no comparable  interdealer trades were available to establish the prevailing market price.  While FINRA examiners concluded that four of the six transactions were  fair and reasonable, they cited G-30 violations on the two remaining  transactions based on the combination of high markups, firm profits, and  the transactions\u2019 proximity in time to interdealer purchases. Illustrating the  importance of reviewing the individual facts and circumstances in each  transaction, examiners deemed one of the highest markups acceptable  because the security had been trading within a wide range of prices  around the time of the trade in question and the transaction resulted in a  high yield to the customer relative to those of comparable securities. In  another examination, FINRA examiners questioned a trade in which a  firm bought 10 bonds from a customer at a price substantially lower than  the last reported trade, which had occurred about a week earlier. The firm  indicated that the security\u2019s credit rating had dropped within that time  period. Given this downgrade and the fact that the bonds in question  continued to trade in the lower range for about a month afterward, FINRA  examiners determined that the firm had set a fair and reasonable  aggregate price and thus had not violated Rule G-30.", "In April 2010, MSRB proposed draft guidance that would provide greater  specificity for broker-dealers acting as principals in determining a  security\u2019s prevailing market price. Specifically, MSRB\u2019s Regulatory Notice  2010-10 proposed a hierarchical approach that is intended to harmonize  with FINRA\u2019s approach to pricing nonmunicipal debt securities. The  proposed approach would first have the broker-dealer use as the  prevailing market price his contemporaneous costs or proceeds\u2014in other  words, his costs or proceeds from a transaction recent enough that it  would be expected to reflect the current market price for the security. If a  broker-dealer wished to use a source other than his contemporaneous  costs or proceeds to determine the prevailing market price, he would be  required to search through a hierarchy of relevant transactions to seek  other appropriate comparison prices. In addition, broker-dealers would be  required to document how they determined the prevailing market price in  cases where they did not use contemporaneous costs or proceeds.  MSRB officials told us that the proposed method would likely make it  easier for regulators to conduct surveillance and enforcement for Rule G- 30, because it would provide a relatively mechanical way to determine a  security\u2019s prevailing market price. However, broker-dealers have  expressed concerns about the proposed method, citing, among other  issues, increased burdens and risks to liquidity. As of January 9, 2012,  MSRB had not finalized the proposed guidance.", "Although regulators identified G-14 violations during our review period,  these trade reporting issues did not appear to be systemic. According to  data we received from MSRB, from February 2005 (the month after the  15-minute reporting requirement took effect) through July 2011, the  monthly industry average for late trades declined from approximately 7  percent to less than 1 percent.

FINRA officials noted that in 2005  FINRA had assigned a dedicated team to conduct automated surveillance  reviews of the municipal market, with an initial focus on late trade  reporting. FINRA officials believe that these surveillance efforts likely  played a role in the decline of the industry G-14 violation average. FINRA  opened 721 reviews based on alerts related to potential G-14 violations  occurring from 2006 through 2010. FINRA\u2019s surveillance group had  completed 621 of those reviews as of June 2011.

Of those 910 examinations:", "Some 699 (about 77 percent) resulted in a cautionary action.", "Another 136 (15 percent) resulted in a compliance conference.", "Forty-two (about 5 percent) resulted in a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver  and Consent.", "The remaining 33 examinations (about 4 percent) resulted in minor  rule violation plans, internal referrals for potential disciplinary action,  or offers of settlement.", "In the sample of 32 FINRA examinations we reviewed with G-14  violations, we found that the violations stemmed from a variety of  sources, including human error, deficient procedures, a firm\u2019s failure to  submit or update a Form RTRS, or technical malfunctions, among other  reasons. However, human error and deficient procedures were the most  commonly cited causes. Regulators noted that late or inaccurate trade  reporting was relatively simple to identify through surveillance and  examinations and that broker-dealers could be cited for a G-14 violation  based on as little as one or two late or inaccurately reported trades. For  example, in one of the FINRA examinations we reviewed, examiners took  a sample of 60 trades and found that 2 were reported to MSRB with the  incorrect price. A representative of the broker-dealer firm told examiners  that the firm had corrected the trades the day they were entered but that  an error had led to the suppression of the amended information. FINRA  counts instances like this as G-14 violations and requires broker-dealers  to update MSRB with the correct information if possible.", "The federal banking regulators cited G-14 violations in 8 of the 87 bank  dealer examinations they conducted. They generally responded to these  violations with corrective action requirements. On the basis of  examinations they conducted during this time frame in which they  assessed broker-dealers for G-14 compliance, OCIE staff agreed that G- 14 violations appeared to have decreased in recent years and said that  the inadvertent late trades they continued to see were sometimes  attributable to factors such as breakdowns in trade reporting systems.", "OCIE staff told us that settlement failures typically appeared to represent  a low percentage of municipal transactions cleared through NSCC.

OCIE  did not have a fixed schedule for examining MSRB, but its SRO  Inspection Guidelines stated that the office generally inspected each SRO  under its jurisdiction every 1-4 years.

Surveillance, examination, and enforcement  programs were typically components of these routine inspections, but  municipal securities were not included in each inspection cycle. From  2000 through 2010, mostly in accordance with a 3-year cycle, OCIE  conducted 49 inspections of FINRA\u2019s district offices, which conduct the  majority of broker-dealer examinations. As part of these inspections, they  assessed whether FINRA examined municipal securities broker-dealers  at least once every 2 years and reviewed a sample of FINRA\u2019s  workpapers to determine whether FINRA examiners thoroughly reviewed  broker-dealers for compliance with all MSRB rules and other applicable  rules and regulations. However, the district office inspections are not  intended to address FINRA\u2019s surveillance activities or policies and  procedures for its municipal market regulatory programs. In 2010, OCIE  began transitioning to a risk-based SRO inspection approach in  conjunction with a comprehensive assessment of OCIE\u2019s structure and  functions.

Although OCIE  obtained some information on FINRA\u2019s examination program through its  district office inspections and broker-dealer examinations, its lack of a  structured mechanism for monitoring the quality of FINRA\u2019s fixed-income  surveillance during that time means that OCIE will not have a full picture of  how effective FINRA was in surveilling for and detecting violations of MSRB  rules until it finishes its 2011 inspection\u2014more than 3 years after the  financial crisis began and more than 6 years since its last inspection.", "Proposed Rule 17a-26 is an example of a mechanism that OCIE could  use to obtain meaningful information for ongoing monitoring of SRO  regulatory programs for the municipal securities market.

In an interest rate swap, a municipal issuer enters into a contract  with a counterparty (typically an investment bank, commercial bank, or  insurance company), and agrees to exchange periodic interest payments.  Municipal issuers may use interest rate swaps to try to lower their  borrowing costs. For example, by issuing variable-rate securities and  entering into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap, an issuer may be able to  obtain a lower fixed-rate interest payment than it otherwise could obtain if it  had issued fixed-rate securities directly. In this case, after issuing the  variable-rate securities, the issuer enters into a swap agreement with a  counterparty that agrees to pay the issuer a variable rate based on an  index that is intended to approximate the variable-rate interest payments  that the issuer must make to its investors. In exchange, the issuer agrees  to pay the counterparty a fixed interest rate. As a result, the issuer achieves  a synthetic fixed rate by converting a variable-rate obligation to a fixed-rate  obligation. Payment exchanges between the issuer and the counterparty  reflect differences between the fixed rate and the variable rate during a  specific period of time. The swap does not alter the issuer\u2019s obligations,  including debt servicing, to existing investors.", "Municipal issuers incur a number of risks when they enter into interest  rate swaps, including basis risk, termination risk, and counterparty risk  Basis risk is the risk that the variable rate paid by the issuer to its  investors is more than the variable interest rate received under the swap.  If that occurs, the payments the issuer receives from the counterparty are  less than the payments the issuer must make to the investors. The issuer  must cover that difference in addition to paying the fixed rate on the swap  to the counterparty. Termination risk is the risk that the swap may  terminate or be terminated before its expiration. Swap agreements allow  for termination of the swap by either party in the case of certain events,  such as payment defaults on the swap or credit rating downgrades. For  example, if the issuer triggers an early termination, it could owe a  termination payment reflecting the value of the swap under the market  conditions at that time. If market rates have changed to the issuer\u2019s  disadvantage (e.g., the issuer is a fixed-rate payer and interest rates have  declined), the issuer will be \u201cout of the money\u201d on the swap, that is, the  fixed rate that the issuer is paying to the counterparty is higher than the  current market rate, and owe the counterparty a termination payment. A  termination of a swap can result in a substantial unexpected payment  obligation. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty will default  on its payment obligations to the issuer.", "The recent financial crisis heightened the exposure of a number of  municipal issuers with interest rate swaps to these risks. For example, a  number of municipal issuers had insured their underlying variable-rate  securities with bond insurance. However, the downgrades in these  insurers\u2019 credit ratings during the financial crisis resulted in some issuers  having to post collateral on the swap agreements they had entered into or  face termination of the swaps. Because interest rates had declined  significantly at that time, these issuers were out of the money\u2014making it  expensive to terminate the contract. However, a number of issuers  refunded their variable rate securities and terminated the swaps to free  themselves from these agreements.", "In some cases where municipal issuers have suffered losses because of  swap agreements, issuers allege that the counterparties that sold them  the swaps (swap dealers) misrepresented the risks of the swaps that they  sold to the issuers. In other cases, they have called into question the fees  that the swap dealers made.

For each  trade, the data included variables describing characteristics of the  security, including the dated date (the date from which interest starts to  accrue), maturity date, interest rate, principal amount at issuance, and  reoffering price (the price at which underwriters sell newly issued  securities to the public in the primary market), as well as variables  describing the characteristics of the trade (trade date/time, settlement  date, trade price, yield, and trade amount) and trade type (dealer sales to  customer, interdealer trade, or dealer purchases from customer). We  analyzed trade data involving newly issued fixed-rate securities to  understand how trade prices differ for institutional and individual  investors, using trade size (amount) as a proxy for whether the trade  involved institutional or individual investors. We focused on trades that  occurred within the period from 30 days prior to and 120 days after the  dated date on municipal securities. We chose to examine this time frame  because we observed that bonds in our sample trade most frequently  around the time of issuance and that trading activity declines as the  number of days after issuance increases, with trading activity typically  leveling off by about 120 days after issuance. Focusing on a period with  more trading activity improved the precision with which we measured the  relationships described below. We chose to examine only trades of newly  issued bonds to ensure that all the trades we analyzed involved bonds  that had been available to investors for a similar amount of time and to  limit the likelihood that unobserved, time-varying characteristics of bonds  influence our analysis.", "First, we analyzed the relationship between the relative trade price (the  trade price as a percentage of the reoffering price) and trade amount by  trade type in order to determine if prices for smaller trades\u2014those more  likely to involve individual investors\u2014are different from prices for larger  trades\u2014those that are more likely to involve institutional investors.  Second, we analyzed the relationships between spreads (the difference  between the price on dealer sales to investors and the price on dealer  purchases from investors as a percentage of the price on dealer  purchases) within $10,000 trade amount increments and trade amount to  determine if spreads on smaller trades are different from spreads on  larger trades. For these regressions, we constructed datasets with one  observation for each security for each $10,000 trade amount increment.  For each security, for each $10,000 trade amount increment, we  calculated the inside spread, mean spread, and outside spread. The  inside spread is the difference between the lowest trade price on a dealer  sale and the highest trade price on a dealer purchase as a percentage of  the highest trade price on a dealer purchase. The mean spread is the  difference between the mean trade price on a dealer sale and the mean  trade price on a dealer purchase as a percentage of the mean trade price  on a dealer purchase. The outside spread is the difference between the  highest trade price on a dealer sale and the lowest trade price on a dealer  purchase as a percentage of the lowest trade price on a dealer purchase.  We only used observations on security-trade amount increment  combinations for which there existed at least one dealer sale and at least  one dealer purchase. Third, we analyzed the relationship between price  dispersion (the difference between the maximum and minimum trade  price as a percentage of average trade price) and trade amount by trade  type to determine if prices on smaller trades are more or less dispersed  than prices on larger trades. For these regressions, we constructed  datasets with one observation for each security, for each trade type, and  for each trade amount in $10,000 increments. We formed groups of  trades for each security, trade type, and trade amount in $10,000  increments. We then calculated price dispersion for that group of trades  as the difference between the maximum trade price and minimum trade  price as a percentage of the average trade price. For all three analyses,  our regressions included indicator variables for each security in the  sample to control for unobserved, time-invariant features of the securities.  We estimated separate regressions for bonds issued in each year from  2005 through 2010. We present the results of our regression analyses in  appendix III.", "For illustrative purposes, we also calculated descriptive statistics using the  trade data. First, we calculated the average relative trade price on newly  issued fixed-rate securities by trade amount and trade type for 2010.  Second, we determined the average spreads for a $20,000 trade (an  individual investor-sized trade) and a $5 million trade (a institutional  investor-sized trade) of a fixed-rate security in 2010. We then used these  average spreads to calculate the yield to maturity of two hypothetical trades  of $20,000 and $5 million of the same security. We did this to compare the  effect of the size of the spread on the return received by an individual  investor and an institutional investor. Third, we calculated the average price  dispersion for newly issued fixed-rate securities by trade amount and trade  type for 2010. We presented these descriptive statistics in tables in the  report. In conducting our analyses, we carried out a data reliability  assessment of the MSRB trade data. To do so, we reviewed information on  the processes and procedures MSRB uses to help ensure that trade data  entered into RTRS are accurate and complete. We also reviewed the data  for missing values and outliers and, where we observed instances of such,  solicited explanations from MSRB staff. On the basis of this information, we  determined that these data were reliable for our purposes.", "We also obtained statistics on the relative size of the municipal securities  market. We obtained data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Flow of Funds  Accounts of the United States on the estimated dollar value of municipal  securities outstanding and from Bloomberg L.P.

We also collected data on the total number of public companies  listed on the major U.S. exchanges from the annual reports of NYSE  Euronext and NASDAQ OMX. We did not conduct an assessment of the  reliability of these data sources. However, these data are widely used by  regulators, market professionals, and academics and are considered  credible for the purposes for which we used them. In addition, we used  these data solely for descriptive purposes and not for the purpose of  making recommendations or drawing conclusions about causality.", "We reviewed studies that analyzed pricing in the municipal securities  market. We limited our survey to those studies using data from 1995 or  later. We did this because prior to 1995, there was no systematic and  comprehensive dissemination of post-trade information for municipal  securities.

In addition, we  attended or viewed the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) field  hearings on the state of the municipal securities market, reviewed industry  literature, and interviewed members of trade organizations representing  institutional investors, broker-dealers (including broker\u2019s brokers), and  individual investors; academics; SEC Office of Municipal Securities Market  officials; MSRB officials and independent municipal market research and  advisory firms. We also reviewed information from these entities on the  availability of pre- and post-trade pricing information in the marketplace,  and we spoke to market participants interested in forming an exchange for  municipal securities. To understand how electronic systems and trading  platforms are used in the trading of municipal securities, we received a  demonstration from Bloomberg on the services it offers to municipal broker- dealers and other subscribers to facilitate municipal securities trading and  analysis. We also reviewed existing alternative trading systems (ATS)  operating in this market by analyzing their annual Form ATSs submitted to  SEC and other descriptive information and received a demonstration from  one ATS of its electronic platform for trading municipal securities.", "To determine how federal regulators enforce MSRB rules to ensure fair  and reasonable prices for investors and the timely and accurate reporting  of municipal trades, we reviewed relevant MSRB rules, guidance, and  proposed rules. We focused on Rules G-30, G-14, G-12, and G-15, which  address pricing, trade reporting, and trade clearance and settlement. We  also reviewed documentation describing RegWeb, the web portal MSRB  makes available to federal regulators to analyze and query RTRS data for  regulatory purposes; the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s  (FINRA) policies and procedures for electronically surveilling RTRS data  for potential violations of MSRB pricing and trade reporting rules; and  FINRA and federal banking regulators\u2019 (Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency, or OCC; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC; and  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal  Reserve) examination procedures for assessing broker-dealer  compliance with these rules.", "We also identified enforcement trends related to Rules G-14 and G-30.  With respect to FINRA, we reviewed results of the periodic surveillance of  trade data it conducted from 2006 to 2010 to monitor broker-dealers and  bank dealers for potential violations of MSRB Rules G-14 and G-30.  These results included the number of alerts FINRA\u2019s surveillance  programs generated on potential G-14 and G-30 violations, as well as the  resolution (for example, no further review, cautionary action, etc.) of each  alert. We also reviewed data from FINRA\u2019s System for Tracking Activities  for Regulatory Policy and Oversight (STAR), which tracks the life cycle of  FINRA\u2019s regulatory matters, on the number of municipal-related broker- dealer examinations FINRA conducted from 2006 to 2010, the number of  those examinations that identified violations of MSRB Rules G-14 and G- 30, and the resolution of each examination. We conducted a reliability  assessment of the FINRA data and determined they were reliable for our  purpose. Specifically, we reviewed information on the STAR system and  FINRA\u2019s policies and procedures for ensuring the data entered into the  STAR system were accurate and complete.", "We reviewed a purposeful sample of 45 examinations FINRA conducted  from 2006 to 2010 in which it identified violations of MSRB Rules G-14 and  G-30. We reviewed these examinations to inform our understanding of how  FINRA examiners applied their policies and procedures for assessing  compliance with Rules G-14 and G-30. First, we selected all 11  examinations that had both G-14 and G-30 violations. Next, we selected an  additional 6 examinations with G-30 violations that were forwarded to other  agencies (such as SEC) for further review or initiated for a specific cause,  as opposed to routine examinations. Third, 8 examinations with G-30  violations were selected systematically by selecting every 4th examination  after ordering the remaining examinations with G-30 violations by the  completion date. Finally, we similarly selected 20 additional examinations  with G-14 violations by selecting every 20th examination from an ordered  listing of remaining examinations with G-14 violations.extrapolate the information in the sample examinations to the universe of  municipal broker-dealer examinations.

We conducted a reliability assessment of the federal  banking regulator data and determined they were reliable for our purpose.  Specifically, we reviewed information from federal banking regulators on  the systems from which they generated the data provided to us and their  policies and procedures for ensuring the data were accurate and  complete.

We reviewed a combined total of 15 examination reports  from these regulators. procedures MSRB uses to identify late trades in RTRS. We determined  these data were reliable for our purposes.", "To identify trends in settlement failures in municipal securities transactions,  we reviewed data from the National Securities Clearing Corporation  (NSCC). This self-regulatory organization (SRO) provides clearance and  settlement services for a variety of securities, including equity, corporate,  and municipal securities. Because NSCC typically does not track  settlement failures by security type, we requested that NSCC perform a  specialized query to provide us with this information. NSCC reviewed a 5- day trading period, from June 6 to June 10, 2011, and provided us with the  dollar value of municipal securities settlement failures, as well as the total  dollar value of all settlement failures, for that period. We did not assess the  reliability of these data because we used the data solely for descriptive  purposes and not for the purpose of making recommendations or drawing  conclusions about causality. However, we corroborated the data by asking  regulators and market participants about their experience with municipal  trade failures, and what they told us was consistent with the trends in the  data.", "To understand how SEC oversees the municipal market, we reviewed the  SEC Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations\u2019 (OCIE)  guidance for conducting oversight inspections of FINRA-registered  broker-dealers, focusing on policies and procedures for assessing  compliance with MSRB rules related to pricing and trade reporting, and  we reviewed OCIE\u2019s guidance for conducting inspections of SROs. We  reviewed data from OCIE on broker-dealer examinations it conducted  from 2002 to 2010 that assessed compliance with municipal securities  rules and regulations, including information on the MSRB rule violations  examiners identified. We conducted a reliability assessment of these data  and determined that there were limitations to how we could use them. We  reviewed information on OCIE\u2019s system for tracking examination data (the  Super Tracking and Reporting System, or STARS), reviewed OCIE\u2019s  policies and procedures for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of  the data, and interviewed OCIE officials. Although we determined that  STARS data are reliable, we learned that STARS does not contain a  unique field that allows users to retrieve all examinations with a municipal  component. Rather, OCIE officials ran a report by searching for key  words that, based on their experience with STARS data, were likely to be  included in an examination with a municipal component. This produced a  list of approximately 1,100 examinations conducted from 2002 to 2010.  We determined this was a reasonable way to proceed to identify a  significant portion of the targeted universe of examinations from which we  would draw selected exams for our review.", "We reviewed a purposeful sample of 35 examinations that OCIE  conducted from 2002 to 2010 in which it identified violations of MSRB  Rules G-14 and G-30. First, we selected all 13 examinations that had G- 30 violations. Four of these examinations also had G-14 violations. We  then selected an additional 22 examinations with G-14 violations (from a  total of 80 examinations with G-14 violations during the time period). For  the latter group, we attempted to select examinations representing the  entire time period and a variety of recommended actions (from minor  deficiency letters to enforcement referrals). We reviewed the  examinations to understand how OCIE examiners applied OCIE\u2019s  examination policies and procedures to assess broker-dealers for  compliance with MSRB rules. However, we did not cite any OCIE  examination statistics in the report, given that the list of 1,100  examinations may not have included all municipal examinations OCIE  conducted from 2002 to 2010, as well as the fact that OCIE uses a risk- based method and does not necessarily review for broker-dealer  compliance with Rules G-30 and G-14 in every examination. We also  reviewed OCIE\u2019s 2002 and 2005 inspections of MSRB and FINRA\u2019s fixed- income program, focusing on OCIE\u2019s review of FINRA\u2019s surveillance,  examination, and enforcement programs for overseeing municipal  securities trading. In addition, we reviewed MSRB\u2019s and FINRA\u2019s  responses to OCIE\u2019s inspection reports.

We focused on trades  that occurred within the period from 30 days prior to and 120 days after  the dated date on municipal securities. We chose to examine this time  frame because we observed that (1) securities in our sample trade most  frequently around the time of issuance, (2) trading activity declines within  days after issuance, and (3) trading activity has typically leveled off by  about 120 days after issuance. Focusing on a period with more trading  activity improves the precision with which we measure the relationships  described below.

To do so, we estimated regressions on  security trades. The dependent variables in these regressions are the  relative price of a trade, and the independent variables in these  regressions are trade amount interacted with trade type and indicator  variables for each security in the sample. The security indicators control  for time-invariant features of a security that may affect the relative price at  which it trades. We estimated separate regressions for securities issued  in each year from 2005 through 2010. We present our regression results  in table 6.

The new fee became effective in January 2011. MSRB expects  the increased transaction fee to generate an estimated $7 million  annually. Second, effective January 2011, dealers in municipal securities  are required to pay a technology fee of $1.00 per transaction for all sales  transactions. MSRB expects the technology fee to generate an estimated  $8.5 million annually. MSRB stated that the technology fee would be  transitional in nature and that it would review the fee periodically to  determine whether it should continue to be assessed.", "MSRB said that these new and increased fees are necessary because its  expenses have increased significantly as a consequence of its capital  investments in technology and the regulatory responsibilities it has  assumed under the Dodd-Frank Act. MSRB said it would use the new  technology fee to establish a technology renewal fund, which would be  segregated for accounting purposes. The technology renewal fund is  intended to fund replacement of aging and outdated technology and to  fund new technology initiatives. For example, MSRB noted that certain of  the existing public information systems it operates, including RTRS, now  rely on dated technology and can be expected to need comprehensive  reengineering in the coming years. In addition, MSRB said that it will need  to develop information systems to facilitate its increased regulatory  responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things,  broadened its mission to include the protection of municipal issuers and  extended its regulatory authority to include municipal advisers.", "The Dodd-Frank Act provided for additional revenue sources for MSRB,  although these revenues are unlikely to represent a significant source of  funding.

However, MSRB officials  said that they did not anticipate these fees would provide a revenue  stream comparable to what MSRB receives from all fees on broker-dealer  activities, including the transaction, underwriting, and technology fees  previously discussed. The Dodd-Frank Act also mandated that SEC and  the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., remit to MSRB a portion  of the fines collected for violation of MSRB rules. Effective October 2010,  SEC must remit half of the fines it collects to MSRB, and FINRA must  remit one-third, although that amount may be modified by agreement  among SEC, MSRB, and FINRA.
