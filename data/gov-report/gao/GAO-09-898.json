A congressional commission, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Army have concluded the Army will need to continue to use its reserve components as an operational force. The transition will require changes to force structure as well as manning and equipping strategies that could cost billions of dollars. The 2009 Defense Authorization Act directed GAO to study this transition. This report provides additional information on (1) progress and challenges the Army faces, (2) to what extent the Army has estimated costs for the transition and included them in its projected spending plans, and (3) the effect of the operational role on the Guard's availability to state governors for domestic missions. GAO examined planning, policy, and budget documents, and relevant sections of Titles 10 and 32 of the U.S. Code; and met with DOD, Army, reserve component, and state officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army is changing the organization and missions of some of its reserve units to provide more operational forces, and is increasing their personnel and equipment, but faces challenges in achieving the predictable and sustainable mobilization cycle envisioned for an operational force, primarily due to the high pace of operations. The Army is reorganizing its reserve units to match their active counterparts, is changing the missions of some units, has made plans to add over 9,000 personnel by 2013, and has requested almost $23 billion for reserve equipment since 2003. To guide the transition, DOD has established principles and policies, such as a 1-year limit on reserve mobilizations, and set a goal of providing reservists 5 years between mobilizations. However, heavy operational demands have meant that many reservists have had significantly less than 5 years between mobilizations. To make the most of the limited mobilization time available, DOD directed the services to provide sufficient resources to support reserve forces to be nearly ready to deploy before mobilization. In the past, reserve component forces often required significant time after mobilization to prepare individuals and units for deployment. However, the Army is continuing to need to improve readiness after mobilization by addressing medical and dental issues, or transferring personnel and equipment from nondeployed units to fill shortfalls. Until demand eases, it seems unlikely that the Army will be able to achieve the mobilization cycle it initially envisioned for the reserves. The Army developed initial cost estimates for transitioning its reserve components to an operational role, but has not budgeted for most of the costs it identified. A 2008 estimate identified costs of about $24 billion over a 6-year period from 2010 to 2015 to increase full-time support personnel, training days, recruiting and retention incentives, and installation support, among others. However, because the Army has not yet established the specific equipping, manning, and training levels required of an operational reserve, it is difficult to assess the estimate's validity. The Army established a task force to develop an implementation plan for the transition, and Army leadership is currently reviewing a draft plan and awaiting the results of other studies, such as a review of full-time support needs. However, pending the results of these studies and agreement on an implementation plan, the Army does not expect to budget for such costs until 2012. Best practices have shown that effective and efficient operations require detailed plans outlining major implementation tasks, metrics and timelines to measure success, and a comprehensive and realistic funding strategy. Until the Army finalizes an implementation plan and fully estimates the transition costs, and includes these costs in its projected spending plans, it will be difficult to assess the Army's progress in transitioning its reserve component to a sustainable operational force. The operational role has reduced the Guard's availability for domestic missions, but the effect on the states remains unclear because states mitigate shortfalls with mutual support agreements and requirements for some domestic missions remain undefined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the demand for Army  forces has been high, and the Army has relied heavily upon its reserve  components\u2014the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve\u2014to meet  operational requirements. As of May 2009, about 475,000 members of the  Army\u2019s reserve components had been activated for ongoing operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan as well as other missions worldwide, representing  the largest activation of reservists since the Korean War. The high pace of  operations has meant that the reserve components\u2019 Cold War role has  evolved from a strategic reserve that would be used to supplement active  duty forces in the event of extended conflict to an operational force  characterized by ongoing rotational deployments.", "As a strategic reserve, the reserve components were not maintained to be  immediately ready for deployment, and it was expected that they would  receive additional equipment, personnel, and training after they were  mobilized. However, as an operational force, reserve units need to build  and maintain readiness prior to mobilization to support recurring  deployments. Some capabilities that have been in especially high demand  for stability and counterinsurgency operations, such as civil affairs and  psychological operations, reside heavily in the reserve component,  creating an especially high pace of operations for reservists with these  skills. In 2006, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Quadrennial Defense  Review established that to use the reserve components as a viable  operational force, reservists and units must be more accessible and readily  deployable. In 2008, the congressionally chartered Commission on the  National Guard and Reserves found there was no reasonable alternative to  increased reliance on the reserve components given the current threats,  fiscal challenges, projected demand for forces, and the unique capabilities  resident in the reserves. In that same year, U.S. Army Forces Command  similarly concluded that using the reserve components as an operational  force was the Army\u2019s best option for meeting its needs. According to the  Army, other options available including full mobilization, significantly  enlarging the active component, and maintaining or adapting the strategic  reserve were infeasible, impractical, or unsustainable. DOD has  acknowledged that the reserve component is now an integral part of the  operating force, in addition to its strategic reserve role, and the Army is  undertaking initiatives designed to enhance the capability of both active  and reserve forces and to provide a more predictable deployment  schedule.", "Over the last few years, we have examined the effects of expanded  mission requirements on the Army National Guard and Army Reserve,  including their new operational roles in supporting both large-scale, long- duration overseas operations and emerging domestic requirements. In July  2005, we reported that, while the Army Reserve has provided ready forces  to support military operations since September 11, 2001, it was becoming  increasingly difficult to continue to provide these forces due to personnel  and equipment shortages. In October 2005, we reported that the high pace  of operations has also caused a strain on the Army National Guard\u2019s  equipment inventories that could be used for domestic missions. In  September 2006, we testified before the congressionally chartered  Commission on National Guard and Reserves that equipment shortages  and personnel challenges have increased in the National Guard and Army  Reserve, which if left unattended may hamper the reserve components\u2019  preparedness for future overseas and domestic missions. In January 2007,  we further reported that planning for the National Guard\u2019s response to  large-scale, catastrophic events is not complete and that the National  Guard may not be prepared to respond as efficiently and effectively as  possible to domestic events. We have also previously reported that the  operational readiness of reserve forces has been hampered by long- standing problems with reservists\u2019 medical and physical condition and that  DOD is unable to determine the extent to which the reserve force has  complied with routine examinations due to a lack of complete or reliable  data. A list of related GAO products is included at the end of this report.", "The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2009 directed GAO to report on the use of the Army\u2019s reserve  components as an operational reserve. Specifically, we were asked to  include in our report a description of current and programmed resources,  force structure, and any organizational challenges that the Army\u2019s reserve  components may face serving as an operational reserve including  challenges related to force structure; manning; equipment availability,  maintenance, and logistics issues; and any conflicts with requirements  under Title 32 of the United States Code. We satisfied that mandate by  providing a briefing on our preliminary observations addressing these  issues to the congressional defense committees in June 2009. This report  provides additional information related to the questions addressed in  response to the mandate. Specifically, this report examines: (1) steps the  Army has taken and the challenges it faces in transitioning its reserve  force structure, manning, and equipping, and logistics strategies, (2) the  extent to which the Army has estimated costs required for the reserve  components\u2019 transition to the operational role and included these in its  budget and Future Years Defense Program, and (3) the effect of the  National Guard\u2019s federal operational role on its availability to state  governors for domestic missions.", "To determine the extent to which the Army has modified the force  structure as well as the manning and equipping strategies of its reserve  components to meet the requirements of the operational role, and to  identify the challenges, if any, the Army faces in completing the transition,  we reviewed Army plans and policy documents, reports of the  Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, and DOD reports to  Congress on related initiatives and issues. We also reviewed program and  policy documents and interviewed officials with DOD, Army, National  Guard Bureau, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, U.S. Army Forces  Command, and First Army. Further, we incorporated information from  surveys of a nonprobability sample of 24 Army National Guard or Army  Reserve units, as well as follow-up interviews with officials from 15 of  these units. The surveys and interviews addressed a range of training,  equipment, and personnel issues. To evaluate the current and projected  resources for transitioning the reserve components to the operational role,  we reviewed current Army plans, policy and budget documents, DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 supplemental appropriations request, and DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2009 and 2010 budget requests. To determine the effect of the  National Guard\u2019s federal operational role on its availability to state  governors for domestic missions, we reviewed relevant sections of Titles  10 and 32 of the United States Code and conducted interviews with the  National Guard Bureau and offices of the Adjutants General of four states  (Virginia, Missouri, Washington, and Florida). We selected states that had  a history of major disaster declarations and that also contained units that  are in demand for both overseas and domestic missions. We conducted  this performance audit from July 2008 through July 2009 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. The scope and methodology used in our review are  described in further detail in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, the Army Reserve and Army National Guard had about  197,000 and 360,400 soldiers, respectively, comprising 51 percent of the  total Army, which also includes the active component. The Army  organizes, trains, and equips its reserve components to perform assigned  missions. The Army Reserve is a federal force that is organized and trained  primarily to supply specialized combat support and combat service  support skills to combat forces. The Army National Guard is composed of  both combat forces and units that supply support skills, but in contrast to  the Army Reserve, the Army National Guard has dual federal and state  missions. When not called to active duty for a federal mission, Army  National Guard units remain under the command and control of the  governors, typically training for their federal mission or conducting state  missions. In addition, National Guard forces can be mobilized under Title  32 of the United States Code for certain federally funded, domestic  missions conducted under the command of the governors such as  providing security at the nation\u2019s airports in the immediate aftermath of  the September 11 terrorist attacks and assisting the Gulf Coast in the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Both reserve components are composed  primarily of citizen soldiers who balance the demands of civilian careers  with part-time military service.", "Reserve forces may be involuntarily called to active duty under three  mobilization authorities. As shown in table 1, the President may  involuntarily mobilize forces under two authorities with size and time  limitations. Full mobilization, which would authorize the mobilization of  forces for as long as they are needed, requires a declaration by Congress.", "In September 2001, following President Bush\u2019s declaration of a national  emergency resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, DOD  issued mobilization guidance that, among other things, allowed the  services to mobilize reservists for up to 24 cumulative months under the  President\u2019s partial mobilization authority. In January 2007, the Secretary of  Defense issued updated guidance on the utilization of the force that,  among other things, limits involuntary reserve component mobilizations to  no more than 1 year at a time.", "During the Cold War, the Army\u2019s reserve components principally operated  as a force in reserve, or strategic reserve, that would supplement active  forces in the event of extended conflict. Members of the reserves generally  served 39 days a year\u20141 weekend a month and an additional 2 weeks of  duty. In addition, the reserve components have a small number of full-time  personnel, Active Guard and Reserve personnel and military technicians,  that perform the necessary day-to-day tasks such as maintaining unit  equipment and planning training events that reserve units need to  accomplish in order to maintain readiness for their mission and be able to  deploy. The Army\u2019s resourcing strategy for a strategic reserve provided  reserve units with varying levels of resources according to the priority  assigned to their federal warfighting missions. Most reserve component  units were provided with between 65 and 74 percent of their required  personnel and 65 to 79 percent of their required equipment. This approach  assumed that most reserve component forces would have a lengthy  mobilization period with enough time to fully man, equip, and train their  units after they were mobilized to attain the high level of operational  readiness necessary for deployment.", "Since September 11, 2001, however, the demand for Army forces and  capabilities has been high, especially to support ongoing operations in Iraq  and Afghanistan. Recognizing that its forces were being stressed by the  demands of lengthy and repeated deployments, the Army has adopted a  new force-generation model intended to improve units\u2019 readiness over  time as they move through phased training to prepare to be ready for a  potential deployment. This contrasts with the previous approach in which,  as a strategic reserve, units\u2019 personnel and equipment levels were  maintained below warfighting readiness levels until they were mobilized.  Under the Army\u2019s new model, the early phases of the cycle will entail  formation and staffing of the unit and beginning individual and collective  training, while later phases will concentrate on larger unit training. Figure  1 illustrates the planned movement of units through the reset, train/ready,  and available phases of the Army force-generation model.", "Under the Army\u2019s force-generation model as designed, reserve component  units would be available for deployment for 1 year with 5 years between  deployments. After returning home from a deployment, units remain in the  reset phase for a fixed 1-year period and focus on restoring personnel and  equipment readiness so that they can resume training for future missions.  Following the reset phase, units enter the train/ready phases in which they  progressively increase their training proficiency by completing individual  and collective training tasks. As designed in the force-generation model,  reserve component units remain in the train/ready phases for 4 years,  although the amount of time is not fixed and may be reduced to meet  operational demands. Upon completion of the train/ready phases, units  enter the available year in which they can be mobilized to meet specific  mission requirements. Under current DOD policy, involuntary reserve  component mobilizations are limited to no more than 1 year in length. The  force-generation process requires increasing resources for units to use in  training to gain higher levels of proficiency prior to mobilization. \u201cThe reserve components provide operational capabilities and strategic depth to meet U.S.  defense requirements across the full spectrum of conflict. In their operational roles,  reserve components participate in a full range of missions according to their Services\u2019  force-generation plans. Units and individuals participate in missions in an established  cyclic or periodic manner that provides predictability for the combatant commands, the  Services, Service members, their families and employers. In their strategic roles, reserve  component units and individuals train or are available for missions in accordance with the  national defense strategy. As such, the reserve components provide strategic depth and are  available to transition to operational roles as needed.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Taken Steps to Adapt the Reserve Components, but It Faces Challenges in Achieving a Sustainable Mobilization Cycle and Meeting Premobilization Readiness Standards", "paragraphs": ["The Army has made a number of changes to its force structure, as well as  to its manning and equipping strategies to better position its reserve  components for the operational role.

In contrast to the Army\u2019s  previous division-based force with many different types of unique forces,  the modular forces were designed to be standardized and interoperable so  forces could be more easily tailored to meet operational needs. Under the  modular reorganization, National Guard and Army Reserve units are to  have the same designs, organizational structures, and equipment as their  active component counterparts so that they can be operationally employed  in the same manner as active component units. The Army reported in its  2009 Campaign Plan that it has converted or begun converting 256 (84  percent) of the 303 planned brigade formations. However, the Army has  been focused on equipping and staffing units to support ongoing  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the equipment and personnel levels  in nondeployed units have been declining. Further, as previously reported,  the Army does not have a plan with clear milestones in place to guide  efforts to equip and staff units that have been converted to the modular  design, and the Army now anticipates that the converted modular units  will not be fully staffed and equipped until 2019\u2014more than a decade  away. Furthermore, without adequate planning, the Army risks cost  growth and further timeline slippage in its efforts to transform to a more  modular and capable force.", "The Army is changing the missions of some Army organizations and  retraining soldiers to produce more soldiers and units with high-demand  skills. For example, the Army is decreasing its supply of air defense,  armor, and field artillery capabilities in order to increase its supply of  special operations, civil affairs, and military police capabilities. The Army  began these rebalancing efforts in fiscal year 2003 after military operations  in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks generated high  demand for certain forces. Among those forces in high demand were  certain combat support and combat service support forces such as military  police and transportation units. These support forces, which are also  called enablers, reside heavily in the reserve components. The goals of  rebalancing included helping to ease stress on units and individuals with  high-demand skills and meeting the Army\u2019s goal of executing the first 30  days of an operation without augmentation from the reserve component.  As part of the rebalancing plan, the Army National Guard is converting six  brigade combat teams into four maneuver enhancement brigades and two  battlefield surveillance brigades that will perform combat support roles.  As of February 2009, the Army reported that it had completed rebalancing  70,400 positions, about 50 percent of the approximately 142,300 positions  scheduled to be rebalanced by 2015 across the active and reserve  components.", "The Army is also increasing personnel within the reserve components. In  January 2007, the Secretary of Defense announced an initiative to expand  the total Army by approximately 74,200 soldiers to better meet long-term  operational requirements, sustain the all-volunteer force, and build  towards a goal of 5 years between mobilizations for the reserve  components. This initiative is expected to add 8,200 soldiers to the Army  National Guard by 2010; 65,000 soldiers to the active component by fiscal  year 2010; and 1,000 soldiers to the Army Reserve by 2013. The Secretary  of Defense expects that with a larger force, individuals and units will, over  time, deploy less frequently and have longer times at home between  deployments. However, we have previously reported that the Army has not  developed a comprehensive funding plan for the expansion initiative and  that, lacking a complete and accurate plan, Congress and other decision  makers may not have the information they need to consider the long-term  costs and benefits associated with increasing Army personnel levels or  gauge the amount of funding that should be appropriated to implement the  initiative.", "The Army eliminated some reserve force-structure positions that  previously had been intentionally unfilled, largely for budgetary reasons.  Specifically, the Army\u2019s force-structure rebalancing, which began in fiscal  year 2003, and the modular transformation efforts that began in 2004  reduced the force structure allowances for the Army National Guard by 7  percent from 376,105 to 349,157 and Army Reserve by about 4 percent  from 213,324 to 205,028 between 2005 and 2009. Concurrently, the Army\u2019s  Grow the Force plan increased the Army National Guard\u2019s size by almost 2  percent from 352,700 soldiers in fiscal year 2007 to 358,200 by fiscal year  2010 and the Army Reserve\u2019s size by 3 percent from 200,000 soldiers in  fiscal year 2007 to 206,000 by 2013. When the reserve components were  solely a strategic reserve, the Army routinely authorized units to be  assigned fewer personnel than would be required for their wartime  mission under the assumption that units could receive additional  personnel when mobilized. By reducing the number of units, the Army was  able to authorize the remaining units to be more fully manned.", "DOD established a policy in 2008 to promote and support the management  of the reserve components as an operational force. The policy directed  the services to align reserve component force structures, to the extent  practicable, with established DOD goals for frequency and duration of  utilization for units and individuals. In addition, the policy instructs the  service Secretaries to manage their reserve components such that they  provide operational capabilities while also maintaining strategic depth to  meet U.S. military requirements across the full spectrum of conflict.  Further, the policy directs the Secretaries to ensure sufficient depth of  reserve component unit and individual capabilities to meet DOD\u2019s  established force-utilization goals.

The Army has increased the number of personnel in  reserve component units, given units higher priority for personnel as they  near availability for deployment in the rotational cycle, established some  personnel readiness goals, and modified its recruiting and retention  strategies.", "The operational role has several implications for how the Army staffs its  reserve component units. First, as an operational force, Army reserve  component units are now expected to be available to deploy for 1 year  with 5 years between deployments and more frequently when the Army  faces increased demand for forces by the combatant commanders. To  prepare for regular deployments, the Army now expects its reserve  component units to progressively increase their personnel readiness on a  cyclical basis as they near availability for deployment. The Army  determines a unit\u2019s personnel readiness level by comparing the unit\u2019s level  of available strength to the number of personnel required by the unit.  Available strength is the portion of the unit\u2019s assigned strength that is  available for deployment to accomplish the unit\u2019s assigned wartime  mission. To be available, these personnel must meet a number of  administrative, medical, and dental requirements and must meet their  individual qualifications. As an operational force, reserve component  units need to make efficient use of training time before deployment and  build a cohesive force needed to achieve collective training proficiency.", "DOD\u2019s policy that the service Secretaries program and execute resources  as required to support a \u201ctrain-mobilize-deploy\u201d model means that units  need to achieve high levels of personnel readiness and complete most of  their training requirements prior to mobilization. This approach to training  and mobilization contrasts with the strategic reserve\u2019s \u201cmobilize-train- deploy\u201d approach in which units would be brought up to full personnel  strength and soldiers\u2019 medical and dental issues would be addressed after  mobilization. To implement the train-mobilize-deploy model, the Army has  found that it needs to stabilize unit personnel by the time the unit is  alerted for deployment or as early as possible in the force-generation cycle  so that the unit can attain as much collective training proficiency as  possible prior to mobilization.

The current full-time  support requirement is based on a manpower study conducted in 1999  when the reserve components were still primarily a strategic reserve. In  subsequent years, the Army reviewed and adjusted the manpower analysis  but it did not conduct an analysis that incorporated the needs of an  operational reserve. The last review performed was completed in 2006,  prior to the issuance of the Secretary of Defense policy that limited  involuntary mobilizations to 1 year and before an increased emphasis was  placed on premobilization readiness. In 2007, the Army directed a study  designed, in part, to measure the readiness benefit to the Army of  increasing its reserve components\u2019 full-time support. However, because of  data limitations, the Army could not quantify the effect of full-time support  on unit readiness. As a result, the Army initiated an additional study to  determine the link between full-time support levels and unit readiness  before including additional funding for full-time support in future budget  requests.

A 2008 Army study of the pre- and postmobilization preparation  of five Army National Guard brigade combat teams that mobilized betw October 2007 and January 2008 found that none of the five units met  deployment standards for the levels of personnel with individua qualifications and medical readiness when they arrived at their  mobilization stations.

Such steps include  addressing medical and dental issues and transferring personnel from  nondeployed to deploying units to fill shortages. For example, according  to Army mobilization officials, one unit that mobilized in September 2008  required the transfer of more than 900 soldiers, or 22 percent of the 4,122  required personnel, from other units within 2 weeks of its mobilization  date in order to fill shortages and man the unit to a deployable level.  Further, our surveys of and interviews with 24 recently deployed reserve  component units found that nearly all of those units had to receive  personnel transfers from outside their units to achieve the required  personnel levels for deployment. According to Army officials, such  transfers disrupt unit stability and cause personnel turbulence at a time  when the units are working to attain collective training proficiency in  preparation for deployment. Additionally, Army officials stated that  personnel transfers disrupt premobilization training plans when they  occur within the last 6 months prior to a unit\u2019s mobilization date because  more training has to be done after mobilization, which reduces operational  availability to theater commanders.

As previously reported, these evolving requirements have made it difficult  for the Army to communicate to deploying units what equipment will be  needed in-theater and has challenged the reserve components to identify  and transfer the right items. Moreover, the Army has directed reserve  component units returning from overseas deployments to leave in-theater  certain essential equipment items that are in short supply for use by  follow-on forces.

First, the Army has not yet defined which cost categories are essential for  an operational reserve component, so costs could be added or removed  from the estimate. For example, the Army has not decided whether  activities recommended by the Commission on National Guard and  Reserves, such as providing housing allowance for activated reservists and  reimbursing certain reservists for travel, are essential for an operational  reserve and should be included as transition costs. Estimated costs for  implementing these recommendations were not included in the  preliminary estimate or the 2009 updates and, if included, could  significantly increase costs. The Army has estimated that providing  housing allowance for activated reservists could add from $170 million to  $400 million annually and reimbursing travel expenses for certain  reservists participating in individual training would add about $580 million  annually. The Army has not estimated costs to implement other  commission recommendations, such as the costs to increase the capacity  of training institutions and increase staff support to the Employer Support  of Guard and Reserves program. Second, the Army has not decided on  the level of resources that will be required in other cost categories. For  example, the Army has not established the specific personnel, training,  and equipment levels its reserve components will require in each phase of  the force-generation cycle. Third, several studies are underway to examine  the level of resources required for full-time support, medical and dental  benefits, and incentives changes for the operational role. If readiness  requirements, full-time support, medical and dental benefits, or incentives  are increased above current levels, costs for the transition to the  operational role could increase.

Since  National Guard units have begun deploying for their federal missions,  states have made plans to compensate for any shortfalls in availability of  their Guard forces either by relying on other capabilities and resources  within the state or by relying on assistance from other states obtained  through mutual support arrangements. National Guard officials from all of  the four states that we visited reported that they routinely coordinate with  other states and utilize mutual assistance agreements to ensure they can  respond effectively to domestic requirements when state forces are  deployed.

Similarly, Guard officials in Virginia told us that its  brigade combat team, comprising about 54 percent of the state\u2019s National  Guard forces, will be deployed at the same time as the state\u2019s aviation  battalion resulting in a large loss of forces and essential capabilities for  domestic response missions. To mitigate for this loss, Virginia National  Guard officials stated they rely on mutual support arrangements with  other states and cross training of the state\u2019s soldiers.

Although the  Army has taken steps to modify its force structure and adapted its  personnel and equipping strategies for the operational role, heavy  operational demands have hampered the Army\u2019s efforts to implement the  force-generation model as intended. For example, the Army has not  established firm readiness requirements for an operational reserve  component or fully incorporated the resources needed to support the  operational role into its budget and projected spending plan. Although the  Army continues to study key costs, incorporating the necessary resources  into its budget and projected spending plan is needed to effectively  implement the force-generation model and support the reserve  components in their new role. Adapting the Army\u2019s institutions and  incorporating the resources needed to support the cyclical readiness of an  operational reserve component into its base budget will be a long-term  effort estimated to take more than 10 years to complete. The  implementation of these changes will span multiple administrations and  Congresses and require many billions of dollars and, therefore, needs  sound management controls to guide the effort and ensure success. The  Army currently plans to request the majority of funding to complete the  transition to an operational force in its fiscal year 2012-2017 budget;  however, it has not finalized a cost estimate or detailed implementation  plan that identifies what specific requirements have been and remain to be  filled. The lack of outcome-related metrics also hampers the Army\u2019s ability  to measure its progress towards fully operationalizing its reserve  components and justifying the large expenditure of funds required to  implement the transition. Until the Army adopts an implementation plan  outlining its requirements for transitioning its reserve components to an  operational force, identifying progress made to date, and detailing  additional personnel and other resources required, DOD decision makers  and Congress will not be in a sound position to determine the total costs  to complete the transition and decide how to best allocate future funding.  Moreover, without effective management controls over these initiatives to  help measure progress and to accomplish effective and efficient  operations, the Army risks continued challenges in preparing ready units  and providing reservists a sustainable balance between military and  civilian careers, which, over time, could threaten the viability of the all- volunteer citizen soldier force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to take the following three actions:    Finalize an implementation plan for transitioning its reserve components  to the operational role that describes the key tasks necessary for the  transition, assigns responsibility for these tasks, defines metrics for  measuring success, and establishes timelines for full implementation.", "Complete a cost estimate for the transition that, at a minimum, should    a clear definition of what costs the Army does and does not consider to be  related to the transition to an operational force;    estimates for key cost drivers; and  identification of any uncertainties in the estimates due to pending changes  to the reserve components\u2019 force structure, personnel, training, and  equipping strategies or other decisions that may affect costs, and updates  to the plan as these decisions are made.

DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in  appendix II.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to finalize an implementation plan for  transitioning its reserve components to the operational role. In its  comments, it cited DOD Directive 1200.17 that directs the Secretaries of  the military departments to manage their respective reserve components  as an operational force such that they provide operational capabilities  while maintaining strategic depth. However, this directive does not  provide detailed direction on how the services should transition the  reserve forces, and we believe that a detailed plan is necessary to ensure  key tasks in managing the reserves as an operational force are completed.  DOD also drew a distinction between managing the reserve components as  an operational force and transitioning reserves to an operational force. In  this report, we defined transitioning reserves to an operational force as  implementing those steps necessary to adapt the Army\u2019s institutions and  resources to support the cyclical readiness requirements and implement  the \u201ctrain-mobilize-deploy\u201d model. We believe that completing a detailed  implementation plan that describes key tasks necessary for the transition,  assigns responsibility for these tasks, defines metrics for measuring  success, and establishes time lines for full implementation is an essential  part of transitioning the reserve components to an operational force.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to complete a cost estimate for the  transition that includes a definition of costs, estimates for key cost drivers,  and areas of uncertainties, such as pending policy decisions, that may  affect costs. However, the department did not describe the steps it will  take to complete the estimate. We therefore believe the Secretary of  Defense should provide specific direction and guidance as outlined in our  recommendation.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to include the costs of the transition in  the Army\u2019s budget and Future Years Defense Program. In its comments,  DOD noted its published guidance, Directive 1200.17, that resourcing plans  should ensure visibility to track resources from formulation,  appropriation, and allocation through execution. However, as discussed in  the report, the Army does not plan to include the majority of the estimated  costs for transitioning its reserve components to an operational role until  fiscal year 2012. Until the Army includes the resources required in its  future spending plans it will be hampered in its ability to transition its  reserve components to the operational role.", "We are sending copies of this report to other appropriate congressional  committees and the Secretary of Defense.

We also reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials from offices of National Guard Adjutants General in  four case-study states: Florida, Missouri, Virginia, and Washington. These  states were selected because they had a history of major disaster  declarations; are geographically dispersed across the United States; have a  brigade combat team presence or a Chemical, Biological, Radiological,  Nuclear, and high-yield Explosive (CBRNE) Enhanced Response Force  Package (CERFP) team (which are units that are dual-tasked with  domestic responsibilities) or both; face a range of homeland security risks;  and present a range of population sizes.", "To identify the extent to which the Army has made progress but faces  challenges in modifying the force structure, manning, and equipping  strategies of its reserve components to meet the requirements of the  operational role, we reviewed prior GAO work, reports of the Commission  on the National Guard and Reserves, reports to Congress on related  initiatives and issues, current Army plans and policy documents, including  the Army Campaign Plan, Army Structure Memorandums, Army Forces  Command\u2019s concept plan for Army Initiative 4 (transition the reserve  components to an operational force), Army Forces Command\u2019s 4 + 1 Army  National Guard Brigade Combat Team Comprehensive Review, the  National Guard and Reserve Equipment Report, DOD Directive 1200.17,  Managing the Reserve Components as an Operational Force, and  Headquarters Department of the Army Execution Order 150-18 Reserve  Component Deployment Expeditionary Force Pre- and Post-Mobilization  Training Strategy. We also reviewed Army data on actual and planned  modular unit restructuring, total force structure changes, and the expected  number of reserve component soldiers available each year at varying  mobilization rates under the currently planned rotational force structures  in order to assess changes made to the reserve components\u2019 force  structure for the operational role. In addition, we reviewed Army National  Guard and Army Reserve force-structure allowances, personnel end  strength, and equipment on hand to assess the extent to which the Army  and reserve components have made changes to more fully man and equip  units for the operational role. Further, we incorporated information from  surveys of a nonprobability sample of 24 Army National Guard or Army  Reserve units, as well as follow-up interviews with officials from 15 of  these units. We selected units of different types and sizes that had  returned from deployments in the last 12 months. In addition, we chose  the proportion of Army National Guard and Reserve units for our sample  based on the proportion of mobilized forces from each of the components.  The surveys and interviews addressed a range of training, equipment, and  personnel issues. We supplemented this information by reviewing  documents and interviewing officials from DOD, Army, National Guard  Bureau, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, U.S. Army Forces  Command, and First Army to discuss planned and ongoing policy and  strategy changes for transitioning the reserve components to an  operational force. Further, we incorporated information from interviews  with officials from offices of National Guard Adjutants General in case- study states.", "To determine the extent to which the Army has estimated costs for the  transition of the reserve components to an operational force and included  them in its current budget and Future Years Defense Program, we  reviewed DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 supplemental appropriations request and  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 and 2010 budget requests. We also examined the  Army\u2019s cost estimates for operationalizing the reserve components,  including Army Forces Command\u2019s concept plan for Army Initiative 4  (AI4)\u2014transitioning the reserve components to an operational force\u2014and  a Center for Army Analysis cost-benefit analysis of the AI4 concept plan.  In addition, we interviewed officials from DOD, the Army, Army Forces  Command, the National Guard Bureau, the Army National Guard, and the  Army Reserve in order to understand assumptions made in estimating the  cost for transforming the reserve components to an operational force, to  assess the extent to which those costs have been included in DOD\u2019s  budget and Future Years Defense Program, and to identify whether the  Army has an implementation plan that includes the full cost of the  transition.", "To determine the effect of the National Guard\u2019s federal operational role on  its availability to state governors for domestic missions, we reviewed  relevant sections of Titles 10 and 32 of the U.S. Code, and DOD directives  regarding management of the reserve components as an operational force  and National Guard homeland defense activities. We also conducted  interviews with the National Guard Bureau and offices of National Guard  Adjutants General in the four states chosen for our case study concerning  the possibility of conflicts between the states\u2019 National Guard  requirements and Title 32 requirements related to the operational role of  the National Guard.
