The restrictions include a ban, for 1 year, on all former senior and very senior employees of federal agencies from representing, aiding, or advising a foreign government or political party with the intent to influence a government official, including the President, Vice President, and members of Congress. Level of pay and certain designated positions are used to categorize employees as \"senior\" or \"very senior.\" A life-time ban on representing or advising foreign entities in this capacity applies to former U.S. Trade Representatives and Deputy Trade Representatives. In addition, all former federal employees who participated personally and substantially in an ongoing treaty negotiation are prohibited for 1 year from aiding any other person in that negotiation, if the employee had access to certain nonpublic information. Ethics officials at USTR, ITA, and USITC reported that they counsel current, as well as former, employees on post-employment restrictions. Justice officials said they viewed the Revolving Door law as being more useful as a preventative measure rather than a tool for prosecution; they believed that guidance from agency ethics officials deterred most violations. In contrast to post-employment restrictions specific to former government officials, FARA and LDA are disclosure laws that require all individuals, unless exempt, to publicly disclose certain foreign representation or lobbying activity. Individuals who act as agents of foreign governments or foreign political parties must register with Justice's Registration Unit. Individuals who conduct a certain amount of lobbying must register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

This  law prohibits federal employees from engaging in certain activities with  the intent to influence government action for various periods of time once  they have left federal government employment. With the signing of  Executive Order 13490 in January 2009, President Obama has placed  additional emphasis on ethics commitments for executive branch  personnel, requiring each of his full-time, non-career appointees to sign an  ethics pledge that lengthens the time of certain post-employment  restrictions applicable to them and prohibits them from engaging in  certain lobbying activities for the remainder of the Obama administration.", "In addition to these post-employment restrictions, there are certain  registration requirements for representational activities that affect all  individuals, not just former government personnel.

We interviewed officials from the Office of  Government Ethics (OGE) regarding interpretation and implementation of  post-employment restrictions. We interviewed ethics officials from USTR,  ITA, and USITC regarding these laws and the guidance they provide to  current and former employees of their respective agencies. We included  USTR and ITA in our scope because their respective missions concern  trade policy formulation and trade promotion. We included the USITC  because of its role in administering U.S. trade remedy laws and providing  independent analysis on trade matters. We interviewed Justice officials  regarding administration of FARA and enforcement actions for post- employment restrictions and FARA. We obtained data on the number of  former senior officials who separated from USTR, ITA, and USITC from  2004  through 2009 from each of the respective agencies as well as from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File. We  focused our work specifically on the number of former senior officials  separated from these agencies because post-employment restrictions are  more stringent for former senior and very senior officials, although we  also obtained the number of all separated employees from these three  agencies from the Central Personnel Data File for contextual purposes.  From Justice, we obtained data on the number of these former senior  officials who had registered under FARA after separating from the  government. From the Clerk of the House of Representatives, we obtained  data on the number of these former senior officials who had registered as  lobbyists after separating from the government.

Congress broadened  post-employment restrictions as part of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989,  including, for example, a restriction against certain former government  officials representing, aiding, or advising on foreign entities. The  executive branch promotes compliance with post-employment restrictions  through agency ethics-in-government programs, which are guided by OGE,  an executive branch agency. OGE is responsible for providing overall  direction to executive branch policies related to preventing conflicts of  interests on the part of officers and employees of any executive agency.  Individual agencies are responsible for the day-to-day administration of  their own ethics programs.", "In contrast to post-employment restrictions specific to former government  personnel, there are federal disclosure statutes concerning foreign  representation and lobbying activities that affect all individuals.

LDA is a disclosure law that requires all individuals working  a certain percentage of the time as lobbyists to publicly disclose these  activities. Lobbying regulations began with the Federal Regulation of  Lobbying Act of 1946, which required lobbyists to disclose the identities of  their clients, report the receipts and expenses involved, and describe the  nature of the legislative objectives that were pursued for each client.  Lobbying was interpreted under the 1946 act as direct communication  with a member of Congress in an attempt to influence the passage or  defeat of any proposed or pending legislation. Congress replaced this law  with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, which expanded the definition  of lobbying to include communications with \u201ccovered\u201d employees in both  the legislative and executive branch regarding legislation, regulations,  policies, or the nomination or confirmation of a person for a position  subject to confirmation by the Senate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-Employment Restrictions for Former Federal Officials and Disclosure Laws Related to Foreign Representation and Lobbying", "paragraphs": ["Post-employment restrictions in the Revolving Door law prohibit federal  employees from engaging in certain conduct with the intent to influence  government officials for a specified period of time after leaving federal  employment.

Consequently, the prohibition no longer applies to former government  employees who negotiated trade agreements. As a result, former  employees may advise another party on \u201ccovered\u201d information related to  trade negotiations as long as doing so would not violate other provisions  of the Revolving Door law.

In particular, the Civil Division  reported that the division had received no referrals of Revolving Door  violations by USTR, ITA, and USITC officials in at least 15 years. Second, it  is difficult to bring cases to a criminal level because Justice must show  that the former employee knowingly broke the law. One Justice official  noted that it is difficult to prove that the former employee knew he or she  was violating the law and that it is often hard to prove that the employee\u2019s  actions resulted in real harm.

We interviewed officials from the Office of  Government Ethics (OGE) regarding the interpretation and  implementation of the Revolving Door law. We interviewed ethics officials  from USTR, ITA, and USITC regarding these laws and the guidance these  officials provide to current, separating, and former employees of their  respective agencies. We included USTR and ITA in our scope because  their respective missions concern trade policy formulation and trade  promotion. We included the USITC because of its role in administering  U.S. trade remedy laws and providing independent analysis on trade  matters. We interviewed Department of Justice (Justice) officials  regarding administration of FARA and enforcement actions for post- employment restrictions and FARA.", "We focused our work specifically on the number of former senior and very  senior officials separated from these agencies because post-employment  restrictions are more stringent for former senior and very senior officials.  We obtained data on the number of former senior officials who separated  from USTR, ITA, and USITC from 2004 through 2009 from each of the  respective agencies and cross-referenced these data with data we  extracted from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel  Data File. We defined \u201csenior\u201d as being any official who met the definition  of \u201csenior employee\u201d in the post-employment restrictions on former  federal employees:    Employees whose rate of pay was specified in or fixed according to the  Executive Schedule.", "For employees whose rate of pay was not tied to the Executive Schedule,  any employee whose rate of basic pay was at 86.5 percent or higher of the  rate of basic pay for Level II of the Executive Schedule.", "For the period between November 24, 2003, to November 24, 2005:  employees who, as of November 23, 2003, were in a position for which the  rate of basic pay was equal or greater than the rate of basic pay payable  for Level 5 of the Senior Executive Service in 2003.", "We collected data on all senior officials separated from these three  agencies, regardless of job title or description. We did not include officials  who had separated from one of the agencies but who had continued  working for the federal government at another agency. For contextual  purposes, we queried the Central Personnel Data File to ascertain the  number of all staff who separated from USTR, ITA, and USITC from 2004  through 2009 and left government service. To assess the reliability of data  on senior officials who separated from USTR, ITA, and USITC, we used  data from the Central Personnel Data File to determine the reliability of  the agency-supplied data. After reconciling discrepancies with the  agencies and receiving revised data from them, we determined that the  data provided to us from the agencies were sufficiently reliable.", "Using the names of the 71 former senior officials we had identified as  having separated from USTR, ITA, and USITC between 2004 and 2009, we  requested Justice\u2019s Registration Unit to determine which of these  individuals had registered under FARA. As our work focused only on  senior level employees, we did not ask the Registration Unit to search for  FARA registrations for all former employees from these three agencies.  We did not attempt to determine whether any of these 71 former senior  officials who did not register should have registered under FARA.", "Using this same list of 71 former senior officials, we requested the Clerk of  the House of Representatives to conduct a search of the publicly-available  LDA database maintained by the Clerk to ascertain the number of these  individuals who had registered as lobbyists.

This section of the law prohibits any former employee of the  executive branch from knowingly, with the intent to influence, making a  communication to or appearance before a federal employee on behalf of  another person in connection with a particular matter involving a specific  party, in which he or she participated personally and substantially as an  employee, and in which the United States is a party or has a direct and  substantial interest.", "For the life-time ban under this section of the law, federal regulations state  that \u201ccommunications\u201d occur when information of any kind is transmitted  by any means, as long as the employee intends the information to be  attributed to himself or herself. \u201cAppearances\u201d occur when the former  employee is physically present before an employee of the federal  government in either a formal or informal setting. This section does not  prohibit any behind-the-scenes assistance from former federal employees,  so long as no communications or appearances occur. For example, if a  former employee of an agency accompanies representatives of a grantee of  that agency to an agency meeting, the former employee is considered to be  making an appearance, even if he or she never speaks during the meeting.", "Communications and appearances are only prohibited if they are made  knowingly and with the intent to influence the United States government.  Federal regulations clarify that this occurs when the former employee\u2019s  purpose is to: (1) seek a government ruling, benefit, approval, or other  discretionary government action, or (2) affect government action in  connection with an issue or aspect of a matter which involves actual or  potential controversy. For example, a former employee who calls an  agency official to complain about how that agency is auditing the  employee\u2019s current employer has made a communication with the intent to  influence government action. Certain communications and appearances  are not considered to be made with the intent to influence, including  routine requests not involving controversy, factual statements or inquiries  that are not in dispute or do not seek discretionary government action, and  purely social contacts. For example, a former employee who calls his or  her prior agency to ask for the date of a scheduled hearing for her current  client is not intending to influence the government. However, if he or she  calls his or her former agency to request that the hearing date be moved,  that may be considered a communication made with the intent to  influence.", "The prohibition in this section of the law applies only to communications  or appearances made in connection with particular matters involving  specific parties. According to federal regulations, \u201cparticular matters  involving specific parties\u201d include those that involve specific proceedings  that affect the legal rights of parties, or an isolatable transaction between  identified parties, such as specific contracts, grants, licenses, product  approval applications, enforcement actions, administrative adjudications,  or court cases. \u201cParticular matters involving specific parties\u201d do not  include matters of general applicability, such as rulemaking or the  formulation of general policies. The regulations state that international  agreements may sometimes be considered particular matters involving  specific parties, depending in part on whether the agreement focuses on  specific property or claims, or instead includes a large number of diverse  issues. For example, the regulations state that a former employee of the  Department of State who participated in a treaty negotiation concerning  transfer of ownership of a piece of land may not later represent the foreign  government in the final stages of that negotiation without violating this  provision.", "The prohibition in this section of the law only applies to employees who  participate \u201cpersonally and substantially\u201d in the matter. Federal  regulations state that this means the employee participated directly or  through direct and active supervision, and that the employee\u2019s  involvement was of significance to the matter. Substantial participation  requires more than official responsibility or involvement on an  administrative or peripheral issue.    207(a)(2) Two-year restrictions on all former executive branch  employees for particular matters under official responsibility. A 2- year prohibition, similar to the life-time prohibition that exists under  section 207(a)(1) for all former federal employees, exists under section  207(a)(2). However, whereas section 207(a)(1) requires personal and  substantial participation in a matter on the part of the former employee,  section 207(a)(2) merely requires that the employee had \u201cofficial  responsibility\u201d for the particular matter. According to OGE regulations,  \u201cofficial responsibility\u201d means direct administrative or operating authority  to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct government action.   207(b)(1) One-year restrictions on aiding or advertising  concerning treaty negotiations. All former federal employees who  participated personally and substantially in an ongoing treaty negotiation  are prohibited for 1 year from aiding or advising any other person in that  treaty negotiation, if the employee had access to certain covered  information. According to OGE regulations, \u201ccovered information\u201d means  agency records that the employee had access to and that were designated  exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The same  prohibition used to exist for employees who negotiated certain trade  agreements; however, the specific definition of \u201ctrade agreement,\u201d as used  in section 207(b)(2)(A), refers only to the fast track trade agreement  authority, which expired in 1993. According to OGE, when Congress  restored similar fast track authority in 2002, it did so by creating new  provisions rather than by amending the prior fast track law that is  referenced in section 207(b) and made no conforming changes to section  207(b) to reference the new fast track provisions. Consequently, section  207(b) no longer covers any existing trade agreement authorities.   207(c) One-year restrictions on former senior officials concerning  any matter. For 1 year following termination of service in a senior  position, former senior employees may not knowingly, with the intent to  influence, make communications to or appearances before their former  agency, if it is made on behalf of another person in connection with a  matter on which the former employee seeks official action by the agency.  \u201cSenior employees\u201d include employees whose rate of pay is specified in or  fixed according to Level II of the Executive Schedule, as well as certain  other employees who meet a specific financial threshold or hold specific  appointed positions. Federal regulations state that a senior employee  seeks official action when he attempts to induce a current employee to  make a decision by his communication or appearance. Additionally,  \u201cmatter\u201d is not limited to just \u201cparticular matters\u201d for this section, but also  includes the consideration of broad policy options, new matters that were  not previously pending at the employee\u2019s former agency, and matters  pending before any other agency or the legislative or judicial branches of  government.   207(d) Two-year restriction on former very senior employees\u2019  representations concerning any matter. A similar prohibition that  applies to former senior federal employees also applies to former very  senior federal employees, except that the prohibition lasts for two years,  and also applies to representational contacts with Executive Schedule  officials in the federal government and the President and Vice President.  \u201cVery senior employees\u201d include employees whose rate of pay is equal to  the rate of pay for Level I of the Executive Schedule, and employees in  certain other named and appointed positions.   207(e) Two-year restriction on former Senators and 1-year  restriction on former members of the House of Representatives  and congressional staff. For 2 years for Senators, and for 1 year for  members of the House of Representatives and congressional staff, former  members of Congress and employees are prohibited from contacting  current members of Congress and congressional staff with the intent to  influence any matter on which the former member or staffer seeks action.   207(f) One-year restriction on former senior and very senior  employees\u2019 representations on behalf of, or aid or advice to, a  foreign entity. For 1 year after leaving a senior or very senior position,  employees cannot knowingly represent a foreign government or foreign  political party before the United States government, or aid or advise the  foreign entity with the intent to influence decisions of U.S. government  officials. A life-time ban on representing, aiding, or advising foreign  entities in this capacity applies to the United States Trade Representative  and the Deputy United States Trade Representatives.", "Section 207(f) states that \u201cforeign entity\u201d means both \u201cforeign  government\u201d and \u201cforeign political party\u201d as defined in FARA. Under  FARA, foreign governments include any person or groups of persons  exercising actual or legal political jurisdiction over any foreign country or  portion thereof, including factions and insurgents that may exercise  governmental authority but have not been recognized by the United  States. Foreign political parties include organizations outside the United  States that are engaged in activities devoted to establishing, controlling, or  acquiring control of foreign governments, or that are furthering or  influencing political or public interests, policies or relations of a foreign  government.", "However, it is sometimes difficult to discern whether certain foreign  organizations meet the definition of \u201cforeign entity\u201d under 207(f). Justice\u2019s  Office of Legal Counsel issued a legal opinion in 2008 stating that a foreign  corporation can be considered a foreign entity for purposes of 207(f) if it  exercises sovereign authority in fact or by formal delegation. In this  opinion, Justice clarified that ownership of a foreign corporation by the  foreign government does not itself make the corporation a foreign entity,  but that if the corporation \u201cexercises political jurisdiction over part of a  foreign country,\u201d then it would be considered a foreign entity under 207(f)  and the prohibition would apply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Loren Yager (202) 512-4347 or yagerl@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Adam Cowles (Assistant  Director), Kate Brentzel, Ashley Alley, Greg Wilmoth, and Karen Deans  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
