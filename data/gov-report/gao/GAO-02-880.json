The number of children who die each year from work-related injuries has changed little since 1992, but the number of children who incurred nonfatal injuries while working is more difficult to determine because data from different sources provide different estimates of the number of injuries and trends over time.

Children in the United States are often encouraged to work and many people believe that children benefit from early work experiences by developing independence, confidence, and responsibility. However, the public also wants to ensure that the work experiences of young people enhance, rather than harm, their future opportunities. Over 200,000 children are injured on the job each year and about 70 die as a result of their injuries, according to a recent report by the Department of Labor. In addition, while work can have a positive effect on academic achievement, working too many hours may adversely affect children\u2019s educational attainment. To protect children from such harmful effects, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), with provisions on child labor, was enacted in 1938. These provisions established the minimum age at which children can work, limited the number of hours and times of day they can work, and prohibited them from performing work defined as hazardous. It also made the Secretary of Labor responsible for defining work that is too hazardous for children and for enforcing the provisions of the law.", "You asked us to update information from our 1991 reports on child laborby providing information on (1) how the number and characteristics of working children in the United States have changed over the past decade, (2) whether the number and characteristics of work-related injuries to children have changed over this same time period, and (3) how well Labor enforces the child labor provisions of FLSA.", "To obtain this information, we analyzed data on the characteristics of, and injuries to, children obtained from Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and injury data from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); reviewed the child labor provisions of FLSA and its implementing regulations, agency documents, information from Labor\u2019s investigations database, and individual case files; interviewed Labor officials in Washington, D.C., and 11 field offices (5 regions and 6 district offices), officials from NIOSH, and other experts on child labor; and developed estimates of the number of children who are employed illegally by comparing BLS data on working children to the child labor provisions of FLSA. Most of the estimates in the report were calculated using data obtained from samples and, therefore, have sampling errors associated with them. All differences included in the report were tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level. See app. I for detailed information on our analysis, including its limitations. We conducted our work from September 2001 to August 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Several key sources provide information on the number and characteristics of working children. The Current Population Survey (CPS), compiled monthly by BLS, is the primary source of information on the United States labor force. CPS provides nationally representative information on the number and characteristics of working children age 15 and older, including data on where children work, the types of jobs they hold, and how many hours a week they work. In addition, it provides demographic information on children such as age, race, ethnicity, and family income. Because the data have been collected for over 50 years, they can be used to show how the number and characteristics of working children have changed over time. Labor also compiles two additional sources of nationally representative data on working children. The first is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The most recent NLSY began in 1997 and is referred to as \u201cNLSY97\u201d; it contains data on one group of approximately 9,000 children born from 1980 to 1984. NLSY provides detailed information on the work experiences of this group of children over time and captures data not collected in CPS, such as information on children younger than 15 and in-depth information on children\u2019s work habits, education, and personal lives. NLSY, however, cannot be used to show how the number and characteristics of all working children have changed over time because it only includes information on one group of children born from 1980 to 1984. The second set is the National Agricultural Workers Survey in which data are collected several times each year from a sample of crop agricultural workers. This survey provides data on the number and characteristics of children who work in migrant agriculture, their educational attainment, and their mobility. The information can be used to supplement data on children in CPS and NLSY but it is limited. Labor added questions to the survey in fiscal year 2000 to obtain additional data on children who work in agriculture but has not been able to obtain data on a sufficiently large number of children working in crop agriculture to provide information that is statistically reliable.", "The primary sources of data on children who are injured or killed as a result of work-related injuries come from BLS and NIOSH. BLS reports all work-related fatalities, including those for children, in its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries published each year. BLS identifies these fatalities through death certificates and reports from state workers\u2019 compensation agencies, medical examiners, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the news media. BLS collects data on the number of nonfatal work-related injuries and illnesses in its Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses from a sample of the injury records that employers in private industry are required to maintain. NIOSH collects data on work- related injuries in its National Electronic Injury Surveillance System from a sample of emergency room records.", "The employment of working children is generally covered by FLSA and its implementing regulations, which limit the types of jobs, number of hours, and times of day that children younger than 16 years of age can work. Generally, most children younger than age 14 are prohibited from working in nonagricultural employment other than casual free-lance jobs such as babysitting and delivering newspapers. Children who are 14 and 15 years old may work in many jobs in retail stores, restaurants, and gas stations. They may not, however, work in any job considered hazardous, including jobs in manufacturing, mining, construction, transportation, warehousing, communications, and public utilities. The provisions also prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working during school hours and limit the number of hours and times of day they can work. (See table 1.)", "FLSA also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to designate certain types of jobs and equipment as too hazardous for children under the age of 18. Once children reach age 16, they are only prohibited from working in jobs or with equipment covered by these Hazardous Occupations Orders, they are not limited as to the number of hours or times of day they can work. These hazardous jobs and types of equipment are specified in 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders originally issued between 1939 and 1963. (See table 2 for a list of the occupations determined to be hazardous by the Secretary of Labor.) In 2002, NIOSH completed a review of the Hazardous Occupations Orders for Labor. Its report, issued in July 2002, made several recommendations for changes to the orders, including establishing new hazardous orders prohibiting all children younger than age 18 from working in the construction industry and from working at a height of 6 feet or higher on ladders, scaffolds, trees, and other structures.Labor is in the process of reviewing the report and deciding what actions it will take in response to the recommendations.", "For jobs in agriculture, the child labor provisions are much less restrictive. Children of any age may work an unlimited number of hours (outside of school hours) in nonhazardous jobs, either on a farm owned by their parents or on a noncommercial farm with the written consent of their parents. Children aged 14 and 15 are allowed to work an unlimited number of hours in nonhazardous jobs outside of school hours without parental consent and, once they reach age 16, they are allowed to work in agricultural jobs deemed hazardous.", "The child labor provisions of FLSA do not cover all children. Children who work for employers whose annual gross volume of sales is less than $500,000 and whose work cannot be linked to interstate commerce are not covered under FLSA, although they may be covered under state child labor laws. In addition, children who are self-employed are not subject to the child labor provisions of FLSA. Furthermore, although children who work for their parents are prohibited from working in occupations and operating equipment listed in the Hazardous Occupations Orders, they are not subject to other restrictions of FLSA. When children reach age 18, they are no longer covered under the child labor provisions of FLSA.", "In 2001, several legislative proposals were submitted in the House of Representatives and the Senate that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA. The proposals include the Children\u2019s Act for Responsible Employment of 2001, which would, among other things, increase the maximum penalties for child labor violations and prohibit children aged 16 and 17 from working in hazardous occupations in agriculture. The Young American Workers\u2019 Bill of Rights would amend the FLSA to require employers to obtain work permits for all children age 18 and under who are still in school, require Labor and the Census Bureau to compile data on child labor from the states, including data on injuries and illnesses, and add additional restrictions on child labor such as prohibiting children from making door-to-door sales for profit. (See app. II for a list of the legislative proposals introduced in the 107th Congress that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA.)", "Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing the child labor provisions of FLSA. WHD\u2019s national office develops the goals and performance measures for Labor\u2019s child labor compliance efforts and reports on the results of its efforts in annual performance plans. The national office is also responsible for providing guidance and training to WHD\u2019s regional and district offices and for assessing the results of their child labor compliance efforts. Much of the responsibility for planning and executing these efforts, however, is left to the discretion of WHD\u2019s five regional offices and the 50 district offices that report directly to the regions. The Child Labor Team Leader in the headquarters office is responsible for coordinating WHD\u2019s child labor compliance efforts, including disseminating information and guidance to the regional and district offices, maintaining the section of the WHD Web site with information on child labor, maintaining the Field Operations Handbook for investigators, and overseeing special projects. WHD\u2019s child labor compliance efforts comprise several strategies: enforcement, partnerships, education and outreach, and public awareness. Its public awareness strategy is designed to inform the general public about the child labor provisions of FLSA through activities such as press releases. WHD\u2019s education and outreach activities\u2014which WHD also refers to as \u201ccompliance assistance\u201d\u2014are specifically targeted to groups that can have an impact on youth employment, such as teachers, parents, and employers. Education and outreach activities include publishing and distributing materials such as bookmarks with information on the rules governing the employment of children under age 18, and maintaining a Web site with information on the child labor provisions of FLSA and state child labor laws.", "WHD\u2019s enforcement actions include on-site investigations of employers and other activities designed to bring employers into compliance with the law. When WHD finds violations of the child labor provisions of FLSA during its investigations, it may assess penalties. The penalties for child labor violations depend on the severity of the violations, the number of times the violations occurred, and aggravating factors such as falsification of records and whether the employer has a record of previous child labor violations. The penalties range from $275 for a record-keeping violation to $11,000 for a violation involving a serious injury or death. Information on WHD\u2019s investigations, violations, and penalties assessed is tracked in its investigations database\u2013the Wage and Hour Investigative Support and Reporting Database, WHISARD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number and Characteristics of Children Who Work and the Percentage of Illegally Employed Children Have Not Changed Since 1990", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, according to data tabulated from CPS, the number and characteristics of working children have not changed. In 2001, working children were as sizable a part of the United States labor force as they were in 1990.

The percentage of children who worked illegally, either because they worked in occupations prohibited under the law or more hours than allowed, also did not change. In 2001, as in 1990, minority children and children from families with annual incomes below $25,000 were more likely than other children to work illegally. However, because of limitations of the data available, we could not determine the full extent and nature of children\u2019s employment in the United States, such as the number and characteristics of children younger than age 15 who work and the percentage of children younger than 15 who are employed illegally."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Children Work, Primarily in Retail Trade and Services", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, as many as 3.7 million children between the ages of 15 and 17 worked, about 30 percent of all children in this age range.

The percentage of children who worked in summer months fluctuated over the decade from a high of 36 percent in 1990 to a low of 30 percent in 2001. Although most children work for an employer, in 2001, about 52,000 (2 percent) were self-employed and about 10,000 (less than 1 percent) performed unpaid labor in a family business.", "Throughout the decade, children primarily worked in retail trade, in businesses such as department stores, grocery stores, and restaurants. In 2001, as in 1990, about 60 percent of all working children were employed in this industry, mostly in eating and drinking places. (See fig. 2.) Children generally held jobs in sales occupations, such as running a cash register or clerking at a store, or in services, such as waiting tables or cleaning hotel rooms.", "Various data sets provide information about children who work in agriculture. According to CPS data tabulated by GAO, about 4 percent of all children who worked were employed in agriculture in 2001. Another data set, the National Agricultural Workers Survey, provides more detailed information on the characteristics of children who work in crop agriculture. According to the data in this survey, the characteristics of children in crop agriculture changed somewhat over the decade. Although most children working in crop agriculture throughout the decade were boys aged 16 and 17, the percentage of boys increased, as did the percentage of children who were foreign-born and newcomers to this country. Although most children working in agriculture are 16 years of age and older, the percentage of younger children (14- and 15-year-olds) who work in agriculture has increased, from 17 percent to 30 percent. In addition, both the percentage of children who entered the country illegally to work in agriculture and the percentage of those who were not accompanied by their parents or other family members rose over the decade.", "Children\u2019s work has a decidedly seasonal nature. More children work in summer months when school is out of session than in school months. In 2001, 30 percent of all children aged 15 to 17 worked in summer months, compared to 23 percent who worked in school months. Not only do more children work in the summer, they also work more hours. In 2001, children worked an average of 21 hours a week in summer months, compared to 16 hours a week in school months. This is similar to the number of hours they worked in both summer and school months in 1990.

Although most children worked in the retail trade industry during the past decade, a substantial percentage of the illegal employment was found in other industries (see fig. 3). For example, in 2001, although only 3 percent of all children worked in manufacturing, this industry accounted for 14 percent of all illegally employed children. Similarly, although only 3 percent of all working children worked in construction, the construction industry accounted for 16 percent of all illegally employed children.", "Moreover, although most children worked in sales and services occupations, children who were employed in prohibited occupations were most commonly employed illegally in transportation-related occupations. In 2001, according to our estimates, over 40 percent of all children who were employed illegally because they worked in prohibited occupations worked as truck drivers.

In addition, black children were less likely than children of other races to work in prohibited occupations, and children who were not citizens were more likely than those who were citizens to work in prohibited occupations.

In 1989, Labor stopped collecting data on 14-year-olds in CPS, although these children are allowed under FLSA and its implementing regulations to work in many jobs.Because CPS does not gather data on 14-year-olds, the estimates presented in this report paint an incomplete picture of the employment patterns for younger children.", "Another limitation of CPS is the method used to capture information on working children. While some data are collected directly from children who work, most of the information in CPS on working children is provided by an adult member of the household, in most cases a parent. Because the adult answering the questions may not be aware of the full extent of the child\u2019s activities, information about the child\u2019s employment may be underreported or omitted, or the adult may incorrectly identify the industry, occupation, or hours worked.", "Another BLS survey, NLSY, collects information on children differently. In NLSY, children are directly asked by interviewers to describe their jobs as well as their activities at work. Because children are asked directly about their work and are asked more detailed questions about employment throughout the year, including using a calendar to prompt the child to account for each period of employment or unemployment during the year, the percentage of children who work reported in NLSY is much higher than in CPS. For example, NLSY97 showed that about 24 percent of all 15-year-olds worked in a particular week during the summer of 1996,while CPS data showed that 18 percent of 15-year-olds worked in that same period. In addition, NLSY collects data on younger children who work.

For 1999, BLS reported that almost 13,000 children were injured on the job, while NIOSH estimated that over 80,000 children were injured on the job that year. BLS\u2019s estimate came from records that employers are required to maintain for all work-related injuries serious enough to cause children to miss at least one day of work. NIOSH\u2019s estimate was based on records of injuries treated in emergency rooms. In addition, different types of injuries were more prevalent among those reported by employers than those treated in emergency rooms. BLS data for 1992 to 2000 showed that sprains, strains, and tears were the most common injuries, while NIOSH data indicated that lacerations were the most common injury.", "The BLS and NIOSH data also, over time, indicate different trends in the numbers of work-related injuries to children. BLS data show that injuries have decreased by more than 40 percent, from about 22,000 in 1992 to about 13,000 in 1999. However, data from NIOSH suggest that injuries may have actually increased during the same period, from about 64,000 in 1992 to about 80,000 in 1999. (See fig. 8.)", "Due to limitations of both data sources, it is difficult to determine the true extent of injuries to children who work. Both sets of data underreport injuries to children. BLS captures only injuries serious enough to require at least one missed day of work; therefore, data on many injuries are not captured. Moreover, because most children work part-time, many children who are injured may not miss a full day of work because they were not scheduled to work after being injured. In addition, BLS does not collect data on children who are self-employed; those who work in federal, state, or local government; those who work for agricultural employers with fewer than 11 employees; and household workers. NIOSH data also underreport injuries because children who are injured may not inform hospital staff that their injuries are work-related and hospital staff may omit details of injuries that connect them to work. As a result, some injuries treated in emergency rooms may not be accurately counted as being work-related. Although BLS and NIOSH officials recognized that the data they collect underreport the number of work-related injuries to children, and recognized the limitations in their data, they emphasized that their data capture information on different types of injuries and can be used to complement each other. For example, certain types of injuries such as lacerations may be treated in emergency rooms but not necessitate one or more days away from work, while other types of injuries that may result in missed work days such as sprains and strains may be more commonly treated in physicians\u2019 offices or outpatient clinics than in emergency rooms.

Demographic data for children injured show that 60 percent of the injuries occurred to boys, even though they accounted for only about half of all working children. Moreover, during this period, children aged 16 and over sustained the vast majority of all work-related injuries. BLS data also show that, throughout the decade, most children (84 percent) were injured while working in the two industries in which children are most likely to work\u2014retail trade and services. Within these industries, in 2000, children who worked in eating and drinking places, food stores, general merchandise stores, and health services had the largest numbers of injuries. The injury rates per hours worked, however, were lower for the retail trade and services industries than the rates for children who worked in wholesale trade, transportation and public utilities, and manufacturing.", "However, as with fatalities, the likelihood of injury needs to be considered in addition to the actual number of injuries. We found that the risk of injury was highest in some industries with the smallest number of injuries to children. For example, although many fewer children who worked in the wholesale trade, transportation and public utilities, and manufacturing industries sustained a work-related injury than those who worked in retail trade and in services, children working in wholesale trade, transportation and public utilities, and manufacturing had higher rates of injury than those working in retail trade or services. (See table 8.)", "Injuries are caused by a variety of factors, but most frequently from coming into contact with an object or equipment. (See fig. 10.) For example, in 1998 a 17-year-old worker fractured his hand when a piece of metal slipped off a power-driven machine he was operating and landed on his hand. Other common accidents were overexertion, falls, and contact with hot objects. The causes of work-related nonfatal injuries were fairly constant over this period.", "The nature of work-related injuries to children also did not change from 1992 to 2000. Children injured on the job most frequently sustained strains and tears, cuts and lacerations, and bruises and contusions. (See fig. 11.)", "In contrast to the decrease in the number of injuries indicated by the BLS data, the severity of injuries to children (as defined by median number of days away from work) reported by BLS has remained relatively constant throughout the decade.

Labor recently established specific goals for fiscal year 2003 for the industries in which children are most likely to work.", "WHD\u2019s national goals in the early part of the decade focused on increasing the number of its child labor enforcement activities. For example, Labor\u2019s goals for fiscal years 1990 and 1992 focused on its plans to dramatically increase the number of child labor investigations through nationwide efforts it called \u201cOperation Child Watch.\u201d These high-visibility efforts involved sending out hundreds of investigators for 1- and 2-day periods to conduct child labor investigations. As a result of these investigations, WHD found thousands of child labor violations and assessed millions of dollars in penalties. Operation Child Watch also gave WHD a sense of where it could expect to find child labor violations in the future.", "In fiscal year 2000, Labor considered setting specific goals for industries in which many children worked and were likely to be injured\u2014the grocery and restaurant industries\u2014but decided not to based on the results it received from a survey of employers. That year, WHD conducted a \u201csurvey\u201d of employers designed to establish baseline compliance rates for employers in these industries. In the survey, WHD conducted investigations of statistically valid samples of supermarkets, full-service restaurants, and fast food restaurants that employ children and found that the overall compliance rates for these industries were 82 percent, 78 percent, and 70 percent, respectively. It also conducted investigations of employers with prior child labor violations and found that, although the compliance rates for two of the three industries were still lower than the overall compliance rates, the rates had improved from 0 percent previously to 72 percent of supermarkets with prior violations, 52 percent of full-service restaurants, and 72 percent of fast food restaurants. Because WHD considered these rates to be sufficiently high, particularly compared to other industries, it decided not to set goals for these industries for improving compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA.", "WHD made this decision despite the conclusions reached in its analysis of the results of the survey. The analysis stated that, while child labor compliance rates were relatively higher in these three industries than overall FLSA compliance rates, it would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d to compare the findings of the survey with compliance rates found in its surveys of other industries because all of the requirements of FLSA were not evaluated in the child labor compliance survey. In addition, the analysis stated that there were \u201cstill enormous child labor compliance issues that these industries need to address,\u201d with at least 52,000 and as many as 220,000 children illegally employed in the three industries. The analysis also stated that the compliance rate in some segments of these industries was lower than the overall compliance rates. For example, it noted that although most children employed in full service restaurants, 89 percent, were employed in compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA, the compliance rate was much lower, 53 percent, for 14- and 15-year-olds working in these restaurants.", "More recently, WHD developed specific goals for improving overall employer compliance with FLSA in some low-wage industries, including compliance with the child labor provisions. For example, WHD\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan established a goal of 75 percent compliance with the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of FLSA for employers in the long-term health care industry (nursing homes and residential care facilities).", "In September 2002, in its comments on a draft of this report, Labor reported that WHD had developed specific, measurable goals in its draft fiscal year 2003 annual performance plan. The draft plan includes goals for grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and full-service restaurants, industries in which children are most likely to work. WHD did not, however, establish goals for industries in which we found that children were likely to be employed illegally, such as manufacturing and construction, or for industries in which children have the highest rates of fatalities and nonfatal injuries, such as construction, wholesale trade, and transportation and public utilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods of Measuring the Success of All Efforts to Improve Compliance Have Not Been Developed", "paragraphs": ["WHD has not developed adequate methods of measuring the success of all of its child labor compliance efforts. Over the decade, WHD\u2019s measures of success have generally consisted of counting the number of its child labor compliance activities. For example, WHD measured the success of Operation Child Watch in the early 1990s by citing the large number of violations and penalties produced. More recently, WHD headquarters officials told us they look at trends in the number of child labor violations found each year, and noted that the numbers have dropped dramatically since the early 1990s. (See table 9.)", "It is not clear, however, what factors led to the decrease in the number of violations. It could have resulted from an increased rate of compliance among employers, the decrease in the number of child labor investigations conducted by WHD, or other factors. For example, since Operation Child Watch, the number of investigator hours devoted to child labor investigations has declined from a high of 11 percent to 7 percent in 2001, with a low of 5 percent in 1998. (See table 10.)", "While WHD headquarters officials use various factors to measure the success of their enforcement efforts, they told us that they do not know how to develop methods of measuring the success of their education and outreach activities. Officials told us they could tell their activities generate attention if WHD receives a lot of media inquires and that they count the number of times individuals access information from WHD\u2019s Web site. However, WHD does not link its education and outreach activities with changes in employer behavior. While we recognize the inherent difficulties in assessing the impact on employer behavior of WHD\u2019s education and outreach activities, particularly the difficulty of establishing a cause and effect relationship between changes in compliance and WHD\u2019s activities, such measurement is important in distributing WHD\u2019s limited resources. Moreover, we found that some district offices were trying to develop such methods. For example, officials at one district office told us that they felt it was important to obtain at least an indication of success by conducting investigations of employers after their education and outreach activities. They also said they were working with researchers at the University of Tennessee to develop methods of measuring the success of all of their child labor compliance activities.", "Despite having difficulty in developing methods of measuring the effectiveness of its education and outreach activities, WHD headquarters officials told us that they devote a lot of their resources\u2014both at the national and local level\u2014 to education and outreach and other compliance assistance activities. Since Operation Child Watch, most of Labor\u2019s national child labor campaigns have focused on providing education and outreach and other compliance assistance to employers and on increasing public awareness of the child labor provisions of FLSA. For example, from 1996 to 2001, WHD conducted its \u201cWork Safe This Summer\u201d initiative designed to reach children beginning summer jobs. As part of this national initiative, WHD provided pamphlets and posters with information on the child labor provisions of FLSA, a Web site with safety tips and information about the law, and a public service announcement displayed on movie screens in 22 states and printed on 37 million shopping bags distributed by K-Mart.

As a result, WHD may not target sufficient resources to these areas. For example, we estimated that a significant proportion of illegally employed children worked in construction and manufacturing\u2014 industries in which WHD targets few of its child labor compliance efforts. We also found that children were more likely to be injured or killed while working in several industries in which WHD conducts few child labor investigations\u2014construction, wholesale trade, and transportation and public utilities. WHD officials told us that they do not use data from BLS on the industries and occupations in which children work because the information is not easily accessible and because the data do not provide information at the local level that could be used to help plan local compliance efforts. However, CPS data is available at the regional level and we developed state-level information by combining several years of data. For example, by combining CPS data for 4 years (1998 to 2001) and comparing it to the provisions of FLSA, we estimated the number of children illegally employed in each state. (See app. I for detailed information on these estimates.)", "WHD also does not utilize information from its investigations database to determine what types of strategies are most successful in detecting child labor violations in its investigations of employers. WHD conducts child labor investigations either as a result of a receiving a complaint about a possible child labor violation or from a decision by a WHD office to conduct investigations of employers that focus specifically on children they employ (\u201cself-initiated\u201d investigations). WHD officials told us that, although they review every complaint they receive about a possible child labor violation, they do not receive many complaints about child labor.They also said that WHD\u2019s national office does not require all district offices to conduct self-initiated child labor investigations. In fact, since Operation Child Watch, the only national initiative that required all district offices to conduct child labor investigations was the child labor compliance survey WHD conducted of the grocery and restaurant industries in fiscal year 2000. WHD officials also told us that it is not necessary for the national office to require all of its district offices to conduct self-initiated child labor investigations because investigators look for child labor violations during all investigations, not just those that focus on child labor. However, in reviewing data we requested from WHD\u2019s investigations database, we found that, although self-initiated child labor investigations accounted for only 5 percent of all investigations completed in fiscal year 2001, these investigations accounted for almost 40 percent of all cases in which child labor violations were found. (See table 11.) In other words, WHD would have missed a large proportion of the cases with child labor violations if some district offices had not conducted self- initiated child labor investigations in the absence of a national directive to do so.", "WHD headquarters officials also do not use data from its investigations database to ensure that district offices nationwide are providing an adequate level of protection to all children who work by ensuring that all district offices nationwide conduct at least some minimum number of child labor investigations. From the data we obtained for fiscal year 2001, we found that the number of investigations conducted by each district office and by WHD\u2019s five regions varied widely and that a few district offices accounted for a large number of the child labor investigations and cases in which child labor violations were found. For example, in fiscal year 2001, we found that the total number of child labor investigations (both those initiated by complaints and self-initiated investigations) conducted by the district offices in each region varied widely, from a total of 942 child labor investigations in the northeast region to a total of 227 investigations in the southwest region. We also found that the number of investigations conducted by each of the district offices varied widely; 8 of the 50 district offices accounted for 43 percent of all child labor investigations completed in fiscal year 2001, and 9 of the 50 district offices completed fewer than 10 self-initiated child labor investigations in fiscal year 2001. WHD headquarters officials were not able to explain these regional and district variances.", "Although WHD\u2019s regional and district offices conduct many local child labor initiatives, WHD headquarters officials do not use the quarterly reports prepared by these offices on their local initiatives to ensure that, nationwide, local child labor initiatives provide adequate protection for all children who work. WHD headquarters officials told us that all regional and district offices should have some local child labor initiatives, unless they have a reasonable justification not to, such as other higher-priority compliance efforts, and that, in recent years, every district office has had some local child labor initiatives. However, the reports we reviewed for fiscal years 1999 through 2002 showed that, in some years, many districts had no child labor initiatives and the number of child labor initiatives varied significantly from one region to another. For example, in fiscal year 2000, almost all of the district offices in the northeast region had at least one child labor initiative and two regions had regionwide initiatives that required all of their district offices to conduct child labor investigations. Some of the district offices in the southwest region, however, had no local child labor initiatives planned for fiscal years 1999 through 2002, although our estimates of illegally employed children showed greater numbers of children in the South to be illegally employed than in the Northeast."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sufficient Guidance and Training Has Not Been Provided to Regional and District Offices", "paragraphs": ["While WHD leaves many of the decisions about how to deploy enforcement resources to its regional and district offices, it does not ensure that these offices receive sufficient guidance and training to properly target or carry out their child labor compliance efforts.

Officials in one district office we visited told us that, because of their past enforcement efforts, illegal child labor was not a problem in their area and thus, they did not devote a lot of their enforcement resources to targeting child labor violations. However, our analysis showed that a large percentage of children working in this state worked in those industries where children were most likely to be injured. In addition, our estimates of the number of illegally employed children in each state showed that a larger proportion of 15-year-olds in that state were likely to be employed illegally than those in any other state we visited.

As a result, district office practices for penalty assessment and collection vary significantly. In reviewing investigations with child labor violations completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 at the district offices we visited, we found that district officials sometimes reduced the penalties for child labor violations or did not assess any penalties for child labor violations while in other, similar cases, they assessed penalties. For example, one district office we visited generally did not waive penalties for child labor violations it found, but another district office waived many of the penalties for the child labor violations it found, including a violation of a Hazardous Occupations Order involving a child who was working with dangerous equipment.

In recognition of this, Labor devotes significant attention to enforcing the child labor provisions of FLSA and ensuring safe and productive work experiences for children. Over the last decade, its efforts have ranged from conducting investigations to carrying out nationwide education and outreach campaigns.", "Despite the importance that WHD places on ensuring the safety of children who work, it faces difficulty in showing that its efforts have made a difference in improving the working conditions of children. WHD\u2019s ability to effectively enforce the child labor provisions of FLSA is dependent, in part, upon the establishment of a sound performance management system that provides program managers with the type of information they need to evaluate the effectiveness of their child labor compliance efforts and ensure that their limited resources are used in the most effective manner. WHD has taken some steps towards developing such a system, as reflected in the program goals it has established and refined in recent years. However, WHD continues to lack goals for industries that have high rates of injuries and fatalities. Further, WHD\u2019s performance management system does not allow managers to fully assess the impact of its child labor compliance efforts. As a result, WHD lacks a sound basis for determining, among other things, the extent to which it should devote resources to child labor investigations versus its education and outreach and other compliance assistance activities. Its resource allocation decisions are also hindered because WHD does not routinely use all of the data available from BLS and NIOSH to target its child labor compliance efforts to the places that are most dangerous for children and in which they are most likely to work illegally. Similarly, by not fully utilizing information from its own investigations database to evaluate the child labor compliance efforts of its regional and district offices, WHD is not able to target its local efforts most effectively or hold local offices accountable at the national level for enforcing the child labor provisions of FLSA and ensuring that all children who work are adequately protected. Finally, even if WHD were to use all existing data as effectively as possible, it would still not be able to use the data to better target its child labor compliance efforts for children younger than 15 because BLS\u2019s CPS data do not include information on 14-year-olds who work and NLSY97 does not have information on children born after 1984. We recognize, however, that collecting these data will require additional resources.", "Regional and district offices also need sufficient guidance and training to effectively carry out their mission. Because WHD\u2019s national office leaves many decisions about the appropriate amount of resources to devote to child labor compliance efforts to its regional and district offices, but does not provide them with criteria for targeting their efforts or data on industries and occupations in which children work and are most likely to be injured, they may not be using their limited resources as efficiently as possible. Additionally, because district offices do not receive specific guidance from WHD\u2019s national office about when to assess penalties for child labor violations, nationwide, they do not consistently assess penalties for these violations.

One goal, for example, is to decrease the percentage of grocery stores and full-service restaurants with repeat child labor violations by 2 percent. We think these are positive steps and have revised our report to reflect these efforts. However, the draft performance plan does not include goals for other industries because Labor does not believe there are sufficient numbers of children working in these industries to justify setting such goals.

Key questions concerning child employment in a family business were not added to CPS until 1994. Therefore, in order to compare results for 2001 with results for 1990, we included children who worked in a family business in the 2001 base population, even though these children are not covered by FLSA.

As a result, our estimates of illegal employment are both under- and overstated. The estimates are understated\u2014probably by a significant amount\u2014because many activities prohibited, particularly the many types of equipment children are prohibited from using detailed in the Hazardous Occupations Orders, cannot be gleaned by reviewing the occupational categories in CPS. For example, all children younger than 18 are prohibited from using meat slicers. However, although CPS shows that many children work in \u201cfood services,\u201d it does not indicate how many of them work with meat slicers. The estimates are also overstated because they include some activities that are allowed in occupations that are prohibited. For example, because work as a public messenger is expressly prohibited for15-year- olds, we included children who worked in the occupation category \u201cmail carrier\u201d in our estimates of illegal employment.

As with prohibited occupations, however, it was not possible to determine the extent to which our estimates are understated as a result of these limitations.

CPS does not collect information on the characteristics of employers for which children work, such as sales volume or other proxies for annual dollar volume of sales, or information that could be used to determine whether children work in interstate commerce.

We totaled the hours worked each week by all children for each year and totaled the hours worked each week for children of different sexes, races, and those who worked in certain industries. Because the data sets for fatal and nonfatal injuries use different industry groupings than CPS, we combined industries so that they would reflect the same industry groupings. Because we were not able to obtain SOII data that only included 15- to 17-year-olds by industry, we calculated industry rates by dividing the total number of injuries to children under 18 by the total hours worked by 15- to 17-year-olds in each industry.

Our draft report acknowledged the difficulty of estimating the number of children employed in violation of the child labor provisions of FLSA and the limitations of using CPS data to provide such estimates. While recognizing these limitations, we continue to believe that our analysis provides the best estimates that can be made with available data. In fact, we used the same methods as those used to develop estimates cited by BLS and WHD in several of their publications. For example, in BLS\u2019s November 2000 Report on the Youth Labor Force and WHD\u2019s May 2000 materials prepared for its \u201cSpring Into Safety\u201d child labor campaign, they cited estimates of the number of children illegally employed prepared by Douglas Kruse, the researcher with whom we worked in developing our estimates. WHD stated that his 1997 study provided \u201cthe best currently available estimate of the number of children employed in violation of Federal or State child labor laws.\u201d 2.  Labor cites the drop in workplace injuries indicated by the BLS data from the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses as evidence that \u201cthe workplace is becoming safer for young workers,\u201d but ignores NIOSH data from emergency room records that indicates that workplace injuries to children are on the rise. 3.  Although we highlighted many of Labor\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA, our report was not intended to describe all of the agency\u2019s child labor enforcement efforts over the past ten years but rather, as requested, to determine how well Labor enforces these provisions and to make recommendations for improvement. 4.  WHD is correct in its statement that the number of investigator hours devoted to child labor enforcement in fiscal year 2001, 74,000 hours, represents the largest investment of investigator time by WHD in the last 5 years. However, our report, which focuses on WHD\u2019s efforts since 1990, shows that this is lower than the resources dedicated to child labor enforcement in the first half of the decade. For example, in fiscal years 1990, 1991, and 1992, WHD investigators devoted 143,000 hours, 83,000 hours, and 105,000 hours, respectively, to child labor enforcement. 5.  We did not provide information on the number of hours spent by WHD investigators on activities other than investigations because, although the investigations database, WHISARD, can track this information, we found, and WHD officials confirmed, that it did not contain complete information on the time investigators spend on non-enforcement activities such as education and outreach. 6.  We continue to believe that the trends in the number of child labor violations found and the amount of penalties assessed\u2014including the fact that the numbers have declined significantly since 1990\u2014are not valid indicators of WHD\u2019s commitment to child labor compliance, nor are they evidence of the success of its efforts to ensure compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. As noted in our report, because we do not know what factors led to the changes in the number of violations, it is unclear whether the increase in the number of violations found by WHD in fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 indicates a growing problem with child labor, improvements in WHD\u2019s efforts to identify violations, or other factors. 7.  This statement is misleading. Our draft report recognized that, in 2002, the maximum penalty for a child labor violation was raised from $10,000 to $11,000. We did not recognize WHD\u2019s efforts to publish a final rule on the 1999 regulatory proposal to update some of the hazardous occupations orders or issue new regulations because these actions have not been completed. 8.  This statement is also misleading. Our draft report acknowledged that NIOSH completed a review of the hazardous occupations orders for Labor, which made several recommendations for changes to the orders. We also noted that Labor was in the process of reviewing the report and deciding the actions it would take in response to NIOSH\u2019s recommendations. 9.  We believe that our report provides a comprehensive and balanced picture of the effectiveness of Labor\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA and contains important information on how these efforts could be improved. 10. The information in our draft report was based on our review of WHD\u2019s fiscal year 2001 and 2002 annual performance plans. Neither of these plans contained specific, measurable goals for the industries in which most children work or in which children are most likely to sustain a serious injury. However, WHD\u2019s draft performance plan for fiscal year 2003, which we recently obtained, appears to be a step in the right direction in terms of setting more specific, measurable goals, although it does not contain goals for some of the industries with high injury and fatality rates. Accordingly, we have revised the information in our report and the associated recommendations. 11. While the referenced employer compliance survey is an important step in setting goals for improving employer compliance, it is only one of the steps required. The baseline data become the starting point for measuring progress in improving compliance. However, after completing the survey in fiscal year 2000, WHD chose not to set specific goals for improving compliance in the grocery and restaurant industries in its fiscal year 2001 and 2002 performance plans. It made this decision even though the rate of non-compliance for fast food restaurants was 30 percent, and the non-compliance rate for full service restaurants with previous child labor violations was almost 50 percent. 12. We do not believe that the most important indicator of compliance is the percentage of children who are employed illegally. Although we agree it is an indicator that should be reviewed, a few companies that employ large numbers of children can have a disproportionate effect on the numbers. Therefore, we believe the most important indicator of compliance is the percentage of employers who are in compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA, particularly because employers are responsible for maintaining compliance with the provisions of the law. 13. As noted previously, prior to fiscal year 2003, WHD\u2019s annual performance plans did not contain specific, measurable goals for improving compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA for many of the industries in which most children work or are likely to sustain work-related injuries. See GAO comment 10. 14. As Labor\u2019s quotation indicates, the goals in WHD\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan did not establish specific goals for the industries in which most children work or are likely to sustain work-related injuries. See GAO comment 10. 15. As noted previously, we have revised the report to reflect the goals contained in WHD\u2019s draft performance plan for fiscal year 2003. See GAO comment 10. 16. The fact that WHD conducts investigations in these industries does not negate the need for WHD to set goals for increasing compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA for these industries. Because WHD conducts many of its investigations in response to complaints about possible violations, the resource allocations indicated in Labor\u2019s charts may reflect WHD\u2019s responses to complaints as much as the results of its efforts to target child labor violations in these industries. 17. We disagree that our analysis of fatality rates is a \u201cflawed interpretation of the BLS and NIOSH data\u201d and that is more appropriate to use the actual numbers of children employed, injured, and killed to determine risk. While we understand the importance of reviewing the number of children who work in each industry and the numbers of children injured or killed, we believe that injury and fatality rates are important indicators that WHD should use in allocating its resources. As noted in an article by a researcher at BLS about fatality rates, \u201calthough  counts are informative in identifying worker groups that experience large numbers of fatalities, they do not by themselves measure risk. To quantify risk, the data on workplace fatalities must be associated with a measure of worker exposure to risk, such as employment or hours worked. The number of hours worked is preferable because different workers spend variable hours on the job in a given time period (e.g. year), and therefore have different lengths of exposure to workplace hazards.\u201d We believe it is particularly important to use the number of hours worked, rather than simply using the number of children employed, to calculate injury and fatality rates because so many children (87 percent) work part time. 18. For the transportation and public utilities industry, Labor mentions only fatality rates and the number of fatalities. In addition to high fatality rates for this industry, we found that the injury rate was high compared to other industries. Therefore, we believe that it is important for WHD to focus some of its resources on reviewing child labor in this industry. 19. It is not clear that establishing a goal for improving compliance in the transportation and public utilities industry would be unrealistic and counterproductive. Given the limitations of the estimates of illegal employment, we question the agency\u2019s estimate that only 4,400 youth are employed illegally in this industry. The statistics cited by Labor on the number of violations found as evidence that violations are not prevalent in this industry are also questionable because it is unclear whether WHD would have found more child labor violations if it had targeted employers in this industry. 20. Labor cites only the fatality rates and number of deaths in the wholesale trade industry, although we found that the injury rates for children working in this industry were also relatively high. While the number of children working in this industry may be small, we believe the injury rates to be sufficiently high to warrant further WHD attention. WHD should look to the extensive experience of its staff cited on page 10 of Labor\u2019s comments to identify the areas of the country in which children are most likely to work in these industries. 21. As with the transportation and public utilities and the wholesale trade industries, Labor only cites the fatality rates for the construction industry. Again, we noted that the injury rate for children who work in this industry was relatively high. In addition, we question how WHD determined that \u201cmany of these specialty trade contractors are so small that they do not meet the FLSA coverage criteria\u201d because this information is not tracked in WHD\u2019s investigations database and we found no data on employer coverage under FLSA. We also found, in our discussions with WHD officials, that establishing coverage for employers in the construction industry was not a problem for some of the district offices we visited, particularly those on the east coast. 22. CPS data on occupations show that many children are employed as truck drivers. However, our draft report incorrectly indicated that 43 percent of all children who are employed illegally are employed as truck drivers. We clarified the report to show that the percentage of children who are employed illegally as truck drivers represents 42 percent of children who are employed in prohibited occupations. 23. We continue to believe that the injury and fatality rates for children who work in the construction industry warrant WHD attention. We also commend WHD\u2019s efforts to fund research by NIOSH on the health and safety of young workers in the industry. 24. As noted in our report, manufacturing has one of the highest injury rates for children. WHD\u2019s opinion that targeting additional resources on this industry would not be a wise resource investment and would have no impact on occupational injuries and fatalities for children working in this industry does not factor in these high injury and fatality rates. In fact, some of the most serious child labor violations WHD found occurred in sawmills and companies that produce wood pallets. 25. We commend WHD\u2019s recent decision to conduct a second compliance survey of the grocery, full service restaurant, and fast-food restaurant industries in fiscal year 2004. However, as stated in our report, WHD has not developed methods of measuring the success of all of its child labor compliance efforts, particularly its education and outreach and other compliance assistance activities. In addition, WHD has not conducted child labor compliance surveys of other industries. 26. In our conversations with WHD headquarters officials and in WHD publications, the number of investigations, violations found, and civil monetary penalties were frequently cited as indicators of the success of the WHD\u2019s child labor enforcement efforts. In fact, on page 3 of the agency\u2019s comments on our report, Labor cites the increase from fiscal years 2000 to 2001 in the number of child labor violations and the total amount of penalties assessed as evidence of \u201cWHD\u2019s continued strong commitment of resources to child labor compliance.\u201d 27. We disagree with Labor\u2019s statement that WHD routinely uses BLS and NIOSH data to plan the allocation of its child labor resources. We found that WHD has no procedures for routinely obtaining data from BLS and NIOSH to plan its child labor enforcement efforts and the district offices we visited confirmed that they do not receive this information for use in planning their local child labor efforts. Second, Labor\u2019s statement that WHD routinely uses state workers\u2019 compensation data to plan its enforcement efforts must be qualified to indicate that many states refuse to release this information to WHD because of privacy concerns. Third, WHD has, in the past, used only limited data from its WHISARD investigations database to plan its enforcement efforts. In some cases, reports we requested from the database, such as reports that showed the source of investigations completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, was the first time that WHD had run such reports. Finally, we believe the anecdotal information on injuries and fatalities maintained by WHD\u2019s national office does not provide enough information to be useful in making WHD\u2019s resource allocation decisions. The information on fatalities and serious injuries to children tracked by WHD\u2019s national office and provided to us in May 2002 contained data on only 7 fatalities and 36 injuries reviewed by WHD in fiscal year 2001 and 7 fatalities and 32 injuries reviewed in fiscal year 2002. 28. We agree with Labor\u2019s statement that our recommendation to consider enhancing the data collected on children who work by expanding CPS to include 14-year-olds or beginning additional cohorts of NLSY cannot be implemented without additional study and resources, which is why we recommended that the Secretary \u201cconsider\u201d these actions instead of recommending that they be taken. We clarified our conclusions to acknowledge that collecting these data may require additional resources. 29. We continue to believe that WHD\u2019s regional and district offices cannot target their resources in the most effective manner without having better criteria from WHD\u2019s national office on how to target their enforcement efforts, including information from WHD\u2019s investigations database on previous child labor investigations and from BLS and NIOSH on the industries in which children work and those in which they are most likely to be injured or killed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Other major contributors to this report are Wendy Ahmed, Amy E.
