However, from an audit perspective, SBA's lack of documentation of the model development process precluded GAO, and others, from independently evaluating the model's development and determining if SBA used a sound and consistently applied method to select and reject model variables. Taking into account economic reasoning and research, SBA's econometric equations for estimating defaults, prepayments, and recoveries were reasonable. SBA's equations used a limited set of variables; equations using other variables could also be reasonable but would produce different estimates. Since an estimate is an approximation, no one estimate can be considered accurate, and reasonable estimates can fall within a range of values. The model's estimated default and recovery rates were in line with recent historical experience. SBA could improve its estimation methodology by periodically checking for and correcting errors and should consider adding more borrower information, such as credit scores. Some errors in the model resulted in understating the estimated program costs. SBA used the expertise of other agencies and a contractor to develop its model and worked closely with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which must approve the methodology agencies use to estimate subsidies. OMB officially approved the model in the fall of 2002. SBA did not adequately document its model development process, including alternative variables considered and rejected, to enable external reviewers to assess the process that was used. Further, GAO and two other independent reviewers could not determine whether a bias existed in the model by systematically excluding variables to influence the subsidy rate in a particular direction. Adequate documentation, a key internal control, would enable SBA and other agencies to demonstrate the rationale and basis for key aspects of the model that provide important cost information for budgets, financial statements, and congressional decision makers and facilitate SBA's annual financial statement audit. Current OMB and other guidance is either silent or unclear about the level of documentation necessary for credit subsidy model development. SBA had a process to help ensure data integrity and data consistency in the equations with the loan-level data in its databases. Although errors existed in SBA's data systems, the magnitude and nature of these errors were not likely to significantly affect the subsidy rate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 7(a) program is the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) largest  lending program for small businesses. SBA reported that it approved about  $8.6 billion in loan guarantees in fiscal year 2003. The program provides  loan guarantees of up to 85 percent for loans made to small businesses that  are unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms in the private credit  markets. Like most federal loan or loan guarantee programs, SBA\u2019s 7(a)  program is subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). FCRA  requires most agencies with government lending programs to estimate  annually the cost to the federal government of extending or guaranteeing  credit over the life of the loans (the subsidy cost). Since an estimate is an  approximation, no one estimate can be considered accurate with certainty,  and reasonable estimates can fall within a range of values. Changes in  estimation methodologies, variables, or data used to calculate an estimate,  are likely to result in differences in the estimate. In fiscal year 2003, SBA  implemented a new methodology to estimate the subsidy cost of the 7(a)  program that is based on econometric modeling. SBA officials told us that  the new 7(a) model was the first step in a long-term effort to develop and  implement new econometric models for their credit programs. Although  this allowed SBA to build a model that responds to the need for greater  sensitivity to a wider variety of factors than a model based on historical  averages, SBA believes that this approach may not be appropriate for all its  credit programs.", "In order to calculate the subsidy cost of their programs, agencies must  estimate the present value of future cash flows over the life of the program,  which for the 7(a) program are principally affected by defaulted loans,  prepayments of outstanding loans, recoveries on defaulted loans, and fees.  The revised method SBA adopted for the subsidy calculation has four  segments: (1) the econometric equations that are used to estimate the  likelihood of defaults and prepayments, (2) the equations used to estimate  the extent of recoveries, (3) the cash flow module, and (4) the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Credit Subsidy Calculator, as shown in  figure 1. The results of the first and second segments\u2014the econometric  equations\u2014are a key input into the third. The third segment\u2014the cash flow  module\u2014uses these results, along with OMB forecasts of interest rates,  unemployment rates, and gross domestic product growth rates to estimate  cash inflows from fees and recoveries on defaulted loans and outflows  from claim payments on defaulted loans. The resulting cash flows are  entered into the fourth segment, the OMB Credit Subsidy Calculator, which  calculates the (1) present values of the cash flows and (2) the subsidy rate.", "This report responds to your November 26, 2002, and December 11, 2002,  requests that we review the methodology that SBA developed to estimate  the subsidy costs of its 7(a) loan program for the fiscal year 2004 budget. As  agreed with your staff, we (1) assessed the reasonableness of the model\u2019s  econometric equations and evaluated the model\u2019s estimated default and  recovery rates based on the 7(a) program\u2019s recent historical loan  experience; (2) identified any additional steps SBA could take to further  enhance the reliability of its subsidy estimate produced by the model; (3)  described SBA\u2019s process for developing the subsidy model; (4) evaluated  the model\u2019s supporting documentation including its discussion of what  variables were tested and rejected; and (5) determined what steps SBA  takes to ensure the integrity of the data used in the model and determined  whether these data are consistent with information in SBA\u2019s databases. We  did not, however, validate SBA\u2019s model.", "First, to analyze the model, we obtained from SBA copies of the model as  approved by OMB in 2002, along with the loan-level data that were used to  develop the subsidy estimates. We analyzed the econometric equations to  determine whether they were reasonable based on the variables they  included, the statistical techniques used, and the results obtained. For  example, we determined whether the econometric equations included  appropriate variables and whether the variables used in the equations were  statistically significant. To evaluate the model\u2019s estimated default and  recovery rates, we compared these rates with recent historical loan  experience of the 7(a) program provided by SBA. Using SBA\u2019s data, we also  calculated what SBA would have estimated for default and recovery rates  based on the estimation methodology it used prior to its fiscal year 2003  budget submission. Second, to identify any additional steps SBA could take  to enhance the reliability of its model, we considered additional types of  data that SBA might collect and consider including in its econometric  equations. As part of this analysis, we reviewed the academic literature on  default modeling and interviewed officials with several banks engaged in  similar efforts. Third, to describe SBA\u2019s process for developing the model  we met with SBA and OMB officials. Fourth, to evaluate the model\u2019s  supporting documentation, including its discussion of what variables were  tested and rejected, we obtained and analyzed available relevant  documents and met with SBA officials and their contractor who developed  the model. We compared the information presented in SBA\u2019s model  documentation with existing credit subsidy guidance. Finally, to determine  what steps SBA took to ensure the integrity of the data used by the model  and to determine whether these data were consistent with information in  its databases, we assessed SBA\u2019s processes for ensuring data reliability. We  examined the type and level of errors and evaluated the likelihood that they  would significantly affect the credit subsidy estimates. We also compared  the loan-level data used in the model with the data contained in SBA\u2019s  databases.

FCRA requires agencies with loan guarantee programs to  estimate the subsidy cost, or the cost to the government, of their loan  guarantees over the life of the loan. To calculate the subsidy costs, agencies  must calculate, on a cohort basis, the net present value of the forecasted  cash flows for the program, which for SBA included estimated defaults,  recoveries, and fees related to the 7(a) program. In addition, as part of this  process, SBA must determine the effects of loan prepayments on the cash  flows. Under FCRA, SBA provides information that generates a single  subsidy rate and does not provide information about any uncertainty in its  estimate of the rate or other factors affecting the rate, such as prepayments  or defaults.", "Prior to its 2003 budget submission, SBA\u2019s methodology for estimating the  subsidy on its 7(a) loans used historical averages for defaults and  recoveries based on loan data going back to 1986 as the basis for estimates  of future defaults and recoveries. This approach resulted in fairly stable  subsidy estimates on a yearly basis as it included a sufficient volume of  historical information that smoothed out fluctuations in economic  conditions from year to year. However, this approach resulted in SBA  consistently overestimating defaults and recoveries. In previous work, we  found that SBA overestimated defaults by about $2 billion from fiscal years  1992 to 2000.", "In an effort to improve the accuracy of its subsidy estimate, SBA  implemented a new methodology based on econometric modeling to  estimate the subsidy cost for the fiscal year 2003 and 2004 budget  submissions. Econometric modeling has advantages over historical  averaging. For example, to the extent that data are available, it can take  into account the effects of changes in such factors as economic conditions,  program rules, and loan types on defaults and prepayments.", "All forecasts are uncertain, and this uncertainty has multiple causes. When  relationships among economic variables are estimated, uncertainty may  arise from the choice of variables used in the model, from the degree of  precision with which the strength of the relationships is estimated, and  from uncertainty about the future values of the independent variables used  in the forecasting equation. Excluding a variable that should be in a  forecasting model can reduce the quality of the model. For example, if  some industries have high default rates, then excluding industry variables  will tend to underestimate default costs in years when many loans go to  high risk industries and overstate default costs in years when many loans  go to low risk industries. The choice of variables to be used in a model  results from a process of professional judgment and balancing the risks of  including too many or too few variables. Economic theory and statistical  tests play an important role in these decisions. The remaining sources of  uncertainty, the precision of the estimated relationships and uncertainty  about future values of independent variables, are often beyond the control  of those building the model. The precision of the effects of the independent  variables is determined largely by the amount of data available to the  analyst, and uncertainty about future values of independent variables is  inherent in any forecast.", "Internal control is a major part of managing an organization and this  includes controls over data gathering and processing, such as SBA\u2019s data on  7(a) loans. As mandated by the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of  1982, the Comptroller General issues standards for internal control in the  federal government. These standards provide the overall framework for  establishing and maintaining internal control and for identifying and  addressing major performance and management challenges and areas at  greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. According to  these standards, internal control comprises the plans, methods, and  procedures used to meet missions, goals, and objectives. Control activities  are the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce  management\u2019s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to address  risks. Control activities are an integral part of an entity\u2019s planning,  implementing, reviewing, and accounting for government resources and  achieving effective results. They include a wide range of diverse activities  including controls over information processing. These controls are  established to ensure that all data inputs are received, are valid, and  outputs are correct. Agency management should design and implement  internal control based on the related costs and benefits.

Economic reasoning and prior  research suggested that differences in borrower and loan characteristics  and economic conditions were likely to influence defaults and  prepayments. For example, prior research suggested that new businesses  were less likely to survive than were established businesses and thus were  more likely to default. Prior research also suggested that the likelihood of  default on loans made to partnerships or corporations should be less than it  was for loans made to sole proprietors, while the likelihood of prepayment  should be greater.

For example, SBA\u2019s default equation suggested  that defaults were more likely when unemployment was higher, and the  rate of increase in gross domestic product was lower. Both of these  estimated relationships were consistent with economic reasoning because  it was less likely borrowers would continue paying their debts when more  people are out of work, and the economy was growing less rapidly or in  decline.", "SBA\u2019s prepayment equation also suggested that prepayments were more  likely when loans were made under the SBA Express Program, for which  SBA guaranteed a smaller percentage of the loan amount than it did under  the regular 7(a) business loan program. This result was consistent with our  expectations because the smaller guarantee was likely to make lenders  more cautious in making lending decisions, such that firms borrowing  through this program may have been more creditworthy than firms  borrowing through the regular program. In turn, the businesses\u2019 enhanced  creditworthiness may have led to more prepayments because these  businesses may have been relatively more financially stable and may have  been more likely to pay off their loans early.

The  choice of variables included in a model reflects the modelers\u2019 professional  judgment and different equations using different sets of variables can all be  considered reasonable. To analyze the effect of adding additional variables,  we tested SBA\u2019s model to estimate the 2003 subsidy cost using additional  variables that (1) measured the current interest rate on 1-year U.S. Treasury  bills and (2) considered the industry in which the borrowing firm operates.  The interest rate could be important as either another measure of general  business conditions or as a specific measure of the cost of capital. The  industry in which the borrowing firm operates could be important if default  and/or prepayment rates vary among industries, and the distribution of  loans among industries varies over time. In addition, banks have  traditionally recognized that the financial performance of a borrower  depends on the nature of the business supporting the loan, the structure of  the loan, and the financial condition of the firm. At the time of our review,  SBA\u2019s econometric equations contain information on the loan and the firm  but did not include information on the firm\u2019s business.", "The estimates produced by our testing suggest that these variables also  influenced the likelihood of defaults and prepayments occurring and,  therefore, that equations using these variables could also be reasonable.  However, there are additional considerations that could be important in  deciding whether to include a measure of interest rates in the default and  prepayment equations. Specifically, including an interest rate variable  would mean that forecasted interest rates would be used with the results of  the econometric equations (and forecast values of other economic  variables) to forecast future defaults and prepayments. The fact that  forecasting interest rates is difficult may be a reason for not including an  interest rate variable, even if the variable appears to be significantly related  to the historical likelihood of default or prepayment. Furthermore, at  present, forecasted interest rates are low relative to the interest rates that  prevailed over most of the period from which the data were drawn to  develop SBA\u2019s equations, potentially limiting the usefulness of including an  interest rate variable.", "We found that including either the interest rate on 1-year Treasury bills or  the industry in which the borrowing firm operates as a variable in the  default and prepayment equations changed the estimated cost of the  program. (See app. II.) According to SBA\u2019s model, the estimated subsidy  rate for loans disbursed in 2003 was 1.04 percent. This estimate increased  to 1.13 percent with the industry identifiers included and decreased to 0.76  percent with the inclusion of the interest rate on 1-year Treasury bills. In  addition, when we included both the interest rate variable and the industry  identifiers, we estimated a subsidy rate of 0.83 percent. Because interest  rates are difficult to predict and have recently been quite low, we  conducted tests to determine how sensitive the estimate was to small  changes in forecasted interest rates. We found that it is not very sensitive to  such changes. For example, when we increased the forecasted values  above those included in the official OMB forecast by 10 percent, we  estimated a subsidy rate of 0.80 percent while when we decreased the  forecasted values by 10 percent we estimated a subsidy rate of 0.73  percent.", "The range of estimated subsidy rates that result from including additional  variables was roughly comparable to the range that resulted from using  different economic assumptions. We tested the sensitivity of SBA\u2019s  estimated subsidy rate to small changes in the forecast values of the GDP  growth rate and the unemployment rate by reestimating the subsidy rate  with SBA\u2019s model but used both more optimistic and more pessimistic  assumptions about future economic conditions.

In  particular, this equation did not include any economic variables, so  forecasted recovery rates were estimated to resemble historical recovery  rates even though economic conditions in the future might be quite  different from the past.

Therefore, one would not expect the estimated loan  performance to exactly mirror historical experience. However, these types  of comparisons are useful to evaluate the model\u2019s estimated default and  recovery cash flows.

These variables include earnings, capital, payment records, and  available collateral, all of which have been shown to affect  creditworthiness and likelihood of default. Profit levels, for example, help  predict a business\u2019s ability to generate cash internally to cover loan  payments. Records of debt payments help determine whether a business  can cover its obligations, while available collateral tells a lender whether a  business has the resources to cover outstanding debts during a financial  crisis.

First,  the recovery estimates were based on the assumption that loans would be  issued during fiscal year 2003 instead of during fiscal year 2004, although  default and prepayment estimates were based on the later year. As a result,  the model estimated that recovery cash flows would occur 1 year early,  affecting the net present value of the cash flows and the subsidy rate.

This model\u2019s methodology  has the potential to produce more reliable estimates than the previous  method of using historical averaging to project the estimated program cash  flows because this model relies on economic reasoning in addition to  historical program data. However, the precision of any econometric model  is limited because any estimate produced by such a model should be  considered one point in a range within which the actual subsidy cost will  likely fall. Because the budget process requires agencies to select a specific  estimate rather than project a range, there will likely be some variance  between the forecasted and actual subsidy amounts. Using additional data  that SBA anticipates gathering in its new loan monitoring system, such as  borrower-specific data, could further enhance the reliability of SBA\u2019s  estimates of the subsidy cost. Therefore, further enhancements could  produce more reliable results.", "Although the errors we identified in the model did not materially affect the  subsidy cost estimate, they did indicate that the process SBA used to  validate the model could be improved.

However, as we  reported, three independent external reviews of SBA\u2019s 7(a) model were  hampered by a lack of adequate documentation of SBA\u2019s model  development process. We reaffirm our conclusion that adequate  documentation is needed for the SBA 7(a) model\u2019s development and that  independent external review and oversight will continue to be hampered  without a requirement to provide adequate documentation about how  econometric models are developed.", "OMB stated that Ernst and Young was able to independently validate SBA\u2019s  7(a) model with the available documentation. According to OMB, this firm  stated that the 7(a) model assumptions and methodology appeared to be  reasonable and accurate. We obtained and reviewed the reports OMB cited  and found that the firm was not hired to validate or review the same  segments of the model that we reviewed. This series of reports was related  to the cash flow module of the 7(a) model, as well as the model used to  calculate reestimates, but did not review the econometric equations or the  model\u2019s development process. In its report, the firm explicitly stated that it  was not reviewing the same parts of the model that we reviewed. We  confirmed this information in conversations with the accounting firm\u2019s  engagement partner and concluded that this firm\u2019s work was not relevant  to the findings and conclusions presented in our report.", "OMB also commented that SAS No. 57 states that internal controls over  accounting estimates may or may not be documented. While SAS No. 57  does state that the process for preparing accounting estimates may not be  documented, it also states that auditors should assess whether there are  additional key factors or alternative assumptions that need to be included  in the estimate and assess the factors that management used in developing  the assumptions. Further, SAS No. 57 states that auditors should  concentrate on key factors and assumptions that are subjective and  susceptible to misstatement and bias. We believe this includes the selection  and rejection of variables that can be included in the model. Without  adequate documentation on the credit subsidy model development  process, it is difficult for auditors to fulfill their responsibilities to assess  these areas.", "OMB also commented that SBA fulfilled the management responsibilities  described in SAS No. 57 regarding internal controls for accounting  estimates. We disagree with this statement and point out that SAS No. 57  provides guidance for auditing accounting estimates as part of conducting  financial statement audits rather than directing agency management\u2019s  actions. Management\u2019s responsibility for internal controls are contained in  our \u201cStandards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,\u201d which  states, among other things, that \u201cinternal control and all transactions and  other significant events need to be clearly documented, and the  documentation should be readily available for examination.\u201d Further, as  previously stated, Cotton and Company also identified the lack of adequate  model documentation as an internal control weakness. Moreover, SBA\u2019s  CFO generally agreed with the independent public accountant\u2019s report\u2019s  findings, including the deficiencies in SBA\u2019s model documentation, and  stated that the internal control report presented \u201cfundamentals of good  financial management and SBA is committed to accomplishing as many of  these items as possible in the coming year.\u201d", "OMB also stated that requiring agencies to prepare additional  documentation of the variables tested and rejected would be unduly  burdensome. We disagree with this statement and note that this  documentation would only need to be prepared when a model is developed  or when significant updates are implemented. Further, this requirement  would be consistent with other segments of OMB Circular A-11 that require  agencies to provide supporting documentation for their budget  submissions. However, as we mentioned in the report, there is currently no  explicit guidance for agencies to document the development of the models  that are used to generate credit subsidy estimates.", "OMB also commented that we received sufficient information to test  alternative variables to measure the reasonableness of the final SBA credit  subsidy model. We note that our work demonstrated that using additional  variables that were also reasonable changed the subsidy estimate. We  believe that this work highlights the need for agencies to document their  basis for rejecting variables or combinations of variables from their final  credit subsidy models. By documenting this work, agencies will be able to  demonstrate to independent reviewers that a bias from variable selection  does not exist in the final model.", "Both agencies provided technical comments that we incorporated into the  report as appropriate.

Because multinomial regression is a simultaneous estimation  process, the default and prepayment equations are identically specified  (that is, the same explanatory variables are used in each equation). SBA  conducts its analysis at the level of the individual loan, using loans that  were disbursed from 1988 through 2001. For each loan, SBA\u2019s data set  contains an observation for each quarter that the loan is active. For  example, if a loan prepays at the end of the third year (counting the  disbursement year as the first year), then it is active during 12 quarters and,  therefore, there are 12 observations for that loan in the data set.", "For each observation, the dependent variable measures whether in that  quarter the borrower defaults on the loan, prepays the loan, or keeps it  active. As a result, the coefficients in the default or prepayment equation  are estimates of the association of each explanatory variable with the  likelihood of the loan defaulting or prepaying in that quarter.", "There are several categories of explanatory variables included in the  default and prepayment equations. The first group consists of a set of  dummy variables that indicate the age of the loan. These variables thus  serve to reflect the fact that prepayment and default behavior change as a  loan seasons. Specifically, there is a dummy variable for each of the first  ten quarters of the life of a loan. From the eleventh quarter to the thirty- fourth quarter, there is a dummy variable for each two consecutive  quarters. Finally, if a loan remains active past an age of thirty-four quarters,  there is one more dummy variable.", "The second set of explanatory variables concern loan characteristics. A set  of dummy variables indicates the contractual term of the loan at  origination. The categories are less than 5 years, 5 to up to 10 years, 10  years to up to 15 years, and 15 years or greater. Less than five years serves  as the omitted category in the regression. Loan amount is another  characteristic and is measured in millions of dollars. SBA also includes a  dummy variable that shows whether a loan was delivered through the SBA  Express Program. Also known as Subprogram 1027, this program allows  lenders to originate a loan using their own loan documents instead of SBA  documents and processing, but the loan guarantee is only up to 50 percent.  By comparison, the typical SBA guarantee is almost 80 percent. Finally,  there is a set of dummy variables for type of lender:  Regular, Preferred, and  Certified. In the regression, the regular type serves as the omitted category.", "The next set of explanatory variables provides information on the  borrower. A set of dummy variables identifies ownership structure. The  categories are sole proprietorship, corporation, or partnership. Sole  proprietorship is the omitted category in the regression. An additional  dummy variable indicates whether the borrower is a new business. Finally,  there is a set of dummy variables that indicate the U.S. Census Bureau  region where the borrower is located.", "The final set of explanatory variables contains two measures of economic  conditions.  The first is the state unemployment rate where the borrower is  based.  The source for these data is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The  second is the quarterly percentage change in gross domestic product. SBA  obtained these data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Table 1  summarizes the explanatory variables.", "The coefficients in the SBA equations indicate that the probability of both  defaults and prepayments generally increase and then decline as a loan  seasons. Defaults peak during the eighth quarter while prepayments peak  around quarters 27 and 28. Longer-term loans are less likely to default or  prepay. By comparison, larger loans are more likely to default or prepay.  Good economic conditions, as reflected by the coefficients on  unemployment and the percentage change in gross domestic product,  reduce the chances of default and increase the likelihood of prepayment.  The positive coefficients on the variable for new business indicate that  such firms are more likely to default and prepay. Corporations and  partnerships are less likely to default and more likely to prepay than sole  proprietors.

We selected that rate, in part, because of the availability of forecasted  values for it that would be consistent with the forecasted values SBA uses  for other economic indicators in forecasting future defaults and  prepayments.", "To create the industry-specific dummy variables, we used data from SBA  that identified the borrower\u2019s industry category, using either the Standard  Industrial Classification (SIC) codes or the North American Industrial  Classification (NAIC) codes. The NAIC is the Department of Commerce\u2019s  current system for classifying businesses into industries and in 1997 the  NAIC codes replaced the SIC codes that Commerce previously used. When  possible, for loans that had NAIC codes, but not SIC codes, we converted  the NAIC code into the corresponding SIC code. We aggregated the SIC  codes into broader categories defined by the first digit of the code. To  reduce the number of dummy variables, we aggregated some small  categories. In particular, we aggregated mining and construction and  combined the small number of firms classified in the public administration  industry with firms in the service industry and used that category as the  omitted category in our regressions. As a result, the coefficients on the  industry-specific dummy variables should be interpreted as the difference  in the likelihood of default and prepayment from the likelihood for the  service category. Table 5 shows how loans in SBA\u2019s database are distributed  among categories defined by single-digit SIC codes.", "The coefficients for the interest rate on 1-year Treasury bills are positive  and highly significant for the default equations, as expected, and negative  and highly significant for the prepayment equation.

In addition,  the unit of analysis is the cohort of loans rather than individual loans. The  recovery equation uses ordinary least squares to regress the cumulative net  recovery rate on a set of dummy variables for the age of the cohort. The  cumulative net recovery rate is defined as cumulative net recoveries to date  divided by cumulative defaults to date. Each dummy variable covers two  quarters ranging from quarters 1 and 2 to quarters 55 and 56. As expected  for a cumulative dependent variable, the coefficients are generally  increasing.

Bearing  Point reported that its review was severely limited by the lack of  documentation and did not assess the econometric segment of the  model. Ernst and Young reported that, at the request of SBA, it did not  assess the econometric component of the model.

Rather, an analysis of the variable  selection process and whether it was consistently applied to all  variables tested would more likely reveal whether such a bias existed in  the final model.", "We also do not concur with SBA\u2019s suggested change to the conclusions  of our report regarding whether a possible bias existed in the final  model. The bias that is described in our report would result from  variable selection or rejection. SBA discusses a statistical bias that  suggests that over the historical period the chosen model  systematically either under predicts or over predicts the likelihood of  defaults or prepayments. To provide reasonable assurance that a bias  was not introduced into the subsidy rate estimate through the choice of  particular equations from among the set of reasonable equations,  adequate documentation of the basis for selecting and rejecting  variables is an important internal control.
