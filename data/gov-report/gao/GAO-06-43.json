About a third or less of the workers at most sites received training and long-term income support, with workers over age 55 less likely to enter training than younger workers. Workers who did not visit a center most often said they needed to find a job right away and did not think they had time to visit a center, or did not think they needed help finding a new job. At the time GAO conducted its survey, most of the workers had either found a new job or retired. At three sites, over 60 percent of the workers were reemployed. At another site, only about 40 percent were reemployed, but another third had retired. And at the final site, about a third were reemployed, but this site had the highest proportion of workers who entered training and most of them were likely still in training. The majority of reemployed workers at four of five sites earned less than they had previously--replacing about 80 percent or more of their prior wages--but at one site over half the reemployed workers matched their prior wages. Few workers at each site received either the health insurance benefit or the wage insurance benefit available to some older workers. No more than 12 percent of workers at each site received the health insurance benefit, and at four of five sites, fewer than half the workers who visited a one-stop center were aware of it. Many workers did not use it because they had other coverage or because the cost of available health insurance was too high. No more than one in five of the older workers at each site received the wage insurance benefit, and at two sites, fewer than half the older workers who visited a center were aware of it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Manufacturing workers in the United States face an uncertain future, as  manufacturing employment continues to decline. The rate of  manufacturing job loss has slowed since early 2003, but manufacturing  employment has continued to fall despite overall employment growth.  Between January 2003 and June 2005, manufacturing employment in the  United States fell by 3.9 percent while overall employment increased by  2.6 percent. Finding a new job may be especially challenging for  manufacturing workers who lose their jobs as a result of international  trade, in part because they may be unable to adapt to the changing U.S.  labor market. These workers tend to be older and to have fewer  transferable skills than other laid-off workers, according to one study,  making reemployment assistance especially important for them.", "The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, established in 1962, is  the federal government\u2019s primary effort targeted at manufacturing workers  who lose their jobs as a result of international trade. The program, funded  at $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2005, is focused on manufacturing workers laid  off as a result of increased import competition or a shift of production  abroad. TAA provides up to 130 weeks of training and up to 104 weeks of  income support benefits to supplement the regular 26 weeks of  Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits available to workers in most  states. The TAA Reform Act of 2002 added two new benefits to the  program\u2014health insurance assistance and wage insurance for older  workers. In addition, the federal government funds reemployment services  such as job search assistance for dislocated workers and job seekers more  generally, including trade-affected workers, through the Workforce  Investment Act (WIA) Dislocated Worker program and the Employment  Service (ES) program. The U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) oversees the  TAA, WIA Dislocated Worker, and ES programs, which are generally  implemented at the state and local level through a network of one-stop  centers that provide access to a variety of employment and training  services.", "Despite the availability of a broad array of federally-funded services, little  is known nationally about the extent to which workers affected by  international trade use these services. Labor tracks the number of  individuals who receive services through the TAA, WIA Dislocated  Worker, and ES programs, but these data do not tell us the proportion of  workers affected by a given trade-related layoff who seek services or the  full range of services they receive. Workers affected by a trade-related  layoff could, for example, look for a job on their own; they could visit a  one-stop center and receive reemployment services such as workshops  and one-on-one assistance; or they could receive training and extended  income support. To better understand how trade-affected workers utilize  federally funded assistance, and what employment outcomes they achieve,  you asked us to examine the experiences of workers affected by a small  number of trade-related layoffs. Specifically, in this report we examine   (1) the extent to which workers accessed federally funded reemployment  services and the mix of services received, (2) the employment outcomes  these workers achieved, and (3) the extent to which workers used the new  health insurance and wage insurance benefits under the TAA program, and  the factors affecting their participation.", "To address these questions, we selected plant closures at five locations:  General Mills, Inc. (baked goods, Missouri); Lear Corporation (automotive  carpets, Pennsylvania); Sanmina-SCI Corporation (printed circuit boards,  Massachusetts); The Toro Company (lawnmower and snow-thrower  engines, Mississippi); and Weyerhaeuser Company (fine paper and pulp,  Washington). These plant closures all occurred since January 2003, and  Labor determined that all were related to international trade. In the  aggregate, about 1,500 workers were affected by these closures and were  potentially eligible for the TAA program, or almost half of 1 percent of the  estimated number of workers covered by the 3,618 TAA petitions certified  nationally during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The General Mills plant (near  St. Louis) and the Sanmina-SCI plant (near Boston) were located in large  metropolitan areas, the Lear and Toro plants were located in rural  counties, and the Weyerhaeuser plant was located in a medium-sized  town. We selected these sites because the plants manufactured a variety of  products, were located in different regions of the country, experienced a  layoff event that affected between 100 and 500 workers, and occurred after  the TAA Reform Act of 2002 was enacted (see fig. 1). The Toro layoff in  Mississippi affected over 100 workers total, but just 40 of them were  determined by Labor to have lost their jobs as a result of international  trade and were potentially eligible for TAA services. To learn about  strategies to help affected workers, we visited each layoff site and  interviewed state and local officials, company and union officials, and  training providers. To learn more about workers\u2019 experiences with  employment and training services and their reemployment outcomes, we  conducted a telephone survey of workers affected by each layoff. Survey  response rates for each layoff ranged from 66 percent to 86 percent. We  used the responses to make estimates about the entire population of each  site, after conducting an analysis of the difference between the survey  respondents and non-respondents. All percentage estimates from our  survey have margins of error of plus or minus 7 percent or less unless  otherwise noted. All wage related estimates from our survey have relative  margins of error of plus or minus 10 percent or less unless otherwise  noted. (For detailed survey results by site, see GAO-06-44SP.) Using data  from our worker survey, we performed multivariate regression analyses to  estimate the effects of factors such as age, gender, and education level on  the likelihood of receiving training and other services. We augmented the  survey with several focus group discussions of two to seven workers at  each site. We also reviewed state administrative data on workers\u2019  demographics and the services they received, as well as state wage  records on employment outcomes, when available. We assessed all data  for reliability and found them to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives. We performed our work from November 2004  through December 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

These  services are provided through a consolidated service delivery structure  called the one-stop system. In order to encourage the streamlined delivery  of employment services, WIA was enacted in 1998 and required that the  TAA, WIA, ES, and other federally funded programs provide employment  and training services through the one-stop center system made up of  nearly 2,000 individual one-stop centers operating in about 600 local  workforce areas across the nation. These program services may be  provided directly at a one-stop center, or at other locations through  referrals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Adjustment Assistance Program", "paragraphs": ["The TAA program was designed to assist workers who have lost their jobs  as a result of international trade. In order for workers to be eligible for  TAA benefits, Labor must certify that their layoff was trade affected. This  certification process begins when a petition on behalf of a group of laid-off  workers is filed with Labor. Petitions may be filed by a group of at least  three affected workers, the employer experiencing the layoff, a union, or a  state or local workforce agency. Labor has 40 days to investigate whether  workers were laid off as a result of international trade, for example  because of a shift in production to another country or an increase in  imports of articles like or similar to what the workers were involved in  producing. If Labor certifies the petition, it notifies the state in which the  layoff occurred, which then has responsibility for contacting the workers  eligible for TAA program benefits under the petition. States must inform  workers individually about the benefits available to them as well as how to  apply for benefits.", "The TAA program provides two primary benefits\u2014training and extended  income support. States have responsibility for approving training and  determining eligibility for extended income support, while local one-stop  centers are the main point of intake and actual delivery of TAA services  and benefits. Training benefits include vocational training, on-the-job  training, and remedial training (e.g., English as a second language or  literacy). Participants in TAA-approved training must attend training full- time. Program participants may also receive a total of 104 weeks of  extended income support beyond the 26 weeks of UI benefits available in  most states. This includes 78 weeks of extended income support while  workers are completing vocational training, and another 26 weeks if  workers are completing remedial training. During their first 26 weeks of  extended income support, participants must either be enrolled in training,  have completed training, or have a waiver from this requirement. To  qualify for extended income support, participants must be enrolled in  training by the later of two dates: either 16 weeks after being laid off or 8  weeks after Labor certified their petition. The maximum level of extended  income support payments in a state is set by statute at the state\u2019s  maximum UI benefit level.", "The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Reform Act of 2002 added several  new benefits to the TAA program, including the Health Coverage Tax  Credit (HCTC). Workers must be enrolled in training or have a waiver  from this requirement to be eligible for the HCTC benefit that helps  workers pay for health care insurance through a tax credit covering 65  percent of their premiums for qualified plans.  Workers can choose to  receive the tax credit in one of two ways\u2014as an advanced option that  covers 65 percent of their monthly premiums allowing them to lower the  amount they have to pay out of pocket for health coverage, or as an end of  year tax credit that is claimed on their income taxes.  The tax credit is  administered at the federal level by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and  three federal departments\u2014Treasury, Labor and Health and Human  Services\u2014share responsibility for implementing HCTC.  There are three  health plan options that are automatically HCTC-eligible:  COBRA continuation plans. Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, certain employers with 20 or more  employees are required to offer 18 to 36 months of continued health care  coverage to former employees and their dependents who lose health  coverage due to certain circumstances, such as when a worker is laid off.  Generally, health care insurers may charge individuals purchasing COBRA  continuation coverage no more than 102 percent of the total premium.", "Spousal coverage. Health care insurance obtained through a worker\u2019s  spouse\u2019s employer is also HCTC-eligible, provided that the employer  contributed less than 50 percent toward the cost of coverage.", "Individual market plans. Workers may use HCTC to cover a portion of  the monthly cost of individually purchased health insurance coverage if  the worker purchased the coverage at least 30 days prior to being laid off.", "In addition to the three options that are automatically qualified for HCTC,  the TAA Reform Act allows states to designate other coverage  alternatives\u2014called state-qualified options\u2014for HCTC recipients. For  example, states may make arrangements with individual health insurers,  among others, to provide HCTC-eligible coverage to TAA participants.", "The Reform Act also established as a demonstration project a wage  insurance benefit for older workers\u2014known as the Alternative Trade  Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) program. This program supplements the  incomes of workers 50 years of age or older who forgo TAA-funded  training and are able to find jobs within 26 weeks of being laid off that pay  less than $50,000 a year and pay less than what they previously earned. If  workers meet these criteria they are eligible to receive 50 percent of the  difference between their new and old wages up to a maximum of $10,000  over 2 years. Older trade-affected workers are only eligible for the wage  insurance program if the petition for TAA assistance that was filed with  Labor included a specific request for ATAA eligibility.", "About $750 million was appropriated for income support for trade-affected  workers for fiscal year 2005, while another $259 million was appropriated  for training. Labor allocates 75 percent of these training funds to states  according to a formula that takes into account each state\u2019s previous year  allocations, accrued expenditures and participant levels. Labor holds the  remaining 25 percent of training funds in reserve, to distribute to states  throughout the year according to need. To cover administrative costs  associated with the TAA program, Labor allocates to each state an  additional 15 percent of its program allocation (see table 1). For example,  Pennsylvania was allocated $20.6 million in fiscal year 2004 to provide  trade-affected workers with training and other services, and an additional  $3.1 million was allocated to cover costs associated with administering the  TAA program.

The initial core services\u2014including job search and  placement assistance, the provision of labor market information, and  preliminary assessment of skills and needs\u2014are available to everyone. If a  dislocated worker is determined to be unable to find a job or has a job that  does not lead to self-sufficiency after core services, intensive services may  be made available, which include comprehensive assessments,  development of an individual employment plan, and case management.  Dislocated workers who are determined to be unable to obtain or retain  employment after intensive services can move on to training. At this level,  dislocated workers can receive services including occupational skills  training and on-the-job training.", "The 1988 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act  generally requires employers with 100 or more workers to give notice\u2014 often called a WARN notice\u2014to the affected workers\u2019 representatives  (e.g., a labor union) or the workers themselves if they have no  representatives, as well as to the state dislocated worker unit 60 days in  advance of expected plant closings or mass layoffs. Once an employer  files a WARN notice with the state\u2019s dislocated worker unit, a rapid  response team is mobilized to provide immediate and on-site contact with  the employer experiencing layoffs as well as with employee  representatives to assess the needs of affected workers. Generally workers  are invited to attend a rapid response meeting where they are provided  with information about UI and other federally funded employment and  training services also available through the one-stop center system.  Typically, if they have reserved adequate funds to provide rapid response  services, states may also use rapid response funds for services including  providing additional assistance to local areas that are experiencing  increased unemployment, and to pay for direct services such as training.  States can also apply to Labor for national emergency grant funds to  provide additional employment and training services to workers affected  by mass layoffs and plant closings, or to provide temporary assistance to  workers affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.", "Labor monitors program performance by requiring states and localities to  track job seekers who receive core services that require significant staff  assistance, intensive services, and training.

Workers with lower pre-layoff wages were significantly more likely to visit  a one-stop center than workers with higher pre-layoff wages, and women  were twice as likely as men to visit a one-stop center, even after  accounting for other factors such as time since being laid off. General  Mills workers were also significantly less likely than workers in the other  sites to visit a one-stop center, which may have been linked to the fact that  the General Mills plant closure was TAA-certified several months after the  layoffs there began. According to union officials, many of the workers had  already been laid off by the time the petition was certified and, because of  this, Missouri state officials noted they had difficulty reaching these  workers to inform them about available benefits and services.", "Workers most commonly received one-on-one assistance such as job  search assistance (see fig. 3). Over half of the workers in each site  reported on our survey that they received one-on-one assistance at a one- stop center, for example with how to look for a job or how to enroll in  training. Workers were somewhat less likely to receive assessments,  attend workshops, or use self-serve one-stop center services on their own.  For example, at one-stop centers at each site we visited, workers were  able to use computers to conduct on-line job searches or to up-date their  resumes. However, some workers at these sites told us that they did not  use these one-stop center resources, because they could use their home  computers to access on-line job banks or to work on their resumes.

Staff at the  Lewistown, Pa., one-stop center developed three service tracks as a way to  streamline the assistance they provided to workers affected by the Lear  plant closure (see fig. 4). Workers were placed into one of three service  tracks depending on their interests and goals.  Workers interested in  getting a job right away were placed in the job seeking track that included  a series of workshops on interviewing and resume writing, while workers  interested in retraining were placed in the training/education track that  included several assessment tests to measure their basic skills and to  identify their career interests. A third service track was designed for  workers undecided about retraining or getting a job and included a  combination of workshops and assessments aimed at helping workers  determine if their job skills are in-demand and if their skill sets need  upgrading through training.", "States used a variety of federal funds to provide reemployment services to  trade-affected workers. In all five sites we visited, state or local officials  told us that TAA administrative funds were insufficient to provide TAA  participants with case management services, and they relied on other  funding sources, particularly ES or WIA, to fund these services. Only two  states\u2014Missouri and Washington\u2014used a portion of their TAA  administrative funds to fund one-on-one case management for TAA  participants at sites we studied. The proportion of TAA participants who  received services funded through WIA among the sites we studied ranged  from 8 percent of Toro workers in Mississippi to 37 percent of General  Mills workers in Missouri, according to administrative data.", "Local areas experienced some difficulties in using local WIA resources to  serve trade-affected workers, according to officials in the sites we visited,  and in response three states used alternative funding sources to provide  these services. At some sites existing case management resources were  not sufficient to meet the needs of trade-affected workers as well as other  workers using one-stop center services. For example, one-stop officials in  Massachusetts told us that they are reluctant to dedicate WIA case  management resources to assist TAA participants, because WIA case  managers are already busy working with WIA program participants. In  addition, concerns about WIA performance measures, especially those  related to reemployment and wage replacement, may serve as a  disincentive for local areas to co-enroll TAA participants. According to  state and local officials in two states, TAA participants tend to have higher  earnings in their previous jobs than the average local job-seeker and are  less likely to find jobs that pay at or near what they previously earned,  which can count against their WIA performance measures. In response to  these concerns, three of the states we visited also used national  emergency grants\u2014discretionary funds that Labor awards to states  experiencing large layoffs\u2014or statewide rapid response funds to serve  trade-affected workers. Massachusetts, for example, initially used a  portion of its rapid response set aside funds to serve Sanmina-SCI  workers, and later used $540,000 in national emergency grant funds. These  funds were used to support additional case managers to provide Sanmina- SCI workers with one-on-one assistance.  Similarly, Missouri received    about $1.4 million in national emergency grant funds to hire additional  staff including case managers and to provide training for dislocated  workers affected by several lay-offs that occurred in the St. Louis area,  including the General Mills plant closure.", "To address concerns that co-enrolling TAA participants in WIA may  negatively affect performance measures, Labor recently piloted an  initiative to encourage states to co-enroll participants in the WIA  Dislocated Worker program.

However, only about a third or less  of the workers at each site had received the benefits for over 1 year, and  no more than 8 percent of the workers at any site had received benefits for  longer than 18 months.

Fewer workers at  each site entered remedial training, which includes courses in literacy,  English as a second language, and General Equivalency Diploma (GED)  preparation. The proportion of workers entering remedial training funded  by any source was highest at Sanmina-SCI in Massachusetts, where  according to administrative data 50 percent of the workers who entered  training took remedial training. One-stop center officials in Massachusetts  told us a number of training providers in the area offered programs that  combined GED preparation or English as a second language instruction  with training in vocational skills.", "Most workers in sites in large metropolitan areas who entered training  attended proprietary schools, while workers in the other sites most  commonly attended public institutions such as community colleges and  vocational/technical schools.

Workers or one-stop center staff in four of the sites we  studied said age was a factor in workers\u2019 training decisions. For example,  one-stop center staff in Mississippi told us that older workers often lacked  the confidence to go back to school after many years away from the  classroom.  The Weyerhaeuser plant closure in Washington affected a  higher proportion of workers age 55 and older (57 percent) than any of the  other closures, and according to our survey only 5 percent of these older  Weyerhaeuser workers entered training, compared to 14 percent of  Weyerhaeuser workers under age 55.

In particular, lack of basic skills was  often cited as a factor affecting training enrollment. For example, the  Sanmina-SCI site in Massachusetts had the highest proportion of workers  without a high school degree or GED (14 percent) among the sites we  studied, and it had the highest proportion of workers enrolled in remedial  training. One-stop center staff in Massachusetts said many of the workers  affected by the Sanmina-SCI plant closure lacked basic skills and needed  GED preparation or English as a second language instruction. In  Washington, a college official said inadequate math and science skills  constrained training options for some dislocated workers. These workers  chose to enter programs to become licensed practical nurses or certified  nursing assistants because they lacked the basic skills necessary to enroll  in training to become registered nurses.

For example, officials in Missouri and Washington  explained that workers must sometimes wait a number of weeks until the  start of the next community college semester, because of a lag between  the worker\u2019s layoff and the start of the next semester. In these cases,  workers might choose to attend a proprietary school with an open- enrollment policy rather than a community college, to avoid using up  several weeks of income support benefits while waiting to start training, or  they might opt for a shorter-term training program to avoid running out of  income support before completing training.", "Officials in two sites that are not in large metropolitan areas said a lack of  training programs in the local area limited workers\u2019 training options. One- stop center officials in Pennsylvania said a shortage of affordable training  programs in the Lewistown area, in particular the lack of a community  college, has been a barrier to training enrollment for Lear workers. One  Lear worker told us he was interested in a particular training program at a  community college, but he could not enroll in the program in part because  it would have been about a 50-mile commute each way.

A large  majority sought some assistance from their one-stop center. Relatively  small numbers chose to enroll in training, but those who did often used  this opportunity to chart a new career path. A few did not seek any  federally funded reemployment services, and yet were still successful in  getting a new job. We cannot know all the factors that motivated workers  to seek particular services or that affected their employability, and we  cannot assess the role that TAA services played in the outcomes workers  achieved. It may be that some workers make an independent assessment  of what they need to help them rejoin the workforce and then try to take  the necessary steps to make that happen.", "While few workers took advantage of training and long-term income  support through the TAA program, even fewer made use of two new  benefits under the TAA program\u2014health insurance assistance and wage  insurance for older workers. Workers who knew about the benefits  sometimes told us that the benefit levels were not high enough to get them  to participate. But relatively large numbers were simply not aware of the  benefits, and some said they might have applied for the benefits had they  known about them. Sometimes workers admitted to being overwhelmed  by the prospect of losing their jobs and by the wealth of information they  initially received. However, states\u2019 efforts to inform workers about and  explain these benefits have been mixed at best\u2014some trained their case  managers to answer questions from workers, while others did not see that  as their role. Despite Labor\u2019s efforts to encourage states to make this  information more widely available, many workers still do not know about  these benefits and, as a result, cannot make use of them.

The advantage of the multivariate approach is that the effect of  any given factor is estimated after its relationship with other factors is  taken into account. The factors we considered were sex, age, education,  tenure, time since the layoff, pre-layoff wage, and site, or the plant where  the worker had been employed.", "The logistic regression approach requires that we use odds and estimate  differences in the odds by taking their ratios. Table 12 below provides an  example of how odds and odds ratios are calculated. The top panel of  table 12 shows that 88 percent of female workers visited a one-stop center,  compared to 80 percent of male workers. Alternatively, we can calculate  the odds on women and men visiting a one-stop center, which were 291/38  = 7.7 and 608/150 = 4.0, respectively. These odds imply that 7.7 women  visited a one-stop center for every woman that did not, and that 4.0 men  visited a one-stop center for every man that did not. Moreover, the ratio of  the two odds, 4.0/7.7 = 0.52 can be interpreted as meaning that the odds on  visiting a center were only half as large for men as for women. While this  might seem inconsistent with the difference between 88 percent and 80  percent, consider that 12 percent of the women but 20 percent of the men  (nearly twice the percentage) did not visit a one-stop center. When the  factor being considered has more than two categories, we choose any one  category arbitrarily as the referent category, and calculate the ratios of the  odds for all other categories relative to that one. For example, in the  bottom panel of table 12 we see the odds on visiting a one-stop center in  each of the five sites, and odds ratios which indicate how much different  the odds were for every site relative to General Mills. These odds ratios  indicate that at the Sanmina-SCI, Lear, and Weyerhaeuser sites, the odds  on visiting a one-stop center were greater than in General Mills, by factors  of 2.3, 2.8, and 2.0, respectively. The odds were highest at the Toro site, in  fact, but because all workers visited a center in that site, the odds, and  thus the odds ratio, are undefined.", "Table 13 shows the effects of the different factors on visiting a one-stop  center (first column), receiving training (second column), and receiving  the HCTC benefit (third column) when we use multivariate logistic  regression models to estimate their effects simultaneously. As noted  above, the advantage to this approach is that it allows us to estimate the  effect of each factor after taking account of the fact that the different  factors are related to each other (i.e., males and females in the sample may  have different lengths of service or wages, workers at different sites may  vary by sex, education, etc.) and have sometimes intertwined effects on  the outcomes of interest.", "Sex, pre-layoff wage, and site are the only factors that have significant  effects on the likelihood of visiting a one-stop center. Men were roughly  half as likely as women to visit a one-stop center (odds ratio of .486).  Better paid workers were less likely to visit a center as well, with every  $10 increase in pre-layoff wage diminishing the odds of visiting a center by  a factor of 0.617. Net of the other factors, workers at the Toro and  Weyerhaeuser sites were nearly 12 times as likely as workers at General  Mills to visit a center, and workers at the Sanmina-SCI and Lear sites were  roughly 3 times as likely as workers at General Mills to do so. This implies  that (1) workers at Toro and Weyerhaeuser were similar with respect to  the likelihood of visiting a center; (2) workers at Sanmina-SCI and Lear  were likewise similar; and (3) workers at Toro and Weyerhaeuser were  11.98/3.19 = 3.8 times as likely to visit a center as workers at Sanmina-SCI  and Lear. Once these effects, and the differences across sites, were taken  account of, none of the other factors (i.e., age, education, etc.) appeared to  have any significant effect.", "The only factors that had significant net effects on the likelihood of  receiving training were age and site. Workers over age 55 were less than  half as likely to receive training as workers under age 40. Workers at  Sanmina-SCI were more than three times as likely to receive training, and  workers at General Mills and Lear were more than twice as likely to  receive training, as workers at Toro and Weyerhaeuser.", "Finally, the factors which affected whether workers received the HCTC  benefit were sex, education, tenure, time since layoff, and site. Men were  twice as likely as women to receive HCTC, and workers with some college  were half as likely as workers with less than a high school education to  receive the HCTC benefit. Workers with 10 or more years of service were  less than half as likely to receive HCTC as workers with less than 10 years,  and workers laid off earlier were more likely to receive the benefit,  because each additional month since the layoff increases the odds on  receiving it by a factor of 1.025.
