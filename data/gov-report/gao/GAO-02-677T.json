This bill seeks to  strengthen federal government information security by reauthorizing and  expanding the information security, evaluation, and reporting  requirements enacted into law as the Government Information Security  Reform provisions (commonly referred to as \u201cGISRA\u201d) in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Concerned with reports  that continuing, pervasive information security weaknesses place federal  operations at significant risk of disruption, tampering, fraud, and  inappropriate disclosures of sensitive information, the Congress enacted  GISRA to reduce these risks and provide more effective oversight of  federal information security.", "As I stated in my March 6, 2002, testimony before the Government  Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations  Subcommittee, first-year implementation of GISRA represented a  significant step in improving federal agencies\u2019 information security  programs and addressing their serious, pervasive information security  weaknesses. However, first-year implementation indicated areas in which  GISRA could be strengthened and clarified to further improve federal  information security and congressional oversight. Furthermore, GISRA  will expire on November 29, 2002, less than a year away.", "In my testimony today, I will first discuss the need to continue  authorization of government information security legislation in view of the  major information security risks that are facing federal agencies. Next, I  will discuss major changes proposed in H.R. 3844, such as requiring annual  agency reporting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the  comptroller general, and establishing mandatory minimum security  controls. Finally, I will highlight other changes in H.R. 3844 intended to  clarify and streamline GISRA provisions.", "Messrs. Chairmen, this testimony is based on our analysis of the proposed  language of H.R. 3844 that you introduced in the House of Representatives  on March 5, 2002. It is also based on the results of our review of first-year  GISRA implementation as presented in my March 2002 testimony and in  our report, which is being released today entitled, Information Security:  Additional Actions Needed to Fully Implement Reform Legislation. We  performed our work during March and April 2002 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of  the Internet, continue to revolutionize the way our government, our  nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business.  However, this widespread interconnectivity also poses significant risks to  our computer systems and, more important, to the critical operations and  infrastructures they support, such as telecommunications, power  distribution, public health, national defense (including the military\u2019s  warfighting capability), law enforcement, government, and emergency  services. Likewise, the speed and accessibility that create the enormous  benefits of the computer age, if not properly controlled, allow individuals  and organizations to inexpensively eavesdrop on or interfere with these  operations from remote locations for mischievous or malicious purposes,  including fraud or sabotage.", "As greater amounts of money are transferred through computer systems,  as more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available information technology, the  likelihood increases that information attacks will threaten vital national  interests. Further, the events of September 11, 2001, underscored the need  to protect America\u2019s cyberspace against potentially disastrous cyber  attacks\u2014attacks that could also be coordinated to coincide with physical  terrorist attacks to maximize the impact of both.", "Since September 1996, we have reported that poor information security is  a widespread federal problem with potentially devastating consequences.  Although agencies have taken steps to redesign and strengthen their  information system security programs, our analyses of information  security at major federal agencies have shown that federal systems were  not being adequately protected from computer-based threats, even though  these systems process, store, and transmit enormous amounts of sensitive  data and are indispensable to many federal agency operations. In addition,  in both 1998 and 2000, we analyzed audit results for 24 of the largest  federal agencies and found that all 24 had significant information security  weaknesses. As a result of these analyses, we have identified information  security as a governmentwide high-risk issue in reports to the Congress  since 1997\u2014most recently in January 2001.", "These weaknesses continue as indicated by our most recent analyses for  these 24 large federal agencies that considered the results of inspector  general (IG) and GAO audit reports published from July 2000 through  September 2001, including the results of the IGs\u2019 independent evaluations  of these agencies\u2019 information security programs performed as required by  GISRA. These analyses showed significant information security  weaknesses in all major areas of the agencies\u2019 general controls, that is, the  policies, procedures, and technical controls that apply to all or a large  segment of an entity\u2019s information systems and help ensure their proper  operation. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of weaknesses across the 24  agencies for the following six general control areas: (1) security program  management, which provides the framework for ensuring that risks are  understood and that effective controls are selected and properly  implemented; (2) access controls, which ensure that only authorized  individuals can read, alter, or delete data; (3) software development and  change controls, which ensure that only authorized software programs are  implemented; (4) segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that one  individual can independently perform inappropriate actions without  detection; (5) operating systems controls, which protect sensitive  programs that support multiple applications from tampering and misuse;  and (6) service continuity, which ensures that computer-dependent  operations experience no significant disruptions.", "Our analyses showed that weaknesses were most often identified for  security program management and access controls. For security program  management, we found weaknesses for all 24 agencies in 2001 as  compared to 21 agencies (88 percent) in a similar analysis in 2000. For  access controls, we also found weaknesses for all 24 agencies in 2001\u2014the  same condition we found in 2000.", "Concerned with accounts of attacks on commercial systems via the  Internet and reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, on October 30, 2000, the  Congress enacted GISRA, which became effective November 29, 2000, and  is in effect for 2 years after this date. GISRA supplements information  security requirements established in the Computer Security Act of 1987,  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996  and is consistent with existing information security guidance issued by  OMB and NIST, as well as audit and best practice guidance issued by  GAO. Most importantly, however, GISRA consolidates these separate  requirements and guidance into an overall framework for managing  information security and establishes new annual review, independent  evaluation, and reporting requirements to help ensure agency  implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight.", "The law assigned specific responsibilities to OMB, agency heads and chief  information officers (CIOs), and the IGs. OMB is responsible for  establishing and overseeing policies, standards, and guidelines for  information security. This includes the authority to approve agency  information security programs, but delegates OMB\u2019s responsibilities  regarding national security systems to national security agencies. OMB is  also required to submit an annual report to the Congress summarizing  results of agencies\u2019 evaluations of their information security programs.  GISRA does not specify a date for this report.", "Each agency, including national security agencies, is to establish an  agencywide risk-based information security program to be overseen by the  agency CIO and ensure that information security is practiced throughout  the life cycle of each agency system. Specifically, this program is to  include periodic risk assessments that consider internal and external threats to the  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems, and to data  supporting critical operations and assets;  the development and implementation of risk-based, cost-effective policies  and procedures to provide security protections for information collected  or maintained by or for the agency;  training on security responsibilities for information security personnel and  on security awareness for agency personnel; periodic management testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of  policies, procedures, controls, and techniques; a process for identifying and remediating any significant deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting and responding to security incidents; an annual program review by agency program officials.", "In addition to the responsibilities listed above, GISRA requires each  agency to have an annual independent evaluation of its information  security program and practices, including control testing and compliance  assessment. The evaluations of non\u2013national-security systems are to be  performed by the agency IG or an independent evaluator, and the results  of these evaluations are to be reported to OMB. For the evaluation of  national security systems, special provisions include designation of  evaluators by national security agencies, restricted reporting of evaluation  results, and an audit of the independent evaluation performed by the IG or  an independent evaluator. For national security systems, only the results  of each audit of an evaluation are to be reported to OMB.", "Finally, GISRA also assigns additional responsibilities for information  security policies, standards, guidance, training, and other functions to  other agencies. These agencies are NIST, the Department of Defense, the  intelligence community, the Attorney General (Department of Justice), the  General Services Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H.R. 3844 Would Continue Benefits of Information Security Reform", "paragraphs": ["With GISRA expiring on November 29, 2002, H.R. 3844 proposes to  permanently authorize information security legislation that essentially  retains the same purposes as GISRA, as well as many of GISRA\u2019s  information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements. It  would also authorize funding to carry out its provisions for 5 years,  thereby providing for periodic congressional oversight of the  implementation and effectiveness of these requirements.", "We believe that continued authorization of information security legislation  is essential to improving federal information security. As emphasized in  our March 2002 testimony, the initial implementation of GISRA was a  significant step for agencies, the administration, and the Congress in  addressing the serious, pervasive weaknesses in the federal government\u2019s  information security. GISRA consolidated security requirements that  existed in law and policy before GISRA and put into law the following  important additional requirements, which are continued in H.R. 3844.", "First, GISRA requires agency program managers and CIOs to implement a  risk-based security management program covering all operations and  assets of the agency, including those provided or managed for the agency  by others. Instituting such an approach is important since many agencies  had not effectively evaluated their information security risks and  implemented appropriate controls. Our studies of public and private best  practices have shown that effective security program management  requires implementing a process that provides for a cycle of risk  management activities as now included in GISRA. Moreover, other efforts  to improve agency information security will not be fully effective and  lasting unless they are supported by a strong agencywide security  management program.", "Second, GISRA requires an annual independent evaluation of each  agency\u2019s information security program. Individually, as well as  collectively, these evaluations can provide much needed information for  improved oversight by OMB and the Congress. Our years of auditing  agency security programs have shown that independent tests and  evaluations are essential to verifying the effectiveness of computer-based  controls. Audits can also evaluate an agency\u2019s implementation of  management initiatives, thus promoting management accountability.  Annual independent evaluations of agency information security programs  will help drive reform because they will spotlight both the obstacles and  progress toward improving information security and provide a means of  measuring progress, much like the financial statement audits required by  the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. Further, independent  reviews proved to be an important mechanism for monitoring progress  and uncovering problems that needed attention in the federal  government\u2019s efforts to meet the Year 2000 computing challenge.", "Third, GISRA takes a governmentwide approach to information security  by accommodating a wide range of information security needs and  applying requirements to all agencies, including those engaged in national  security. This is important because the information security needs of  civilian agency operations and those of national security operations have  converged in recent years. In the past, when sensitive information was  more likely to be maintained on paper or in stand-alone computers, the  main concern was data confidentiality, especially as it pertained to  classified national security data. Now, virtually all agencies rely on  interconnected computers to maintain information and carry out  operations that are essential to their missions. While the confidentiality  needs of these data vary, all agencies must be concerned about the  integrity and the availability of their systems and data. It is important for  all agencies to understand these various types of risks and take  appropriate steps to manage them.", "Fourth, the annual reporting requirements provide a means for both OMB  and the Congress to oversee the effectiveness of agency and  governmentwide information security, measure progress in improving  information security, and consider information security in budget  deliberations. In addition to management reviews, annual IG reporting of  the independent evaluation results to OMB and OMB\u2019s reporting of these  results to the Congress provide an assessment of agencies\u2019 information  security programs on which to base oversight and budgeting activities.  Such oversight is essential for holding agencies accountable for their  performance, as was demonstrated by the OMB and congressional efforts  to oversee the Year 2000 computer challenge. This reporting also  facilitates a process to help ensure consistent identification of information  security weaknesses by both the IG and agency management.", "The first-year implementation of GISRA also yielded significant benefits in  terms of agency focus on information security. A number of agencies  stated that as a result of implementing GISRA, they are taking significant  steps to improve their information security programs. For example, one  agency stated that the law provided it with the opportunity to identify  some systemic program-level weaknesses for which it plans to undertake  separate initiatives targeted specifically to improve the weaknesses. Other  benefits agencies observed included (1) higher visibility of information  security within the agencies, (2) increased awareness of information  security requirements among department personnel, (3) recognition that  program managers are to be held accountable for the information security  of their operations, (4) greater agency consideration of security  throughout the system life cycle, and (5) justification for additional  resources and funding needed to improve security. Agency IGs also  viewed GISRA as a positive step toward improving information security  particularly by increasing agency management\u2019s focus on this issue.", "Implementation of GISRA has also resulted in important actions by the  administration which, if properly carried out, should continue to improve  information security in the federal government. For example, OMB has  issued guidance that information technology investments will not be  funded unless security is incorporated into and funded as part of each  investment, and NIST has established a Computer Security Expert Assist   Team to review agencies\u2019 computer security management. The  administration also has plans to direct large agencies to undertake a review to identify and prioritize  critical assets within the agencies and to identify their interrelationships  with other agencies and the private sector; conduct a cross-government review to ensure that all critical government  processes and assets have been identified; integrate security into the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard; develop workable measures of performance; develop electronic training on mandatory topics, including security; and explore methods to disseminate vulnerability patches to agencies more  effectively.", "Such benefits and planned actions demonstrate the importance of GISRA\u2019s  requirements and the significant impact they have had on information  security in the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Changes Proposed by H.R. 3844", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3844 proposes a number of changes and clarifications that we believe  could strengthen information security requirements, some of which  address issues noted in the first-year implementation of GISRA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing Mandatory Minimum Controls", "paragraphs": ["Currently, agencies have wide discretion in deciding what computer  security controls to implement and the level of rigor with which to enforce  these controls. In theory, some discretion is appropriate since, as OMB  and NIST guidance state, the level of protection that agencies provide  should be commensurate with the risk to agency operations and assets. In  essence, one set of specific controls will not be appropriate for all types of  systems and data. Nevertheless, our studies of best practices at leading  organizations have shown that more specific guidance is important. In  particular, specific mandatory standards for specified risk levels can  clarify expectations for information protection, including audit criteria;  provide a standard framework for assessing information security risk; help  ensure that shared data are appropriately and consistently protected; and  reduce demands for already limited agency information security resources  to independently develop security controls.", "In response to this need, H.R. 3844 includes a number of provisions that  would require the development, promulgation, and compliance with  minimum mandatory management controls for securing information and  information systems to manage risks as determined by agencies.  Specifically,", "NIST, in coordination with OMB, would be required to develop (1)  standards and guidelines for categorizing the criticality and sensitivity of  agency information according to the control objectives of information  integrity, confidentiality, and availability, and a range of risk levels, and (2)  minimum information security requirements for each information  category.", "OMB would issue standards and guidelines based on the NIST-developed  information and would require agencies to comply with them. This  increases OMB\u2019s information security authority, given that the secretary of  commerce is currently required by the Computer Security Act to issue  such standards.  These standards would include (1) minimum mandatory  requirements and (2) standards otherwise considered necessary for  information security.", "Agencies may use more stringent standards than provided by NIST, but  H.R. 3844 would require building more stringent protections on top of  minimum requirements depending on the nature of information security  risks.", "Waiver of the standards is not permitted\u2014they are intended to provide a  consistent information security approach across all agencies, while  meeting the mission-specific needs of each agency. Thus, agencies would  be required to categorize their information and information systems  according to control objectives and risk levels and to meet the minimum  information security requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting Information to the Congress", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3844 seeks to improve accountability and congressional oversight by  clarifying agency reporting requirements and ensuring that the Congress  and GAO have access to information security evaluation results. In  particular, it requires agencies to submit an annual report to both OMB  and the comptroller general. This reporting requirement is in addition to  the requirement in both GISRA and H.R. 3844 that IGs report the results of  independent evaluations to OMB and would help to ensure that the  Congress receives the information it needs for oversight of federal  information security and related budget deliberations. However, to ensure  that agencies provide consistent and meaningful information in their  reports, it would be important that any such reporting requirement  consider specifying what these reports should address.", "As reported in our March 2002 testimony, during first-year implementation  of GISRA, OMB informed the agencies that it considered GISRA material  the CIOs prepared for OMB to be predecisional and not releasable to the  public, the Congress, or GAO. OMB also considered agencies\u2019 corrective  action plans to contain predecisional budget information and would not  authorize agencies to release them to us. Later, OMB did authorize the  agencies to provide copies of their executive summaries, and through  continued negotiations with OMB since our March testimony, many  agencies are now providing us with the more detailed information that  they submitted to OMB. We are continuing to work with OMB to obtain  appropriate information from agencies\u2019 first-year GISRA corrective action  plans and to develop a process whereby this information can be routinely  provided to the Congress in the future.", "The Congress should have consistent and timely information for  overseeing agencies\u2019 efforts to implement information security  requirements and take corrective actions, as well as for budget  deliberations. In our report being released today, we recommend that  OMB authorize the heads of federal departments and agencies to release  information from their corrective action plans to the Congress and GAO  that would (1) identify specific weaknesses to be addressed, their relative  priority, the actions to be taken, and the timeframes for completing these  actions and (2) provide their quarterly updates on the status of completing  these actions. In commenting on our recommendation, OMB stated that it  recognizes Congress\u2019s oversight role regarding agencies\u2019 actions to correct  information security weaknesses and is continuing to develop a solution  for next year\u2019s reporting to provide to the Congress information on  agencies\u2019 corrective actions. However, OMB believed that removing  predecisional information from current year plans would be difficult and is  not having the agencies prepare information on their current plans that  would be releasable to the Congress. One way to help ensure that the  Congress receives such information would be to specifically require that  agencies report it to the Congress and GAO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsibilities for National Security Systems", "paragraphs": ["In our March 2002 testimony, we reported that we were unable to obtain  complete information on GISRA implementation for national security  systems.

In this regard, our report being released today  includes a recommendation that OMB provide the Congress with  appropriate summary information on the results of the audits of the  evaluations for information security programs for national security  systems.", "While we were unable to evaluate this aspect of GISRA implementation,  H.R. 3844 proposes to modify GISRA in a number of ways to clarify the  treatment of national security systems and to simplify statutory  requirements while maintaining protection for the unique requirements of  such systems within the risk management approach of the law.", "First, the bill replaces GISRA\u2019s use of the term \u201cmission critical system.\u201d  Instead, H.R. 3844 uses the traditional term \u201cnational security system,\u201d   maintaining the longstanding statutory treatment of military and  intelligence mission-related systems and classified systems. It would also  eliminate a separate category of systems included in GISRA\u2019s definition of  mission critical system\u2014debilitating impact systems\u2014that broadened the  exemption from GISRA for these systems.", "Second, consistent with the traditional definitions of national security  systems, H.R. 3844 provides more straightforward distinctions between  national security and non\u2013national-security systems. This simplifies the  law and could simplify compliance for agencies operating national security  systems.  The bill, for example, replaces GISRA\u2019s delegation of policy and  oversight responsibilities for national security systems from OMB to  national security agencies by simply continuing longstanding limitations  on OMB and NIST authority over national security systems.", "Third, H.R. 3844 makes a number of changes to GISRA to streamline  agency evaluation requirements that affect national security systems:", "The bill clarifies procedures for evaluating national security systems  within the context of agencywide evaluations.", "The results of the evaluations of national security systems, not the  evaluations themselves, are to be submitted to OMB, which will then  prepare a summary report for the Congress. As in GISRA, the actual  evaluations and any descriptions of intelligence-related national security  systems are to be made available to the Congress only through the  intelligence committees.", "The requirement for an audit of the evaluation of national security systems  is eliminated. Instead, agencies are required to provide appropriate  protections for national security information and, as discussed above,  submit only the results of the evaluations to OMB.", "We agree that these changes provide a more traditional definition of  national security systems, and that such systems should be appropriately  considered within the context of a comprehensive evaluation of agency  information security.  We also believe that requirements for reporting  evaluation results to OMB and for OMB to prepare a summary report for  the Congress would provide information needed for congressional  oversight.

Some of the more significant requirements are as follows:", "Agencies would be required to comply with all standards applicable to  their systems, including the proposed mandatory minimum control  requirements and those for national security systems. Thus, in  implementing an agencywide risk-management approach to information  security, agencies with both national security and non\u2013national-security  systems would need to have an agencywide information security program  that can address the security needs and standards for both kinds of  systems.", "Under the bill, the requirement for designating a senior agency information  security officer is more detailed than that under GISRA. This official is to  (1) carry out the CIO\u2019s responsibilities under the act; (2) possess  appropriate professional qualifications; (3) have information security as  his or her primary duty; and (4) head an information security office with  the mission and resources needed to help ensure agency compliance with  the act.", "H.R. 3844 also requires each agency to document its agencywide security  program and prepare subordinate plans as needed for networks, facilities,  and systems. GISRA uses both the terms \u201csecurity program\u201d and \u201csecurity  plan\u201d and does not specifically require that the program be documented.  Our guidance for auditing information system controls states that entities  should have a written plan that clearly describes the entity\u2019s security  program and policies and procedures that support it.", "H.R. 3844 stresses the importance of agencies having plans and procedures  to ensure the continuity of operations for information systems that  support the operations and assets of the agency. Such plans, procedures,  and other service continuity controls are important because they help  ensure that when unexpected events occur, critical operations will  continue without undue interruption and that crucial, sensitive data are  protected. Losing the capability to process, retrieve, and protect  electronically maintained information can significantly affect an agency\u2019s  ability to accomplish its mission. If service continuity controls are  inadequate, even relatively minor interruptions can result in lost or  incorrectly processed data, which can cause financial losses, expensive  recovery efforts, and inaccurate or incomplete information. For some  operations, such as those involving health care or safety, system  interruptions could even result in injuries or loss of life.

These changes include the following:  Information security: H.R. 3844 would create a definition for the term  \u201cinformation security\u201d to address three widely accepted objectives\u2014 integrity, confidentiality, and availability.  Including these objectives in  statute highlights that information security involves not only protecting  information from disclosure (confidentiality), but also protecting the  ability to use and rely on information (availability and integrity).", "Information technology: H.R. 3844 would retain GISRA\u2019s use of the  Clinger-Cohen Act definition of \u201cinformation technology.\u201d However, H.R.  3844 clarifies the scope of this term by using consistent references to  \u201cinformation systems used or operated by any agency or by a contractor of  an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency.\u201d This emphasizes  that H.R. 3844 is intended to cover all systems used by or on behalf of  agencies, not just those operated by agency personnel. As discussed  previously, both OMB\u2019s and GAO\u2019s analyses of agencies\u2019 first-year GISRA  reporting showed significant weaknesses in information security  management of contractor-provided or -operated systems.", "Independent evaluations: The legislation would continue the GISRA  requirement for an annual independent evaluation of each agency\u2019s  information security program and practices.

For example, the word  \u201crepresentative\u201d would be substituted for \u201cappropriate\u201d in the requirement  that the evaluation involve the examination of a sample of systems or  procedures.  In addition, the bill would also require that the evaluations be  performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards, and that GAO periodically evaluate agency information security  policies and practices. We agree with these proposed changes to  independent evaluations, but as noted in our March 2002 testimony, these  evaluations and expanded coverage for all agency systems under GISRA  and H.R. 3844 place a significant burden on existing audit capabilities and  require ensuring that agency IGs have necessary resources to either  perform or contract for the needed work.", "Federal information security incident center: The bill would direct  OMB to oversee the establishment of a central federal information security  incident center and expands GISRA references to this function.  While not  specifying which federal agency should operate this center, H.R. 3844  specifies that the center would provide timely technical assistance to agencies and other operators of compile and analyze information security incident information; consult with national security agencies and other appropriate agencies,  inform agencies about information security threats and vulnerabilities; and  such as an infrastructure protection office.", "H.R. 3844 would also require that agencies with national security systems  share information security information with the center to the extent  consistent with standards and guidelines for national security systems.  This provision should encourage interagency communication and  consultation, while preserving the discretion of national security agencies  to determine appropriate information sharing.", "Technical and conforming amendments: In addition to its substantive  provisions, H.R. 3844 would make a number of minor changes to GISRA  and other statutes to ensure consistency within and across these laws.

However, even with these and other  information security-related improvement efforts undertaken in the past  few years\u2014such as the president\u2019s creation of the Office of Homeland  Security and the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board\u2014 challenges remain.", "Given the events of September 11, and reports that critical operations and  assets continue to be highly vulnerable to computer-based attacks, the  government still faces a challenge in ensuring that risks from cyber threats  are appropriately addressed in the context of the broader array of risks to  the nation\u2019s welfare. Accordingly, it is important that federal information  security efforts be guided by a comprehensive strategy for improvement.  In 1998, shortly after the initial issuance of Presidential Decision Directive  (PDD) 63 on protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, we  recommended that OMB, which, by law, is responsible for overseeing  federal information security, and the assistant to the president for national  security affairs work together to ensure that the roles of new and existing  federal efforts were coordinated under a comprehensive strategy. Our  later reviews of the National Infrastructure Protection Center and of  broader federal efforts to counter computer-based attacks showed that  there was a continuing need to clarify responsibilities and critical  infrastructure protection objectives.", "As I emphasized in my March 2002 testimony, as the administration refines  the strategy that it has begun to lay out in recent months, it is imperative  that it take steps to ensure that information security receives appropriate  attention and resources and that known deficiencies are addressed.  These steps would include the following:  It is important that the federal strategy delineate the roles and  responsibilities of the numerous entities involved in federal information  security and related aspects of critical infrastructure protection. Under  current law, OMB is responsible for overseeing and coordinating federal  agency security, and NIST, with assistance from the National Security  Agency, is responsible for establishing related standards. In addition,  interagency bodies\u2014such as the CIO Council and the entities created  under PDD 63 on critical infrastructure protection\u2014are attempting to  coordinate agency initiatives. Although these organizations have  developed fundamentally sound policies and guidance and have  undertaken potentially useful initiatives, effective improvements are not  yet taking place. Further, it is unclear how the activities of these many  organizations interrelate, who should be held accountable for their  success or failure, and whether they will effectively and efficiently support  national goals.", "Ensuring effective implementation of agency information security and  critical infrastructure protection plans will require active monitoring by  the agencies to determine if milestones are being met and testing to  determine if policies and controls are operating as intended. Routine  periodic audits, such as those required by GISRA and H.R. 3844, could  allow for more meaningful performance measurement. In addition, the  annual evaluation, reporting, and monitoring process established through  these provisions, is an important mechanism, previously missing, to hold  agencies accountable for implementing effective security and to manage  the problem from a governmentwide perspective.", "Agencies must have the technical expertise they need to select, implement,  and maintain controls that protect their information systems. Similarly, the  federal government must maximize the value of its technical staff by  sharing expertise and information. Highlighted during the Year 2000  challenge, the availability of adequate technical and audit expertise is a  continuing concern to agencies.", "Agencies can allocate resources sufficient to support their information  security and infrastructure protection activities. Funding for security is  already embedded to some extent in agency budgets for computer system  development efforts and routine network and system management and  maintenance. However, some additional amounts are likely to be needed  to address specific weaknesses and new tasks. OMB and congressional  oversight of future spending on information security will be important to  ensuring that agencies are not using the funds they receive to continue ad  hoc, piecemeal security fixes that are not supported by a strong agency  risk management process.", "Expanded research is needed in the area of information systems  protection. While a number of research efforts are underway, experts have  noted that more is needed to achieve significant advances. As the director  of the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center testified before this subcommittee  last September, \u201cIt is essential to seek fundamental technological solutions  and to seek proactive, preventive approaches, not just reactive, curative  approaches.\u201d In addition, in its December 2001 third annual report, the  Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism  Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (also known as the Gilmore  Commission) recommended that the Office of Homeland Security develop  and implement a comprehensive plan for research, development, test, and  evaluation to enhance cyber security."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
