These civilian R&D investments (investments not related to nuclear security) supported diverse science and energy research areas, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. The five program offices and ARPA-E also obligated funds for staff to oversee these R&D investments\u2014referred to as staff costs in this report\u2014and include federal staff salaries and benefits, travel, support services, and other costs.", "GAO was asked to review DOE's oversight of its civilian R&D investments. This report discusses (1) the activities selected DOE offices use to oversee investments in civilian R&D, and (2) staffing levels and costs associated with DOE oversight of civilian R&D.", "GAO obtained staffing and obligations data from the five DOE program offices and ARPA-E that funded civilian R&D for fiscal years 2011-2015, the most recent years for which data was available; examined DOE policies, plans, and guidance; and interviewed DOE officials. GAO selected three of the five program offices for detailed review because they oversee nearly 90 percent of DOE's civilian R&D investments and 12 of the 13 national laboratories that primarily conduct civilian R&D. GAO used a broad definition of oversight, including any activity that directly or indirectly supported DOE's R&D mission. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE generally agreed with GAO's findings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three Department of Energy (DOE) program offices that GAO selected for detailed review\u2014the offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Nuclear Energy, and Science\u2014use various activities to oversee civilian research and development (R&D) investments.", "Activities to identify research priorities . The program offices obtain input from multiple sources to help determine the areas in which DOE invests in research at its national laboratories, as well as in universities and industry. For example, the Office of Nuclear Energy sponsored workshops in 2015 that sought to identify ideas for advancing nuclear energy technologies.", "Activities to oversee investments at national laboratories . The program offices require that the laboratories they oversee develop strategic plans to help ensure DOE investments in these laboratories support national R&D priorities. They also monitor and review individual laboratory R&D projects. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the Office of Science oversaw over 1,600 new or ongoing laboratory projects that received $3.67 billion in obligations. Finally, the program offices annually assess each laboratory contractor's scientific, technological, managerial, and operational performance.", "Activities to oversee investments in universities, industry, and other entities . To help determine where DOE invests in civilian R&D, the program offices review R&D proposals from universities, industry, and other entities. According to data provided by DOE, in fiscal year 2015 the three program offices conducted or managed more than 5,600 proposal reviews\u2014with each review including as many as 3 to 4 individual reviewers\u2014and selected 1,490 proposals for new financial assistance awards. The program offices then monitored and periodically reviewed the awarded proposals.", "Staffing levels for oversight of civilian R&D decreased by 11.0 percent from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2015 in five DOE program offices\u2014those noted above, plus two others that oversee a smaller percentage of DOE's civilian R&D investments\u2014and in the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). At the same time, obligations for staff costs and civilian R&D investments increased by 2.4 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, without adjusting for inflation (obligations declined slightly when adjusted for inflation). Staffing levels and costs changed to varying degrees among the offices and ARPA-E. For example, staff costs increased in three of the offices and ARPA-E but decreased in the other two offices. Obligations for staff costs made up 7.6 percent of total obligations (R&D and non-R&D obligations) in fiscal year 2015; they also varied among program offices and ARPA-E, ranging from 3.6 percent to 21.4 percent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2015, the Department of Energy (DOE) obligated $7.36  billion for civilian research and development (R&D) in diverse science and  energy research areas, including fundamental scientific research on  energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy  technologies, fossil energy, energy security, and electricity infrastructure.  Of this $7.36 billion, $5.14 billion was obligated to 17 national laboratories  to conduct R&D and manage scientific facilities. DOE obligated the  remaining $2.22 billion in contracts, research grants and other forms of  financial assistance for R&D conducted by universities, industry, and  other entities, such as nonprofit organizations and state governments.", "To ensure appropriate management of R&D at laboratories, universities,  and industry, DOE employs federal staff who oversee its investments.  These staff provide strategic direction on research priorities; solicit,  review, and award research proposals; monitor and evaluate research  projects; work to ensure that DOE laboratories and their scientific facilities  are managed appropriately by the laboratory contractors; monitor the  construction of scientific facilities; and administer contracts for  laboratories and financial assistance for universities, industry, and other  entities.", "You asked us to review DOE\u2019s oversight of its civilian R&D investments.  This report identifies (1) the activities that selected DOE offices use to  oversee civilian R&D investments, and (2) the staffing levels and costs  associated with DOE oversight of civilian R&D investments.", "The scope of our review included the five DOE program offices within the  Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Energy that fund and  oversee civilian R&D, as well as the Advanced Research Projects  Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), a separate DOE agency that also funds and  oversees civilian R&D. The five program offices are:  the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability,  the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,  the Office of Fossil Energy,  the Office of Nuclear Energy, and  the Office of Science.", "For the purpose of identifying the oversight activities that these program  offices and ARPA-E use, and the associated staffing levels and costs, we  defined oversight broadly to include all activities that support the program  offices\u2019 R&D missions. These included direct oversight activities, such as  oversight of individual R&D projects, as well as activities that indirectly  support DOE\u2019s management of R&D, such as contract and financial  management and intellectual property legal counsel.", "To identify activities that DOE program offices and ARPA-E use to  oversee civilian R&D investments, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials from all five program offices and ARPA-E. In  particular, we reviewed broad planning documents, such as DOE\u2019s 2016  Science and Energy Plan, as well as documents specific to individual  program offices, such as Office of Science guidance for laboratory plans  and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\u2019s guidance for  funding university and industry projects. In addition, we selected three of  the program offices\u2014the offices of Science, Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, and Nuclear Energy\u2014for detailed review because  they represent diverse energy and science research programs as well as a range in the technological maturity of the R&D that the offices support.  These three program offices oversee 12 of the 13 national laboratories  that primarily support civilian R&D, and they provide financial assistance  to universities and industry. In fiscal year 2015, these three offices  oversaw R&D that accounted for $6.58 billion, or about 90 percent, of the  total $7.36 billion in obligations for civilian R&D from the five program  offices and ARPA-E. For the three program offices we selected for  detailed review, we reviewed relevant regulations, orders, guidance  documents, and budget documents covering fiscal year 2011 to fiscal  year 2015. We cannot generalize the results of our detailed review of  these three program offices to ARPA-E, the Office of Electricity Delivery  and Energy Reliability, or the Office of Fossil Energy because the latter  three offices make much smaller investments in R&D, have significantly  fewer staff, or have a different management structure. To gain additional  context about DOE oversight activities at the national laboratories, we  visited a nongeneralizable sample of 4 of the 14 DOE site offices  collocated with national laboratories\u2014specifically the Argonne and Fermi  site offices in Illinois; the Thomas Jefferson site office in Virginia; and the  Office of Science\u2019s Integrated Support Center, which is collocated with  the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. Additionally, we interviewed  DOE site office officials and the contractors that manage the selected  laboratories. In particular, we obtained information from the officials about  the site offices\u2019 role and primary responsibilities with respect to the  national laboratories, the practices the offices use to oversee contractors,  and the types of staff employed at the site offices. We selected the site  offices to obtain information representing a range in the sizes of  laboratories overseen by the offices. We also interviewed DOE officials or  otherwise obtained information from three site offices that we did not visit:  the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado; the Idaho  National Laboratory; and the National Energy Technology Laboratory,  which has locations in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.", "To identify the staffing levels and costs associated with DOE oversight of  civilian R&D investments, we developed a data collection instrument  (DCI)\u2014a structured set of data requests and related questions\u2014that we provided to the five program offices that oversee civilian R&D and to  ARPA-E. The DCI included data requests and questions for the research  offices within the five program offices and ARPA-E and for the 14 site  offices collocated with DOE national laboratories. Before distributing the  DCI, we met with officials from each program office and ARPA-E to  discuss the clarity of our questions and the availability of the data we  requested, and we modified the DCI based on officials\u2019 comments. In  requesting data from DOE, we defined oversight broadly to include any  DOE activities that support its R&D mission and that help ensure that  DOE\u2019s R&D investments are efficient, effective, and appropriately  managed. The DCI requested information for fiscal year 2011 to fiscal  year 2015 on staffing levels and obligations for staff costs, as well as  information on investments in R&D. We also requested more detailed  information for fiscal year 2015 because that was the most recent year  with complete data; this information included details about the types of  staff employed in the offices at the end of the fiscal year, and on  laboratory work and financial assistance awarded during the fiscal year.  We assessed the reliability of the data we obtained from the DCI by  checking for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and by  comparing the data with other sources of information, such as DOE  budget documents. We resolved data inconsistencies we found through  e-mail and phone communications with officials from the program offices  and ARPA-E. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  reporting on DOE staffing levels and costs.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to February  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

These offices have the goal of enhancing U.S.  security and economic growth through transformative scientific and  technological innovation, and through market solutions to overcome  science, energy, and environmental challenges that the United States  faces. These program offices and ARPA-E fund R&D that is conducted by  DOE national laboratories, universities, industry, nonprofit organizations,  state governments, and other federal laboratories. Each program office  and ARPA-E may fund R&D at any of the national laboratories. For  example, the Office of Science funds civilian R&D at all 17 of DOE\u2019s  national laboratories, including the national laboratories sponsored by the  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Similarly, national  laboratories may receive funding from any of the program offices and  ARPA-E, as well as from other governmental agencies and  nongovernmental entities.

The office oversees the National  Energy Technology Laboratory\u2014with locations in Oregon,  Pennsylvania, and West Virginia\u2014which is the only DOE national  laboratory operated by the government rather than a contractor.", "The Office of Nuclear Energy\u2019s primary mission is to advance nuclear  power as a resource capable of meeting the nation\u2019s energy,  environmental, and national security needs by resolving technical,  cost, safety, proliferation resistance, and security barriers. The office  oversees the Idaho National Laboratory.", "The Office of Science\u2019s mission is to deliver scientific discoveries and  major tools that transform our understanding of nature and advance  the energy, economic, and national security in the United States. This  office is the nation\u2019s single largest funding source for basic research in  the physical sciences, and supports research in energy sciences,  advanced scientific computing and other fields. The office oversees  10 of DOE\u2019s national laboratories.", "ARPA-E\u2019s mission is to sponsor high-potential, high-impact energy  technologies that are considered too early for private-sector  investment. ARPA-E does not oversee a national laboratory.", "Of the five program offices noted above, four consist of several types of  offices that manage and oversee DOE\u2019s R&D investments; these four are  the offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy,  Nuclear Energy, and Science. First, each of these program offices has a  headquarters office in the Washington, D.C. area that includes senior  leadership and that may include offices that provide support across the  program office, such as policy development and oversight, budget, public  relations and congressional outreach, and technical assistance programs  as well as other administrative and support units. According to DOE  officials, the extent to which staff functions are centralized in  headquarters offices varies across program offices. Second, the program  offices include research offices, generally collocated with headquarters  offices, that manage particular scientific areas and research portfolios and  provide strategic direction for these areas. For example, the Office of  Science includes six research offices that steward different scientific  areas. Third, the program offices have site offices\u2014collocated with each  national laboratory\u2014that manage the laboratory contracts, oversee  federal facilities at the laboratories and, in some cases, manage financial  assistance awards to universities and industry, as well as other  contracts.", "ARPA-E and the other program office\u2014the Office of Electricity Delivery  and Energy Reliability\u2014make smaller R&D investments, have  significantly fewer staff, and do not oversee a national laboratory. As a  result, they are organized differently from the other four program offices.  According to an ARPA-E official, all ARPA-E staff are located at a central  office, and research projects are organized around individual program  directors. In the case of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy  Reliability, the office has one suboffice that is dedicated to research and  development; other suboffices are dedicated to regulatory or coordination  functions.", "Figure 1 lists ARPA-E and the five program offices we reviewed, along  with research offices and site offices within those program offices.", "Figure 2 shows the locations of the 13 national laboratories that primarily  conduct civilian R&D under the oversight of the program offices we  reviewed.

The R&D funded by  DOE is carried out under the department\u2019s direction and is managed by  scientists, engineers, and others employed by the laboratory contractor.  The remaining national laboratory\u2014the National Energy Technology  Laboratory\u2014is operated by DOE. Therefore, the scientists and engineers  who conduct the R&D at this laboratory are primarily federal employees.", "In addition to M&O contracts that DOE enters into for the operation of the  national laboratories, DOE program offices and ARPA-E provide financial  assistance\u2014primarily grants and cooperative agreements\u2014to support  R&D at universities, industry, and other entities. Under the Federal  Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, an agency is to use a grant  agreement when the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a  thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose authorized by  law, and substantial involvement by the agency is not expected. For  grants, an agency\u2019s involvement is essentially administrative, and  includes standard federal stewardship responsibilities such as reviewing  performance to ensure that the objectives, terms, and conditions of the  grant are met.

The  activities these three offices used included activities to:  identify research priorities and help determine where to invest in R&D, help ensure that national laboratories conduct R&D in alignment with  DOE priorities and that M&O contractors manage the research and  federally owned properties at the laboratories safely and efficiently,  and help ensure that universities, industry, and other entities are meeting  research goals as defined in financial assistance agreements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Activities to Identify Research Priorities and Help Inform Investment Decisions", "paragraphs": ["For all investments, including those in DOE\u2019s national laboratories,  universities, industry, and other entities, the three selected program  offices engage in activities to obtain input from multiple sources to identify  research priorities and to help inform where DOE invests in R&D.", "To help identify specific research priorities, these three program offices  review objectives established in the DOE strategic plan and other DOE  documents, such as the Quadrennial Energy Review and the Quadrennial  Technology Review. These DOE documents are in turn influenced by  national policies such as the President\u2019s Climate Action Plan of 2013. For  example, one of the objectives of DOE\u2019s strategic plan is to advance  sustainable hydropower technologies in order to help double renewable  energy generation in the United States between 2012 and 2020, a goal of  the President\u2019s Climate Action Plan.", "Additionally, the program offices hold scientific and technical workshops  with the scientific community\u2014scientists and researchers in universities,  industry, and government\u2014to help identify priority research areas that, if  supported, could contribute to overcoming barriers to advancing particular  energy technologies. For example, the Office of Nuclear Energy  sponsored a series of workshops in 2015 that sought to identify ideas for  advancing nuclear energy technologies.", "Furthermore, the program offices have established federal advisory  committees that provide expert input on particular knowledge gaps or  infrastructure needs at the national laboratories. For example, in 2014 a  panel of the federal advisory committee for the High Energy Physics  research office issued a long-term plan for supporting particle physics,  including recommending upgrades at a number of accelerator facilities,  such as at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.", "DOE program offices also engage in other activities to help develop  research priorities, such as attending conferences, regularly reviewing  published literature, regularly meeting with national laboratory staff, and  engaging with interagency working groups. In addition, according to DOE  officials, new ideas often come from the scientific community in the form  of proposals submitted in response to solicitations from the program  offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Oversight Activities for R&D Investments in National Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DOE civilian R&D investments in national laboratories  ($5.14 billion in obligations in fiscal year 2015) align with DOE priorities,  and that M&O contractors manage research and federally owned  properties safely and efficiently, the offices of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, Nuclear Energy, and Science carry out three broad  types of activities for their respective national laboratories. We identified  these activities through reviews of DOE documents and interviews with  officials from DOE\u2019s program offices and site offices.", "First, the three program offices conduct planning activities to help ensure  that DOE investments in the laboratories support national R&D priorities.  For example, the program offices require that each M&O contractor that  operates a national laboratory develop a long-term strategic plan for its  laboratory. The DOE program offices and the relevant site office staff  review the plans and provide feedback to the laboratory contractor. These  plans can identify the laboratory\u2019s vision for the future, core capabilities,  major initiatives, and laboratory infrastructure needs, among other things.", "The three program offices conduct this process with their laboratories on  an annual basis. Complementary to this, program offices may also  develop their own strategic planning documents. For example, within the  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, research offices  develop strategic \u201croadmaps\u201d that establish a vision with broad and long- range goals to provide overall program direction. Some offices also  develop multi-year program plans, which are operational guides for how  research offices will manage their activities.", "Second, research offices and site offices conduct various oversight  activities of the new and ongoing R&D projects and scientific facilities that  DOE invests in at the national laboratories.", "As of the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the  offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Energy, Nuclear Energy, and Science  supported and oversaw 32 designated user  facilities that were primarily located at national  laboratories. A designated user facility is a  federally sponsored research facility available  for external use to advance science or  technology. These facilities are open to  researchers and scientists without regard to  nation of origin or institutional affiliation.  Potential users may be allocated time in the  facilities after a merit review of the proposed  work. Users of the facilities are not charged a  fee if they publish research results in open  literature; for proprietary work that is not  disclosed publicly, the user is charged full cost  recovery.   Each of these designated user facilities  represents a significant investment of federal  funds. For example, according to DOE  documents, the Advanced Photon Source, one  of four designated user facilities at the  Argonne National Laboratory in fiscal year  2015, was completed in 1995 at a cost of $812  million. Since then, DOE has funded more  than $100 million in upgrades. The facility  produces x-rays that allow scientists to  conduct research on the structure and function  of materials\u2014for example, to aid in the  development of new pharmaceuticals.", "Research offices solicit research proposals from national  laboratories. This proposal solicitation helps the offices determine  where to invest DOE funds. The national laboratories submit work  proposals for new and ongoing projects, and research office staff  review these proposals and hold merit reviews\u2014often with outside  experts\u2014 to help determine which laboratory projects to invest in.  According to information provided by the Office of Science, research  offices conduct in-depth merit reviews for new laboratory work  proposals, and most research offices review about one-third of  ongoing laboratory projects each fiscal year; these reviews generally  consist of three or more individual peer reviewers. For example,  according to the Basic Energy Sciences research office, which is one  of the Office of Science\u2019s six research offices, in fiscal year 2015  research office staff reviewed approximately 132 of 395 ongoing  laboratory projects, in addition to 64 new work proposals.", "Research office staff monitor project performance. These staff  conduct this monitoring through other periodic reviews, site visits, and  regular meetings or phone calls with laboratory management and  project staff, according to DOE officials. DOE officials told us that a  significant portion of research office activities involved overseeing the  large number of ongoing projects at the national laboratories. For  example, according to information provided by the Office of Science,  in fiscal year 2015, its research office staff oversaw more than 1,600  new or ongoing projects that received $3.67 billion in obligations that  fiscal year. Project size, risk, technological maturity, and other factors  can influence how often research office staff review these laboratory  projects or meet with project staff. For example, according to officials  in the Office of Nuclear Energy, contractors must submit quarterly  project reports, and the office holds formal monthly reviews in which  laboratory projects are evaluated against performance metrics.  Likewise, for Office of Science construction projects, research offices  collaborate with site office staff and review projects to ensure they  meet their technical, cost, scope and schedule milestones, according  to DOE officials.", "Site offices ensure that laboratory M&O contractors meet  contract requirements. For example, one such requirement is that  the contractor have a contractor assurance system to oversee its  performance and to self-identify and correct potential problems.  Each M&O contractor must establish a contractor assurance system  that includes management systems and processes to generate the  information needed to manage and improve the contractors own  performance. Site office staff are responsible for reviewing,  monitoring, and assessing the effectiveness of the system to ensure it  is working and meets contract requirements. A contractor assurance  system also allows site office staff to monitor the contractors own  internal assessments and reviews, thereby reducing the number of  reviews that the site office otherwise might conduct. For example,  Argonne site office officials told us that the Argonne National  Laboratory M&O contractor self-identified and corrected a radiation  inventory problem at a laboratory building and kept site office staff  informed of laboratory actions.", "Site office staff conduct independent and joint reviews. These  staff conduct their own independent reviews, as well as joint reviews  with contractor staff, of laboratory facilities to ensure federal  properties are being managed safely and efficiently. For example,  according to information provided by the Golden Field Office, in fiscal  year 2015, site office staff conducted 366 safety and health reviews at  the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Examples of these  reviews include construction project safety inspections; laboratory  inspections, readiness verifications, compliance visits, and risk  assessments of the laboratory safety and health programs; and  assessment of lab performance. Site office staff also conducted  hundreds of other reviews in areas such as environmental oversight,  physical and cyber-security, and financial oversight.", "Site offices are responsible for administering the M&O contracts.", "This responsibility includes taking actions such as modifying the  contract to add funding for laboratory work or to incorporate new  applicable directives from DOE and the Office of Management and  Budget. According to site office staff we interviewed, the incorporation  of new directives into an M&O contract is an ongoing effort that  requires coordination with the contractor and often negotiation about  the terms added to the contract. For example, according to officials at  one site office, to address a new DOE order that called for particular  safety management procedures at DOE facilities, officials tailored  the contract so that the new contract language would apply to only the  scientific user facility with the highest risk at the laboratory\u2014this  action reduced the number of safety management procedures  required of the contractor while complying with the new order.", "Site offices must have specific staff to oversee construction and  upgrades. These staff\u2014referred to as federal project directors\u2014 oversee the construction of any new scientific facilities or upgrades to  existing facilities. These federal project directors also may be  assigned from a site office or from the Office of Science\u2019s Integrated  Support Center to a project site other than a national laboratory. For  example, according to DOE officials, a federal project director at the  Integrated Support Center is responsible for overseeing construction  of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University, a  $730 million project.", "Site offices may conduct other activities to provide centralized  support to other site offices and the larger program office. Areas  of support include intellectual property and other legal services,  procurement, human resources, information technology, and safety  and security. Within the Office of Science, many of these activities are  provided by the Integrated Support Center. The Idaho Operations  Office and the Golden Field Office provide many of these services to  the Office of Nuclear Energy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, respectively.", "Third, at the end of each fiscal year, program offices use a performance  evaluation and measurement plan to assess each laboratory contractor\u2019s  scientific, technological, managerial, and operational performance. The  plan is developed collaboratively by the responsible program office,  including the site office, and the laboratory M&O contractor before each  fiscal year, and it helps form the basis for the evaluation of the laboratory  contractor at the end of the year. Research office staff are responsible  for evaluating laboratory mission-related areas of the plan, including the  contractor\u2019s ability to deliver science and technology to meet DOE  missions. Site office staff evaluate the contractor\u2019s operations at the  laboratory, including the use of the contractor assurance system,  according to DOE documents and officials. Results from this performance  evaluation inform the contractor\u2019s award fee determination as well as the  possibility of earning additional years on the contract through an award  term extension."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Oversight Activities for R&D Investments in Universities, Industry, and Other Entities", "paragraphs": ["The offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Nuclear Energy,  and Science use various processes to help oversee DOE\u2019s civilian R&D  investments in universities, industry, and other entities ($2.22 billion in  obligations in fiscal year 2015). Research office staff in these three  program offices develop solicitations\u2014also referred to as funding  opportunity announcements\u2014for R&D proposals from universities,  industry, and other entities. They then conduct or manage merit reviews  of submitted proposals, an activity that generally includes independent  reviews from technical, subject matter experts. Research office staff  identify and recruit teams of experts for these merit reviews. According to  DOE officials, program managers take these expert reviews into  consideration, along with factors such as portfolio balance and available  funds, before making funding recommendations to DOE leadership.  According to data provided by DOE, research office staff in the five  program offices and ARPA-E conducted or managed more than 6,600  proposal reviews\u2014with reviews consisting of as many as 3 or 4 individual  reviewers\u2014to select 1,691 new financial assistance awards in fiscal year  2015.", "In addition to overseeing new proposals from universities and industry,  research office staff oversee thousands of projects that were awarded in  previous years, also known as continuing awards. As shown in table 1  below, in fiscal year 2015, DOE research offices oversaw 4,921  continuing awards (projects).", "Research offices may oversee projects differently, depending on factors  such as the maturity of the science or technology, the size and complexity  of the work, the size and makeup of the awardees (single institution vs.  multi-institution), and the risk of the project, according to DOE officials.  Research office staff tailor the level of oversight to the size, scope, and  complexity of the project to ensure awardees are meeting research goals  as defined in the proposal award agreement. Office of Science officials  told us they generally receive annual reports from awardees and have  annual project reviews for small financial assistance awards. These  officials told us that for larger and more complex grants and cooperative  agreements, there may be significantly more oversight, such as through a  greater frequency of meetings and progress reports. The Office of Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Nuclear Energy,  which primarily invest in applied research and development projects,  typically use cooperative agreements instead of grants, as cooperative  agreements allow substantial federal involvement in the projects to help  ensure that projects meet specific program office technology goals. These  program offices may use a range of oversight activities to help ensure  projects succeed.

Specifically, the Golden Field Office in the Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, the Idaho Operations Office in the Office of Nuclear  Energy, and the Integrated Support Center in the Office of Science  administer awards through activities such as preparing solicitations,  negotiating award terms with recipient institutions, and closing out  awards, among other things. According to information provided by  these program offices, in fiscal year 2015, the offices managed $1.82  billion in obligations for thousands of new and continuing financial  assistance awards. DOE officials indicated that financial assistance  awards that did not receive obligations also required support.

Other offices attributed  changes in staffing to causes such as budgetary pressures and voluntary  separation programs. One site office we visited reported that as  employees left or retired, the office did not fill open billets; instead, the  office spread the responsibilities among remaining staff. Office  reorganizations also contributed to staffing declines.

These  factors include:", "The extent to which an office uses cooperative agreements  instead of grants. As discussed above, cooperative agreements are  to be used when an agency anticipates that substantial federal  involvement in performance or project activities may be necessary.  DOE officials said that cooperative agreements may incur higher staff  costs than grants because of this increased involvement. According to  DOE officials, program offices that invested primarily in applied R&D  typically used cooperative agreements.", "The extent to which an office supports non-R&D activities.", "Obligations for non-R&D activities, such as regulatory support, come  out of staff costs and may have limited or no corresponding R&D  obligations, thus increasing staff costs\u2019 share of the total.
