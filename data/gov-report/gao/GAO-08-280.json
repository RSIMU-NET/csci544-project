For example, SEC has documented authorizations for software modifications, developed a comprehensive program for monitoring access activities to its computer network environment, and tested and evaluated the effectiveness of controls for the general ledger system. In addition, the commission has made progress in improving its information security program. To illustrate, it has developed remedial action plans to mitigate identified weaknesses in its systems and developed a mechanism to track the progress of actions to correct deficiencies. A key reason for its progress is that SEC senior management has been actively engaged in implementing information security activities. Nevertheless, SEC has not completed actions to correct 12 previously reported weaknesses. For example, SEC workstations are susceptible to malicious code attacks and perimeter security is not properly implemented at its Operations Center. Significant control weaknesses intended to restrict access to data and systems, as well as other information security controls, continue to threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SEC's financial and sensitive information and information systems. SEC has not consistently implemented effective controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized access to computing resources. For example, it did not always (1) consistently enforce strong controls for identifying and authenticating users, (2) limit user access to only those individuals who need such access to perform their job functions, (3) encrypt sensitive data, (4) log and monitor security related events, (5) physically protect its computer resources, and (6) fully implement certain configuration management controls. A key reason for these weaknesses is that SEC has not yet fully implemented its information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively. Specifically, SEC has not effectively or fully implemented key program activities. For example, security plans for certain enterprise database applications were incomplete, information security training for certain key personnel was not sufficiently documented and monitored, security tests and evaluations of enterprise database applications were not comprehensive, and continuity of operations plans were not always complete.

For example, the Federal  Bureau of Investigation has identified multiple sources of cyber threats,  including foreign nation states engaged in information warfare, domestic  criminals, hackers, and virus writers, and disgruntled employees working  within an organization. Similarly, the U.S. Secret Service and the  Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) Coordination Center  conducted a study on insider threats and stated in a May 2005 report that  \u201cinsiders pose a substantial threat by virtue of their knowledge of, and  access to, employer systems and/or databases.\u201d These concerns are  well-founded for a number of reasons, including the dramatic increase in  reports of security incidents, the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools,  and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. For example, for fiscal year 2006, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) cited a total of 5,146 incidents reported by federal  agencies to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT), an increase of 44 percent from the previous fiscal year.

Accordingly, we have designated information security as a  governmentwide high-risk area since 1997, a designation that remains in  force today. Recognizing the importance of securing federal agencies\u2019  information systems, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) in December 2002 to strengthen the security of  information and systems within federal agencies.

This review was performed to support our opinion  developed during the audit of SEC\u2019s internal controls over the preparation  of financial statements.", "To determine the status of SEC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previously  reported information security weaknesses, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, practices, and guidance. We  reviewed prior GAO reports to identify previously reported weaknesses  and examined SEC\u2019s corrective action plans to determine which  weaknesses were corrected, as SEC had reported. For those instances  where SEC reported it had completed corrective actions, we assessed the  effectiveness of those actions.", "To determine whether controls over key financial systems were effective,  we tested the effectiveness of information security controls. We  concentrated our evaluation primarily on the controls for financial  applications, enterprise database applications, and network  infrastructure\u2014Momentum; CATS/Phoenix; Electronic Data Gathering,  Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR); the Strategic Acquisition Manager; and  the general support system (GSS) network\u2014that directly or indirectly  support the processing of material transactions reflected in the agency\u2019s  financial statements.
