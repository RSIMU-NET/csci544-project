By congressional mandate, plans for expenditure of appropriated funds on this system, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), must meet certain conditions, including GAO review. This study addresses whether the fiscal year 2006 plan satisfies these conditions; it also describes the status of DHS's efforts to implement prior GAO recommendations for improving ACE management, and provides observations about the plan and DHS's management of the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2006 ACE expenditure plan, including related program documentation and program officials' statements, either satisfied or partially satisfied the legislative conditions imposed by the Congress; however, more can be done to better address several aspects of these conditions. In addition, DHS has addressed some recommendations that GAO has previously made, but progress has been slow in addressing several recommendations aimed at strengthening ACE management. For example, DHS has more to do to implement the recommendation that it establish an ACE accountability framework that, among other things, ensures that expenditure plans report progress against commitments made in prior plans. Implementing a performance and accountability framework is important for ensuring that promised capabilities and benefits are delivered on time and within budget. In addition, describing progress against past commitments is essential to permit meaningful congressional oversight. Among GAO's observations about the ACE program and its management are several related to the need to effectively set and use performance goals and measures. Although the program set performance goals, these targets were not always realistic. For example, in fiscal year 2005, the program set a target that 11 percent of all Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees would use ACE. However, this target does not reflect the fact that many CBP employees will never need to use the system. Additionally, the program has established 6 program goals, 11 business results, 23 benefits, and 17 performance measures, but the relationships among these are not fully defined or adequately aligned with each other. For example, not every goal has defined benefits, and not every benefit has an associated performance measure. Without realistic ACE performance measures and targets that are aligned with the overall program goals and desired results, DHS will be challenged in its efforts to establish an accountability framework for ACE that will help to ensure that the program delivers its expected benefits. In addition, DHS plans to develop several increments, referred to as \"releases,\" concurrently; in the past, such concurrency has led to cost overruns and schedule delays because releases contended for the same resources, and resources that were to be used on later releases were diverted to earlier ones. However, because of DHS's belief that such concurrent development will allow it to deliver ACE functionality sooner, it is reintroducing the same problems that resulted in past shortfalls."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In February 2006, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), submitted to the Congress its  fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan for the Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) program. ACE is to be CBP\u2019s new import and export  processing system. The program\u2019s goals include    supporting border security by enhancing analysis and information sharing  with other government agencies and   streamlining time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks for CBP personnel  and the trade community through the provision of a single Web-based  interface.", "DHS currently plans to acquire and deploy ACE in 11 increments, referred  to as \u201creleases,\u201d in approximately 8.5 years.

For example:    One legislative condition states that the plan should meet OMB\u2019s capital  planning and investment control review requirements, which include  addressing security and privacy issues. However, a privacy impact  assessment for ACE has been in draft for several months and is not yet  approved. Another capital planning and investment control review  requirement is that performance goals and measures be provided in the  business case for ACE. Although CBP describes selected performance  goals and measures, the goals (i.e., targets) are not always realistic (we  provide further discussion of this issue later in this report).", "According to another legislative condition, the expenditure plan must  comply with DHS\u2019s enterprise architecture. However, DHS does not have a  documented methodology for evaluating programs for compliance with its  enterprise architecture, other than relying on the professional expertise of  its staff.", "According to a third legislative condition, the DHS Chief Information  Officer is to certify that an independent verification and validation (IV&V)  agent is under contract.

CBP has taken steps such as (1) hiring a contractor to  develop cost estimates (including contract task order cost estimates) that  are independent of CBP\u2019s estimates, and (2) tasking a support contractor  with evaluating both the independent and CBP estimates against the  criteria defined by SEI. According to the results of the support  contractor\u2019s evaluation, the independent estimates satisfied the SEI  criteria; CBP\u2019s estimates largely satisfied the criteria.", "However, according to the support contractor, CBP\u2019s cost estimating had  limitations. First, the CBP estimate did not adequately consider past  projects in its cost and schedule estimates. In addition, the CBP estimate  was an aggregation of estimates developed separately for three ACE  components, each according to a different cost estimating methodology;  the support contractor advised against this approach, recommending that  component estimates be based on the same methodology.", "Immediately develop and implement a human capital management strategy  that provides both near- and long-term solutions to program office human  capital capacity limitations, and report quarterly to the Appropriations  Committees on the progress of efforts to do so.", "In progress. CBP has expanded its contractor and government workforce  dedicated to the ACE program by merging staff assigned to trade-related  legacy systems with the ACE program staff.

The expenditure plan describes steps both planned and under  way to ensure that ACE infrastructure supports both ACE and other  homeland security applications. For example, it states that both ACE and  the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US- VISIT) program should conform to the DHS enterprise architecture, which  is to define standard shared services that the two systems can request.  Such a services oriented architecture is intended to promote reuse, as well  as reducing overlap and duplication.", "Define measures, and collect and use associated metrics, for determining  whether prior and future program management improvements are  successful.", "In progress. CBP continues to make changes that are intended to improve  overall program management, but it has not consistently defined measures  to determine whether the changes are successful. For example, CBP has  reorganized its Office of Information Technology; this reorganization is  intended to improve program management by providing (1) enhanced  government oversight of ACE development, (2) better definition of  requirements for future ACE releases, and (3) faster and cheaper delivery  of ACE capabilities. However, program officials told us that they have not  established measures or targets for determining whether the  reorganization is providing these benefits.", "Define and implement an ACE accountability framework that fulfills  1.  The framework should cover all program commitment areas, including  key expected or estimated system (a) capabilities, use, and quality;  (b) benefits and mission value; (c) costs; and (d) milestones and  schedules.", "In progress. CBP has prepared an initial version of an accountability  framework that it intends to improve as it proceeds. The framework is  built around measuring progress against costs, milestones, schedules,  and risks for select releases; however, the benefit measurement has  not been well defined, and the performance targets are not always  realistic.  2.  The framework should ensure currency, relevance, and completeness  of all program commitments made to the Congress in expenditure  plans.", "In progress. The fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan includes inaccurate,  dated, and incomplete information and omits other relevant  information. For example, the plan did not include information  regarding CBP\u2019s decision to eliminate the dependencies among the  screening and targeting releases and the cargo releases, and to take  advantage of the capabilities of its existing Automated Targeting  System.3.  The framework should ensure reliable data that are relevant to  measuring progress against commitments.", "In progress. The data that CBP uses to measure progress against  commitments are not consistently reliable. For example, data in the  defect tracking system show that defects in Release 4 (which is now  operational) have not been closed; however, program officials told us  that many of these defects have been resolved.  4.  The framework should ensure that future expenditure plans report  progress against commitments contained in prior expenditure plans.", "In progress. The current expenditure plan does not adequately  describe progress against commitments made in previous plans. For  example, the plan provides a summary of the funding requested in  each of the previous six expenditure plans, but it does not provide  information on whether these funding amounts were actually  expended or obligated as planned.  5.  The framework should ensure that criteria for exiting key readiness  milestones adequately consider indicators of system maturity, such as  the severity of open defects.", "In progress. ACE milestone exit criteria provide for addressing the risk  associated with severe defects that are unresolved. Using these  criteria, CBP passed several release milestones with severe defects  still open. However, CBP officials were unable to provide us with any  documentation on how they assessed the inherent risks of passing  these milestones with open severe defects.  6.  The framework should ensure clear and unambiguous delineation of  the respective roles and responsibilities of the government and the  prime contractor.", "Complete.

This pattern  has continued with the most recently deployed cargo release, which  developed problems that caused delays with a subsequent screening and  targeting release. CBP took steps to mitigate this problem by eliminating  the dependencies between the cargo releases and the screening and  targeting releases.", "However, CBP\u2019s planned schedule for developing additional releases  includes a significant level of concurrence, because of CBP\u2019s interest in  delivering ACE functionality sooner. Such concurrence between ACE  release activities has led to cost overruns and schedule delays in the past.  Thus, the revised ACE plans and actions are potentially reintroducing the  same problems that produced past shortfalls.", "We made several specific observations related to these weaknesses,  including the following:    On two recent releases, key milestones were passed despite unresolved  severe defects. Officials told us that the risk of proceeding did not  outweigh the need to get the releases to users, and thereby gaining user  acceptance and feedback. However, the risks were not documented  and formally managed.", "Concurrence in developing early ACE releases caused schedule slips  and cost overruns. Despite these experiences, CBP has established a  risky plan that involves considerable overlap across the development  schedules for three future releases.", "Although the use of earned value management (EVM) is an OMB  requirement, it was not being used to manage the development of two  recent releases. For example, CBP discontinued use of EVM on one  release because this method was not familiar to staff who were  transferred to work on the program.", "ACE operations: Operational performance has been mixed, and mission  impact is unclear.", "ACE releases one through four are in operation. To date, these releases\u2019  operational performance has been uneven. For example, ACE has largely  been meeting its goals for being available and responsive in processing  virtually all daily transactions, and has decreased truck processing times  at some ports. However, ACE is not being used by as many CBP and trade  personnel as was expected, and truck processing times at other ports have  increased. Moreover, overall user satisfaction has been low.", "In addition, ACE goals, expected mission benefits, and performance  measures are not fully defined and adequately aligned with each other. For  example, not every goal has defined benefits, every benefit is defined only  in terms of efficiency gains, not every benefit has an associated business  result, and not every benefit and business result has associated  performance measures.", "Further, where performance measures have been defined, the associated  targets are not always realistic. For example, the performance target in  fiscal year 2005 for ACE usage was that 11 percent of all CBP employees  would use ACE. However, that many CBP employees will never need to  use the system. This performance target does not reflect that.", "Because performance measures are not always realistic or aligned with  program goals and benefits, it is unclear whether ACE has realized\u2014or  will realize\u2014the mission value that it was intended to bring to CBP\u2019s and  other agencies\u2019 trade- and border security-related operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The legislative conditions that the Congress placed on the use of fiscal  year 2006 ACE appropriated funds have been either partially or fully  satisfied by the latest expenditure plan and related program  documentation and activities. Nevertheless, more can be done to better  address several aspects of these conditions, such as ensuring that the  program\u2019s privacy impact assessment is approved, measuring ACE  performance and results, ensuring architectural alignment, and employing  effective IV&V practices. Given that the legislative conditions are  collectively intended to promote accountability and increase the chances  of program success, it is important that each receives DHS\u2019s full attention.", "Also important to ACE\u2019s success is the swift and complete implementation  of the recommendations that we have previously made to complement the  legislative conditions and improve program management, performance,  and accountability. In this regard, some recommendations have been  addressed, while progress has been slow on others, such as    accurately reporting to the Appropriations Committees on CBP\u2019s progress  in implementing our prior recommendations;   developing and implementing a strategic approach to meeting the  program\u2019s human capital needs;    using criteria for exiting key milestones that adequately consider  indicators of system maturity, such as severity of open defects and the  associated risks; and   developing and implementing a performance and accountability  framework for ensuring that promised capabilities and benefits are  delivered on time and within budget.", "To its credit, CBP has taken several steps to stem the pattern of cost,  schedule, and performance shortfalls that it experienced on early ACE  releases. However, future releases are unlikely to realize the impact of  these steps because revised ACE plans and actions are reintroducing the  same pattern that led to early release shortfalls. This pattern includes not  formally and transparently considering, and proactively addressing, the  risks associated with passing key release milestones with known severe  defects; building considerable overlap and concurrence in the  development schedules of releases that will contend for the same  resources; and not performing EVM on all releases. If this pattern  continues, the prospects for a successful program will be diminished.", "Although availability and responsiveness targets are largely being met and  long-standing help desk limitations are being addressed, the prospects for  a successful program nevertheless remain unclear. The true measure of  ACE\u2019s success is arguably the mission value that it brings to CBP\u2019s and  other agencies\u2019 trade- and border security-related operations and users.  Such value depends both on the operational performance of ACE and on  CBP\u2019s ability to demonstrate that this performance is achieving program  goals, delivering expected benefits, and producing desired business  results. At this juncture, however, neither the system\u2019s performance nor its  value is clear because of several factors: the operational performance of  deployed releases has been mixed; users\u2019 satisfaction has been low; the  relationships among goals, benefits, and desired business outcomes are  not evident; and the range of measures needed to create a complete and  realistic picture of ACE\u2019s performance is missing.", "In summary, a number of ACE activities have been and are being done  well; these have contributed to the program\u2019s progress to date and will go  a long way in determining the program\u2019s ultimate success.
