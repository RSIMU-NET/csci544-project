The Project BioShield Act of 2004 authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to procure countermeasures for a Strategic National Stockpile. However, in December 2006, HHS terminated the contract for a recombinant protective antigen (rPA) anthrax vaccine because VaxGen failed to meet a critical contractual milestone. Also, supplies of the licensed BioThrax anthrax vaccine already in the stockpile will start expiring in 2008. GAO was asked to identify (1) factors contributing to the failure of the rPA vaccine contract and (2) issues associated with using the BioThrax in the stockpile. GAO interviewed agency and industry officials, reviewed documents, and consulted with biodefense experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three major factors contributed to the failure of the first Project BioShield procurement effort for an rPA anthrax vaccine. First, HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) awarded the procurement contract to VaxGen, a small biotechnology firm, while VaxGen was still in the early stages of developing a vaccine and had not addressed many critical manufacturing issues. This award preempted critical development work on the vaccine. Also, the contract required VaxGen to deliver 25 million doses of the vaccine in 2 years, which would have been unrealistic even for a larger manufacturer. Second, VaxGen took unrealistic risks in accepting the contract terms. VaxGen officials told GAO that they accepted the contract despite significant risks due to (1) the aggressive delivery time line for the vaccine, (2) VaxGen's lack of in-house technical expertise--a condition exacerbated by the attrition of key company staff as the contract progressed--and (3) VaxGen's limited options for securing any additional funding needed. Third, important Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements regarding the type of data and testing required for the rPA anthrax vaccine to be eligible for use in an emergency were not known at the outset of the procurement contract. In addition, ASPR's anticipated use of the rPA anthrax vaccine was not articulated to all parties clearly enough and evolved over time. Finally, according to VaxGen, the purchase of BioThrax for the stockpile as a stopgap measure raised the bar for the VaxGen vaccine. All these factors created confusion over the acceptance criteria for VaxGen's product and significantly diminished VaxGen's ability to meet contract time lines. ASPR has announced its intention to issue another request for proposal for an rPA anthrax vaccine procurement but, along with other HHS components, has not analyzed lessons learned from the first contract's failure and may repeat earlier mistakes. According to industry experts, the lack of specific requirements is a cause of concern to the biotechnology companies that have invested significant resources in trying to meet government needs and now question whether the government can clearly define future procurement contract requirements. GAO identified two issues related with the use of the BioThrax in the Strategic National Stockpile. First, ASPR lacks an effective strategy to minimize the waste of BioThrax. Starting in 2008, several lots of BioThrax in the Strategic National Stockpile will begin to expire. As a result, over $100 million per year could be lost for the life of the vaccine currently in the stockpile. ASPR could minimize such potential waste by developing a single inventory system with Department of Defense (DOD)--a high-volume user of BioThrax--with rotation based on a first-in, first-out principle. DOD and ASPR officials identified a number of obstacles to this type of rotation which may require legislative action. Second, ASPR planned to use three lots of expired BioThrax vaccine in the stockpile in the event of an emergency. This would violate FDA rules, which prohibit using an expired vaccine, and could also undermine public confidence because the vaccine's potency could not be guaranteed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The anthrax attacks in September and October 2001 highlighted major  gaps in our civilian preparedness to respond to health emergencies that  threaten national security. These incidents also led the Congress and the  federal government to focus attention on the importance of developing  new drugs, vaccines, and therapeutics to protect U.S. citizens.", "In 2002, in response to the anthrax attacks, the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within the National Institutes of  Health (NIH) launched an effort to rapidly develop a second generation  recombinant protective antigen (rPA) anthrax vaccine. While there is  already a licensed anthrax vaccine (BioThrax), it is given in six doses over  18 months followed by an annual booster. NIAID wanted to have a vaccine  that could be administered in an immunization series of not more than  three doses.", "In the late 1980s, Department of Defense (DOD) research identified an rPA  anthrax vaccine, created with a process that (1) is fully defined, quantified,  and controlled in terms of protective antigens; (2) showed development  potential; and (3) required fewer doses. DOD researchers developed a fully  defined manufacturing process to produce highly purified rPA. The  researchers found that they could protect animals using this rPA with  fewer doses than the existing licensed vaccine. In 2002, the Institute of  Medicine (IOM) stated that although AVA\u2014Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed,  now called BioThrax\u2014is safe and effective for use, \u201cit is far from  optimal.\u201d The IOM supported the development of a new anthrax vaccine.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), when  an rPA vaccine is fully developed, it will address the shortcomings of the  AVA vaccine identified in the IOM report.", "In 2002 and 2003, NIAID awarded development contracts for rPA vaccines  to two companies\u2014VaxGen and Avecia. VaxGen was a small U.S.  biotechnology company. According to NIAID, one of the objectives was to  demonstrate how manufacturing efforts might be increased to support  creation of a national stockpile of medical countermeasures.", "The Project BioShield Act of 2004 formalized this initiative and authorized  the Secretary of HHS, who in turn entrusted the Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) with responsibility for  acquiring and ensuring the management of and accounting for a Strategic  National Stockpile of medical countermeasures. It is designed to  supplement and resupply state and local public health agencies in the  event of a national emergency anywhere and anytime within the United  States or its territories. Among other medical countermeasures, this  stockpile contained, as of June 2007, about 10 million doses of BioThrax,  the licensed anthrax vaccine. Since doses of BioThrax, like other  vaccines, have an expiration date, these doses will be disposed of if they  are not used before their expiration date.", "The only other large user of BioThrax vaccine is DOD, which has procured  its own inventory of the vaccine. DOD has a mandatory Anthrax Vaccine  Immunization Program (AVIP) for military personnel, emergency-essential  DOD civilians, and contractors, based on defined geographic areas or  roles. The policy also allows personnel previously immunized against  anthrax, who are no longer deployed to high-threat areas, to receive  follow-up vaccine doses and booster shots on a voluntary basis.", "In November 2004, ASPR awarded VaxGen a procurement contract for  $877.5 million for the manufacture and delivery of 75 million doses of its  rPA anthrax vaccine to the Strategic National Stockpile. Two years later,  in December 2006, ASPR terminated VaxGen\u2019s contract for failure to meet  a critical contractual milestone.  The failure of this procurement effort  raised larger questions regarding the country\u2019s ability to develop a new  anthrax vaccine and a robust and sustainable biodefense medical  countermeasure industry by building a partnership between  pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms and the government. The biotech  industry has raised concerns whether the government can clearly define  its requirements for future procurement contracts.", "In our May 2006 testimony, we concluded that ASPR\u2019s procurement  strategy for rPA anthrax vaccine had been very aggressive. We stated that  \u201cit is important to understand the unique issues at stake in this early phase  of implementation of the biodefense strategy. The rest of the  biotechnology sector will be watching to see whether the industry and the  U.S. government can make this partnership work. Issues with this contract  might have an effect beyond just this individual vaccine procurement.  They could have an impact on how the biotechnology industry responds to  government overtures in the future for the development and procurement  of medical countermeasures for the many biothreat agents still to be  addressed.\u201d", "To assist in ongoing efforts to address these concerns, you asked that we  identify (1) factors that contributed to the failure of ASPR\u2019s first Project  BioShield procurement effort with VaxGen for an rPA anthrax vaccine and  (2) issues associated with using the licensed anthrax vaccine, BioThrax, in  the Strategic National Stockpile."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine what factors contributed to the failure of ASPR\u2019s  procurement effort with VaxGen, we interviewed officials from HHS\u2019s  components\u2014ASPR, NIAID, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The act also authorizes HHS to procure these  countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile.", "Project BioShield is a procurement program that allows the government to  enter into contracts to procure countermeasures while they still are in  development, up to 8 years before product licensure is expected. Under  this program, the government agrees to buy a certain quantity of  successfully developed countermeasures for the Strategic National  Stockpile at a specified price once the countermeasure meets specific  requirements. The government pays the agreed-upon amount only after  these requirements are met and the product is delivered to the Strategic  National Stockpile.

Citing the urgency involved, ASPR awarded the procurement  contract to VaxGen several years before the planned completion of earlier  and uncompleted NIAID development contracts with VaxGen and thus  preempted critical development work.  (For a time line of events for the  first rPA anthrax vaccine development and procurement effort, see  appendix I).", "In response to the anthrax attacks of 2001, NIAID was assigned  responsibility for developing candidate vaccines leading up to licensure,  purchase, and storage in the stockpile. NIAID envisioned a strategy of  minimizing risk by awarding contracts to multiple companies to help  ensure that at least one development effort would be successful. NIAID\u2019s  strategy was appropriate since failure is not uncommon in vaccine  development. Toward this end, NIAID designed a sequence of two  contracts\u2014one to follow the other\u2014to advance pilot lots of rPA anthrax  vaccine through early characterization work, phase 1 and phase 2 clinical  trials, accelerated and real-time (long-term) stability testing, and tasks to  evaluate the contractor\u2019s ability to manufacture the vaccine in large  quantities according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  Additionally, these contracts were cost reimbursable, an appropriate  contracting mechanism when uncertainties involved in contract  performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy  to use a fixed-price contract.

They  were, however, optimistic the procurement contract would be successful.  One official described its chances of success at 80 percent to 90 percent.  However, a key official at VaxGen told us at the same time that VaxGen  estimated the chances of success at 10 percent to 15 percent. ASPR now  estimates that prior to award, the rPA vaccine was at a TRL rating of 8.

However, November 2004 was 3 years after the anthrax attacks in 2001,  and while the sense of urgency was still important, it could have been  tempered with realistic expectations. According to industry experts,  preempting the development contract 2 years before completing work\u2014 almost half its scheduled milestones\u2014was questionable, especially for  vaccine development work, which is known to be susceptible to technical  issues even in late stages of development. NIAID officials also told us that,  in their opinions, it was too early for a BioShield purchase. At a minimum,  the time extensions for NIAID\u2019s first development contract with VaxGen to  accommodate stability testing should have indicated to ASPR that  development on its candidate vaccine was far from complete.", "After ASPR awarded VaxGen the procurement contract, NIAID canceled  several milestones under its development contract with VaxGen to free up  funds for earlier milestones that VaxGen was having trouble meeting.

VaxGen officials told us  that at the time of the procurement award they knew the probability of  success was very low, but they were counting on ASPR\u2019s willingness to be  flexible with the contract time line and work with them to achieve  success. In fact, in May 2006, ASPR did extend the contract deadlines to  initiate delivery to the stockpile an additional 2 years. However, on  November 3, 2006, FDA imposed a clinical hold on VaxGen\u2019s forthcoming  phase 2 trial after determining that data submitted by VaxGen were  insufficient to ensure that the product would be stable enough to resume  clinical testing. By that time, ASPR had lost faith in VaxGen\u2019s technical  ability to solve its stability problems in any reasonable time frame. When  VaxGen failed to meet a critical performance milestone of initiating the  next clinical trial, ASPR terminated the contract.", "According to VaxGen\u2019s officials, throughout the two development  contracts and the Project BioShield procurement contract, VaxGen\u2019s staff  peaked at only 120, and the company was consistently unable to marshal  sufficient technical expertise. While it is not known how a larger  pharmaceutical company might have fared under similar time constraints,  we believe more established pharmaceutical companies have staff and  resources better able to handle the inevitable problems that arise in  vaccine development and licensure efforts. For example, according to  industry experts, a large firm might be able to leverage an entire internal  department to reformulate a vaccine or pursue solutions to a stability  issue, while a smaller biotechnology company like VaxGen would likely be  unable to use more than a few full-time scientists. In such situations, the  smaller company might have to contract out for the necessary support,  provided it can be found within a suitable time frame.", "External expertise that might have helped VaxGen better understand its  stability issue was never applied. At one point during the development  contracts, NIAID\u2014realizing VaxGen had a stability problem with its  product\u2014convened a panel of technical experts in Washington, D.C.", "NIAID officials told us that at the time of the panel meeting, they offered  to fund technical experts to work with the company, but VaxGen opted  not to accept the offer. Conversely, VaxGen officials reported to us that at  the time NIAID convened the panel of experts, NIAID declined to fund the  work recommended by the expert panel.", "The lack of available technical expertise was exacerbated when key staff  at the company began leaving. A senior VaxGen official described the  attrition problem as \u201cmassive.\u201d Of special significance, VaxGen\u2019s Senior  Vice President for Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer  left during critical phase 2 trials. An official at VaxGen described this  person\u2019s role as key in both development of the assays and reformulation  of the vaccine.", "Finally, VaxGen accepted the procurement contract terms even though the  financial constraints imposed by the BioShield Act limited its options for  securing any additional funding needed. In accordance with this act,  payment was conditional on delivery of a product to the stockpile, and  little provision could be made, contractually, to support any unanticipated  or additional development needed\u2014for example, to work through issues  of stability or reformulation. Both problems are frequently encountered  throughout the developmental life of a vaccine. This meant that the  contractor would pay for any development work needed on the vaccine.  VaxGen, as a small biotechnology company, had limited internal financial  resources and was dependent on being able to attract investor capital for  any major influx of funds.", "In such a firm, fixed-price contractual arrangement, the contractor  assumes most of the risk because the price is not subject to any  adjustment based on the contractor\u2019s cost experience. Thus, even if the  contractor costs go up, the delivery price does not. We believe these  contracts are appropriate in situations where there are no performance  uncertainties or the uncertainties can be identified and reasonable  estimates of their cost impact can be made, but this was not the situation  in the VaxGen procurement contract. VaxGen had to be willing to accept  the firm, fixed-price contract and assume the risks involved.

In January 2006, FDA informed VaxGen, under its recently issued  draft EUA guidance, of the data FDA would require from VaxGen for its  product to be eligible for consideration for use in an emergency. The draft  guidance described in general FDA\u2019s current thinking concerning what  FDA considered sufficient data and the testing needed for a product to be  considered for authorization in certain emergencies.", "Because the EUA guidance is intended to create a more feasible protocol  for using an unapproved product in a mass emergency than the term  \u201ccontingency use under an IND protocol\u201d that ASPR used in the  procurement contract, it may require more stringent data for safety and  efficacy. Under an IND protocol, written, informed consent must be  received before administering the vaccine to any person, and reporting  requirements identical to those in a human clinical trial are required. The  EUA guidance\u2014as directed by the BioShield law\u2014eased both informed  consent and reporting requirements. This makes sense in terms of the  logistics of administering vaccine to millions of people in the large-scale,  postexposure scenarios envisioned. Because EUA guidance defines a less  stringent requirement for the government to use the product, it  correspondingly may require more testing and clinical trial work than was  anticipated under contingency use.", "Several of the agencies and companies involved in BioShield-related work  have told us the EUA guidance appears to require a product to be further  along the development path to licensure than the previous contingency  use protocols would indicate. VaxGen officials told us that if the draft EUA  guidance was the measure of success, then VaxGen estimated significant  additional resources would be needed to complete testing to  accommodate the expectations under this new guidance. NIAID told us  that the EUA guidance described a product considerably further along the  path to licensure (85 percent to 90 percent) than it had assumed for a  Project BioShield medical countermeasure (30 percent) when it initially  awarded the development contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Concept of Use for the rPA Vaccine Was Not Clearly Articulated to All Parties", "paragraphs": ["FDA considers a vaccine\u2019s concept of use important information to gauge  the data and testing needed to ensure the product\u2019s safety and efficacy.   Under the EUA statute, FDA must determine on the basis of the specific  facts presented whether it is necessary and appropriate to authorize use of  a specific product in an emergency. According to FDA, data and testing  requirements to support a product\u2019s use in an emergency context may vary  depending on many factors, including the number of people to whom the  product is expected to be administered. The current use of an unlicensed  product involves the assessment of potential risks and benefits from use of  an unapproved drug in a very small number of people who are in a  potentially life-threatening situation. In such situations, because of the  very significant potential for benefit, safety and efficacy data needed to  make the risk benefit assessment might be lower than in an emergency  situation where an unlicensed vaccine might be offered to millions of  healthy people. This distinction is critical for any manufacturer of a  product intended for use in such scenarios\u2014it defines the level of data  and testing required. Product development plans and schedules rest on  these requirements.", "In late 2005, as VaxGen was preparing for the second phase 2 trial and well  into its period of performance under the procurement contract, its officials  participated in meetings, primarily with FDA but also with ASPR and  NIAID representatives, to receive FDA comments on its product  development plans and responses to specific requests for regulatory  advice. VaxGen needed to have a clear understanding of FDA\u2019s data and  testing requirements for the rPA vaccine for the upcoming phase 2 trial to  be able to plan for and implement the necessary clinical and nonclinical  work to generate that data. Without it, VaxGen did not have adequate  means to determine how far along it was toward meeting FDA\u2019s  requirements.", "However, in these meetings, it became clear that FDA and the other  parties had different expectations for the next phase 2 trial. FDA officials  concluded from the discussion that VaxGen, ASPR, and CDC anticipated  the next phase 2 trial to produce meaningful safety and efficacy data to  support use of the vaccine in a contingency protocol under IND. However,  FDA officials stated that this was a new idea to the agency. From FDA\u2019s  perspective, the purpose of phase 2 trials was to place the product and  sponsor (VaxGen) in the best position possible to design and conduct a  pivotal phase 3 trial in support of licensure. The lack of a definition of  concept of use caused FDA to delay replying to VaxGen until it could  confer with ASPR and CDC to clarify this issue.

ASPR purchased 10 million  doses of BioThrax in 2005 and 2006 as a stopgap measure for post- exposure situations. After discussions between VaxGen and FDA, VaxGen  concluded that this raised the bar for its rPA vaccine.

First, ASPR lacks an effective strategy to minimize  waste. As a consequence, based on current inventory, over $100 million is  likely to be wasted annually, beginning in 2008. Three lots of BioThrax  vaccine in the stockpile have already expired, resulting in losses of over  $12 million. According to the data provided by CDC, 28 lots of BioThrax  vaccine will expire in calendar year 2008. ASPR paid approximately $123  million for these lots. For calendar year 2009, 25 additional lots\u2014valued at  about $106 million\u2014will reach their expiration dates. ASPR could  minimize the potential waste of these lots by developing a single inventory  system with DOD\u2014which uses large quantities of the BioThrax vaccine\u2014 with rotation based on a first-in, first-out principle.", "Because DOD is a high-volume user of the BioThrax vaccine, ASPR could  arrange for DOD to draw vaccine from lots long before their expiration  dates. These lots could then be replenished with fresh vaccine from the  manufacturer. DOD, ASPR, industry experts, and Emergent BioSolutions  (the manufacturer of BioThrax) agree that rotation on a first-in, first-out  basis would minimize waste.", "DOD and ASPR officials told us that they discussed a rotation option in  2004 but identified several obstacles. In July 2007, DOD officials believed  they might not be able to transfer funds to ASPR if DOD purchases  BioThrax from ASPR. However, in response to our draft report, DOD  informed us that funding is not an issue.  However, ASPR continues to  believe that transfer of funds would be a problem.  DOD stated smallpox  vaccine (Dryvax) procurement from HHS is executed under such an  arrangement. Further, DOD and ASPR officials told us that they use  different authorities to indemnify the manufacturer against any losses or  problems that may arise from use of the vaccine. According to DOD, this  area may require legislative action to ensure that vaccine purchased by  ASPR can be used in the DOD immunization program.  Finally, since DOD  vaccinates its troops at various locations around the world, there may be  logistical distribution issues. A DOD official acknowledged that these  issues could be resolved.", "Second, ASPR plans to use expired vaccine from the stockpile, which  violates FDA\u2019s current rules. Data provided by CDC indicated that two  lots of BioThrax vaccine expired in December 2006 and one in January  2007. CDC officials stated that their policy is to dispose of expired lots  since they cannot be used and continuing storage results in administrative  costs. FDA rules prohibit the use of expired vaccine.", "Nevertheless, according to CDC officials, ASPR told CDC not to dispose of  the three lots of expired BioThrax vaccine. ASPR officials told us that  ASPR\u2019s decision was based on the possible need to use these lots in an  emergency.

Our draft report acknowledged the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response\u2019s (ASPR) sense of urgency to develop an rPA  anthrax vaccine following the 2001 attack.  However, our report also  stated that by November 2004, ASPR had had sufficient time and  opportunity to thoroughly evaluate contractual risks and issues without  being overly influenced by the sense of urgency.  By November 2004, it  was clear that significant manufacturing issues needed to be overcome  and that a 2-year time scale to produce 25 million doses was accordingly  unrealistic.    2. We agree that ASPR has taken several steps to develop and  communicate its strategy and plans to acquire medical countermeasures to  potential manufacturers. In addition, HHS has conducted several  workshops to stimulate discussion with potential manufacturers.  However, these steps were taken just before or after VaxGen\u2019s  procurement contract was terminated.  While we reviewed the HHS Public  Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Strategy and  Implementation Plan for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear  Threats, we did not find these documents to be relevant to our evaluation  of ASPR\u2019s performance with regard to VaxGen\u2019s procurement contract.    3. ASPR\u2019s definition of the concept of use refers, as expressed in its  comments, to the anthrax vaccine in combination with antibiotics as post- exposure prophylaxis.  However, our report discusses the potential use of  the unlicensed rPa vaccine in the stockpile when the licensed anthrax  vaccine was already available.  We cite the Food and Drug  Administration\u2019s position that it would give preference to the licensed  vaccine over the unlicensed vaccine.", "With regard to critical requirements, HHS acknowledged that critical  requirements would change for different products.  Therefore, HHS should  have known the consequences of changing requirements for a fixed-price  contract with a 2-year time limit.  4. We agree with HHS that it is not always possible to know the exact  regulatory specifications for a product at the beginning of the  procurement process.  However, ASPR failed to recognize that changing  requirements under a fixed-price procurement contract could significantly  affect the finances and the 2-year delivery time line it established.    5. The acting director of ASPR told us that the principal deputy of ASPR  had decided not to destroy the expired lots in case they were needed for  use in an emergency. However, using the expired vaccine would violate  the FDA rule.  In response to the draft of this report, HHS now states that  it is quarantining the expired lots until a decision can be made regarding  disposal. We do not understand HHS\u2019s rationale for continuing to hold the  vaccine in quarantine for nearly a year and the justification for the  administrative expenses involved.   6. Although HHS and the Department of Defense (DOD) use different  authorities to address BioThrax liability and funding issues, both  authorities could apply to vaccines purchased by either DOD or HHS;  consequently, indemnity does not appear to be an insurmountable  obstacle for future procurements.  As indicated in our report, DOD and  HHS should continue to explore the legal implications of different  indemnity authorities and present a legislative proposal to Congress if they  determine that a statutory change is required to establish a joint inventory.    7. Since, as ASPR acknowledges, it does not have a strategy to minimize  waste, we calculated the potential $100 million annual wastage based on  expiration dates of the current vaccine inventory.  ASPR stated that the  annual saving would only be up to $25 million per year but did not provide  any basis for this estimate.  However, according to DOD, in contract year  2006, it purchased BioThrax valued at about $55 million, a savings of more  than double ASPR\u2019s estimate.", "A strategy to minimize waste in the stockpile should include not only  integration of inventory based on a first-in, first-out principle but also  reexamination of requirements derived from consequence modeling with  regard to the size of the inventory.  Such a strategy would result in savings  closer to $100 million.  8. We did not mean to suggest that all expired products represent waste or  lost investment. We clarified our definition of waste in the report.  When  there is a large-volume user for the stockpile product, not having an  effective strategy to ensure that stockpile product would be used  constitutes waste.  However, since DOD is a large user of BioThrax,  unnecessary waste will result from ASPR not making an effort to ensure  that to the extent possible, DOD uses the vaccine in the stockpile.  9. We did not question the legality of the contract award to VaxGen but  rather the rationale underlying the contract\u2019s requirement for 25 million  doses in 2 years.   10.  ASPR officials told us that they did not have tools to assess product  maturity at the time of the contract award, and that they were guided by a  sense of urgency.  On the basis of these statements, we concluded that  their assessment was subjective.    11. We disagree that the VaxGen Project BioShield award did not preempt  other support for product development that was being provided to VaxGen  through its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases contract.  According to our analysis of the contract document and discussions with  NIAID officials, funding under the development contract largely ceased  once the procurement contract was awarded.    12.  We clarified the report text to attribute to VaxGen officials the  statement that the purchase of BioThrax for the stockpile as a stopgap  measure raised the bar for the VaxGen vaccine.  13. Our draft report did not say that HHS changed the requirements for the  VaxGen rPA vaccine.  However, we have clarified the text to state that  purchase of BioThrax for the stockpile raised the requirement for the use  of rPA anthrax vaccine.  14 We clarified the report text to indicate that neither FDA nor VaxGen  understood the concept of use prior to January 2006.    15. We clarified the report text to indicate that ASPR officials told us that  FDA would define \u201csufficient data\u201d and the testing hurdles a product  needed to overcome to be considered a \u201cusable product.\u201d  16.
