We previously reported that, based on this  definition, as of August 2018, the 24 agencies planned to have a total of  4,907 operating data centers at the beginning of fiscal year 2019.", "However, OMB\u2019s June 2019 revised DCOI reporting requirements further  changed the definition of a data center, including no longer requiring  agencies to report most of the facilities previously categorized as non- tiered data centers. As noted previously, OMB directed agencies to stop  reporting on spaces not designed to be data centers as part of their  inventory. As a result, agencies are no longer required to report on about  2,000 facilities, some of which are considerable in size and will continue  to operate.

Specifically, in its 2016 guidance memorandum, OMB stated that these  smaller facilities posed a cybersecurity risk, and consequently, identified  them as data centers that needed to be included in consolidation efforts  under DCOI. In particular, OMB called out server rooms and closets as  security risks that should be targeted for closure. However, while OMB\u2019s  2019 guidance noted the need to address security at these locations and  encouraged agencies to continue working to consolidate and optimize  them, there is no requirement for agencies to continue to track and report  on their progress in closing these smaller facilities.", "In July 2019, we found that IT systems supporting federal agencies, such  as those found in the government\u2019s data centers, are inherently at risk.  Specifically, we reported that because these systems can be highly  complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically  dispersed, these factors increase the difficulty of protecting their security.  Since each physical location represents a potential access point to an  agency\u2019s interconnection with other internal and external systems and  networks, each location also poses a risk as a point of potential attack.  We also noted that IT systems are often riddled with security  vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities,  such as unsecured access points, can facilitate security incidents and  cyberattacks that disrupt critical operations; lead to inappropriate access  to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive information;  and threaten national security, economic well-being, and public health  and safety. Because of OMB\u2019s decision to remove these types of data  centers from DCOI reporting, agencies may lose track of the security  vulnerabilities that these facilities present due to the consequent  reduction in overall visibility and oversight into all data centers.", "In its June 2019 guidance, OMB also outlined a process by which  agencies could request, and OMB approve, that specific facilities be  removed from reporting. As part of this process, agencies were allowed to  identify data centers to be removed in one reporting period and then  actually remove them in the next, unless OMB provided a written denial  within 30 days of the original request. Similarly, agencies could request  an exemption for mission critical facilities from their closure target; that  request also allows 30 days for OMB to object to the request before an  agency should consider the request approved.", "However, there is currently no documentation of OMB\u2019s decisions on  requests to remove specific data centers from reporting, or to exempt the  data centers from closure targets because the facility is mission critical.  Although an agency\u2019s data center inventory included fields for  documenting OMB\u2019s decisions with regard to potential exemptions to  optimization, there is no requirement or mechanism to document OMB\u2019s  approval that a data center could be dropped from reporting or exempt  from closure. There is also no mechanism that would allow a third party to  determine whether OMB is providing any denials within the 30 days  specified in the DCOI guidance.

However, OMB\u2019s own past guidance has acknowledged  the security risks posed by the types of facilities that agencies can now  exclude from DCOI. While agencies are best positioned to determine  whether these locations should be closed or optimized, it is important that  these facilities, previously covered by DCOI, continue to be reported on  quarterly, regardless of whether they are subject to closure or  optimization. Further, the lack of transparency into OMB\u2019s approval  process for removing certain facilities from reporting due to a lack of  documentation hinders its ability to understand how and why those  decisions are made.

For example, officials in the  Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Office of the CIO reported 12 data  center closures, but said they did not report any achieved cost savings  because the majority of those data centers were within multi-use facilities  that were still owned and maintained by the agency. However, according  to VA\u2019s DCOI strategic plan, the agency plans to achieve cost savings in  fiscal year 2020 because it expects to stop leasing two data centers,  which is expected to reduce data center spending.", "In addition, officials from three agencies\u2014the Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), the General Services Administration (GSA),  and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2014 reported that they did not have any agency-owned data centers and had  limited opportunity to achieve cost savings related to closing and  optimizing their data centers. According to OPM officials, the agency did  not have a savings target due to the lack of a fiscal year 2019 DCOI  strategic plan, which was attributed by the officials to an oversight that  resulted from changes in OPM CIO leadership at the time the plan was  due. The officials reported that the agency continued to execute on a plan  that was already in place and they did not anticipate any meaningful  changes in the agency\u2019s DCOI strategy for 2020. The officials said they  expect OPM to submit its fiscal year 2020 strategic plan on time in April  2020.", "Overall, the 24 participating DCOI agencies have reported a total of $4.7  billion in cost savings and avoidances from fiscal years 2012 through  2019. We have previously stressed that identifying and reporting the  savings resulting from agencies\u2019 data center consolidations was an  important indicator for monitoring the progress of DCOI. Until OPM  submits a plan that identifies its cost savings targets to OMB, the  agency\u2019s ability to plan how to achieve DCOI\u2019s expected benefits will be  limited.

Pursuant to this requirement, OMB has used several different sets of  performance measures that have changed over time. Most recently, and  as previously noted, OMB issued revised DCOI guidance in June 2019  that defined a set of three revised and one new data center optimization  metrics to replace the five previous metrics. According to the OMB  memorandum that published these changes, the current metrics were  intended to focus optimization efforts in key areas where agencies can  make meaningful improvements and achieve further cost savings through  optimization. Table 3 provides a description of the four data center  optimization metrics and how each metric is to be calculated.", "According to the June 2019 revised DCOI guidance, agencies are to  focus their optimization efforts on their remaining open, agency-owned,  tiered data centers. OMB also included in the guidance its plans to work  with the agencies to set agency-specific optimization performance targets  for each fiscal year.

As of  September 2019, the IT Dashboard reported that four agencies had fully  completed their overall DCOI optimization efforts for all of their data  centers and had no further work to do. The IT Dashboard further reported  that another four agencies had met their optimization targets for fiscal  year 2019.", "However, eight agencies had not met their fiscal year 2019 virtualization  target. The reasons agencies provided for not meeting the target varied.  For example, officials in the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of the CIO  reported that the department did not meet the virtualization target  because the closure date for one of its data centers was moved to fiscal  year 2020, which resulted in fewer virtualized hosts for 2019 under OMB\u2019s  new definition. Additionally, although EPA did not meet its virtualization  target, its DCOI strategic plan described the agency\u2019s intention to meet its  goals by expanding its virtualization strategy agency-wide, which would  increase the agency\u2019s virtualization performance.", "In addition, OMB required agencies to report the number of agency- owned data centers with advanced energy metering. As of September  2019, of the 19 agencies with the basis to report, eight reported that they  did not reach their target for having such metering in their data centers.  For example, officials at the Department of Veteran Affairs reported that  they did not meet their advanced energy metering target due to difficulties  in getting a contract in place to install the metering.", "Further, for the new availability metric, there were unexpected variances  in how agencies reported information\u2014thus rendering the data for this  metric unreliable. Specifically, according to OMB\u2019s quarterly reporting  instructions, agencies were to report the number of hours, in the 3-month  reporting period, that each data center was expected to be available to  provide services. However, several agencies reported information based  on annual, instead of quarterly, calculations. In addition, Department of  Agriculture officials stated that, for one data center, they reported the total  number of availability hours for multiple instances where they provided  data center services to other agencies. Based on the various instances of  erroneous agency reporting that we identified, we determined that the  data for this metric was not sufficiently reliable for us to use.", "When the problems with these data were brought to agencies\u2019 attention,  many agreed that their reporting needed to be updated; in some cases,  the agencies updated their information, but not in time for it to be  analyzed and addressed in this report. Based on our discussions with  agencies, we will continue to monitor their progress in improving the  accuracy of their reporting for this metric through our follow-up efforts for  this report, as well as our future mandated reviews of DCOI progress.", "Additionally, and as mentioned previously, Justice had not established a  target for server utilization. Officials in the department\u2019s Justice  Management Division stated that this was due to OMB\u2019s issuing the  revised DCOI guidance and metrics in June 2019. Once they can track  server utilization for a few reporting periods, the officials stated that the  agency will finalize its definition for underutilized severs and establish an  appropriate target for the metric.", "Overall, while agencies reported more success in meeting the current  optimization metrics, most agencies did not meet all of their metric targets  for fiscal year 2019. Until these agencies take the steps necessary to  meet their optimization targets, it is unlikely that these agencies will  achieve the expected benefits of optimization and the resulting cost  savings.

However, the performance metrics did not fully meet the  two other characteristics\u2014namely they did not include appropriate  performance parameters and did not fully include all the information that  would allow them to be understood at all levels of the organization.", "Table 5 provides our assessment of the extent to which the OMB metrics  aligned with the characteristics of an effective metric. In addition,  appendix III provides additional detail of our assessment of the  characteristics of each metric.", "While all four of OMB\u2019s metrics met three of the five characteristics of an  effective metric, none of the metrics addressed the fourth characteristic of  providing appropriate performance parameters. Specifically, none of the  metrics included statistical universe parameters that would enable a  determination of progress against goals. For example, the virtualization  metric requires an agency to report the number of its virtual hosts, but  does not relate that to the overall number of servers and mainframes at  the agency. As a result, the metric does not indicate whether an agency\u2019s  reported number of virtual hosts is almost all of that agency\u2019s servers and  mainframes, or very few. Similarly, the server utilization metric identifies  how many underutilized servers an agency has, but does not give the  context of how that relates to the agency\u2019s total population of servers. In  both these cases, percentages cannot be calculated to determine  progress. For instance, while the number of an agency\u2019s virtualized  servers may increase, if the universe of servers were to increase at a  higher rate, then progress would actually be negative. In the June 2019  DCOI revised guidance, OMB acknowledged removing targeted averages  for its metric targets. However, by doing so, OMB also removed important  information that provided a relative sense of the progress indicated by the  data.", "Further, the lack of performance parameters in defining the metrics had  an impact on OMB\u2019s public reporting of agencies\u2019 progress. The IT  Dashboard displays agencies\u2019 consolidation and progress information  through a DCOI Optimization Summary that displays data about the  number of agency data center facilities, achieved and planned closures,  achieved and planned IT cost savings, and progress of the current  performance metrics against the related targets. However, the IT  Dashboard does not provide important information, such as in which fiscal  year the targets are to be achieved and how the metric information being  reported relates to an agency\u2019s operations. For example, the IT  Dashboard reports the number of servers and mainframes serving as  virtual hosts in agency-managed data centers, but does not provide the  total number of servers and mainframes to give the context of how well  agencies are managing the number of their virtual hosts.", "Staff in OMB\u2019s Office of the Federal CIO stated that the lack of  performance parameters for the metrics is due to OMB and the agencies  needing time to collect baseline data before making changes to the  metrics. However, until OMB addresses missing information from the  optimization metric definitions, the metrics will lack important and  meaningful information about agencies\u2019 DCOI performance that would  assist OMB and Congress in their oversight roles. In addition, unless  OMB takes action to update the metrics\u2019 definitions to include missing key  metric characteristics, agencies\u2019 reporting may not provide an accurate  view of their data center optimization progress.

Additionally, in fiscal year  2019, almost all of the agencies met or planned to meet their $249 million  total savings target. Agencies\u2019 efforts in both respects have made an  important contribution to achieving the overall goals of DCOI. However,  agencies\u2019 annual closure goals are not currently reported in their DCOI  strategic plans or tracked on the IT Dashboard, requiring us to manually  calculate those targets. Unless agencies\u2019 annual closure goals are fully  reported and tracked, oversight of DCOI will be hampered. Further, the  six agencies without plans to meet their fiscal year data center closure or  cost savings targets will continue to be challenged to realize the full  benefits of DCOI.", "As part of the 2019 changes to DCOI, OMB significantly reduced the  scope of what is considered a data center, and, in doing so, excluded  about 2,000 smaller facilities that were previously reported by agencies in  2018.

Further, there  is currently no documentation of OMB\u2019s decisions on agency requests to  remove data centers from reporting, or to exempt mission critical data  centers from closure targets.

In addition, Department of Agriculture officials stated that, for  one data center, they reported the total number of availability hours for  multiple instances where they provided data center services to other  agencies. Because of these variances and the impact they had on the  reported information, we determined that the availability metric data were  insufficiently reliable to report on agencies\u2019 progress.", "To assess whether OMB\u2019s new performance metrics met key  characteristics of an effective performance measure, we adapted  principles from the Green Book that described characteristics of effective  performance measures.
