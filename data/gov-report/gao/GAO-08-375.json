The Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that it will need more than $17 billion for facilities to accommodate the planned personnel increases. GAO was asked to review (1) the process the Army and Marine Corps used to develop construction projects associated with Grow the Force, (2) the extent to which the projects submitted in DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 support the initiative, and (3) whether the Army and Marine Corps plan to use temporary facilities while construction projects are completed. GAO reviewed the construction projects associated with Grow the Force in DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, reviewed stationing documents, and interviewed officials at Army and Marine Corps headquarters and six installations on the process used to develop projects. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD disagreed with GAO's assessment that 1 Army project and 12 Marine Corps projects do not support Grow the Force but did not provide sufficient documentation that existing capacity issues would be exacerbated by additional personnel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Marine Corps followed their typical process to develop construction projects when they developed the Grow the Force projects submitted in DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008; however, the process was compressed due to the short period of time between the announcement of the initiative and submission of budget requests. For example, the active duty Army took about 2 months and the Marine Corps took 6 months to develop projects submitted in DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008; the typical process takes about 2 years. Nearly all of the military construction projects submitted as Grow the Force projects in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 supported the Grow the Force initiative. GAO found that 68 of the 69 projects submitted by the Army and Army National Guard, totaling more than $2.3 billion, and 37 of the 49 projects submitted by the Marine Corps, totaling more than $665 million, supported Grow the Force. However, GAO found that 1 Army project and 12 Marine Corps projects did not support Grow the Force because they addressed existing deficiencies and were needed regardless of whether Grow the Force occurred or they supported another initiative. For example, the Marine Corps included a $7 million wastewater system modification project at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in its fiscal year 2008 budget request to address environmental issues. Officials said the project was already planned for a future budget request and would be needed regardless of whether Grow the Force had occurred. Additionally, GAO determined that 3 Marine Corps projects, totaling $58 million, were to construct facilities for wounded Marines that supported another initiative, not Grow the Force. While most of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008 projects were linked to Grow the Force, it may be more difficult to identify some Marine Corps and Army Reserve projects as supporting the initiative in future budget requests because the Marine Corps may not link installationwide projects to Grow the Force and the Army Reserve plans to identify projects for a related force structure effort as Grow the Force projects. GAO's analysis shows that some units will arrive at installations before facilities are constructed; however, the Army does not plan to purchase or lease temporary facilities, while the Marine Corps plans to do so to bridge the gap between when units are established and permanent facilities are constructed. The Army plans to use existing facilities, including facilities vacated by deployed units, to bridge the gap between the time when personnel arrive and the completion date of construction projects. The majority of new units will be established at Marine Corps installations before permanent facilities are complete and will require temporary facilities. The Marine Corps requested $147 million in fiscal year 2008 for temporary facilities, including armories and trailers, to bridge the gap between the time units arrive and the completion date of construction projects. A Marine Corps official expects that additional funding for temporary facilities will be required but the extent of the funding requirements have not yet been determined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2007 the President announced a permanent increase in the  Army and Marine Corps end strength through the Grow the Force initiative  to enhance overall U.S. forces, reduce stress on deployable personnel, and  provide necessary forces for success in the Global War on Terrorism. This  planned expansion will increase the Army\u2019s end strength by more than  74,000 soldiers by 2013 and the Marine Corps\u2019 end strength by 27,000  Marines by 2011. Currently, the Army and Marine Corps estimate that the  construction of operational and support facilities and housing associated  with this expansion will total more than $17 billion through 2013. The  Army and Marine Corps have already requested more than $3 billion for  construction projects related to the expansion in the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 budget requests.

The committee report directed us to review  the planning and budgeting process for military construction projects  associated with Grow the Force submitted in DOD\u2019s budget requests for  fiscal years 2007 and 2008. In response to that direction we examined   (1) the process the Army and Marine Corps used to develop the  construction projects to accommodate the increased end strength due to  the Grow the Force initiative, (2) the extent to which the construction  projects submitted in DOD\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008  support the initiative, and (3) whether the Army and Marine Corps plan to  use temporary facilities while construction projects are completed.", "To examine the process the Army and Marine Corps used to develop  construction projects to accommodate the increased end strength, we  reviewed information about the process typically used to develop  construction projects and the process the Army and Marine Corps used to  develop Grow the Force construction projects. We discussed this process  with knowledgeable officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics; key offices within the  Army, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps  headquarters; and selected Army and Marine Corps installations. To  determine the extent to which the construction projects submitted in  DOD\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 support the Grow the  Force initiative, we analyzed key documents, including budget justification  documents for all construction projects submitted for the fiscal year 2007  supplemental budget request, the fiscal year 2008 Global War on Terrorism  supplemental budget request, and the President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget  request. We included in our scope only those projects that the Army and  Marine Corps submitted in DOD\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and  2008. We determined that a project supported the Grow the Force  initiative if budget justification documentation for the project stated that it  supported the initiative, cited a particular unit that was being established  or increasing in size as part of the Grow the Force initiative, and referred  to a capacity issue due to the additional personnel. If the budget  justification documentation did not provide sufficient information to  determine whether the project supported the Grow the Force initiative, we  discussed the project with officials at the service headquarters or the  installation to obtain the needed information. We discussed our  methodology and assessment of whether projects supported the Grow the  Force initiative with Army and Marine Corps officials, who generally  agreed with our approach. While we evaluated the extent to which the  projects submitted in DOD\u2019s budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008  supported the Grow the Force initiative, we did not validate the need for  projects. To determine whether the Army and Marine Corps planned to  use temporary facilities, we reviewed Army and Marine Corps stationing  plans and project documentation and interviewed knowledgeable officials  within the Army and Marine Corps headquarters and selected Army and  Marine Corps installations.

Specifically, the limited  time available between when the Grow the Force initiative was announced  and the fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 budget requests were  submitted gave the services less time than during the typical process to  develop and submit projects.", "The Army\u2019s typical process for developing construction projects generally  takes over 2 years; however, the Army completed the process in about   2 months for Grow the Force projects included in its fiscal year 2007  supplemental budget request and the President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget  request. In general, the Army\u2019s typical process to develop construction  projects includes five steps: (1) Army headquarters provides guidance to  installations, (2) installation officials develop construction projects,   (3) construction projects are submitted to Army headquarters for review  and approval, (4) senior Army officials review and approve construction  projects, and (5) construction projects are included in the Army budget for  submission to Congress. For Grow the Force projects included in the  fiscal year 2007 supplemental budget request and the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2008 budget request, the Army included all of the steps from the  typical process, but completed them in a compressed time frame, as  shown in figure 1.", "According to Army officials, projects submitted in the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2009 budget request were also developed using the steps of the  typical process in a compressed time frame. The projects were developed  in about 6 months instead of 2 years. Army officials expect that Grow the  Force projects submitted in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget request  and beyond will follow the typical process and time frames.", "As with the Army, the Marine Corps\u2019 process for developing construction  projects generally takes about 2 years; however, the Marine Corps  completed the process in 6 months for Grow the Force projects included  in DOD\u2019s supplemental budget requests for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. In  general, the Marine Corps\u2019 typical process for developing construction  projects includes 6 steps: (1) Marine Corps headquarters sends guidance  on facility projects to the installations, (2) installations develop project  proposals and submit them to Marine Corps headquarters, (3) a military  construction review board prioritizes the projects and sets funding limits,  (4) the Naval Facilities Engineering Command reviews projects and  validates the cost and scope of the projects, (5) Marine Corps  headquarters reviews projects, and (6) construction projects are included  in the Department of the Navy budget for submission to Congress.

A Marine Corps headquarters official said that the  installations did not submit new projects developed specifically for Grow  the Force in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request. Rather, they  submitted projects that were already in the development process for  future budget requests due to the limited time available to develop  projects and environmental reporting requirements. Installations followed  the typical process when developing these projects.", "According to a Marine Corps official, installations followed the typical  process to develop projects included in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2009  budget request and had the same amount of time to develop projects,  although Marine Corps headquarters provided the guidance to installations  to develop projects about a month later than for the typical process and  installations submitted projects to Marine Corps headquarters about a  month later than usual.

According to a  National Guard Bureau official, the Army National Guard\u2019s process to  determine projects for the President\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget request was  the same as the typical military construction process; however, the  projects were developed in a compressed time frame.

Specifically, we found that 65 Army projects, 3  Army National Guard projects, and 37 Marine Corps projects supported  Grow the Force, but 13 projects did not, as shown in table 3.", "We determined that one Army project to upgrade a railroad yard at Fort  Lewis, Washington, did not support Grow the Force because the project is  in response to an existing deficiency. Specifically, the Army\u2019s budget  justification states that current facilities are overtaxed to support  deployment from Fort Lewis as a result of growth through other Army  initiatives. While approximately 2,000 personnel are being added to Fort  Lewis through Grow the Force, we assessed this project as not supporting  Grow the Force because the project was needed regardless of whether  Grow the Force occurred and we did not identify a clear link between the  additional personnel and an increased number of deployments, which  would exacerbate the current capacity issues at the railroad yard. An  official in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management agreed with our assessment.", "As a result of the compressed time frame to develop and submit projects,  we found that the 22 projects submitted by the Marine Corps in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request had already been planned and  were moved up from future years\u2019 budgets to meet existing deficiencies.  We determined that 10 of these projects would support the Grow the  Force increase because the existing deficiencies would be exacerbated by  having more Marines on the installation due to the Grow the Force  initiative. For example, officials from Twentynine Palms, California, said  that they had already planned to include projects in their fiscal year 2010  and fiscal year 2011 military construction budget requests to build  operations facilities designed to house multiple battalions due to existing  deficiencies in administrative space on the installation. While the projects  were not originally intended for the new personnel, installation officials  identified these as projects that could be moved up to meet the new  requirements for Grow the Force.", "However, we determined that the remaining 12 of the 22 projects totaling  $210 million did not support the initiative because they address existing  deficiencies rather than new units associated with Grow the Force, or  address initiatives other than Grow the Force. We found that 7 of the  Marine Corps projects totaling $137 million do not support Grow the Force  because they address existing deficiencies on the installations that needed  to be addressed regardless of whether Grow the Force occurred and we  could not clearly identify that existing capacity issues these projects were  designed to address would be exacerbated by additional personnel from  Grow the Force. For example, the Marine Corps included a $7 million  wastewater system modification project at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina,  which budget justification documentation indicates is needed to limit  environmental impacts and does not make reference to capacity issues  from additional personnel through Grow the Force.  Additionally,  installation officials said this project would be needed regardless of  whether Grow the Force occurred and was already planned to be included  in a future budget request. Similarly, according to project documentation  and information from installation officials, two projects to construct new  operations facilities at Camp Pendleton, California, were to address  existing quality issues, rather than capacity issues resulting from  additional Marines added to the facility through Grow the Force.", "Additionally, we determined that 5 of the 12 projects that did not support  Grow the Force, totaling nearly $73 million, supported other initiatives.  For example, the Marine Corps submitted 2 projects for physical security  upgrades that support installation security and force protection efforts,  rather than supporting Grow the Force. The remaining three projects were  barracks at Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton and a headquarters  building at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, totaling $58 million, that  support an initiative for wounded Marines, rather than Grow the Force.  Marine Corp officials agreed that the 3 Wounded Warrior projects do not  support the Grow the Force initiative. However, Marine Corps officials  disagreed with our assessment that the remaining 9 projects do not  support Grow the Force because they believe that each of the projects will  help the installations manage issues related to additional personnel on the  installation.", "While most of the Army, Army National Guard, and Marine Corps projects  were clearly linked to Grow the Force, it may be more difficult to identify  some Marine Corps and Army Reserve projects as supporting the initiative  in future budget requests. Specifically, a Marine Corps official expected  that installations would identify future unit-specific construction projects  related to Grow the Force as supporting the initiative in budget  justification documentation. However, the official expected that  installationwide projects, including mess halls or quality of life projects,  such as child development centers, would not be clearly linked to Grow  the Force in future budget justifications because these installationwide  projects would benefit and be used by all of the personnel on the  installation, rather than only those added through Grow the Force.  Further, we found that the Army Reserve, which submitted its first Grow  the Force projects in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget request, plans  to link projects that support other related force structure changes to Grow  the Force in budget justification documentation. Specifically, Army  Reserve officials said they plan to link projects for about 16,000 soldiers to  Grow the Force even though these personnel are not part of Grow the  Force. These 16,000 soldiers are part of a related effort to realign the  Army\u2019s forces to better match operational needs, called rebalancing, and it  is not clear what the facility requirements for these personnel may include.

Our analysis shows that units will be established at 11 Army  installations prior to the completion of planned construction projects.  However, the Army has not requested funding to purchase or lease  temporary facilities to support the additional forces. To bridge the gap, the  Army plans to utilize existing space, including space vacated by units  deploying overseas, to accommodate the additional personnel. For  example, installation officials at Fort Carson, Colorado, said they have  used space temporarily vacated by brigade combat teams deployed  overseas to accommodate additional personnel at the installation.  However, the officials expressed concern about whether they would  continue to have sufficient space on the installation to accommodate  additional personnel with brigade combat teams returning from overseas  deployments. According to National Guard Bureau officials, the Army  National Guard will have units established before the completion of  facilities for those units; however, the states, which are responsible for  stationing personnel, have not yet submitted requests for any leased  facilities.", "The majority of new Marine Corps units established between fiscal year  2007 and fiscal year 2011 will arrive at installations before permanent  facilities are available. The Marine Corps requested $147 million in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request and plans to purchase or lease  about 1,500 temporary facilities to house units while permanent facilities  are completed. The majority of these facilities will be used at Camp  Pendleton, California; Twentynine Palms, California; and Camp Lejeune,  North Carolina. For example, Camp Pendleton requested nearly $40  million to lease some temporary facilities, such as office trailers, and  purchase other temporary facilities, such as armories. In its fiscal year  2007 supplemental budget request, the Marine Corps requested $18 million  to purchase temporary facilities for Twentynine Palms, including trailers,  portable armories, and storage containers, to accommodate the increase in  end strength until permanent facilities are completed. Camp Lejeune,  which is receiving the largest end strength increase from Grow the Force,  requested funding to lease trailers and purchase portable armories, which  installation officials said would be used until the permanent facilities are  complete. Each installation is responsible for determining temporary  facility needs, and Marine Corps officials noted that temporary facility  needs could vary from day to day depending on what units are deploying  or being established and the type of space that is needed. According to  installation officials we spoke with, temporary facilities will typically be  used for 3 to 7 years, depending on the time between when units arrive at  the installation and when construction is complete.
