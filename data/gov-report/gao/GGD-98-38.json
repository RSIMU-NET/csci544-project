Such tax audits have been a fundamental part of IRS\u2019 enforcement strategy for many years, helping to ensure that taxpayers pay the amount of taxes they owe. Tax audits may occur in a variety of forms, ranging from a simple review of a return with little taxpayer contact to a detailed on-site examination and investigation of a taxpayer\u2019s financial records. Increasingly, however, the way IRS conducts its audits has been criticized by taxpayers, tax professionals, and Congress as being overly intrusive and burdensome for taxpayers.", "Much of this criticism has stemmed from IRS\u2019 reemphasis on detecting unreported income. In the early 1990s, IRS managers became concerned that auditors were not fully using audit techniques designed to identify unreported income. In a 1994 initiative, to address this concern, IRS implemented a training program to reemphasize the need to consider a taxpayer\u2019s financial status by focusing on whether the taxpayer\u2019s income and expenses were roughly proportional. The training program reemphasized certain audit techniques for identifying unreported income. These techniques are sometimes referred to as financial status audit techniques.", "You asked that we review IRS\u2019 use of financial status audit techniques. In this report, we (1) estimate how frequently IRS used financial status audit techniques in audits closed in tax years prior to the 1994 initiative (1992 and 1993) and in tax years following the initiative (1995 and 1996); (2) consider how IRS\u2019 need to contact taxpayers for additional taxpayer information when using financial status techniques might intrude on taxpayers; (3) estimate the audit results from using financial status audit techniques in terms of the amount of adjustments to reported income; and (4) determine how IRS applied its audit standards, quality controls, and measurement of audit quality to the use of financial status techniques.", "As our primary method for addressing these objectives, we selected random samples of audits of individual returns completed before and after IRS implemented its financial status audit initiative in 1994 and examined the IRS audit workpapers for the sampled tax returns. We discussed our observations about the audits we reviewed with IRS officials. We did not contact individual taxpayers about the audits we reviewed. However, we discussed the issues of intrusiveness and burdens of IRS\u2019 financial status audits with knowledgeable tax professionals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS defines the tax gap as the amount of tax that taxpayers owed but have not paid. IRS estimates the individual income tax gap to be $95.3 billion for 1992. Unreported income accounts for a major portion of this tax gap\u2014$58.6 billion or over 60 percent. In the early 1990s, IRS became concerned that its auditors were not fully probing for income that should have been, but was not, reported on tax returns. This concern as well as others led IRS to reemphasize the need for its auditors to consider a taxpayer\u2019s financial status and to probe for unreported income. This reemphasis came to be known as the financial status audit program.", "IRS initiated the financial status audit program in late 1994 with a training course for auditors. In the training course, IRS stressed the importance of identifying unreported income by determining whether the taxpayer\u2019s reported income roughly conforms to his or her spending. Such an evaluation requires consideration of the taxpayer\u2019s spending patterns in addition to verifying items reported on tax returns. If reported income and spending patterns differ, the auditor is supposed to decide whether the difference is significant enough to warrant asking the taxpayer for an explanation.", "The training course stressed the importance of meeting with taxpayers, checking nontraditional data sources (such as state and local governments), and using four indirect audit techniques. These four techniques, the cornerstones of financial status audits, are bank deposit analysis, in which the auditor uses the taxpayer\u2019s bank statements to ensure that total deposits are accounted for on the tax return or as nontaxable receipts; net worth method, in which the auditor analyzes changes in the taxpayer\u2019s assets to determine any potential for unreported income; normal markup/unit of sales method, in which the auditor uses the taxpayer\u2019s cost of goods sold and average markups within the industry to estimate business gross receipts; and cash transaction (Cash-T) method, in which the auditor compares the taxpayer\u2019s expenditures to income sources. Under this method, if a taxpayer\u2019s expenditures exceed reported income and the source for such expenditures cannot be explained, the excess represents potential unreported income.", "The Cash-T method also includes a preliminary Cash-T in which the auditors use only the information available on the tax return to determine whether the expenditures exceeded reported income. The preliminary Cash-T can be completed without contacting the taxpayer for information.", "The consideration of a taxpayer\u2019s financial status and the use of these techniques to probe for unreported income are not new concepts. Historically, the techniques have been used in fraud and criminal investigation cases, but they have also been available for use by other IRS auditors. IRS officials noted that the use of financial status techniques has been mentioned in the Internal Revenue Manual at least as far back as 1961. According to IRS officials, the 1994 financial status initiative was intended primarily to reemphasize instructions that auditors receive in other IRS training courses.", "By early 1995, IRS was receiving considerable criticism about audits using these financial status techniques. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Members of Congress, and various taxpayer groups were concerned that these audits were more time consuming and intrusive than other auditing techniques. AICPA officials had several concerns about the taxpayer burden and intrusiveness that they associated with IRS\u2019 use of financial status techniques. Specifically, they were concerned about IRS\u2019 practice of asking financial status questions at the initial interview before having any evidence of underreported income. Similarly, AICPA officials were concerned about IRS sending a request for personal living expense (PLE) information with the letter notifying the taxpayer of the audit, before finding any evidence of unreported income.", "In response to these criticisms, IRS provided additional instructions to its auditors to clarify the intent of financial status audits. Between August 1995 and March 1996, three memoranda were issued from the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (Examination) to Regional Chief Compliance Officers to provide the clarifications. The August memorandum supported the use of financial status techniques but urged auditors to use sound judgment in asking financial status questions at the initial interview, particularly when no indication of underreported income existed. The December 1995 and March 1996 memoranda provided similar instructions, including guidance indicating that PLE forms should not automatically accompany notification letters. AICPA officials acknowledged to us that these instructions helped to reduce some of their concerns, but they said they were still concerned about the added time and intrusiveness associated with IRS\u2019 use of financial status audit techniques."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which IRS\u2019 use of financial status techniques has changed, we selected random samples of audits of individual returns completed before and after IRS began reemphasizing the techniques in 1994. We selected these samples from IRS\u2019 Audit Information Management System (AIMS) database. For the \u201cbefore\u201d sample, we selected audits that were opened on individuals from October 1991 through October 1992 and closed during fiscal years 1992 and 1993. For the \u201cafter\u201d sample, we selected audits that were opened from October 1994 through October 1995 and closed during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Each sample audit included one or more individual income tax returns. Our sample contained 838 valid audits selected from an estimated population of 977,000 audits. All the numbers used in this report are estimates developed on the basis of weights assigned to the sampled audits so that they represent the population from which we sampled. See appendix I for a more detailed description of our sampling methodology and the procedures used to develop our estimates.", "We used the IRS workpapers associated with each audit to determine whether and how auditors used the financial status techniques and which type of techniques were used. For each sample audit, using a data collection instrument that we developed, we gathered specific information from the case files about the types of techniques used, amounts of any adjustments to taxable income and tax liability, types of questions asked the taxpayers, and information about both the auditor and taxpayer. We also met with National Office officials responsible for implementing the financial status program to discuss our sampling methodology and results. We did not determine whether IRS\u2019 auditors made appropriate choices in deciding when to use financial status techniques and what techniques to use because IRS had no specific criteria against which to make this judgment.", "To obtain information on how the use of financial status techniques increased the need for taxpayer contact and might have affected the taxpayer, we again used data from the audit workpapers. We collected information from the case files on the types of techniques being used, whether or not Cash-Ts were preliminary or comprehensive, the nature of the taxpayer contacts, the types of questions asked at initial interviews, and whether or not IRS requested PLE information when first notifying the taxpayer of the audit. Additionally, we met with IRS\u2019 National and Field office officials to learn how each technique was used. As part of our work on this issue, we discussed the financial status program with officials at AICPA. These officials raised several concerns about IRS\u2019 use of financial status techniques and the whole approach to audits resulting from the emphasis on the techniques. To the extent possible, we used our sample data to evaluate these concerns.", "To determine the results of audits using financial status techniques, we used the samples and workpapers previously discussed. For each audit, we recorded the adjustments to income and additional taxes found on all returns. We also recorded the amount of the changes to income attributable to the use of one or more of the financial status techniques.", "To determine how IRS applied its audit standards, quality controls, and quality measurement to the use of financial status techniques, we met with officials in the Examination Division, including the Quality Measurement staff, at the National Office and four district offices. We also discussed quality review procedures with group managers at the district offices. We obtained copies of the audit standards and reviewed their applicability to the financial status program. Otherwise, we did not evaluate the adequacy of the standards. We reviewed IRS\u2019 Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) to determine how IRS measures audit quality and what the measures show. At three of the four district offices, we examined several EQMS cases, selected by IRS personnel, to see how EQMS reviews were done. We did not examine any cases at the Philadelphia district office because all EQMS reviews in that region are done at another district office. We did not try to assess the accuracy of EQMS reviews. (See appendix II for a summary of IRS\u2019 audit standards.)", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On November 20, 1997, we received written comments from IRS, which are summarized at the end of this letter and are reproduced in appendix IV. These comments have been incorporated into the report where appropriate.", "We performed our audit at IRS headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., and at district offices and service centers in Fresno and Oakland, CA; Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; and Richmond, VA. Our work was done between October 1996 and August 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little Change Shown in the Use of Financial Status Techniques", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 renewed emphasis on financial status audit techniques produced little, if any, change in how often these techniques were used. Comparing audits done before and after IRS\u2019 emphasis on financial status, we estimated that the use of one or more of the financial status techniques was 24 percent for the 1992 and 1993 period and 22 percent for the 1995 and 1996 period. The difference in these percentages is not statistically significant. During both periods, financial status techniques were used predominately on returns involving business or farm income. IRS research has found that taxpayers with these types of income are more likely to underreport income than taxpayers whose income is reported by third parties on information returns. Table 1 compares the two periods we reviewed.", "IRS managers were concerned that auditors were not making use of techniques to identify unreported income. The financial status program and the associated training was designed to correct this problem. IRS officials could not tell us why the percent of financial status audits had not changed after the reemphasis and training. However, they noted that one reason may have been because of the limited amount of follow-up training provided by the districts and the limited amount of National Office oversight due to IRS\u2019 reorganization activities after the initial training. In commenting on our draft report, IRS officials indicated that the financial status training focused less on increasing the use of a specific technique and more on improving the auditors\u2019 ability to identify unreported income.", "We also analyzed whether IRS changed the types of techniques being used. We found no significant change in usage by type of financial status technique since the reemphasis. Generally, only two techniques were used, often in combination, during our two sample periods. Table 2 describes the results of this analysis.", "To put the data presented in tables 1 and 2 in perspective, in 1995, about 116 million taxpayers filed their 1994 individual income tax returns. On the basis of historical data and information from our sample, we estimate that between 126,000 and 183,000 will receive an audit that uses at least one of the four financial status techniques during the 3 years before the statute of limitations expires."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Taxpayer Contact When Using Financial Status Techniques Varies", "paragraphs": ["Financial status audit techniques vary in the extent of additional taxpayer contact needed and the amount of information being sought from taxpayers. IRS has no data showing how much additional taxpayer contact is associated with each technique or how intrusive the additional information needed might be. However, we were able to make some general observations based on our review of the workpapers.", "For example, the Cash-T method can be separated into two types\u2014preliminary and comprehensive. In the preliminary Cash-T, the auditor uses only information available on the tax return to identify any indications of unreported income. This technique, therefore, requires no additional contact with the taxpayer. Of the estimated 126,000 to 183,000 audits of tax year 1994 individual returns in which IRS used a financial status technique, we estimated that between 29,000 and 42,000 of these audits (23 percent) only used a preliminary Cash-T, requiring no response from the taxpayer.", "The comprehensive Cash-T and each of the other techniques require some additional taxpayer contact. The amount of contact required and information sought can vary with each taxpayer and the type of financial status technique used. In a comprehensive Cash-T, the auditor needs information from the taxpayer on nonreturn items such as cash on hand, savings, and PLE. For a bank deposit analysis, the auditor requires access to the taxpayer\u2019s bank account records and may require considerable taxpayer contact to ask the taxpayer to explain significant discrepancies between total deposits and the income shown on the tax return. The net worth and normal markup methods require taxpayer contact primarily to explain any identified discrepancies.", "AICPA has been among the critics of IRS\u2019 reemphasis on financial status audits since the program began in late 1994, claiming that IRS auditors use the techniques without having any evidence that taxpayers have underreported income. Such intrusions into taxpayer\u2019s spending patterns could occur at two points\u2014(1) before the initial interview and (2) during the initial interview. Critics suggested that such intrusions increased after the 1994 initiative. Using the data gathered from our reviews of IRS\u2019 audit workpapers, we looked at the frequency of the two concerns.", "We gathered information on how often IRS used the initial notification letter to request that the taxpayer provide PLE information. We found no significant difference between the 1992 and 1993 period (before the reemphasis on financial status) and the 1995 and 1996 period (after the reemphasis). During both periods, less than 5 percent of the initial notification letters to the taxpayers also requested that they provide information on their PLE.", "Recognizing the potential for intrusiveness, the Acting Assistant Commissioner (Examination) in a March 1996 memo, clarified the PLE instructions. The memo indicated that while auditors had the responsibility to secure an overall financial picture of the taxpayer, they were not expected to automatically request PLE information with the notification letter. According to AICPA officials, sending PLE forms with the notification letters has decreased since the distribution of this memo.", "We also gathered information on the types of questions IRS auditors asked taxpayers at opening interviews. Financial status critics believe that questions designed to determine the taxpayer\u2019s financial status were inappropriate unless IRS had evidence that the taxpayer had underreported income. AICPA officials provided a list of the questions, which focused on personal spending habits such as how often a taxpayer eats at restaurants and where a taxpayer vacations.", "Based on our analysis of the documents in the case files, most of these interview questions occurred in fewer than 5 percent of the audits. For the 1995 and 1996 sample period, only four of the questions were asked during the initial interview in over 10 percent of the audits. In addition, the frequency in which the questions were asked was about the same in our samples of audits for 1992 and 1993 and for 1995 and 1996. Appendix III provides information about the specific questions and how often they were asked."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results From Audits Using Financial Status Techniques Have Been Mixed", "paragraphs": ["The results of using financial status techniques have been mixed. The use of the techniques resulted in IRS auditors identifying large amounts of unreported income in some cases. At the same time, a high percentage of audits resulted in no adjustments to reported income attributable to the use of financial status techniques. Table 3 summarizes these results.", "IRS reemphasized the use of financial status techniques to address its concerns with finding unreported income. In the audits we reviewed in our 1995 and 1996 sample, we estimated that auditors used financial status techniques to identify unreported income totaling over $300 million. Our review of the IRS workpapers indicated that the auditors were unlikely to have identified unreported income without using the techniques. The workpapers did not show that this income was reported on an information return or identified by the taxpayer, the other two primary techniques used to verify the accuracy of reported income.", "However, table 3 shows that the use of financial status techniques has resulted in no adjustments to income in a significant number of cases. For example, in our 1992 and 1993 sample, 81 percent of the audits using financial status techniques resulted in no adjustments to reported income attributable specifically to the techniques. Similarly, for the 1995 and 1996 sample, 83 percent resulted in no adjustment to reported income attributable to the use of the techniques.", "Audits having no change attributable to the use of financial status audit techniques may have had changes attributable to other audit techniques. These no-change audits were closed with either (1) no changes to any tax issue or (2) changes such as reducing claims for a tax deduction, exemption, or credit after the auditor reviewed the taxpayer\u2019s documentation. For the 1992 and 1993 audits having an 81 percent no-change rate, 23 percent had no change for any reason and 58 percent had changes to taxable income that were not attributable to the use of financial status techniques. For 1995 and 1996, the 83 percent no-change rate breaks out as 28 percent with no change for any reason and 55 percent with changes to taxable income that were not attributable to the use of financial status techniques.", "This high percentage of no change attributable to the use of financial status techniques raises issues about whether IRS can further help auditors in judging when and how to use these techniques. Given the complexity of the tax code and the fact that tax return forms provide for limited, if any, explanation of the numbers entered by the taxpayer, it is not reasonable to expect an adjustment every time a financial status technique is used nor is it desirable that all auditor judgment be removed from the decision about when to use the techniques. It is important, however, that IRS make the most effective and efficient use of its limited resources while striking an appropriate balance between collecting information and evidence to assist the auditor in identifying the correct tax, and avoiding unnecessary burden and intrusiveness for the taxpayers. Thus, the best interest of both IRS and the taxpayers is achieved when the no-change rate is at some acceptable low point. To this end, we believe that more specific criteria on when to use financial status techniques would provide auditors with additional context around which to exercise their professional judgment on a case-by-case basis, and would likely result in a reduced no-change rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Tools to Oversee Use of Financial Status Techniques", "paragraphs": ["IRS has three primary tools to oversee use of financial status audit techniques: (1) audit standards to guide auditors, (2) supervisory review of auditors\u2019 adherence to the standards, and (3) a system to measure adherence to the standards. Our analyses focused on how IRS applied these tools to the use of financial status audit techniques. While these tools offered important controls over the use of the financial status techniques, they each have limitations. For example, the audit standards do not guide auditors on when and when not to use financial status techniques. IRS\u2019 managers at the group level review a small portion of the audits because of a lack of time caused by other duties. IRS\u2019 measurement system, like the standards, focused on whether financial status techniques, when used, were used correctly from a technical perspective, not on when to use the techniques and to what degree."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Audit Standards Lack Specific Criteria for Using Financial Status Techniques", "paragraphs": ["IRS uses its audit standards, which have evolved since the 1960s, to define audit quality. However, the standards do not offer specific criteria to guide auditors on when and when not to use financial status techniques and to what degree. Instead, the standards focus on whether actions were taken and, if so, whether they were taken correctly from a technical perspective.", "IRS uses nine audit standards to address the scope, audit techniques, technical conclusions, workpaper preparation, reports, and time management of an audit. Each standard is composed of key elements that operationally define a quality examination. IRS guidance stipulates that for a standard to be rated as being \u201cmet,\u201d each of the key elements must be rated as \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cnot applicable.\u201d The standards and the associated key elements are summarized in appendix II.", "Of the nine audit standards, Standard 2, Probes for Unreported Income, has four key elements that address whether the auditor (1) considered the adequacy of internal controls, (2) considered the types of books and records maintained, (3) considered the taxpayer\u2019s financial status, and (4) appropriately used indirect audit techniques to probe for unreported income. These last two elements directly address financial status analyses and audit techniques. Under Standard 2, auditors are instructed to consider financial status in all audits and only use a financial status audit technique when they suspect unreported income.", "However, IRS did not provide specific criteria in the standards to help auditors decide when unreported income is likely. The key element for evaluating appropriate use of these techniques addressed whether the auditor considered using a technique, selected the appropriate technique, and applied it correctly. Nothing in the standard provides the auditor with specific criteria to determine when to use or not use a given technique or to what degree to use it. For example, IRS has not instructed auditors on how extensively to consider a taxpayer\u2019s financial status and when that consideration should prompt the use of a technique to probe for unreported income. Nor has IRS instructed auditors on how large a discrepancy between reported income and expenses should be to justify more in-depth probing. On the basis of our review of the audit workpapers, we believe that this lack of criteria has probably contributed to the large percentage of audits in which the use of financial status techniques resulted in no adjustments to income.", "During the course of our work, IRS agreed with us that it needs specific criteria to better guide its auditors on using the financial status techniques. According to an IRS official, sections of the Internal Revenue Manual are being revised to better instruct tax auditors and revenue agents about when and when not to use financial status techniques and to what degree to use them in probing for unreported income. In September 1997, we received a draft of the revised manual sections. Our initial review of these revised instructions indicated that they offered some guidance on when to use financial status techniques but did not provide specific criteria. For example, the revisions indicate that if a preliminary analysis yields a Cash-T that is materially out of balance, the auditor should use subsequent interviews and information gathering to resolve the imbalance.", "The instructions define \u201cmaterial imbalance\u201d as the significance of an item in determining the correct tax liability. The instructions require auditors to use their judgment on the return as a whole and the items that comprise that return. In using their judgment on whether the imbalance is material, the auditors must consider such factors as the comparative and absolute size of the imbalance as well as the relationship between the size of the imbalance and the tax liability. However, IRS has not provided instructions to guide the auditor when analyzing the comparative or absolute size of the imbalance or when comparing the relationship of the imbalance to the tax liability. In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS officials said it would be impractical to develop specific quantitative criteria to define materiality.", "We acknowledge that developing quantitative criteria to cover every situation is difficult and that auditors\u2019 judgment is still an important element of any audit. However, we believe that the concept of \u201cmaterial imbalance\u201d could be made more specific by developing some quantitative criteria that would use the preliminary Cash-T and establish thresholds for the factors associated with an imbalance between reported income and estimates of PLE, such as the comparative size of any imbalance. If the preliminary Cash-T indicated that the income reported on the tax return that was available for PLE was below the threshold\u2014that is, apparently not sufficient to support the living expenses indicated\u2014the auditor would be expected to conduct a more detailed probe for unreported income, potentially using one or more of the other financial status techniques. If the preliminary Cash-T showed the taxpayer\u2019s reported income to be above the threshold\u2014that is, apparently sufficient to support the estimated PLE\u2014using the other financial status techniques would not be expected.", "In either case, the auditor could decide to go against the criteria but would be expected to explain the reasons in the workpapers.

Rather, the managers must rely on the experience and judgment of the auditors because the manager\u2019s audit workload and other duties limit the time available for review. Further, these officials said budget constraints will likely cause the managers\u2019 span of control to increase rather than decrease in the future, resulting in more audits to oversee. The analysis of our sample supports IRS\u2019 assertions that not all audits are reviewed by managers.

This office compiles and maintains a national database of the quality reviews done at the district level. This database can be used to identify trends by district and nationally. Of the 800,000 face-to-face audits done by IRS in fiscal year 1996, EQMS staff reviewed a sample of 12,170 audits to measure quality against the nine audit standards. According to IRS officials, this sample provided a statistically valid basis for measuring audit quality. EQMS staff reviewed the 12,170 audits to determine whether the auditors met the criteria for each of the auditing standards.

Further, 74 percent and 82 percent of these office and field audits, respectively, were rated as having met the key element under Standard 2 that involves the appropriate use of financial status audit techniques. Table 4 summarizes the EQMS-determined reasons auditors did not meet these key elements of Standard 2. For example, the most frequent reasons cited were that auditors did not (1) provide evidence that they had evaluated financial status, (2) recognize the need to use one of the financial status techniques, and (3) correctly compute the financial status technique.", "Knowing the reasons for not meeting the key element or the standard can provide insights on when the use of the financial status techniques would and would not be necessary to identify unreported income. However, the reasons identified by IRS, like the criteria in the audit standard on probing for unreported income, have not addressed the issue of when and when not to use financial status techniques and to what degree they should be used.

Also, neither the type of technique nor the type of return on which they are used has changed to any statistically significant degree.", "IRS has not measured how the use of financial status techniques may add to the burden and intrusiveness of audits. Use of the preliminary Cash-T technique added no burden because this technique does not require additional taxpayer contact. Use of the other financial status techniques require some degree of taxpayer contact. The amount of contact and the amount of additional information sought from the taxpayer, however, can vary with each situation.", "The results of using financial status techniques were mixed. In a large majority of such audits, no adjustments to income could be attributed specifically to the techniques. While it is not reasonable to expect unreported income to be found every time these techniques are used, the current rate of no adjustments seems high. However, in the remaining audits, the use of the techniques helped auditors to find unreported income that probably would not otherwise have been detected.", "This detection capability and the high frequency of no adjustments to reported income raises the issues of how to decide when and when not to use financial status techniques and to what degree they should be used. Currently, auditors\u2019 judgment primarily dictates these decisions because IRS does not provide the auditors with specific guidance for determining whether to use financial status audit techniques. While an auditor\u2019s judgment is likely to continue to constitute a significant portion of the decisionmaking process, guidance, in the form of specific criteria, might help reduce the frequency in which these techniques are used but do not result in adjustment to income.", "Similarly, supervisory review of audits to guide the auditors\u2019 performance, a key piece of IRS\u2019 quality control system, was limited by workload constraints and when done, seldom addressed the use of financial status techniques. Finally, IRS staff reviewed some closed audits for quality through EQMS, but like the audit standards, these reviews did not focus on when and when not to use financial status techniques and to what degree to use them.", "Without establishing specific criteria to guide the usage of financial status audit techniques, IRS does not have a good basis for evaluating the auditors\u2019 judgment in choosing to use or not use the techniques. We believe that such criteria would help IRS auditors make their decisions. Given that our tax system is based on voluntary compliance, an appropriate balance must be maintained between collecting information to assist the auditor in identifying the correct tax and avoiding unnecessary burden and intrusiveness for the large majority of taxpayers. More specific criteria to use in making case-by-case decisions about when and to what extent to use financial status audit techniques would be helpful to auditors in achieving that balance. Developing such criteria, however, would have to be considered a work in progress, with changes and updates occurring as needed when auditors and managers become more experienced with their use.
