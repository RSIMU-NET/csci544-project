In August 2010, GAO reported that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had not ensured that all states were complying with the managed care actuarial soundness requirements that rates be developed in accordance with actuarial principles, appropriate for the population and services, and certified by actuaries. For example, GAO found significant gaps in CMS\u0092s oversight of 2 of the 26 states reviewed\u0097CMS had not reviewed one state\u0092s rates in multiple years and had not completed a full review of another state\u0092s rates since the actuarial soundness requirements became effective. Variation in practices across CMS regional offices contributed to these gaps and other inconsistencies in the agency\u0092s oversight of states\u0092 rate setting. GAO\u0092s previous work also found that CMS\u0092s efforts to ensure the quality of the data used to set rates were generally limited to requiring assurances from states and health plans\u0097efforts that did not provide the agency with enough information to ensure the quality of the data used. With limited information on data quality, CMS cannot ensure that states\u0092 managed care rates are appropriate, which places billions of federal and state dollars at risk for misspending. GAO made recommendations to improve CMS\u0092s oversight.", "Oversight of supplemental payments needs improvement. GAO has reported on varied financing arrangements involving supplemental payments\u0097disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments states are required to make to certain hospitals, and other non-DSH supplemental payments\u0097that increase federal funding without a commensurate increase in state funding. GAO\u0092s work has found that while a variety of federal legislative and CMS actions have helped curb inappropriate financing arrangements, gaps in oversight remain. For example, while there are federal requirements designed to improve transparency and accountability for state DSH payments, similar requirements are not in place for non-DSH supplemental payments, which may be increasing. From 2006 to 2010, state-reported non-DSH supplemental payments increased from $6.3 billion to $14 billion; however, according to CMS officials, reporting was likely incomplete. GAO made numerous recommendations aimed at improving oversight of supplemental payments.", "Challenges exist related to CMS\u0092s role ensuring program integrity. In December 2011, GAO testified that the key challenge CMS faced in implementing the statutorily established federal Medicaid Integrity Program was ensuring effective coordination to avoid duplicating state program integrity efforts, particularly in the area of auditing provider claims. GAO found that overpayments identified by its audit contractors since fiscal year 2009 were not commensurate with its contractors\u0092 costs, and CMS reported in 2011 that it was redesigning its audit program to achieve better results. Data limitations may have hampered the contractors\u0092 ability to identify improper claims beyond what states had already identified. With regard to CMS\u0092s other core oversight activities\u0097annual assessments and triennial comprehensive state program integrity reviews\u0097GAO found that much of the information collected from the annual assessments duplicated information collected during triennial reviews.

Our  prior work has shown that CMS continues to face challenges overseeing  the fiscal management of the Medicaid program.

We conducted this body of work from June 1993 through  December 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Under managed care, states use capitation payments to  prospectively pay health plans to provide or arrange for services for  Medicaid enrollees. Such capitation payments are required by federal law  to be actuarially sound.

For example, the extent to which CMS ensured  state compliance with some of the actuarial soundness requirements was  unclear because CMS officials did not always document their review or  cite evidence of the state\u2019s compliance. When officials did cite evidence,  the evidence did not always appear to meet the actuarial soundness  requirements. Variation in practices across CMS regional offices  contributed to these gaps and other inconsistencies in the agency\u2019s  oversight of states\u2019 rate setting. For example, regional offices varied in the  extent to which they tracked state compliance with the actuarial  soundness requirements, their interpretations of how extensive a review  of a state\u2019s rate setting was needed, and their determinations regarding  sufficient evidence for meeting the actuarial soundness requirements.", "We also reported in 2010 that CMS\u2019s efforts to ensure the quality of the  data used to set rates were generally limited to requiring assurances from  states and health plans\u2014efforts that did not provide the agency with  enough information to ensure the quality of the data used. CMS  regulations require states to describe the data used as the basis for rates  and provide assurances from their actuaries that the data were  appropriate for rate setting. The regulations do not include requirements  for the type, amount, or age of the data used to set rates, and states are  not required to report to CMS on the quality of the data. When reviewing  states\u2019 descriptions of the data used to set rates, CMS officials focused  primarily on the appropriateness of the data rather than their reliability.  Additionally, we found that actuarial certification does not ensure that the  data used to set rates are reliable. In particular, our review of rate-setting  documentation found that some actuaries\u2019 certifications included a  disclaimer that if the data used were incomplete or inaccurate then the  rates would need to be revised. Furthermore, some actuaries noted that  they did not audit or independently verify the data and relied on the state  or health plans to ensure that the data were accurate and complete. With  limited information on data quality, CMS cannot ensure that states\u2019  managed care rates are appropriate, which places billions of federal and  state dollars at risk for misspending. States and other sources have  information on the quality of data used for rate setting\u2014information that  CMS could obtain. In addition, CMS could conduct or require periodic  audits of data used to set rates; CMS is required to conduct such audits  for the Medicare managed care program.", "CMS took a number of steps that may address some of the variation that  contributed to inconsistent oversight, such as requiring regional office  officials to use a detailed checklist when reviewing states\u2019 rate setting;  use of the checklist had previously been optional. However, we found  variations in CMS oversight even when the checklist was used. Thus, to  improve oversight of states\u2019 Medicaid managed care rate setting, we  recommended that CMS (1) implement a mechanism for tracking state  compliance, including tracking the effective dates of approved rates;   (2) clarify guidance for CMS officials on conducting rate-setting reviews,  such as identifying what evidence is sufficient to demonstrate state  compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements, and how officials  should document their reviews; and (3) make use of information on data  quality in overseeing states\u2019 rate setting. HHS agreed with these  recommendations, and as of June 2011, CMS officials indicated they  were investigating ways to create an easily accessible database to help  them more closely monitor the status of rate-setting approvals, reviewing  and updating its guidance, and looking into incorporating information  about data quality into its review and approval of Medicaid managed care  rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Oversight of Medicaid Supplemental Payments Needs Improvement", "paragraphs": ["In our prior work, we have reported on varied financing arrangements  involving supplemental payments that shifted costs from the states to the  federal government.

Our work found  that while a variety of federal legislative and CMS actions have helped  curb inappropriate financing arrangements, gaps in oversight remain.  Because such financing arrangements effectively increased the federal  Medicaid share, they could compromise the fiscal integrity of Medicaid\u2019s  federal and state partnership.", "Our most recent reports on supplemental payments underscore these  gaps in federal oversight. In May 2008, we reported that CMS had not  reviewed all supplemental payment arrangements to ensure that these  payments were appropriate and used for Medicaid purposes. In  November 2009, we found that ongoing federal oversight of supplemental  payments was warranted, in part, because two of the four states reviewed  did not comply with federal requirements to account for all Medicaid  payments when calculating DSH payment limits for uncompensated  hospital care.", "Recently implemented requirements have the potential to improve  oversight of some supplemental payments, but concerns about other  payments remain. and accountability requirements in place for DSH payments.
