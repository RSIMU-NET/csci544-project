CMS estimates Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) improper payments, in part, by conducting medical reviews\u2014reviews of provider-submitted medical record documentation to determine whether the services were medically necessary and complied with coverage policies. Payments for services not sufficiently documented are considered improper payments. In recent years, CMS estimated substantially more improper payments in Medicare, relative to Medicaid, primarily due to insufficient documentation (see figure).", "For certain services, Medicare generally has more extensive documentation requirements than Medicaid. For example, Medicare requires additional documentation for services that involve physician referrals, while Medicaid requirements vary by state and may rely on other mechanisms\u2014such as requiring approval before services are provided\u2014to ensure compliance with coverage policies. Although Medicare and Medicaid pay for similar services, the same documentation for the same service can be sufficient in one program but not the other. The substantial variation in the programs' improper payments raises questions about how well the programs' documentation requirements help identify causes of program risks. As a result, CMS may not have the information it needs to effectively address program risks and direct program integrity efforts.", "CMS's Medicaid medical reviews may not provide the robust state-specific information needed to identify causes of improper payments and address program risks. In fiscal year 2017, CMS medical reviews identified fewer than 10 improper payments in more than half of all states. CMS directs states to develop corrective actions specific to each identified improper payment. However, because individual improper payments may not be representative of the causes of improper payments in a state, the resulting corrective actions may not effectively address program risks and may misdirect state program integrity efforts. Augmenting medical reviews with other sources of information, such as state auditor findings, is one option to better ensure that corrective actions address program risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to CMS, including that CMS assess and ensure the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid documentation requirements, and that CMS take steps to ensure Medicaid's medical reviews effectively address causes of improper payments and result in appropriate corrective actions.

For example, Medicare home health services must be supported by  documentation demonstrating compliance with the coverage policy that  beneficiaries be homebound, among other requirements. Certain  coverage policies and documentation requirements were implemented to  help reduce the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse. For example,  Medicare implemented a requirement that DME providers maintain  documentation demonstrating proof of item delivery, to better ensure  program integrity.

However, since the Medicaid  review sample in a state typically is not large enough to be statistically  generalizable by service type, the identified improper payments may not  be representative of the prevalence of improper payments associated  with different services within the state. Accordingly, corrective actions  designed to rectify specific individual improper payments may not address  the most prevalent underlying causes of improper payments. For  example, state Medicaid officials in four of our six states said that most  improper payments identified through PERM medical reviews are unique  one-time events. Federal internal control standards require agencies to  identify and analyze program risks so they can effectively respond to such  risks, and OMB expects agencies to implement corrective actions that  address underlying causes of improper payments. Without estimates  that provide information on the most prevalent underlying causes of  improper payments within a state, particularly by service type, a state  Medicaid agency may not be able to develop appropriate corrective  actions or prioritize activities to effectively address program risks.  Corrective actions that do not address the underlying causes of improper  payments are unlikely to be an effective use of state resources.", "Increasing sample sizes of the PERM is one approach that could improve  the usefulness of the medical reviews for states\u2014but other options also  exist. For example, PERM findings could be augmented with data from  other sources\u2014such as findings from other CMS program integrity efforts,  state auditors, and HHS-OIG reports. States conduct their own program  integrity efforts, including medical reviews, to identify improper payments  and state Medicaid officials we spoke with in four of our six selected  states said that they largely rely on such efforts to identify program risks.  One state\u2019s Medicaid officials said that state-led audits allow them to  more effectively identify\u2014and subsequently monitor\u2014services that are at  risk for improper payments in the state. CMS also could use data from  other sources on state-specific program risks to help design states\u2019  PERM samples. These options could help CMS and the states better  identify the most prevalent causes of improper payments and more  effectively focus corrective actions and program integrity strategies to  address program risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Policy May Limit State Identification of Medicaid Providers Under Fraud Investigation", "paragraphs": ["State Medicaid agencies may, but are not required to, determine whether  providers included in the PERM sample are under fraud investigation and  notify the PERM contractor. Under CMS policy, when a state notifies the  PERM contractor of a provider under investigation, the contractor will end  all contact with the provider to avoid compromising the fraud  investigation, and the claim will be determined to be improper, due to no  documentation. In fiscal year 2017, of the 328 Medicaid improper  payments due to no documentation, 27 (8 percent) from five states,  according to CMS, were because the provider was under fraud  investigation.", "If a state Medicaid agency does not notify the PERM contractor about  providers under fraud investigation, the PERM contractor will conduct its  medical review, which involves contacting the provider to obtain  documentation as a part of its normal process, and communicate about  improper payment determinations. Contacting providers that are under  fraud investigation as part of PERM reviews could interfere with an  ongoing investigation, such as in the following ways we identified based  on information from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and  others.", "The contact by the PERM contractor to request documentation,  although unrelated to the fraud investigation, may give the impression  that the provider is under heightened scrutiny. This could prompt the  provider to change its behavior, or to destroy, falsify, or create  evidence. These actions could in turn disrupt or complicate law  enforcement efforts to build a criminal or civil case.", "The PERM contractor\u2019s communication about improper payment  determinations may prompt states to conduct educational outreach to  the provider about proper billing procedures. This may inadvertently  change the billing practices of a fraudulent provider for whom law  enforcement is trying to establish a pattern of behavior.", "We found that states may not have processes to determine whether  providers included in the PERM sample are under fraud investigation. Of  the six states we spoke with, officials from two states said they did not  have a mechanism in place to identify providers under fraud investigation.  However, it is a best practice for investigative and review entities to  communicate and coordinate with one another to determine if multiple  entities are reviewing the same provider and for investigators to work  discreetly without disrupting the normal course of business, based on our  analysis of information from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners  and others. Accordingly, investigators should be aware of other  government entities that are in contact with providers under investigation,  such as the PERM contractor, who may contact providers multiple times  to request documentation, and refer identified improper payments for  recovery. If multiple entities are reviewing the same provider, one entity  may be directed to pause or cease its activities, such as a PERM medical  review, to reduce the risk of compromising an active fraud investigation.  CMS has stated that it is not the agency\u2019s intention to negatively impact  states\u2019 provider fraud investigations and, therefore, it has provided states  the option to notify the PERM contractor of any providers under  investigation to avoid compromising investigations. However, CMS does  not require states to determine whether providers under PERM medical  reviews are also under fraud investigation, which creates the potential  that PERM reviews could interfere with ongoing investigations.", "State Medicaid agencies may not have incentives to notify the PERM  contractor of providers under fraud investigation, as doing so will  automatically result in a no documentation error, which increases states\u2019  improper payment rates. Medicaid officials from one state we spoke with  said that while they check whether providers subject to PERM reviews  are under investigation for fraud, they do not report these instances to the  PERM contractor because the PERM contractor would find a no  documentation error and the claim would be cited as improper, increasing  the state\u2019s improper payment rate. Officials from another state said this  policy penalizes states, in the form of higher state-level improper payment  rates that may reflect poorly on states. Additionally, officials from this  state were reluctant to develop corrective actions for improper payments  stemming from such no documentation errors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS and states need information about the underlying causes of  improper payments to develop corrective actions that will effectively  prevent or reduce future improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid  FFS. The substantial variation in Medicare and Medicaid estimated  improper payment rates for the services we examined raise questions  about how well the programs\u2019 documentation requirements ensure that  services were rendered in accordance with program coverage policies.  While our study focused on certain services with high rates of insufficient  documentation, differences in documentation requirements between the  programs may apply to other services as well. Without examining how the  programs\u2019 differing documentation requirements affect their improper  payment rates, CMS\u2019s ability to better identify and address FFS program  risks and design strategies to assist providers with meeting requirements  may be hindered.", "At the state level, PERM medical reviews do not provide robust  information to individual states. CMS\u2019s requirements to address individual  improper payments may lead states to take corrective actions that may  not fully address underlying causes of improper payments identified  through medical review, and may misdirect state efforts to reduce  improper payments. Absent a more comprehensive review of existing  sources of information on the underlying causes of Medicaid improper  payments, CMS and states are missing an opportunity to improve their  ability to address program risks. In addition, the lack of a requirement for  state Medicaid agencies to determine whether providers whose claims  are selected for PERM medical reviews are also under fraud investigation  risks compromising ongoing investigations. Further, citing such claims as  improper payments in states\u2019 estimated improper payment rates may  discourage state Medicaid agencies from notifying the PERM contractor  that a provider is under investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to CMS:  The Administrator of CMS should institute a process to routinely  assess, and take steps to ensure, as appropriate, that Medicare and  Medicaid documentation requirements are necessary and effective at  demonstrating compliance with coverage policies while appropriately  addressing program risks. (Recommendation 1)", "The Administrator of CMS should take steps to ensure that Medicaid  medical reviews provide robust information about and result in  corrective actions that effectively address the underlying causes of  improper payments. Such steps could include adjusting the sampling  approach to reflect state-specific program risks, and working with  state Medicaid agencies to leverage other sources of information,  such as state auditor and HHS-OIG findings. (Recommendation 2)", "The Administrator of CMS should take steps to minimize the potential  for PERM medical reviews to compromise fraud investigations, such  as by directing states to determine whether providers selected for  PERM medical reviews are also under fraud investigation and to  assess whether such reviews could compromise investigations. (Recommendation 3)", "The Administrator of CMS should address disincentives for state  Medicaid agencies to notify the PERM contractor of providers under  fraud investigation. This could include educating state officials about  the benefits of reporting providers under fraud investigation, and  taking actions such as revising how claims from providers under fraud  investigation are accounted for in state-specific FFS improper  payment rates, or the need for corrective actions in such cases.

HHS also provided us with technical  comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "HHS concurred with our first recommendation that CMS institute a  process to routinely assess and ensure that Medicare and Medicaid  documentation requirements are necessary and effective. HHS stated  that CMS\u2019s Patients over Paperwork initiative is focused on simplifying  Medicare documentation requirements and noted that for the Medicaid  program, CMS will identify and share documentation best practices with  state Medicaid agencies. CMS\u2019s Patients over Paperwork initiative may  help CMS streamline Medicare documentation requirements. However,  we believe CMS should take steps to assess documentation  requirements in both programs to better understand the variation in the  programs\u2019 requirements and their effect on estimated improper payment  rates. Without an assessment of how the programs\u2019 documentation  requirements affect estimates of improper payments, CMS may not have  the information it needs to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid  documentation requirements are effective at demonstrating compliance  and appropriately address program risks.", "HHS did not concur with our second recommendation that CMS ensure  that Medicaid medical reviews provide robust information about and result  in corrective actions that effectively address the underlying causes of  improper payments. HHS noted that increasing the PERM sample size  would involve increasing costs and state Medicaid agencies\u2019 burden, and  that incorporating other sources of information into the PERM sample  design could jeopardize the sample\u2019s statistical validity. HHS also  commented that it already uses a variety of sources to identify and take  corrective actions to address underlying causes of improper Medicaid  payments. We acknowledge that increasing the sample size would  increase the costs of the PERM medical review program, though the level  of improper payments warrants continued action. Further, under the  current approach, we found that CMS and state Medicaid agencies are  expending time and resources developing and implementing corrective  actions that may not be representative of the underlying causes of  improper payments in their states. It is important that corrective actions  effectively and efficiently address the most prevalent causes of improper  payments, and our report presents options that could improve the  usefulness of the PERM\u2019s medical reviews\u2014such as augmenting medical  reviews with other sources of information during the development of  corrective actions. We continue to believe that corrective actions based  on more robust information would help CMS and state Medicaid agencies  more effectively address Medicaid program risks.", "HHS concurred with our third and fourth recommendations that CMS  minimize the potential for PERM medical reviews to compromise fraud  investigations and address disincentives for state Medicaid agencies to  notify the PERM contractor of providers under fraud investigation.
