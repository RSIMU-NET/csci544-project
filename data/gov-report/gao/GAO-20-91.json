As part of this training, the Ready Aircrew  Program establishes the minimum numbers and types of sorties and  simulator missions that aircrews of a particular combat aircraft must  complete during the annual training cycle to sustain different levels of  mission readiness. For example, in fiscal year 2016, experienced  aircrews for the F-15E were required to complete a minimum of 96 annual  live sorties (eight per month) to be considered combat mission ready, of  which 49 were to be flown to fulfill primary mission requirements.  Experienced aircrews for the F-15E were also required to complete 36  annual simulator missions (three simulator missions per month) to be  considered combat mission ready.", "In addition to quantifying the minimum number of annual flying hours  required to train combat aircraft squadrons, the Ready Aircrew Program is  an important input for establishing the resources necessary to make the  required training available to pilots and units. For example, the Air Force  uses the Ready Aircrew Program sortie requirements for its combat  aircraft, along with other inputs, to calculate the Air Force\u2019s annual flying  hour program and includes this cost in the Air Force\u2019s annual budget  submission to Congress.

Section 351 also required  the Air Force to report on actions it plans to take in response to the  independent study\u2019s recommendations and to estimate the resources  required to implement the recommendations. In accordance with Section  351, the Air Force contracted with the RAND Corporation in 2017 to  independently study the Air Force\u2019s Ready Aircrew Program at a cost of  slightly over $1 million.

To understand the extent to which  the RAND report complied with generally accepted research standards,  we reviewed research literature and Department of Defense (DOD)  guidance and identified frequently occurring, generally accepted research  standards that are relevant for defense studies. We selected standards  related to the design, execution, and presentation of the study from  among the standards we identified as generally accepted for research.  We assessed the RAND study against these three major elements for  generally accepted research standards, as based on prior GAO work. To  make our assessments, we considered the individual components of  those elements, as appropriate for the RAND study.

Air Force officials conceded that the  actions described in that briefing and plan were already underway at the  time of the study and were not initiated in response to the study\u2019s  recommendations. They stated that, though they generally agreed with  the recommendations, the Air Force lacked the manpower, resources,  and means to implement them. As such, the Air Force considers each of  the recommendations closed and plans no further actions. Further, the Air  Force has no plans for future follow-up on implementation of the RAND  recommendations. Accordingly, we did not further assess the actions  described by the Air Force in relation to the RAND study.

The Air Force expects that this  module will centralize management of the Air Force Ready Aircrew  Program Tasking Memorandum at the command level, transfer  aircrew training data whenever a member moves to a new station,  and improve capability to track the types of flight simulators used for  training. Further, because the Air Force does not plan to take  additional actions, it estimated no resources are required, beyond the  $5.15 million already funded, prior to RAND making these  recommendations.", "In concurring with RAND Recommendation 5\u2014to document training  quality to support requests for training resources\u2014the Air Force  explained that it is documenting the quality of training prescribed in its  annual Air Force Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum at  the squadron level. However, this is not a change based on the RAND  recommendation and was being done prior to RAND making this  recommendation. The Air Force factors unit training,  accomplishments, and readiness inputs into the Air Force Ready  Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum and overall flying hour  program. As the flying hour program is the basis for resource training  requests and the Air Force factors unit training and accomplishments  into its flying hour program, the Air Force explained that it plans to  take no additional actions based on this recommendation. Further,  because the Air Force does not plan to take additional actions, it  estimated no resources were required to implement this  recommendation.", "Partially Concur: In partially concurring with RAND recommendations  1, 3, 4, 6, and 9, Air Force officials explained that the mechanisms  reflected in its comments are sufficient to address the intent of the  RAND recommendations even though these mechanisms predated  RAND\u2019s recommendations. Consequently, according to the Air Force  officials who briefed us, the Air Force plans no additional actions  based on the recommendations, obviating the need to estimate  resources in the case of these five recommendations.", "Nonconcur: In not concurring with RAND Recommendation 7\u2014to  consider changing how Air Force Flying Hour Program requirements  affect the flying hour program\u2014the Air Force explained that the flying  hour program determination is standard across the Total Air Force,  affecting more than combat aircrews alone, and that the centrality of  the flying hour program to readiness and combat capability cannot be  overemphasized and must be defendable and auditable. Further,  based on its not concurring with this recommendation, the Air Force  did not estimate resources for this recommendation.", "Notwithstanding the RAND study, the actions taken by the Air Force may  not fully implement our prior recommendations as described previously.  Specifically, we recommended that the Air Force comprehensively  reassess the assumptions underlying its annual training requirements\u2014 including for example the total annual training requirements by aircraft,  the criteria for designating aircrews as experienced or inexperienced, and  the mix between live and simulator training\u2014and make any appropriate  adjustments in future aircrew training plans to ensure that its forces can  accomplish a full range of missions. While RAND accomplished such an  analysis as part of its review (see table 1, items 1(a) through 1(e) above),  RAND concluded in its analysis that the Air Force did not have the  objective measures of proficiency needed to determine the minimum and  optimum number of sorties and that the combat air forces aviation  community lacks consensus on how to define and measure an aircrew  member\u2019s proficiency. While the Air Force has defined proficiency in an  Air Force manual issued in September 2019, the Air Force has not  reassessed its assumptions underlying training requirements and made  appropriate adjustments to future training plans per our recommendation.", "Further, we recommended that the Air Force establish desired learning  objectives and training support elements needed to accomplish the  training expectations in its annual Ready Aircrew Program tasking  memorandums, and develop a process to collect data to assess the  effectiveness of annual training. In commenting on RAND\u2019s  recommendations 2 and 8, the Air Force stated that, before the  recommendations were made, it had made available $5.15 million in fiscal  year 2020 funding to develop an Aircrew Readiness Training  Management Module as an upgrade to the Air Force\u2019s Aviation Resource  Management System. The Air Force\u2019s effort to upgrade this system, while  not a result of the RAND recommendations, may meet the intent of our  recommendation. For example, the Air Force\u2019s development of the  Aviation Resource Management System is expected to centralize  management of the Air Force\u2019s Ready Aircrew Program training  requirements data at the command level, transfer aircrew training data  whenever a member moves to a new station, and improve capability to  track the types of flight simulators used for training. When fully  implemented, these improvements may ultimately allow the Air Force to  assess the effectiveness of annual training, as we recommended.  However, it is too early to tell as the actions were under development or  had just begun at the end of September 2019, and sufficient data to  evaluate the results have not been collected.", "Fully implementing both of our recommendations would better position  the Air Force to ensure that its aircrews receive effective training to  achieve a range of missions for current and emerging threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.
