While recent studies have disclosed problems with VA's development of contracts for clinical services, there has been little scrutiny of how VA monitors and evaluates the care contract providers give to veterans.", "GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to monitor clinical contractors working in VA facilities. This report examines the extent to which VA establishes complete performance requirements for contract providers, challenges VA staff encounter in monitoring contract providers' performance, and the extent to which VA oversees VAMC staff responsible for monitoring contract providers.", "GAO reviewed VA acquisition regulations and other guidance. In addition, GAO visited four VAMCs that varied in geographic location and selected a nongeneralizable sample of three types of clinical contracts from each of the four VAMCs to review. GAO discussed how VAMC and VISN staff monitor and oversee these contracts and reviewed contract monitoring documentation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All 12 contracts GAO reviewed from the four Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical centers (VAMC) visited contained performance requirements consistent with VA acquisition policy. However, the performance requirements lacked detail in six categories: type of provider or care; credentialing and privileging; clinical practice standards; medical record documentation; business processes; and access to care. GAO identified these categories from reviews of VA acquisition regulations, VA policies, and hospital accreditation standards; and VA officials verified that these six categories were an accurate reflection of performance requirements that should be in VA clinical contracts. GAO found, for example, one VAMC cardiothoracic contract that had detailed performance requirements while another VAMC's cardiothoracic contract did not contain a statement describing the contract provider's responsibilities for reporting and responding to adverse events and patient complaints. GAO also found that contracting officials lack tools, such as standard templates, that provide examples of the performance requirements that should be included in common types of clinical contracts. Such tools would help ensure consistency in requirements across contracts.", "Contracting officer's representatives (COR) cited two main challenges in monitoring contract providers' performance--too little time to monitor clinical contractors' performance effectively and inadequate training. Most of the 40 CORs at the four VAMCs in GAO's review said that their clinical contract monitoring duties were a collateral duty and that they had other primary responsibilities, such as serving as a business manager or administrative officer for a specialty clinic within the VAMC. GAO found that, on average, each of these 40 CORs spent about 25 percent of their time monitoring an average of 12 contracts. CORs said the demands of their primary positions at times prevented them from fully monitoring contract providers' performance. Further, VA's current guidance related to COR responsibilities does not include any information on how VAMCs are to determine the feasibility of whether a COR's workload--including both COR and primary position responsibilities--will allow them to carry out their tasks as CORs for monitoring contract provider performance. GAO also found that current VA COR training programs focus on contracts that buy goods, not clinical services, and include little information on monitoring responsibilities. CORs questioned the usefulness of the COR training VA uses to prepare them for monitoring clinical contracts.", "VA Central Office conducts limited oversight of COR and contract monitoring activities. VA Central Office reviews of COR clinical contractor monitoring activities are limited to a small number of annual file reviews that focus on verifying the presence of required documentation only and do not assess the quality of CORs' monitoring activities. Since implementing the program in March 2013 these reviews have been conducted in 4 of 21 network contracting offices and as of August 2013 none of the 4 offices has received feedback on these reviews. Without a robust monitoring system, VA cannot ensure that all CORs in its VAMCs are properly monitoring, evaluating, and documenting the performance of contract providers caring for veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA develop and disseminate standard templates that provide examples of performance requirements for clinical contracts, revise guidance for CORs to include workload information, modify COR training, and improve the monitoring and oversight of clinical contracts.

However, VA\u2019s outpatient satisfaction survey  includes significantly more than four elements and the contract\u2019s  performance standard does not clearly specify which four survey  elements will be used for this analysis. In another instance, the Seattle  VAMC temporary clinical provider contract includes a performance  standard for prescription dispensing that includes multiple standards that  cover numerous tasks related to prescription processing and validation in  inpatient and outpatient settings. By including multiple parts in a single  performance standard, it is unclear what the COR will actually be  measuring to determine the clinical contractor\u2019s performance in this area.

In another instance, the Minneapolis VAMC specialty contract  includes several performance standards in the credentialing and  privileging category that indicate the clinical contractor is responsible for  maintaining medical and clinical knowledge and engaging in practiced- based learning. However, this contract does not include information on  how the clinical contractor\u2019s performance in these areas would be  assessed and does not specify a clear numerical target for determining  whether or not these standards have been fulfilled.

(See table 5.)", "Based on the results from our data collection instrument administered to  40 CORs at the four VAMCs we visited, we found that the average COR  spends about one-quarter of his or her time monitoring approximately 12  contracts, according to estimates provided by CORs; however, some of  these CORs were responsible for overseeing significantly more contracts.  For example, we found that 6 of these 40 CORs managed nearly 190 of  the 452 (41 percent) contracts in place at the four VAMCs we visited and  told us they estimated spending at most 30 percent of their work time to  their COR duties. These 6 CORs were each managing about 20 more  contracts than the average, in our group of 40 CORs completing the data  collection instrument, in less time and all 6 of these CORs had other more  time-consuming primary duties, such as serving as an administrative  officer for a clinical specialty or as a program manager.", "In addition to CORs who responded to our data collection instrument,  during our review of the 12 contracts for various clinical services in the  four VAMCs we visited, we found that the CORs responsible for  managing these contracts frequently did not have the time to effectively  monitor the performance of contract providers. The majority of these  CORs said that one of their greatest challenges is not having adequate  time to fulfill their COR duties and responsibilities and that the demands  of their primary positions prevented them from fully monitoring clinical  contractors\u2019 performance. Specifically, CORs for 8 of the 12 contracts  reported that the demands of their primary positions have at times  prevented them from fully monitoring contract providers\u2019 performance. In  addition, CORs for 6 of these 12 contracts stated that they could not  complete certain elements of their COR responsibilities due to limited  time and resources. For example, one COR stated that she did not  adequately monitor costs for the 50 contracts she managed because the  duties of her primary position demanded significant portions of her work  day and caused frequent interruptions that did not allow her to focus on  her duties as a COR. Another COR noted that she only had time to  monitor contract issues that were a cause for concern or needed to be  addressed immediately. As a result of this time pressure and the  demands of their primary positions, CORs reported they did not complete  several key monitoring functions, including: (1) submitting required  reports, such as quarterly quality assurance reports; (2) documenting  contract provider performance issues for annual evaluations; and   (3) monitoring contract expenditures.", "CORs managing 5 of our 12 selected contracts reported that to help  address challenges presented by time constraints and the demands of  their primary positions, they often worked extended hours in order to  complete at least some of their COR duties and manage their day-to-day  responsibilities. For example, one COR responsible for managing 1 of our  selected contracts, along with 49 other contracts, said that she worked  after hours to devote a block of time to her COR work that she could not  devote during the normal work day due to the responsibilities of her  primary position. In addition, a few CORs also stated that they believe  COR duties should be a separate, stand-alone, full-time position rather  than a collateral duty to ensure that the monitoring of clinical contractors  and other COR duties receives full attention.", "COs responsible for managing the 12 selected contracts echoed what  CORs told us about the heavy workloads and monitoring challenges  CORs face. However, none of the COs responsible for the 12 contracts  we reviewed directly participate in the monitoring of contract providers\u2019  performance, and all have delegated this responsibility directly to the  COR for each clinical contract. Most of the 10 COs responsible for our 12  selected clinical contracts told us that they also rely on the CORs to  identify performance issues with contract providers. The majority of these  COs recognized that CORs face competing demands and heavy  workloads that may prevent them from effectively monitoring contract  providers\u2019 performance. Specifically, 7 of the 10 COs responsible for the  12 selected contracts in our review reported that primary position duties  and COR duties combined resulted in heavy workloads for CORs. As a  result, these COs noted that CORs often do not have enough time to  devote to their COR duties. Half of the COs responsible for the 12  selected contracts expressed that the COR responsibility should be a full- time, stand-alone position.", "We found that VA\u2019s current guidance related to COR responsibilities does  not include any information on how VAMCs are to determine the  feasibility of whether a COR\u2019s workload\u2014including both COR and primary  position responsibilities\u2014will allow them to carry out their tasks as CORs  for monitoring contract provider performance. The COR standard  operating procedure also does not provide any guidance for determining  when COR duties should be assigned as a collateral duty or a full-time  responsibility. Without clear guidance on how to determine a COR\u2019s  workload, VAMCs can unintentionally assign COR duties to a staff  member who does not have the time available to properly monitor clinical  contractors.", "If CORs\u2019 workloads prevent proper monitoring of clinical contracts, VA  risks missing the opportunity to proactively identify and correct  performance issues with contract providers and to recognize patient  safety concerns potentially resulting from contract providers\u2019 actions. By  failing to identify performance concerns with contract providers, VA could  unknowingly be receiving sub-standard service from these contractors,  continue to receive services from these contract providers that do not  meet the needs of the VAMCs, and risk patient safety problems when  these contracts are extended for additional years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Training Does Not Adequately Prepare CORs to Monitor Contract Providers\u2019 Performance", "paragraphs": ["CORs from the four VAMCs we visited noted weaknesses in VA\u2019s COR  training courses and our own analysis of these courses confirmed these  limitations.

In addition,  CORs for 8 of the 12 contracts we reviewed did not find the required COR  training helpful or applicable to VA clinical contracting. Several of the  CORs monitoring the 12 selected contracts and CORs managing other  contracts at the four VAMCs we visited stated that VA\u2019s required COR  training is focused on Department of Defense contracting and is not  tailored to CORs managing clinical contracts at VA. For example, one  COR stated that the training covered very broad areas of contracts and  did not include specific information on which kinds of contracts need  detailed quality assurance plans or information on how to manage a  clinical contract rather than a supply contract. In addition, a few CORs  stated that the instructors for their training courses had limited knowledge  of clinical contracting.", "VA requires CORs to complete training courses to obtain the Federal  Acquisition Certification (FAC) for CORs or FAC-COR. are developed and offered by VA\u2019s Acquisition Academy and can be  taken both in person and through instructor-led, web-based courses.

Specifically, the FAC-COR Level I certification is an   8-hour training and does not require previous experience as a COR, the FAC-COR Level  II certification is 40 hours of training (Level I combined with an additional 32 hours of  training) and requires 1 year of previous experience serving as a COR, and the FAC-COR  Level III certification is 60 hours of training and requires 2 years of previous experience  serving as a COR. equipment purchase, and soup contents and production. There were  no examples focused on how to evaluate or measure the quality of  services provided by a contract provider in a VAMC clinical setting. By  focusing on the types of examples in the course content, CORs did  not have the opportunity to learn and practice the skills necessary for  developing and managing service contracts that do not focus on  easily quantifiable elements and involve complex assessments of the  performance of clinicians.", "Included little information on monitoring responsibilities. The  course content includes limited information for CORs on post-award  monitoring responsibilities for clinical contracts and instead is heavily  weighted to discussing the pre-award development of a contract. By  failing to incorporate a robust discussion of how CORs should be  monitoring contract providers in the course, VA has not provided  these critical personnel with a solid foundation for how to conduct their  responsibilities for monitoring the performance of contract providers  serving in clinical roles at VAMCs.", "To supplement the required FAC-COR Level II course, VA\u2019s Medical  Sharing Office recently developed and implemented an 8-hour training  course for CORs managing clinical contracts. However, VA does not  currently require this course be completed by all CORs managing clinical  contracts. This course covers primarily pre-award contract development  responsibilities of CORs and does not include any significant information  on the post-award monitoring responsibilities of CORs managing clinical  contracts.", "Without developing required training on clinical contract monitoring, VA  cannot ensure that all CORs are receiving adequate information on how  to carry out this critical contract management responsibility and cannot  ensure that CORs are well trained in how to monitor contract providers.  This training places VA at risk of having CORs miss performance  weaknesses by clinical contractors that could affect patient safety, and  extending clinical contracts for contract providers who do not help VAMCs  effectively meet their clinical staffing needs or provide high-quality care to  veterans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Central Office Oversight of VAMC Clinical Contract Monitoring is Limited", "paragraphs": ["VA has not established a robust method for overseeing the monitoring of  clinical contractors by COs and CORs throughout VA\u2019s health care  system.

VA officials told us that, while the Procurement Operations Office sets  a goal to review COR files from two network contracting offices each  month, since implementing the program in March 2013 these reviews  have been completed in only four network contracting offices and  none of these four offices have received feedback on the outcomes of  these reviews as of August 2013. Officials added that this limited  review schedule is due to only one Procurement Operations Office  staff member being assigned to complete these reviews. These  reviews also have a narrow focus on the completeness of COR files  because the Procurement Operations Office staff member reviewing  the files relies on a checklist to verify the presence or absence of  required documentation of COR monitoring activities and does not  review the quality of information contained within CORs records.", "The limited review schedule and narrow focus on file completeness do  not allow the Procurement Operations Office to comprehensively assess  the monitoring activities of COs and CORs throughout VA\u2019s health care  system, as recommended by federal internal control standards.

Contract providers allow  VAMCs and CBOCs to supplement the capacity of VA-employed  providers and the ability to provide additional services at these VA  facilities. However, VA must maintain robust monitoring of these contract  providers to ensure they provide high quality care to veterans and fulfill  the responsibilities of their contracts. We identified weaknesses in four  areas that limit VA\u2019s ability to effectively monitor clinical contractors and  provide support to VAMC-based CORs and contracting officials  responsible for conducting these critical reviews.", "First, the lack of available tools such as templates for common types of  clinical contracts requires COs and CORs to rely on less consistent  sources for constructing critical performance requirements in clinical  contracts. As a result, most clinical contracts we reviewed were  insufficiently detailed in their descriptions of contract providers\u2019  performance requirements and these performance requirements were not  consistently applied throughout our sample of clinical contracts. Without  making tools such as templates available to COs and CORs, VA cannot  ensure that all clinical contracts include performance requirements in key  categories necessary to VA\u2019s operations and patient care, such as  credentialing and privileging and medical record documentation.", "Second, VA lacks guidance for COs and CORs that defines the types of  performance standards and key elements of performance expected to be  included in clinical contracts. Without access to this type of guidance, VA  cannot ensure that contracting officials have the ability to establish clear  and measurable performance standards. Consistency in performance  measurement and attention to key elements\u2014including clearly stating  performance standards, and ensuring these performance standards can  be accurately and consistently measured\u2014is critical to VA\u2019s efforts to  ensure that all contract providers are monitored appropriately and can be  held accountable for providing quality patient care.", "Third, two significant challenges CORs face in the monitoring of clinical  contracts\u2014COR workload and training\u2014if left unresolved, will likely have  continuing negative impacts on the quality of the monitoring that CORs  are able to perform. Better guidance to VAMCs on how to determine an  appropriate COR workload would allow CORs to fulfill key functions  required to effectively monitor clinical contractors\u2019 performance. Currently,  VA guidance is silent on how to determine whether or not a potential COR  has the time to take on the critical responsibilities of monitoring contract  providers. With the current practice of assigning COR duties to VAMC  staff as a collateral duty, it is critical that VA define how VAMC staff  should allocate COR duties to ensure that contracts are monitored  effectively. In addition, CORs are receiving insufficient training to prepare  them for monitoring clinical contracts. Currently, CORs for clinical  contracts cannot apply the current training to their duties because it  focuses on purchasing supplies rather than on acquiring clinical care  services. While VA has undertaken efforts to provide supplemental  training to CORs on clinical contracts, this additional training fails to  address how CORs should monitor clinical contracts and instead focuses  on the development of contracts. Without ensuring that COR training  addresses all of the critical monitoring functions CORs perform, VA  cannot ensure that all CORs are approaching this role with adequate  preparation and skills and VA risks failing to identify weaknesses in  contract providers\u2019 performance that could affect patient safety.", "Finally, VA Central Office currently provides limited oversight of clinical  contract monitoring activities. Without a robust monitoring program that  includes involvement from VA Central Office, VA does not have  reasonable assurance that all CORs in VAMCs throughout VA\u2019s health  care system are properly monitoring clinical contractors and is missing  the opportunity to identify system-wide limitations in the monitoring of  these critical contract providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the monitoring and oversight of clinical contracts, we  recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take the following five actions:", "Develop and disseminate tools, such as standard templates, for the  most common types of clinical contracts in VA\u2019s health care system.
