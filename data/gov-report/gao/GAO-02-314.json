The use of an enterprise  architecture, which describes an organization\u2019s mode of operation in  useful models, diagrams, and narrative, is required by the OMB guidance  that implements the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and is a commercial best  practice. Such a \u201cblueprint\u201d can help clarify and optimize the  dependencies and relationships among an agency\u2019s business operations  and the IT infrastructure and applications supporting them.

At the same time, the agency has separately begun other  initiatives to improve its investment management processes, but these  initiatives are not aligned with the established milestones or with each  other. The DLA CIO characterizes the agency\u2019s approach to its various  process improvement efforts as a necessary progression that includes  some inevitable \u201ctrial and error\u201d as it moves toward a complete process  improvement plan.", "Without such a plan that allows the agency to systematically prioritize,  sequence, and evaluate improvement efforts, DLA jeopardizes its ability to  establish a mature investment process that includes selection and control  capabilities that result in greater certainty about future IT investment  outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Until recently, IT investment management has not been an area of DLA  management attention and focus. As a result, DLA currently finds itself  without some of the capabilities that it needs to ensure that its mix of IT  investments best meets the agency\u2019s mission and business priorities. To its  credit, DLA now recognizes the need to strengthen its IT investment  management and has taken positive steps to begin doing so. However,  several critical IT investment management capabilities need to be  enhanced before DLA can have reasonable assurance that it is maximizing  the value of its IT investment dollar and minimizing the associated risks.  Moreover, DLA does not yet have a process improvement plan that is  endorsed and supported by agency leadership. The absence of such a plan  limits DLA\u2019s prospects for introducing the management capabilities  necessary for making prudent decisions that maximize the benefits and  minimize the risks of its IT investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen DLA\u2019s investment management capability and address the  weaknesses discussed in this report, we recommend that the secretary of  defense direct the DLA director to designate the development and  implementation of effective IT investment management processes as an  agencywide priority.", "Further, we recommend that the secretary of defense have the DLA  director do the following:", "Develop a plan, within 6 months, for implementing IT investment  management process improvements that is based on GAO\u2019s ITIM stage 2  and 3 critical processes.", "Ensure that the plan specifies measurable goals and time frames, defines a  management structure for directing and controlling the improvements, and  establishes review milestones.", "Ensure that the plan focuses first on correcting the weakness in the ITIM  stage 2 critical processes, because these processes collectively provide the  foundation for building a mature IT investment management process.  Specifically:", "Develop and issue guidance covering the scope and operations of  DLA\u2019s investment review boards. Such guidance should include, at a  minimum, specific definitions of the roles and responsibilities within  the IT investment process; an outline of the significant events and  decision points within the processes; an identification of the external  and environmental factors that will influence the processes (for  example, legal constraints, the behavior of key suppliers or customers,  or industry norms), and the manner in which IT investment-related  processes will be coordinated with other organization plans and  processes.", "Develop and issue policies and procedures for maintaining DLA\u2019s IT  projects inventory for investment management purposes.", "Finalize and issue policies and procedures (including the use of  information from the IT systems and project inventory) for the PEO  Review Board\u2019s oversight of IT projects.", "Develop and issue similar policies and procedures for the other  investment boards.", "Finalize and issue guidance supporting the identification of business  needs and implementing management controls to ensure that proposals  submitted to DLA for review clearly identify and define business  requirements.", "Develop and issue guidance for the proposal selection process in such  a way that the criteria for selection are clearly set forth, including  formally assigning responsibility for managing the proposal selection  process and establishing management controls to ensure that the  proposal selection process is working effectively.", "Ensure that the plan next focuses on stage 3 critical processes, which are  necessary for portfolio management, because along with the stage 2  foundational processes, these processes are necessary for effective  management of IT investments.

We do not agree. As stated in our report, to effectively  manage IT investments an agency should (1) have basic, project-level  control and selection practices in place (stage 2 processes) and  (2) manage its projects as a portfolio of investments (stage 3 processes).  Although DLA has executed most of the key practices associated with  stage 2 processes, the agency acknowledges that it has not implemented  any of the stage 3 processes. Therefore, our caption as written describes  DLA\u2019s IT investment management capabilities appropriately.", "In addition, DOD recommended that we change the caption \u201cDLA Lacks a  Plan to Guide Improvement Efforts\u201d to \u201cDLA Lacks a Published Plan to  Guide Improvement Efforts.\u201d DOD stated that this change is needed  because DLA has developed some elements of an implementation plan. We  do not agree. Our point is that DLA did not have a complete process  improvement plan, not that it has yet to publish the plan that it has. As we  describe in the report, a complete plan should, at a minimum, (1) be based  on a full assessment of process strengths and weaknesses, (2) specify  measurable goals, objectives, milestones, and needed resources,  (3) clearly assign responsibility and accountability for accomplishing well- defined tasks, and (4) be documented and approved by agency leadership.", "In contrast, DLA\u2019s planning document was based on a preliminary  assessment of only stage 2 critical processes and lacked several of the  critical attributes listed above. Moreover, DOD stated in its comments that  DLA has not completed a formally documented and prioritized  implementation plan to resolve stage 2 and 3 practice weaknesses and has  yet to complete the self-assessment and gap analysis necessary to define  planned action items.
