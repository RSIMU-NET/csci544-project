Another key deficiency in the compilation and reporting process for the CFS was the failure of the Department of the Treasury's process for compiling the CFS to directly link information from federal agencies' audited financial statements to amounts reported in the CFS. Without this direct link, the information in the CFS may not be reliable. The lack of a direct link also affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the CFS audit. Treasury is designing a new compilation process that it expects to directly link this information beginning with the fiscal year 2004 CFS.

Specifically, we have reported that the federal government did not have  adequate systems, controls, and procedures to properly prepare its  consolidated financial statements.  Many of these weaknesses in internal  control that contributed to our disclaimer of opinion were identified during  the audit of federal agencies\u2019 financial statements by the agency financial  statement auditors and reported in detail with recommendations to the  agencies in separate reports.  However, some of the internal control  weaknesses were identified during our tests of the U.S. Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) process for preparing the CFS.  Such weaknesses impaired the federal government\u2019s ability to fully ensure that the CFS is  consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements,  properly balanced, and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles.

Because the net operating cost amount includes this plug, which  does not correspond to any budget activity, the $17.1 billion should have  been included as a reconciling item in the reconciliation statement, but it  was not.

Although these activities accounted for  a net increase of $20.4 billion, the balance sheet reflected a smaller net  increase, $18 billion; Treasury was unable to explain the remaining  $2.4 billion of the net change.  In addition, while we found that the source  of the line item \u201cprincipal repayments of precredit reform loans\u201d that is  reported on the reconciliation statement was from STAR, Treasury was  unable to link this amount of $8.2 billion to any related agency financial  statements or the consolidated Balance Sheet and related notes.", "Lastly, Treasury did not establish a reporting materiality threshold for  purposes of collecting and reporting information in the reconciliation  statement.

However, Treasury and OMB disagreed with our  recommendations related to unreconciled transactions affecting net  position and the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified  Budget and Other Activities.  They also stated that they would consider the  other recommendations in our report as they continue the design and  implementation of the new process for preparing the CFS.", "On the first matter, Treasury and OMB disagreed with our proposed  recommendation that federal agencies submit to Treasury an analysis of  their net position that separates intragovernmental and public transactions.  The purpose of this recommendation was to help Treasury understand and  control the U.S. government\u2019s net position, as well as to eliminate the plugs  associated with compiling the CFS.  In response to our draft report,  Treasury and OMB stated that Treasury had decided not to require agencies  to split net position between intragovernmental and public transactions as  Treasury had originally planned and reported in its CFS Improvement  Project Report because it was unable to develop a procedure that agencies  could use to provide this split.  In addition, Treasury and OMB stated that  this split would not identify certain items known to affect the unreconciled  net position transactions.  However, because Treasury has not identified  and quantified all the components of the unreconciled transactions, a  procedure is still needed that will adequately reconcile net position and  assist Treasury in identifying and eliminating the plugs needed to balance  the CFS.  Our proposed recommendation in the draft report that we  provided for comment was one option for Treasury to resolve the  uncertainties regarding the reliability of these data. We recognize there are  other ways to gain these assurances.  Therefore, we have modified our  recommendation to recommend that Treasury develop reconciliation  procedures to aid in understanding and controlling the net position  balance.", "Regarding the second matter, Treasury and OMB stated that we had  suggested that federal agency data be used to prepare receipts and outlays  used in the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and  Other Activities.  They stated that they disagree with this approach because  it would be time-consuming and costly to gather such information.  Treasury and OMB have stated that the Statement of Changes in Cash  Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities is prepared from  information derived from Treasury\u2019s Central Accounting System rather  than from agencies\u2019 financial statements.", "We were not calling for Treasury to use federal agencies\u2019 financial  statements to prepare the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from  Unified Budget and Other Activities.  Instead, we recommended that  Treasury collect certain information already reported in federal agencies\u2019  audited financial statements and develop procedures that ensure  consistency of the significant line items on the Statement of Changes in  Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities with the agency- reported information.  As we stated in our report, Treasury has expressed  the belief that the information it maintains in its system is materially  reliable.  However, federal agencies also believe their amounts are  materially reliable and their auditors have rendered unqualified audit  opinions on their financial statements.  We found unexplained material  differences between Treasury\u2019s records and some agencies\u2019 financial  statements.  We provided a schedule of these differences to Treasury and  requested explanations for the material differences.  As discussed in our  report, Treasury was unable to explain material differences, totaling $231  billion (absolute) and $166 billion (net), between the actual unified budget  net outlays reported on this statement and the net outlays reported on  selected individual federal agencies\u2019 audited Combined Statement of  Budgetary Resources.", "As stated in our report, OMB Bulletin 01-09, Form and Content of Agency  Financial Statements, states that outlays in federal agencies\u2019 Combined  Statement of Budgetary Resources should agree with the net outlays  reported in the budget of the U.S. government.  In some cases, we found  that net outlay amounts reported in federal agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements differed from the amounts included in the CFS and budget of  the U.S. government for these agencies.  For example, Treasury did not  provide us with an explanation of why its own audited Combined  Statement of Budgetary Resources reported net outlays of $479 billion for  fiscal year 2002, while the amount included in the CFS relating to net  outlays for the Department of Treasury was only $375 billion for fiscal year  2002.", "Ensuring that the significant line items on the Statement of Changes in  Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities are consistent with  agencies\u2019 audited financial statements is an important expectation. As  stated in our report, SFFAS No. 7, Accounting for Revenue and Other  Financing Sources and Concepts for Reconciling Budgetary and  Financial Accounting, requires agencies to provide an explanation for any  material differences between the information required to be disclosed  (including outlays) in their financial statements and the amounts described  as \u201cactual\u201d in the budget of the U.S. government. Also, many of the amounts  reported in the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget  and Other Activities are intended to be the same as the amounts reported in  the budget of the U.S. government. As such, we continue to believe that the  process we proposed would be the most efficient manner for Treasury, as  the preparer of the CFS, to obtain the necessary assurance on the  significant amounts reported in the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance  from Unified Budget and Other Activities.", "Treasury and OMB also suggested that we not address the  recommendations in our report related to management representation  letter and legal representation letter issues to Treasury.  Generally accepted  auditing standards require Treasury and OMB to provide us, as their  auditor, a management representation letter for the CFS, and their letter  depends on the information within agencies\u2019 management representation  letters.  However, we found that Treasury and OMB did not have policies or  procedures to adequately review and analyze federal agencies\u2019  management representation letters.  As such, we continue to believe that  both Treasury and OMB need to work together to address the  recommendations we made in this area.", "In regard to legal representation letters, we identified problems with  certain agencies\u2019 letters that could weaken the accuracy and reliability of  federal agencies\u2019 financial statements and the CFS.  OMB, in its role of  providing guidance to agencies and their auditors regarding agencywide  financial statements, and Treasury, in its role as preparer of the CFS, both  play an important part in ensuring that legal representation letters provide  adequate information to enable the proper reporting of legal contingency  losses in federal financial statements.
