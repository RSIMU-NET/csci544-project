The widespread use of SSNs by both the public and private sectors and their display in public records have raised concern over how SSNs might be misused and how they should be protected. In light of this concern, GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which SSNs are visible in records made available to the public, (2) the reasons for which governments collect SSNs in records that display them to the public, and (3) the formats in which these records are stored and ways that the public gains access to them. As well as looking at public records, GAO also examined the practices of several federal agencies regarding the display of entire nine-digit SSNs on health insurance and other identification cards issued under their authority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Social Security numbers appear in any number of records exposed to public view almost everywhere in the nation, primarily at the state and local levels of government. State agencies in 41 states and the District of Columbia reported visible SSNs in at least one type of record and a few states have them in as many as 10 or more different records. SSNs are most often to be found in state and local court records and in local property ownership records, but they are also scattered throughout a variety of other government records. In general, federal agency display of SSNs in public records is prohibited under the Privacy Act of 1974. While the act does not apply to the federal courts, they have taken action in recent years to prevent public access. With regard to the SSNs maintained in public records, various state and local officials commonly reported needing them for identity verification. A few, however, said they had no use for the SSN, but that documents submitted to their offices often contained them. States also commonly reported using the SSN to facilitate the matching of information from one record to another. The federal courts largely collect SSNs when required by law to do so; however, due to privacy concerns, SSNs are not in documents that are available electronically to the public. Public records with SSNs are stored in a multiplicity of formats, but public access to them is most often limited to the inspection of individual paper copies on site or via mail by request. Few state agencies make records with SSNs available on the Internet; however, 15 to 28 percent of the nation's 3,141 counties do place them on the Internet and this could affect millions of people. Overall, GAO found that the risk of exposure for SSNs in public records at the state and local levels is highly variable and difficult for any one individual to anticipate or prevent. Another form of SSN exposure results from a government practice that does not involve public records per se. GAO found that SSNs are displayed on cards issued to millions of individuals under the authority of federal agencies for identity purposes and health benefits. This involves approximately 42 million Medicare cards, 8 million Department of Defense identification cards, as well as some insurance cards, and 7 million Veterans Affairs identification cards, which display the full nine-digit SSN. While some of these agencies are taking steps to remove the SSNs, there is no governmentwide federal policy that prohibits their display. Although we did not examine this phenomenon across all federal programs, it is clear that the lack of a broad, uniform policy allows for unnecessary exposure of personal Social Security numbers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security number (SSN) is used by federal, state, and local  government agencies for a myriad of purposes, including data sharing,  research, and the administration of programs that deliver services and  benefits to the public. In the course of public business, government  agencies create, collect, or maintain many records or documents that  contain SSNs, many of which are often made available to the public in  their entirety for inspection. These governments may also handle SSNs  that, while not exposed in public records, are nevertheless subject to  public view because they are printed on individual eligibility and  identification cards. While federal and state laws may authorize or require  the use of SSNs, there is no single federal law governing their handling by  all levels and branches of government or restricting their display to the  public. State laws also vary in regulating SSN use and exposure to public  view.", "While the use of SSNs can be extremely beneficial to the public sector,  SSNs are also a key piece of information used in identity thefts, including  creating false identities for financial misuse or for assuming another  individual\u2019s identity. The widespread use and retention of SSNs by both  the public and private sectors may provide opportunities for criminals to  easily obtain and misuse this personal information. In particular, the  availability of individuals\u2019 SSNs in public records has raised concern over  how this personal information might be misused and how it should be  protected. Historically, the general public has gained access to public  records by visiting the offices that maintain them\u2014this offered practical  limits on the volume of SSNs that could be disclosed. Today, however, the  growth in electronic record keeping and the increasing availability of such  information in volume over the Internet have heightened concern about  misuse, particularly in view of the rise in identity thefts. We previously  reported in 2002 that few government entities that display SSNs in public  records were making them available on their Web sites, but some were  considering doing so or expanding the volume and type of such posting.", "In light of the potential for increasing exposure, theft, and misuse of SSNs,  you asked us to identify common methods of storing public documents  with SSNs and to determine the extent to which the public has access to  them. To do this, we addressed three questions: (1) To what extent are  SSNs visible in records that are made available to the public? (2) For what  purpose do governments collect SSNs in records that display them to the  public? (3) How are these records stored and what methods can the public  use to access them? In addition to looking at public records, we examined  the practices of several federal executive branch agencies pertaining to the  display of SSNs on health insurance cards and other identification cards  issued under their authority.", "To answer these questions, we conducted research at federal, state, and  local levels of government. To obtain information at the federal level, we  reviewed the Privacy Act and other related statutes and conducted  personal interviews with officials of 10 federal agencies. Data gathering at  the state level included a Web-based survey to state agency heads that  oversee eight pre-selected programs or functions in all 50 states and the  District of Columbia (D.C.). In a previous GAO survey, these programs or  functions were identified as frequent users of SSNs and likely to have  public records. They included (1) human services, (2) health and vital  statistics, (3) selected professional licensing offices, (4) law enforcement,  (5) the judiciary, (6) corrections, (7) public safety, and (8) labor. At the  state level, our survey of the judiciary consisted of the office of the State  Court Administrator in each state. We also conducted a survey of various  local government officials within a probability sample of 200 counties  across the United States, allowing us to generalize to the population of U.S  counties. At the local level, we surveyed (1) courts, (2) health  departments, (3) law enforcement, (4) recording officials, (5) social  services, (6) tax assessors, and (7) voter registrars. At the local level, our  survey of the judiciary included trial courts and courts of limited  jurisdiction operating in the counties in our sample. The state survey  results are based on responses from 338 out of 542 state agencies, with  responses from all 50 states and D.C. The local government survey results  are estimated with a response rate of about 81 percent. The questions  asked in each survey are listed in appendix II. We conducted our work  between March 2003 and September 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. For additional information on  our methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Because the SSN is unique for every individual, both the public and private  sectors increasingly use it as a universal identifier. It is particularly useful  to government for data matching or identity verification to ensure that  individuals are eligible for program benefits or services. Though the use of  SSNs by government entities is often mandated or authorized by law, there  is no one law that regulates the overall use of SSNs by all levels and  branches of government, and state laws pertaining to SSN display vary in  terms of the restrictions they impose on both use and disclosure. Due to  the pervasive use of SSNs, individuals are routinely asked to disclose their  SSNs along with other personal, identifying information, for numerous  purposes. In some instances where individuals provide their SSNs to  government entities, documents containing the SSN are routinely made  available to the public for inspection.", "Generally, the overall use and disclosure of SSNs by the federal  government is restricted under the Privacy Act, which, broadly speaking,  seeks to balance the government\u2019s need to maintain information about  individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against  unwarranted invasions of their privacy.  Section 7 of Public Law 93-579  requires that any federal, state, or local government agency, when  requesting an SSN from an individual, tell individuals whether disclosing  their SSN is mandatory or voluntary, cite the statutory or other authority  under which the request is being made, and state what uses it will make of  the individual\u2019s SSN.  Based on a survey for prior work, we reported that  while nearly all government entities we surveyed collect and use SSNs for  a variety of reasons, many of these entities reported they do not provide  individuals the information required under this statute when requesting  their SSNs.  Further, it is unclear who has responsibility for overseeing  these requirements placed on state and local governments.", "The growth in the use of SSNs is important to individual SSN holders  because these numbers, along with names and birth dates, are among the  three personal identifiers most often sought by identity thieves, and recent  statistics indicate that the incidence of identity theft is growing. The  widespread disclosure of SSNs in public records has raised concern  because it can put individuals at increased risk for identity theft. The  passage of identity theft legislation by the federal government and state  governments indicates that this type of crime is widely recognized as a  serious problem. Some of these laws include limits or restrictions on the  display of SSNs, and government agencies have taken other measures to  restrict the exposure of SSNs as well. For instance, most states have  modified their policies on placing SSNs on state drivers\u2019 licenses, some  prohibit the use of SSNs as a student identification number, and others  have removed SSNs from checks and benefit statements. These actions  suggest that the risk of SSN exposure is also widely recognized.", "As governments move increasingly to electronic record keeping, access to  documents that include Social Security numbers has become easier. To  the extent that such records are available through the Internet, ease of  access can increase exponentially. The growth of electronic record  keeping has, in fact, made it easier for some agencies to provide or even  sell their data in bulk. In our previous research, a few government  agencies and courts reported to us that they were also considering the  prospect of expanding the volume and type of public records that would  be available on their Web sites. Currently, congressional lawmakers are  considering legislation to curtail such exposures, looking at both public  and private sector uses.", "Not all records held by government or public agents are \u201cpublic\u201d in terms  of their availability to any inquiring person. Governments hold many  records that are not generally available and other records that are  protected from public access. For example, adoption records are generally  sealed. Personnel records are often not readily available to the public,  although newspapers may publish the salaries of high, elected officials.  Furthermore, governments may release portions of records but protect  sensitive information within them, which includes Social Security  numbers. Treatment of similar types of records varies among federal,  state, and local governments. Furthermore, there is no common definition  of public records. For this report, however, we refer to public records as  those records generally made available to the public in their entirety for  inspection by a federal, state, or local government agency. Such  documents are typically accessed in a public reading room, clerk\u2019s office,  or on the Internet.", "In our previous review of government use of SSNs, we found that they are  prevalent in records held by government agencies, some of which were  available to the public. We also learned that courts at all three levels of  government maintain public records containing SSNs, such as divorce  decrees, child support orders, and bankruptcy cases. At that time, some  officials who maintained these records told us their primary responsibility  was to preserve the integrity of these records rather than protect the  privacy of the individual SSN holder. However, we also found that some  agencies were trying to better safeguard the SSN by using innovative  approaches, such as by modifying their processes or their forms. Some  agencies and courts also reported limiting the practice of placing public  records containing SSNs on Web sites. The most far-reaching efforts we  identified took place in states that had established statewide policies and  procedures.

In response to requests for name retrievable records  made under the Freedom of Information Act, NARA screens the records  and redacts SSNs (if the individual is not deceased) prior to public  disclosure or release. NARA also masks the SSNs of living individuals in  archival databases that NARA makes available to the public on its Internet  Web site.", "We discussed Judicial Conference policies and procedures pertaining to  privacy and SSNs with officials from the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts. They told us that the Conference has taken a number of actions in  recent years to increase privacy and reduce Internet access to SSNs that  are in federal court documents. These actions include (1) implementing a  rule for bankruptcy cases, effective December 1, 2003, that requires SSNs,  except for the last four digits, to be redacted from electronically available  (Internet) documents accessible to the public; (2) issuing a \u201cmodel local  rule\u201d for criminal cases that eliminates SSNs from documents filed with  the court, unless necessary, and includes only the last four digits of SSNs  in publicly available paper and electronic versions of such documents; and  (3) issuing privacy policy guidance for electronically available court  documents in civil cases. Citing its bankruptcy case rule and model local  rule for criminal cases, the Conference also advises attorneys for parties  filing court documents to include only the last four digits of SSNs. In its  report, the committee that developed the policy noted that there should be  \u201cconsistent, nationwide policies in federal courts in order to ensure that  similar privacy protections and access presumptions apply regardless of  which federal court is the custodian of a particular case file.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Millions of Federal Health Insurance and Identity Cards Display the SSN", "paragraphs": ["Although they are not displayed in public records en masse, we found that  millions of SSNs are still subject to exposure on individual identity cards  issued under federal auspices. Although some agencies are taking action  to address this display of the SSN, we found that, currently, an estimated  42 million Medicare cards display entire nine-digit SSNs, as do some  Department of Defense insurance cards and approximately 8 million  identification cards, as well as 7 million Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) beneficiary cards. In addition, approximately 830,000 federal  employees carry health insurance cards issued through Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program that display the bearer\u2019s full SSN.  Such cards are used at the point of service \u2013 at pharmacies, medical  offices, or merely to enter buildings \u2013 and are usually carried almost  everywhere, circulating through many hands and even photocopiers,  increasing opportunities for the card and the SSN on it to be stolen,  copied, or even lost.", "Three of four federal agencies have begun taking action to remove SSNs  from such health insurance or identification cards issued under their  auspices. In 2003, the federal Office of Personnel Management, which  handles personnel for executive branch agencies, directed all health  insurance carriers affiliated with the Federal Employee Health Benefit  Program to eliminate SSNs from insurance cards as soon as it is  operationally and financially practical. As of August 2004, about 57 percent  of these insurers were using numbers others than SSNs on their cards\u2014 this represents over 79 percent of the subscribers in the FEHBP. The  office projected that by the end of 2005 only 3.7 percent of FEHBP  subscribers will have their SSNs on their health insurance cards, as more  insurance companies have signaled their intention to replace the SSN.  Meanwhile, VA is eliminating SSNs from 7 million VA identification cards  and is replacing cards with SSNs or issuing new cards without SSNs from  2004 through 2009, until all such cards have been replaced. In 2004, the  Department of Defense (DoD) began replacing approximately 6 million  health insurance cards that display SSNs with cards that do not display the  bearer\u2019s SSN, but continues to include SSNs on approximately 8 million  military identification cards. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services (CMS), with the largest number of cards displaying the  entire nine-digit SSN, does not plan to remove the SSN from Medicare  identification cards. During 2003, CMS\u2019s Office of Financial Management,  Program Integrity Group conducted a study of identity theft issues, during  which they considered the possibility of removing SSNs from Medicare  cards. CMS officials who served on the workgroup told us that the group  had concluded that eliminating SSNs from 40 million Medicare cards  would be cost prohibitive.", "The Social Security Administration (SSA), which is the issuer of Social  Security cards (displaying the bearer\u2019s SSN), addresses this vulnerability  differently than the other agencies. SSA recommends that cards be kept in  a safe place and that a person \u201cnot carry\u201d it with them unless it is needed  \u201cto show it to an employer or service provider.\u201d In contrast, CMS  instructs Medicare participants to show the card whenever medical care is  provided, and to carry the card when traveling, but to keep the number as  safe as they would a credit card number.", "While the Social Security Administration advises individuals to avoid  exposure of their SSN card, we found no federal policy regarding its  display on identity and insurance cards. Specifically, there is no  presidential executive order, federal law, or common federal policy in  effect. Although SSA has authority to issue policies and procedures over  the Social Security cards that it issues, it does not have authority over how  other federal agencies use and display SSNs. While the Office of  Management and Budget has issued guidance for managing federal  information resources and protecting records on individuals, it has not  provided guidance for the display of SSNs on cards. Rather, the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of Personnel Management,  VA, and DoD each have their own policies for the cards issued under their  authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Today, the SSN has become a universal identifier; as such, it offers  government as well as the private sector an efficient way to verify the  identity and the qualifications of people for programs or activities ranging  from taxes to health benefits to worker\u2019s compensation payments. As a  single, unique number assigned to one person, the SSN also allows for  tracking that individual through more than one database and comparing  information for a variety of uses, including police work.", "In short, SSNs are a lynchpin to other personal information held in a  variety of records. The extent to which they are exposed to public view, of  course, increases the likelihood that they will be misused for inappropriate  mining of personal information, violation of privacy, and identity theft. The  increased use of SSNs in both the public and private sectors means that  SSNs are more widely circulated and more likely to appear in public  records that document common life events and transactions, such as  marriages and home purchases.", "The continued visibility of SSNs in public records in virtually every corner  of the country presents continued risk of widespread, albeit small-scale,  identity theft. Since the public usually obtains such records in individual  hard copies, the risk of SSN theft in large volume from public records may  be small. Indeed, a variety of government agencies and oversight bodies  appear to be taking steps to eliminate the open display of SSNs, but there  is no uniform practice or policy at the federal, state, or local level to  protect them. Such initiatives to protect the SSN may slow its misuse, but  the absence of uniform and comprehensive policy is likely to leave many  individuals vulnerable. For example, the 15 to 28 percent of counties that  we estimate post some records with SSNs on the Internet creates a broad  vulnerability that, together with the lack of uniform protections, makes it  difficult for any one individual to mitigate. In one of our previous reports,  we recommended that a representative group of federal, state, and local  officials develop a unified approach to safeguarding SSNs used in all levels  of government and particularly those displayed in public records. We still  believe such an approach would be constructive.", "On another front, there is jeopardy in the display of SSNs on identity and  eligibility cards issued under government auspices. The cardholder is  usually required to use his or her card at the point of service\u2014which  means a practical need to carry and display it often\u2014thus increasing the  likelihood for accidental loss, theft, or visual exposure. The risk this poses  has been both recognized and addressed by, among other things,  prohibitions against using SSNs as student identification numbers and  policy changes concerning use of SSNs on drivers\u2019 licenses. While we did  not examine the phenomenon of SSN display on identification cards  across all federal programs, it is clear that the lack of a broad, uniform  policy allows for inconsistent, but persistent exposure.", "To address the overall problem of exposure for the SSN, congressional  lawmakers are considering legislation that would, among other things,  curtail display of SSNs in both the private and public sectors. For its part,  the public sector has already demonstrated that it is possible, for example,  to substitute another number for the SSN on displayable cards, and link it  to actual SSNs in a protected database. Given the size of federal programs,  the lack of such safeguards across all agencies currently leaves millions of  people unprotected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To address this potential vulnerability, we recommend that the Director,  Office of Management and Budget, identify all those federal activities that  require or engage in the display of nine-digit SSNs on health insurance,  identification, or any other cards issued to federal government personnel  or program beneficiaries, and devise a governmentwide policy to ensure a  consistent approach to this type of display."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Administrative Office of the  United States Courts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the  Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records  Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of  Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, and the  Department of Veterans Affairs for comment.
