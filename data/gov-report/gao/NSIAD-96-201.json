For example, 10 U.S.C. 4543 provides nine conditions that must be present in order for certain Army industrial facilities to sell manufactured articles or services outside DOD, including the requirement that the services cannot be obtained from a private-sector source within the continental United States. Depot officials stated that it would be unusual for there not to be at least one private-sector provider for most depot activities. Also, 10 U.S.C. 2471 requires that when depot equipment and facilities are leased to a private-sector firm, reimbursements must be made to the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts rather than to the depot providing the facilities. This provision reduces the incentive for the services to enter into such arrangements. Unless these and other statutes are revised, dual use initiatives may have limited promise for significantly improving the utilization and decreasing excess capacity of Army depots."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Statutes Affect Efforts to Privatize Workloads", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, various statutory restrictions may affect the extent to which DOD depot-level workloads can be converted to private-sector performance, including 10 U.S.C. 2464, 10 U.S.C. 2466, and 10 U.S.C. 2469. Title 10 U.S.C. 2464 provides for a \u201ccore\u201d logistics capability to be identified by the Secretary of Defense and maintained by DOD unless the Secretary waives DOD performance as not required for national defense.", "Titles 10 U.S.C. 2466 and 10 U.S.C. 2469 affect the extent to which depot-level workloads can be converted to private-sector performance. Title 10 U.S.C. 2466 prohibits the use of more than 40 percent of the funds made available in a fiscal year for depot-level maintenance or repair for private sector performance: the so-called \u201c60/40\u201d rule. Title 10 U.S.C. 2469 provides that DOD-performed maintenance and repair workloads valued at not less than $3 million cannot be changed to performance by another DOD activity without the use of \u201cmerit-based selection procedures for competitions\u201d among all DOD depots and that such workloads cannot be changed to contractor performance without the use of \u201ccompetitive procedures for competitions among private and public sector entities.\u201d", "While each statute has some impact on the allocation of DOD\u2019s depot-level workload, 10 U.S.C. 2469 is the primary impediment to privatization without a public-private competition. The competition requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469 have broad application to all changes to the depot-level workload valued at not less than $3 million currently performed at DOD installations, including the Army depots at Red River and Letterkenny. The statute does not provide any exemptions from its competition requirements and, unlike most of the other laws governing depot maintenance, does not contain a waiver provision. Further, there is nothing in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990\u2014the authority for the BRAC recommendations\u2014that, in our view, would permit the implementation of a recommendation involving privatization outside the competition requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469.", "The determination of whether any single conversion to private-sector performance conforms to the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469 depends upon the facts applicable to the particular conversion. DOD has not yet finalized its privatization plans for either the Letterkenny or Red River depot nor, as of the date of this report, has DOD informed us how it plans to comply with the statutory restrictions in these proposed conversions. It is unclear whether the planned conversions will comply with the requirements of existing law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to take the following actions.", "Develop required capability in military depots to sustain core depot repair and maintenance capability for Army systems and conduct and adequately document a risk assessment for mission essential workloads being considered for privatization.", "Use competitive procedures, where applicable, to assure the cost-effectiveness of privatizing Army depot maintenance workloads.", "Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of consolidating all of the Letterkenny tactical missile workload at the Tobyhanna depot, including an assessment of the fixed cost savings impact on the workload currently maintained at Tobyhanna.", "Assess alternatives for reducing the costs of operating the Red River depot, given the extensive excess capacity that will remain at that facility after implementation of the 1995 BRAC recommendations.", "Complete cost analyses of the Army\u2019s proposed privatization initiatives, including the Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicle and wheeled vehicle and troop support equipment maintenance workloads from Red River. In comparing the cost and benefits of consolidating these workloads at other DOD depots with privatizing, the analyses should include the impact on recurring cost of existing workloads at the depots that would receive the workloads.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense review the results of the Army\u2019s cost analysis for tactical missile maintenance to determine the most cost-effective course of action. If the consolidation option is determined to be the most cost-effective, the Secretary should reassess the Army\u2019s interpretation of the BRAC recommendation and (1) if the reassessment determines that the consolidation is consistent with the BRAC recommendation to consolidate the entire tactical missile workload, except for disassembly and storage at Tobyhanna, DOD should do so or (2) if the reassessment determines that such a transfer is not consistent with the BRAC recommendation, DOD should seek redirection from Congress to accomplish this action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting orally on our draft report, DOD officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations regarding the Army\u2019s plans to privatize depot maintenance. They stated that the Army\u2019s plans were tentative and contingent on congressional relief from requirements of title 10, most notably, the 60/40 rule and the requirement for public-private competitions before privatizing depot workloads that exceed $3 million. They pointed out that the Army\u2019s plans are being revised because Congress did not repeal or modify these statutes. They said that in revising these plans, DOD and the Army intend to meet the requirements of existing statutes governing DOD\u2019s depot-level maintenance operations. They did not specify how the plans would meet the requirements.", "DOD officials also noted that the BRAC 1995 recommendation regarding Letterkenny did not provide for the transfer of all the missile maintenance mission work to the Tobyhanna depot or the private sector\u2014only the missile guidance work\u2014which they estimate to represent about 14 percent of the missile maintenance workload. Officials stated that the combination of the BRAC 1993 recommendation to consolidate tactical missile maintenance at the Letterkenny depot with the BRAC 1995 recommendation to transfer or privatize only the missile guidance workload precludes the Army from consolidating all missile depot maintenance workload at Tobyhanna. Accordingly, they believe there is no need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an option that the Army cannot implement.", "In our view, the BRAC recommendation is sufficiently imprecise to support a variety of interpretations to include the Army\u2019s proposal, as well as the consolidation of all tactical missile depot maintenance at Tobyhanna. Notwithstanding this point, there is nothing that precludes the Army from assessing the cost-effectiveness of the various alternatives, whether they are implemented or not. Consequently, we have modified the recommendation in our draft report and are now recommending that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to make such a cost analysis. In addition, we are recommending that the Secretary of Defense review the Army\u2019s cost analysis to determine the most cost-effective course of action and if necessary seek redirection from Congress to implement the most cost-effective action.", "Our review indicated that consolidation of the missile workload at Tobyhanna and elimination of depot maintenance activities at Letterkenny, with the exception of conventional ammunition storage and tactical missile disassembly and storage, would offer the Army a more cost-effective alternative than retaining the excess capacity at both underutilized depots. The continuation of depot maintenance work at Letterkenny, whether as a government-owned and operated maintenance depot or as a privatized operation, is not likely to achieve the savings that could be achieved through the closure of facilities and the elimination of overhead at one activity. We also believe that given the potential opportunities to reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs by consolidating the missile workload at Tobyhanna, DOD should further evaluate this option before the Army proceeds with a less cost-effective option.", "In other comments, DOD officials suggested that maximum potential capacity not be used to measure unused capacity at Army depots because it (1) is not equivalent to the current industrial capacity of a depot, (2) includes building space that lacks plant equipment, and (3) is useful only for determining if additional work can be accomplished in existing space with the transfer or purchase of equipment. They said that the use of maximum potential capacity inflates the excess problem at the depots. We believe that maximum potential capacity is an acceptable benchmark for measuring capacity utilization and cost impact of underutilized facilities. The services developed, certified, and submitted such data for use in the BRAC 1995 process. We believe this capacity measure is a conservative projection of excess capacity, since it is based on a 5-day, one 8-hour shift operation, while private sector industrial use is frequently 2 or 2-1/2 shifts. Further, other DOD measures of capacity are constrained by numbers of available personnel and provide little indication of potential capacity available through more cost-effective use of industrial facilities and equipment. Maximum potential capacity provides a reasonable basis for analyzing the potential capacity available for workload consolidation.", "DOD officials also noted that the Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicle workload cannot continue at the Letterkenny depot in a government facility after the year 2001 because the 1995 BRAC Commission directed this mission be realigned to the Anniston depot. We recognize that the BRAC 1995 recommendation for Paladin depot maintenance workload was to move it to Anniston, but delaying transfer until the year 2001 could increase the cost of overall depot maintenance operations and decrease the savings expected to be derived from workload consolidation.", "Based on other DOD oral comments, we made technical changes to the draft report for clarification of several points."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In conducting our work, we obtained documents from and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.; Army headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Army Materiel Command and Army Audit Agency, Alexandria, Virginia; Industrial Operations Command, Rock Island, Illinois; and Anniston, Letterkenny, Red River, and Tobyhanna Army Depots. While at these depots, we discussed programs that involved partnering and other joint ventures with depot officials and reviewed pertinent documentation on the planned use and the results of these programs. We did not evaluate the merits of these programs because they generally were small in number and relatively new. In addition, whenever possible, we relied on information previously gathered as part of our prior reviews of DOD\u2019s depot maintenance operations.", "To evaluate the impact on excess capacity, we compared maximum potential capacity and programmed workload forecasts data, as certified to the Joint Cross Service Group for Depot Maintenance prior to the 1995 BRAC round. We determined current excess capacity percentages based on a comparison of maximum potential capacity and workload forecasts for fiscal year 1996. To assess the impact of planned workload reallocations, we compared maximum potential capacity to workload forecasts for fiscal year 1999, adjusting for (1) capacity that the Army plans to transfer to the Red River and Letterkenny depot communities, (2) planned reallocation of programmed workloads from the Letterkenny and Red River depots to the Anniston depot, and (3) planned privatization of Letterkenny and Red River workloads.", "To determine the impact of workload reallocation plans on operating costs for combat vehicles maintenance, we reviewed an economic analysis that the Army Materiel Command had prepared and a draft audit report of the analysis that the Army Audit Agency had prepared. To determine the impact of workload reallocation plans on future operating rates for electronic type items, we asked officials at the Tobyhanna depot to compute operating costs based on the their pre-BRAC workload forecasts and supplemented by possible transfers of 1.5 million direct labor hours of tactical missile workload from the Letterkenny depot and 1.2 million hours of ground communications and electronics workload from the Sacramento Air Logistics Center.", "To determine the cost-effectiveness of the Army\u2019s planned privatization plans, we held discussions with responsible Army officials and reviewed available documentation from the Army Materiel Command and its Industrial Operations Command. We could not fully evaluate these plans because the Army had not completed its analyses of all the privatization initiatives. Given that our analysis was constrained by the preliminary nature of some Army plans and the absence of some cost data, our analysis is based on assumptions that may change as better data become available.", "For DOD compliance with statutory requirements, we identified the applicable requirements and determined their impact on DOD\u2019s plans to privatize depot-level maintenance workloads.", "We conducted our review between February 1996 and July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this letter to the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, and the Air Force; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and interested congressional committees.
