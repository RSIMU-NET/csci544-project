Three U.S. agencies--the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD)--support programs aimed at building this broader capacity to detect a variety of infectious diseases. This testimony describes (1) the obligations, goals, and activities of these programs and (2) the U.S. agencies' monitoring of the programs' progress. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed budgets and other funding documents, examined strategic plans and program monitoring and progress reports, and interviewed U.S. agency officials. GAO did not review capacity-building efforts in programs that focus on specific diseases, namely polio, tuberculosis, malaria, avian influenza, or HIV/AIDS. This testimony is based on a report (GAO-07-1186), which is being released with this testimoy. GAO did not make recommendations. The agencies whose programs we describe reviewed our report and generally concurred with our findings.

In fiscal years 2004-2006, U.S. agencies obligated approximately $84 million for these programs, which operate in developing countries around the world. Global Disease Detection is CDC's main effort to help build capacity for infectious disease surveillance in developing countries. The Field Epidemiology Training Programs, which CDC and USAID support, are another tool used to help build infectious disease surveillance capacity worldwide. Additionally, USAID supports CDC and the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Africa in designing and implementing Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in 46 countries in Africa, with additional technical assistance to 8 African countries. DOD's Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System also contributes to capacity building through projects undertaken at DOD overseas research laboratories. USAID supports additional capacity-building projects in various developing countries. For each of the four key surveillance capacity-building programs, the U.S. agencies monitor activities such as the number of epidemiologists trained, the number of outbreak investigations conducted, and types of laboratory training completed. In addition, CDC and USAID recently began systematic efforts to evaluate the impact of their programs; however, because no evaluations had been completed as of July 2007, it is too early to assess whether these evaluation efforts will demonstrate progress in building surveillance capacity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for this opportunity to discuss GAO\u2019s recent work on U.S.  efforts to strengthen international surveillance of infectious diseases.", "Infectious diseases are a leading cause of deaths worldwide and represent  the third most common cause of death in the United States. As the recent  outbreaks and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  and avian influenza have shown, disease outbreaks pose a threat beyond  the borders of the country where they originate. The United States thus  has a clear interest in building capacity abroad to identify and respond to  outbreaks of infectious disease. Effective disease surveillance systems in  other countries contribute to lower morbidity and mortality rates and  improved public health outcomes, both in those countries and elsewhere  in the world.", "Earlier efforts to improve surveillance worldwide focused on individual  diseases, beginning with global influenza surveillance in the 1940s and  followed by surveillance systems for smallpox and polio, among others. In  the mid-1990s, recognizing the threat posed by previously unknown  infectious diseases, the United States and other countries initiated a  broader effort to ensure that countries can detect any disease outbreak  that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern.  Three U.S. agencies\u2014the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense  (DOD)\u2014have programs aimed at building this broader capacity to detect a  variety of infectious diseases.", "Today I will describe U.S. efforts to build developing countries\u2019 broader  capacity for infectious disease surveillance, specifically: (1) the  obligations, goals, and activities of key U.S. programs to develop  epidemiology and laboratory capacity and (2) U.S. agencies\u2019 monitoring of  the progress achieved by these programs. My statement\u2014based on our  report released today\u2014does not address U.S. efforts to build international  capacity for surveillance of specific diseases, namely polio, tuberculosis,  malaria, HIV/AIDS, or avian influenza. However, we recently issued  reports on domestic preparedness for avian influenza outbreaks and on  international efforts to prevent pandemic influenza. In addition, we are  beginning to examine, at the subcommittee\u2019s request, U.S. capacity to  protect against naturally or intentionally introduced outbreaks of zoonotic  diseases as well as lessons that can be learned from previous outbreaks in  other countries.", "For our September 2007 report, we reviewed annual budgets, grants, and  project funding for four infectious disease surveillance programs\u2014Global  Disease Detection (GDD), Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP),  Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), and Global  Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS)\u2014and  examined U.S. agencies\u2019 budget, planning, and reporting documents. In  addition, we interviewed U.S. and World Health Organization (WHO)  officials responsible for implementing capacity-building activities. We  determined that the budget and performance data that we obtained had  some limitations but were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We did  not make recommendations in our report. We conducted our work from  October 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "DOD, HHS, and USAID provided written comments on a draft of our  September 2007 report, generally concurring with our findings. DOD  provided information to clarify the extent of GEIS\u2019s global involvement,  goals, and priorities. HHS provided additional information regarding GDD  operations, noting that the GDD centers bring together CDC\u2019s existing  international expertise in public health surveillance, training, and  laboratory methods. Additionally, HHS indicated that disease-specific  programs contribute to building surveillance capacity. USAID\u2019s comments  also focused mainly on the support it provides to disease-specific and  other activities that contribute to building surveillance capacity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic growth in the volume and speed of international travel and trade  in recent years have increased opportunities for diseases to spread across  international boundaries with the potential for significant health and  economic implications. International disease control efforts are further  complicated by, for instance, the emergence of previously unknown  zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever and avian influenza.", "Surveillance provides essential information for action against infectious  disease threats. Basic surveillance involves four functions: (1) detection,  (2) interpretation, (3) response, and (4) prevention. (See fig. 1.)", "Global efforts to improve disease surveillance have historically focused on  specific diseases or groups of diseases. For example, as we reported in  2001, the international community has set up surveillance systems for  smallpox, polio, influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among  others, with the goal of eradicating (in the case of smallpox and polio) or  controlling these diseases. In 2006, the United States adopted a national  strategy to prepare for pandemic influenza outbreaks both domestically  and internationally, which included planned funding by U.S. agencies to  support influenza surveillance and detection. Such disease-specific  efforts can build capacity for surveillance of additional diseases as well.", "The United States acknowledged the need to improve global surveillance  and response for emerging infectious diseases in 1996, when the President  determined that the national and international system of infectious disease  surveillance, prevention, and response was inadequate to protect the  health of U.S. citizens. Addressing these shortcomings, the 1996  Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-7 enumerated the roles of U.S.  agencies\u2014including CDC, USAID, and DOD\u2014in contributing to global  infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and response.", "Enhancing capacity for detecting and responding to emerging infectious  disease outbreaks is also a key focus of the revised International Health  Regulations (IHR). For many years, the IHR required reporting of three  diseases\u2014cholera, plague, and yellow fever\u2014and delineated measures  that countries could take to protect themselves against outbreaks of these  diseases. In May 2005, the members of WHO revised the IHR, committing  themselves to developing core capacities for detecting, investigating, and  responding to other diseases of international importance, including  outbreaks that have the potential to spread. The regulations entered into  force in June 2007; member states are required to assess their national  capacities by 2009 and comply with the revised IHR by 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four U.S.\u2013funded Programs Help Build Capacity for Overseas Infectious Disease Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies operate or support four key programs aimed at building  overseas surveillance capacity for infectious diseases: Global Disease  Detection (GDD), operated by CDC; Field Epidemiology Training  Programs (FETP), supported by CDC and USAID; Integrated Disease  Surveillance and Response (IDSR), supported by CDC and USAID; and  Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS),  operated by DOD.

Two GDD  centers were established in Kenya and Thailand in 2004, and three centers  are currently under development in Egypt, China, and Guatemala. In  addition, CDC established a GDD Operations Center in Atlanta to  coordinate information related to potential outbreaks.", "According to CDC officials, GDD capacity-building activities consist of  strengthening laboratories, providing epidemiology training, and  conducting surveillance activities. CDC aims to establish laboratories with  advanced diagnostic capacity\u2014for example, in Kenya, CDC established  several laboratories with biosafety levels 2 and 3. GDD centers conduct  formal, 2-year training programs in analyzing epidemiological data,  responding to outbreaks, and working on research projects. The centers  also conduct short-term training\u2014for example, in 2006, GDD centers  trained more than 230 participants from 32 countries to respond to  pandemics.
