These four agencies have also developed guidance, training, and other tools for managers to use in adapting to climate change. For example, the National Park Service is developing guidance for park-based climate change adaptation plans that includes steps such as identifying conservation targets and conducting vulnerability assessments. The Bureau of Land Management has not established a strategic direction for addressing climate change impacts but is planning to develop a high-level climate change adaptation strategy by the end of the summer 2013. In addition, GAO visited one field location within each agency and found that managers at four of the five locations have taken steps to address climate change adaptation. For example:", "Chugach National Forest managers have begun an assessment of the vulnerability to climate change of key resources to help set priorities and identify adaptation actions.

For example,  insect pests are economically important stressors on forest ecosystems in  the United States. Coupled with pathogens, they account for $1.5 billion  in damage every year, according to the study. Changes in climate have  contributed to major insect pest outbreaks in the United States over the  past several decades because rising temperatures increase insect  outbreaks in a number of ways, according to the study. For example,  longer and warmer seasons allow some insects to develop faster,  sometimes completing two life cycles instead of one in a single growing  season, and warmer conditions also help expand the ranges of some  insects. In addition, recreation and tourism are important to the economy  and the quality of life for many people. In many communities, according to  the study, recreation and tourism generate billions of dollars for regional  economies through activities such as fishing, hunting, skiing, hiking, and  diving and some of these economic benefits could be reduced or lost as a  result of the impacts from climate change.", "Precisely how and to what extent changes in the climate will affect  particular federal lands and waters in the future is uncertain, but climate- related changes have already been observed on federally managed lands  and waters.

The framework also stated that  management strategies based on historical or current conditions will need  to be adjusted or replaced with approaches that support adaptation to  changing conditions brought about by climate change. According to the  framework, Forest Service natural resource managers will use current  science to better understand and predict the impacts of climate change  on natural resources, including plant and animal species. The agency will  also use an iterative approach, according to the framework, meaning that  natural resource managers are to modify their management actions, if  needed, as new scientific information emerges. They also are to  collaborate with partners\u2014including private landowners and tribal  entities\u2014to share technical expertise and coordinate management  actions across land ownership boundaries to more effectively address  adaptation.", "In February 2011, the Forest Service published a document, known as  \u201cthe roadmap,\u201d which identified actions that natural resource managers in  national forests were already taking or could take to implement the  strategic direction outlined in the agency\u2019s strategic framework.  According to the roadmap, ongoing actions that agency natural resource  managers were already taking include collaborating with scientists to  assess the vulnerability of key species to climate change and re- vegetating ecosystems that had been affected by fire or other major  disturbances with plant species that are better adapted to current and  future climates. Actions that natural resource managers could begin  taking in the short term, according to the roadmap, include collaborating  with partners to develop strategies for creating and protecting connected  habitat by, for example, establishing corridors across private lands to  allow species affected by climate change to migrate to landscapes to  which they are better adapted. Longer-term actions include developing  comprehensive strategies for maintaining and restoring the connectivity of  habitats.", "The Forest Service has also established a performance goal for national  forests. In 2011, the Forest Service informed national forest managers  that by 2015 they are expected to address at least one of the following  three areas related to climate change adaptation: (1) assessing the  vulnerability of key resources\u2014such as the availability of clean and  abundant drinking water from national forest watersheds\u2014to the impacts  of climate change, (2) reducing the vulnerability of key resources to  climate change, and (3) monitoring and evaluating climate change  impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation activities. To help track  progress in achieving the goal, the Forest Service also directed each  national forest to report annually on its status, plans, and actions for  assessing vulnerabilities, reducing vulnerabilities, and monitoring and  evaluating effectiveness. The agency also published guidance in 2011 to  assist the national forests in preparing their annual reports, which are  referred to as climate change performance scorecard reports. For  example, regarding monitoring, the guidance provided examples of  current national monitoring programs that could be used to track climate  change impacts, as well as instructions on where to find additional  information about such programs.", "In addition, the agency has taken other steps to help national forests  address adaptation. Specifically, in April 2012, the Forest Service  finalized a new planning rule that includes climate change adaptation  requirements. Also, in February 2013, the agency issued draft guidance  outlining specific steps that forests can take to implement these  requirements. Each national forest is governed by a land management  plan\u2014referred to as a forest plan\u2014which must be revised at least every  15 years to guide its long-term natural resource management actions.  The planning rule is intended to ensure, among other things, that forest  plans will be responsive and can adapt to issues such as the challenges  of climate change. The rule also requires that each national forest have a  monitoring program that addresses climate change impacts. To help the  forests translate the monitoring requirement into action, the draft agency  guidance we reviewed stated, for example, that in developing their  monitoring programs, the forests could consider monitoring types of  vegetation that are likely to be among the first affected by climate change.  According to the draft guidance, doing so could help natural resource  managers in the forests to identify opportunities to assist those natural  resources in adapting to climate change. Agency officials told us they  plan to finalize the guidance by the end of 2013.", "The Forest Service has also begun developing decision support tools to  help its natural resource managers address climate change adaptation.  For example, in 2012, the Forest Service issued the Climate Project  Screening Tool, which was developed by agency scientists to help natural  resource managers determine how, if at all, climate change  considerations could impact decisions to proceed with, modify, or cancel  proposed projects. The tool includes, for a variety of project types,  examples of key questions natural resource managers might consider to  address climate change adaptation. For example, on a proposed project  to restore an aquatic species, managers might consider whether the  species is likely to survive in the landscape if the waters continue to grow  warmer as a result of climate change. The tool provides a template that  natural resource managers can use to record climate change  considerations in their decision-making process. Specifically, the template  allows managers to document information about the proposed project,  climate change trends and local impacts, their responses to key  questions, and their decisions about whether or how to proceed with the  project.", "The Forest Service is also providing information and training to help  natural resource managers address climate change adaptation. For  example, the agency continues to update its Climate Change Resource  Center\u2014a publicly accessible web portal it developed as a reference for  natural resource managers and decision makers who need information  and decision support tools to address climate change adaptation in the  national forests, among other purposes. The website includes peer- reviewed resources such as lectures on addressing climate change  adaptation in natural resource management.

For example, the Forest Service included a collaboration goal  in its October 2008 strategic framework for responding to climate change  because the agency believes that collaborating with partners will be  essential to address climate change across land ownership boundaries.  According to the framework, the Forest Service manages 8 percent of all  lands in the United States, but climate change impacts will extend across  land ownership boundaries, and the Forest Service has a responsibility to  work with others to address those impacts.

For example, the task force recommended that federal  agencies establish and implement adaptation action plans that address  the challenges that climate change poses to their missions, operations,  and programs. The task force also recommended that agencies address  cross-cutting issues by developing, among other things, (1) a national  action plan to strengthen climate change adaptation for freshwater  resources; (2) a strategy for reducing the impacts of climate change on  the nation\u2019s fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats; and (3) a  strategic action plan for strengthening the resilience of coastal, ocean,  and Great Lakes communities and ecosystems to climate change. In  October 2011, the task force reported that federal agencies had made  significant progress in addressing the goals outlined by the task force in  2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Natural Resource Agencies Have Collaborated on National Strategies to Address Climate Change Adaptation and Climate Assessments", "paragraphs": ["National Fish, Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Partnership.

It was developed with input  from a steering committee led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  NOAA, and the New York Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine  Resources with officials from 11 additional federal agencies, 4  additional state fish and wildlife agencies, 2 intertribal commissions,  and the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The strategy  stated that fish, wildlife, and plant resources are already being  affected by climate change and described projected future impacts.  The strategy also outlined goals for addressing climate change  adaptation for fish, wildlife, and plants as well as strategies for  addressing these goals. For example, one goal is to conserve habitat  to support healthy fish, wildlife, and plant populations and ecosystem  functions in a changing climate. Strategies for addressing the goal  include identifying areas that are likely to be resilient to climate  change and taking steps to ensure that those areas are protected.", "National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan. Federal natural resource  management departments contributed to preparing this plan, which  identifies actions federal agencies will take to bolster the ocean  economy, improve ocean health, and provide better science, among  other things. In July 2010, the President issued an Executive Order  regarding stewardship of our oceans, coasts, and the Great Lakes.\u201d   The national ocean policy calls for management practices that will  enhance the understanding of and capacity to respond to climate  change and ocean acidification, among other things. The National  Ocean Council, which includes the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, the Interior, and the NOAA Administrator, published the  implementation plan for the national ocean policy in April 2013.  Among other things, the plan stated that federal agencies will enable  and support efforts to understand, minimize, and adapt to the impacts  of climate change, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and extreme  weather events, strengthening the resilience of coastal communities.  For example, according to the implementation plan, federal agencies  will offer tools and training courses on how to design and implement  vulnerability assessments and develop assessments of coastal and  ocean climate impacts in support of the National Climate Assessment.", "Federal agencies have also collaborated on national climate  assessments, which analyze current trends in global change, both  human-induced and natural, and project major trends for the subsequent  25 to 100 years. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires  publication of a national climate assessment not less frequently than  every 4 years\u2014the first and second assessments were first published by  the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 2000 and 2009,  respectively. Thirteen federal agencies, including the Forest Service,  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and NOAA,  contributed to the third assessment that was released as a draft for public  comment in January 2013. The draft assessment provides information  on climate change impacts and the status of climate change science, and  it highlights ongoing climate change adaptation efforts, among other  things. For example, the draft assessment states that, although  substantial climate change adaptation planning is occurring at all levels of  government, adaptation actions have been limited. According to the draft  assessment, challenges to implementing adaptation actions include lack  of resources and leadership, and difficulties in using climate change  projections, which can be complex and difficult to apply to management  decisions. To help ensure that natural resource managers and other  decision makers have timely and relevant information, the draft  assessment includes information on creating a sustained climate  assessment process to more efficiently collect and synthesize climate  change science. The draft assessment also states that climate change  adaptation actions have rarely been evaluated for effectiveness because  such actions have only recently begun to be initiated and comprehensive  metrics for evaluating these actions have not been developed.
