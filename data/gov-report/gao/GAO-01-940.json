The Department of Labor has not systematically identified new occupations suitable for apprenticeship programs, nor has it successfully alleviated the concerns of some employers about apprenticeship requirements, which has slowed the expansion of apprenticeship to new occupations. Labor has approved 19 new occupations for apprenticeships in the last five years, and many of these have been in less traditional occupations, such as internetworking technicians. Employers are often wary of apprenticeship programs. For example, some employers are reluctant to commit to incremental increases in wages as required by apprenticeship regulations.

At the same time, many workers have not mastered the skills that are most in demand in the labor market. One approach to addressing this mismatch between labor demand and supply\u2014the apprenticeship model\u2014has been used for decades in construction trades and some manufacturing occupations to ensure that workers have the skills employers need. Apprenticeship combines supervised on-the-job training with formal instruction. It benefits both employers and employees by providing the skills and knowledge necessary for a specific job and a credential recognized throughout an industry. Apprenticeship programs typically last from one to several years and are sponsored by employers who pay an apprentice\u2019s wages; the employer or the apprentice may fund the formal instruction. The use of apprenticeship is standard practice in some industries, but expansion beyond occupations not traditionally apprenticed has been limited.", "To promote the apprenticeship model and safeguard the welfare of apprentices, the Department of Labor established the federal registered apprenticeship program, in which more than 360,000 apprentices are currently enrolled. Labor determines whether occupations in which employers want to sponsor apprentices should be approved as apprenticeable. Employers, sometimes with the help of unions and other employee groups, can establish and operate programs in those approved occupations. Labor or representatives of state apprenticeship councils designated by Labor promote the apprenticeship concept and must approve individual programs for them to be part of the federal registered apprenticeship program.", "To address your concern that apprenticeship is not being used as much as it could be to develop a skilled workforce, you asked us to (1) describe efforts Labor has made to expand apprenticeship to new occupations and explain some of the impediments to getting apprenticeship programs established in fields not traditionally apprenticed, and (2) describe examples of apprenticeship programs that responded to current labor market needs and how they have done so. To answer your questions, we spoke with Labor officials at headquarters and regional offices about their efforts to promote the apprenticeship program. We also interviewed federal and state employees in four states\u2014California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and New Jersey\u2014who promote and register apprenticeship programs. We analyzed the approval process for 40 new programs in these four states and identified and obtained more detailed information on challenges faced by six programs in occupations not traditionally apprenticed. We also spoke with experts and employer and employee group representatives about how apprenticeship meets labor market needs. Our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between November 2000 and July 2001. See appendix I for a full discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Apprenticeship is an employee training approach that combines on-the-job training and formal instruction to teach workers the practical and theoretical aspects of a skilled occupation. It is appropriate for many occupations that require at least 1 year of hands-on training and formal instruction. Apprentices work under the auspices of a mentor who is a fully trained worker, often called a journey worker. The content and length of the apprenticeship training and instruction are determined by the needs of the specific occupation. For employers, apprenticeship helps ensure that workers learn consistent skills, practices, and safety procedures. It also can be a way to retain employees because it indicates an employer\u2019s willingness to invest in the worker and ensures regular wage increases if skills are attained. Additionally, employers are permitted to pay apprentices in a registered program less than prevailing wages while they are working on a federal construction project. At least two states and municipalities have similar requirements or mandate that contractors employ apprentices on projects. Employees benefit from registered apprenticeship by advancing their skills and obtaining a credential recognized throughout an industry. Apprenticed occupations have historically been concentrated in the building trades, metalworking trades, and various repair occupations, as we described in an earlier report.Figure 1 shows the apprentices as of September 30, 2000, for 36 states that provided data on apprentices by industry. Construction and manufacturing apprentices continue to make up the vast majority\u201482 percent\u2014of apprentices.", "The National Apprenticeship Act of 1937, commonly known as the Fitzgerald Act (29 U.S.C. 50), authorized and directed the Secretary of Labor to formulate and promote labor standards safeguarding the welfare of apprentices and to bring employers and labor together to establish programs of apprenticeship. The Secretary issued regulations implementing the act which provide for registration of apprenticeship programs. In order to be registered, Labor requires that an apprenticeship program be in an apprenticeable occupation as defined in the regulation and meet certain standards. Programs are administered by the Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services (ATELS) or by State Apprenticeship Agencies or Councils recognized by the Secretary of Labor.", "The standards prescribed by Labor require that federal registered apprenticeships must include at least 1 year or 2,000 hours of on-the-job training and a recommended 144 hours of formal instruction. In general, most programs last 3 to 4 years. Each program must meet 20 additional requirements, which include a specified minimum age for an apprentice, a specified term of apprenticeship, a progressively increasing wage schedule based on skills acquired, safety training, and a minimum ratio of apprentices to skilled workers. States can impose additional requirements on programs. Program sponsors may also identify additional minimum qualifications that apprentices must possess\u2014for example, a certain level of education or specific physical abilities needed to perform essential functions of the occupation.", "In addition to meeting the prescribed labor standards, an apprenticeship program must be in an apprenticeable occupation to be eligible for registration. Labor makes this determination based on criteria outlined in the regulations. Labor can make this determination when a program is presented for registration or before apprenticeship programs are developed. In the latter situation, for example, an employer may submit a list of the skills needed to complete various tasks in an occupation and the necessary training to complete these tasks. Typically, Labor then distributes this list to appropriate industry representatives for feedback on the occupation\u2019s apprenticeability. Once Labor has determined that an occupation is apprenticeable, it notifies federal and state apprenticeship representatives who can begin to promote programs within that occupation. If an employer decides to establish an apprenticeship program, he or she can work with an apprenticeship representative, either from Labor or a state council, to ensure that the program complies with Labor\u2019s standards and state laws. Frequently, the apprenticeship representative will help the employer by suggesting various program practices, providing examples of programs that have been successful, or modifying the requirements to meet the needs of individual employers. Employers can sponsor registered apprenticeship programs independently, with a group of employers, or with organized labor.", "Despite having an important presence in industry, the federally registered apprenticeship program operates using relatively little federal money. In fiscal year 2001, ATELS has an appropriation of about $22 million to administer the program, while state councils run the program with an additional $20 million. The employers and apprentices themselves contribute at least $1 billion for the training. According to Labor, more than 37,000 apprenticeship programs in about 850 occupations employed about 360,500 registered apprentices in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Systematic Identification of Occupations and the Need to Allay Employers\u2019 Concerns Slow Expansion of Apprenticeships", "paragraphs": ["Progress in expanding apprenticeships to address skill needs in occupations not traditionally apprenticed has been hampered because Labor\u2019s efforts to identify new apprenticeable occupations are not systematic, nor has Labor been able to alleviate some employers\u2019 apprehension about program requirements. Instead of proactively identifying occupations in which apprenticeship could help provide needed skills, Labor has reacted to employers\u2019 requests to have their occupations recognized as apprenticeable. While some employers take the initiative to make this request, others are deterred from doing so by their apprehension about apprenticeship. Employer concerns that have impeded the establishment of apprenticeship programs ranged from stringent program requirements to the increased government scrutiny they may invite. Apprenticeship representatives working one-on-one with employers try to allay these concerns; however, Labor does not have a centralized effort to reach out to industry representatives and explain how apprenticeship could be implemented in their industry. Further, Labor cannot identify and share its successes because it cannot fully assess its progress in establishing new programs. Its apprenticeship database is incompatible with states\u2019 systems, resulting in data that are incomplete and too general to provide information on specific occupations\u2019 expansion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor Lacks a Systematic Process to Expand Apprenticeship", "paragraphs": ["Labor does not have a formal process to determine how the apprenticeship program could be expanded to meet an increasing demand for skilled labor or to respond to the technological advances of today\u2019s economy. Labor has primarily reacted to employers\u2019 requests for apprenticeships in new occupations and has allowed industry to take the lead in requesting new occupations. Further, Labor has not made a comprehensive effort to locate funding for all new apprenticeable occupations; however, it has recently recognized several occupations that respond to evolving labor market needs. In March 2000, at the request of a union, it approved internetworking technician as an apprenticeable occupation to respond to the increased need for skilled workers to install, maintain, and operate advanced data networks and their components. In October 1999, Labor approved Hotel Associate as an apprenticeable occupation to respond to increased labor needs in the tourism industry and to help retain workers in a competitive labor market. In a few cases, Labor has been proactive in identifying specific occupations, providing funding for their development, and encouraging their implementation. For example, in the late 1990s, Labor initiated (and approved in 2000) the youth development practitioner apprenticeship to provide quality training for workers who deliver comprehensive services to young people and provided grants for its implementation. In the last 5 years, 19 occupations have been recognized by Labor as apprenticeable and a substantial number of these have been in less traditional occupations. Table 1 lists the occupations and approval dates for these occupations.", "Labor officials recognize the need for Labor to become more proactive in identifying new occupations as apprenticeable and providing funds for the development of new apprenticeship programs but, according to the officials, Labor\u2019s efforts in this area have been hindered by resource limitations. Specifically, Labor officials commented that staff and funding shortages have prevented the agency from fully addressing all its responsibilities, including marketing apprenticeship programs, coordinating with other partners in the job training arena, and providing technical assistance to employers. However, despite their funding limitations, Labor has been able to make some progress in developing and expanding the apprenticeship program. Further, information to help them identify additional occupations in which more skilled workers are needed and apprenticeship can effectively be used to train workers is readily available. Future plans call for taking a more systematic approach, especially in assessing the labor needs of occupations and determining the possibility of apprenticeships helping to address these needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employer Perceptions Present Challenges to Expanding Apprenticeships", "paragraphs": ["Some employers\u2019 perceptions and concerns about the apprenticeship program have presented challenges to expanding the program. In our discussions with apprenticeship representatives and employers from the states we visited, we were told that employers were apprehensive about agreeing to a progressive wage schedule for an apprentice without first receiving feedback on how the apprentice was performing both on the job and during formal instruction. Employers were reluctant to commit to a program lasting several years, especially in view of uncertain economic conditions and rapidly changing technology. Employers were concerned with what they considered strict training requirements, such as the 144 hours of formal instruction, recommended by federal regulation but required by some states. Employers were also concerned about getting involved in a program that they thought would lead to increased government oversight or scrutiny of their business. Additionally, employers regarded apprenticeship as a \u201cblue collar\u201d approach to training that is inappropriate to their industry.", "Employers in some industries, such as high technology and biotechnology, have difficulty envisioning how apprenticeship would benefit them. Apprenticeship officials in several states commented that they have tried to reach out to these industries but have not been successful because employers see difficulty incorporating the apprenticeship structure within their industry. The computer-generated imaging industry in California is an example of an unsuccessful attempt to reach out to an industry by the state apprenticeship representatives. The need for animators to create computer-generated graphics has greatly increased, but is largely project- driven. Workers are needed for a short period of time and then are laid off when the project ends, which is not conducive to long-term apprenticeships. State officials suggested that studios adopt the construction trade model, where workers are essentially pooled and employers draw from the pool as needed. Employer reaction was strongly against this model because the motion picture industry did not want to share workers; the proprietary nature of the work, with companies operating in very competitive fields with new technology, made them uneasy.", "Labor has efforts under way to reach out to individual employers as well as to inform the general public about apprenticeship. In developing individual apprenticeship programs, Labor deals with employers on a one- on-one basis. Although costly, time-consuming, and labor intensive, Labor officials commented that this approach is very effective at allaying the fears and concerns of employers regarding apprenticeship and was instrumental in gaining their support. Many apprenticeship representatives from Labor are former apprentices who are knowledgeable about the program and can relate to employer concerns. Their approach is to meet with employers to explain the details of the program and resolve any concerns the employer raises. For example, in response to concerns about wage progression, apprenticeship representatives might explain the need to increase workers\u2019 pay over time, noting that this is not automatic but rather based on a demonstrated increase in skills. To allay concerns about the long-term nature of apprenticeship training, they might describe how the program provides flexibility in determining the length of the program. Some programs such as the cable television installer apprenticeship are 1- year programs whereas more complex apprenticeships would be longer, for example, 4 years for a carpenter or electrician apprenticeship. When an employer expresses concern about increased governmental scrutiny, the representative might explain that oversight would not include reviewing other aspects of the operations. Officials commented that once employers fully understand the reasons for apprenticeship requirements, they are often supportive of apprenticeship and can see the benefit to both themselves and the employee.", "Additionally, Labor has begun an initiative using its current resources to better market apprenticeship. In October 2000 Labor started the Registered Apprenticeship Awareness Initiative, which consisted of a variety of efforts aimed at increasing awareness of and support for registered apprenticeship beyond the employers. For example, Labor produced a compact disc to help spread information about apprenticeships to employers and potential apprentices. It includes information on how to contact apprenticeship representatives, what resources are available to help set up a program, and the benefits of a program. Labor has found this to be a way to conduct outreach, within their present resources, to a broad segment of employers and potential apprentices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Inadequate Information System Prevents Measuring Progress and Sharing Information", "paragraphs": ["The Apprenticeship Information Management System (AIMS), Labor\u2019s current apprenticeship information system, cannot provide a complete, detailed picture of progress in implementing apprenticeships in new fields and cannot be used to assess progress or program development. Apprenticeship officials in 36 states enter data directly into AIMS but the remaining 14 states\u2014which have a labor force of 49 million, or 35 percent of the total U.S. labor force\u2014have chosen not to directly report data to the system, do not have access to it, and in some cases provide only summary data. Detailed information is not included in AIMS for these states, and some information, such as programs being developed, is not included for any states. The system was developed to provide Labor with capabilities to report statistical information and track apprenticeship registration, not to manage the program. Labor hopes that a new system under development will be used by all states so that it can provide information with which to measure progress in expanding apprenticeships to new occupations. Labor has developed specifications for a state-of-the-art AIMS system that can be used by headquarters, regions, and all states. The new system is expected to provide detailed information, such as data on apprentices who start, complete, or leave the program. The new system is expected to be designed by February 2002 and to be operational by June 2002.", "Labor lacks a mechanism to share information among all states, which could be helpful as Labor tries to expand apprenticeships to less- traditionally apprenticed occupations. Labor does not maintain a national information-sharing system that provides information on lessons learned and experiences with these apprenticeships. This lack precludes states from quickly learning of and benefiting from the experiences of others. For example, two states we visited were each working independently to develop potential apprenticeships within the information technology (IT) industry. They were unaware of similar efforts by the other or by Labor nationally. Both were unable to benefit from the other\u2019s experiences, and neither was successful in getting an IT-related apprenticeship started. Neither could readily access national information on other states\u2019 progress or success at similar efforts. According to Labor officials, such information is not readily available. Labor officials believe that their system should have more capabilities, such as on-line queries, that would enable this information to be obtained readily. The data gaps and insufficient capability of the AIMS system further reduce the value of information that is obtainable on the system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Apprenticeship Programs That Respond to Current Labor Needs Have Overcome Impediments", "paragraphs": ["We identified a diverse group of programs for which apprenticeship was chosen as an approach to developing skills needed by an industry. The people involved in establishing these programs overcame difficulties in order to set up apprenticeship programs. While the programs were at various stages of maturity at the time of our study, none had developed quickly; they required much discussion and negotiation among different parties, and in a few cases their development is still under way. Generally, the start-up effort required additional resources, sometimes provided by employers and sometimes by Labor. Program sponsors frequently used innovative practices, such as on-line training, to respond to the special characteristics of individual programs.", "As shown in table 2, the programs we studied represent a variety of industries and meet particular labor skill needs. Most of these programs were started in the last decade, and a few are still being established. More recent efforts to establish apprenticeships in new occupations have involved reaching out to industries in which apprenticeship is not a familiar concept and developing a comfort level among potential sponsors and apprentices. (See app. II for detailed descriptions of the development and status of each program.)", "Open communication among employers, employee groups, and the approving agencies has helped speed up and ensure the establishment of these apprenticeship programs. For example, the production technologist apprenticeship was the result of a joint meeting of union and employer representatives. Because the apprenticeship would cross several job classifications, such as engineer, machinist, and electrician, some workers and Labor were not enthusiastic about its potential. This concept was not immediately accepted by some local union workers, who were concerned that allowing these workers to perform tasks that were part of other occupations would jeopardize the other occupations. However, discussions involving all parties allayed their fears. Program planners explained that the quick availability of production technologists who could make small repairs would reduce the production line\u2019s lost time, yet machinists would still be called when more expertise was needed. The youth development practitioner apprenticeship also required good communication. Labor officials worked with staff from its Office of Youth Services to hold several forums across the nation to discuss the apprenticeability of the occupation. The exact nature of the position was defined based on information from these forums.", "Apprenticeship was initially an unfamiliar concept to the people involved in establishing some of these programs. However, discussion with apprenticeship representatives helped them to understand its value to the employers. The responsibility for educating program sponsors\u2014 sometimes one-on-one\u2014typically fell to the Labor or state apprenticeship council representatives who marketed the concept. The expansion of the childcare development apprenticeship from a one-state program to a national one required this type of effort. As part of a national initiative to strengthen childcare workers\u2019 skills, Labor sponsored a nationwide videoconference to discuss the value of childcare worker apprenticeships. Representatives from various state agencies, industry representatives, and apprenticeship representatives participated in the conference, which led to further meetings to discuss the possible implementation of the program in their states. In the three states whose childcare programs we reviewed, training was developed at the state level, which eliminated the need for individual employers to develop their own training plans. Apprenticeship representatives explained the formal training and helped employers understand how it would integrate with the apprenticeship\u2019s structure. Similarly, the pharmacy technician apprenticeship required education outreach. Representatives from the apprenticeship councils in Maine and the District of Columbia contacted hospitals and pharmacies to convince them of the value of apprenticeship, particularly in retaining pharmacy technicians. In Maine, the apprenticeship representative explained how the progressive wage schedule would be helpful in overcoming the problem a hospital was having with retaining workers.", "Typically, the programs we reviewed required significant resources to develop and deliver formal training. For example, the development of technical courses for the production technologist apprenticeship has cost about $160,000. The employer who provided this money viewed it as an investment in high quality training. For the northern California sound and communication workers, whose apprenticeship training has been provided by a joint employer/union council, two sources have provided funding for training. The employers themselves have contributed $0.30 for each hour that union employees worked, and the state provided more than $4 per hour from a training fund for each apprentice\u2019s classroom time.", "For some of the programs, particularly those in industries where apprenticeship is not common, government funding was provided to pay for program design, as Labor took on responsibility for helping to identify such funding. Although Labor\u2019s ATELS unit does not have regular appropriations for program design, in some cases Workforce Investment Act discretionary funds have been used. The Congress also appropriated $12 million to bolster Labor\u2019s childcare development worker apprenticeship initiative. To date, 20 states and the District of Columbia have received grants from this appropriation, which they have used for various purposes, including subsidizing formal instruction and funding apprenticeship representatives who \u201cmarket\u201d apprenticeship to childcare centers and monitor the on-the-job training. Officials we spoke with in three states emphasized the important role that these funds played in marketing and implementing apprenticeship within the industry. For the new youth development practitioner apprenticeships that Labor spearheaded, Labor requested grant proposals in April 2001 from entities that wished to receive funds to establish individual programs. About $1.45 million will be available for local organizations and institutions, national organizations, and an organization that can provide technical assistance as programs develop their procedures and curriculum. In May 2001, Labor provided $550,000 to the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), an IT trade association, to design an IT technical support specialist apprenticeship program. The association will use the funds to convene industry representatives to identify which jobs and skill sets within the IT career clusters would fit the apprenticeship model.", "Several sponsors of the apprenticeship programs we studied used innovative approaches to meet apprenticeship requirements while accommodating unique characteristics of the occupation or industry. In four of the programs, distance learning\u2014formal instruction over the Internet or by videoconferencing\u2014was used or is being developed to accommodate workers who could not meet with instructors personally. The production technologist position\u2019s formal instruction, designed and taught by university personnel in Illinois, was provided via videoconferencing to workers at the two participating manufacturing facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Denver, Colorado. New Hampshire sponsored on-line training for the childcare development specialist apprentice mentors (the supervisors of the apprentices) and lent them laptop computers to enable them to participate in the courses and network with others who were mentoring childcare apprentices.", "Some of the programs adapted their apprenticeships to accommodate unique characteristics of their occupation or industry. For example, the childcare industry typically has low wages relative to other industries. Vermont officials decided to use some of their childcare grant funds to subsidize the wages for apprentices and their mentors, which they believed would raise the status of apprenticeship and attract both apprentices and mentors. In some industries, skill certifications have become key elements of workers\u2019 credentials, and in some of the programs we studied, the certifications were made part of the training. For example, the sound and communication workers in northern California integrate into their apprenticeship program the BICSI training, an industry- recognized certification that some contracts require all workers to have. Similarly, CompTIA, a trade association that develops certifications in many technical aspects of personal computer service, support, and networking, plans to offer certification for IT technical support specialist apprentices who pass the formal instruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Labor has not led a systematic effort to identify apprenticeable occupations and, therefore, the full potential of apprenticeships may not have been realized. Some industries with shortages of skilled labor have not used apprenticeship to meet those needs. Labor has focused its efforts to expand apprenticeship on a few occupations for which skills need to be improved and shortages exist. Its efforts to identify new occupations for apprenticeship have been largely reactive and, as a result, Labor is not influencing the expansion of apprenticeships to industries in need of skilled training. Instead of being reactive, Labor can take a leadership role in identifying occupations where apprenticeship can contribute to providing needed skills, using available information and staff to better direct the expansion of apprenticeship nationally. In addition, Labor has identified workforce development funds to support some of these efforts, but has not systematically located resources for apprenticeships needing funds for program design, which could help ensure their success.", "Further, Labor has not done all it could to widely disseminate information about the apprenticeship program, although doing so would result in employers overcoming their concerns and wanting to participate. The agency has not set up a way for program sponsors to share information on lessons learned, such as through online databases that sponsors could query, with other employers interested in establishing apprenticeships. Such an information exchange would help potential program sponsors understand how apprenticeship could be beneficial, overcome difficulties that may arise in their efforts to establish a program, and alleviate concerns they have about apprenticeship requirements. For example, this exchange could allow the classroom training modules and work standards established for programs in one location to inform employers and apprenticeship representatives in other locations. Similarly, a more detailed apprenticeship database could help people who are considering establishing new programs by identifying others who have experience in operating similar programs. Currently, the database\u2019s incompatibility with some state systems hinders networking and sharing of lessons learned among apprenticeship representatives who are working to establish new programs.
