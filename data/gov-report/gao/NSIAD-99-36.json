According to DOD\u2019s calculations, when all BRAC actions from those rounds are completed, no later than 2001, DOD will have reduced its domestic military basing structure by about 20 percent. DOD believes it needs to reduce its domestic basing infrastructure even further to bring it more into line with reductions in its force structure and funding levels and free up funds for other programs, including modernization. Consequently, in 1997 and 1998, the Secretary of Defense requested the Congress to authorize additional rounds of base closures.", "However, the Congress continues to have many questions about the four BRAC rounds and has not been willing to authorize additional ones to date. Some in the Congress, noting the lengthy time frame allowed for closures and realignments to be completed, have suggested that additional BRAC rounds should not be authorized until prior recommendations have been implemented and the effects of those decisions fully assessed. Some members have also raised questions about the adequacy of DOD\u2019s accounting for the costs and savings associated with BRAC decisions, including environmental restoration costs and other costs to the government not borne directly by DOD; the extent to which environmental restoration associated with BRAC might continue beyond 2001; and the economic impact on communities affected by closures and their ability to recover."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessing the Magnitude of Base Closures and Realignments Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["DOD has characterized the four rounds of BRAC actions as representing about 20 percent of its major bases, producing decisions to close 97 out of 495 major domestic installations and many smaller ones and to realign many other facilities. However, trying to fully assess the magnitude of closures, tally the precise numbers of bases closed or realigned, or differentiate between the two is difficult. For example, individual BRAC commission recommendations may have included actions affecting multiple bases. Additionally, BRAC commissions in the later rounds made changes, or what are termed \u201credirects,\u201d to prior BRAC decisions. In total, the four BRAC rounds produced 499 recommendations affecting about 450 military activities.", "In our 1995 report on the BRAC process, we noted that the term base closure often leaves the impression that a larger facility is being closed.However, that may not actually be the case. Military installations are diverse and can include a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, home port, or leased facility and can vary in size from a few acres to hundreds of thousands of acres. Further, an installation may house more than one mission or function. For example, in 1993 the Navy closed the Norfolk Naval Aviation Depot, which was located on the Norfolk Navy Base, which included the Norfolk Navy Station, Supply Center, and Air Station. Our report noted that full closures may involve relatively small facilities, rather than the stereotypical large military base. It also noted that the number of bases recommended for closure or realignment in a given BRAC round was often difficult to precisely tabulate because closure decisions did not necessarily completely close facilities.", "In the BRAC process, decisions generally were made to either close or realign facilities. While the 1990 BRAC enabling legislation did not specifically define what is meant by \u201cclose,\u201d it did define a realignment as any action that reduces and relocates functions and civilian positions. Our 1995 report noted that an individual BRAC recommendation may actually affect a variety of activities and functions without fully closing an installation. More specifically, the nature of closures and realignments was such that both could result in the closure of portions of facilities, and the distinction between the two was not always clear. For example, our 1997 report on BRAC lessons learned contained a listing of base closure decisions DOD reported as major closures. Excluded from that list was the BRAC 1995 decision regarding Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, which DOD characterized as a major base realignment. The actual decision included shifting a portion of the base\u2019s property to the adjacent Lackland Air Force Base and moving the depot maintenance workload of the Air Logistics Center located on Kelly to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council. Some closures, as well as realignments, such as those involving the Army\u2019s Fort Pickett, Virginia, and Fort Hunter Liggett, California, essentially call for cessation of active military presence on the installations while retaining nearly all of the property for use by reserve components.", "Finally, efforts to precisely determine the numbers of bases closed or realigned are complicated by changes that are made to BRAC decisions in later BRAC rounds. The BRAC process allowed DOD to propose changes to previous commission recommendations, or redirects, while it was considering new base closures in rounds conducted in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Redirects often meant redirecting the planned movement or activity to a base other than the one cited as the receiving base in a prior BRAC round."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Process for Terminating Military Involvement and Disposing of Unneeded Property Can Be Complicated and Time-consuming", "paragraphs": ["By law, DOD must initiate closure or realignment actions no later than 2 years after the President submits the recommended BRAC list to the Congress and must complete implementation within 6 years. However, this 6-year period refers only to the time permitted to implement realignment or closure decisions, such as moving functions from one base to another or halting military activities on a base as a base closes. DOD\u2019s involvement on an installation can go beyond the 6 years as it completes the process of cleaning up environmental contamination on the bases and disposing of the unneeded property."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Environmental Cleanup Can Take Many Years to Complete", "paragraphs": ["DOD must comply with cleanup standards and processes associated with laws, regulations, and executive orders in conducting assessments and cleanup of its base closure property. DOD spends about $5 billion annually to fulfill its environmental mission, including compliance and cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances and waste on active, closing, and formerly used DOD sites. While DOD has an ongoing environmental program at each of its military bases, the decision to close a military base and dispose of unneeded property can require expedited cleanups that may not have otherwise occurred. The time needed to accomplish required cleanup activities can extend many years beyond the 6 years allowed under BRAC legislation for ceasing military operations and closing a base.", "The status of cleanup activities can also affect transferring title of the property from the federal government to others.", "The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 ( 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) provides the framework for responding to contamination problems. CERCLA authorizes the federal government to respond to spills and other releases of hazardous substances. It generally requires that the government warrant that all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment has been taken before property is transferred by the United States to nonfederal entities, such as communities or private parties. While CERCLA had originally authorized property transfers to nonfederal ownership only after all remedial action had been taken, the act was amended in 1996 to expedite transfer of contaminated property. Now such property, under some circumstances, can be transferred to nonfederal users before all remedial action has been taken. However, remedial action must still be taken at some point.", "Given the large amount of land being affected by the BRAC process and the delays that could be encountered due to environmental cleanup, the Congress included provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (P.L. 103-160) that were intended to stimulate base reuse prior to property transfer. That legislation authorized the military services to lease property to facilitate state or local economic reuse without limiting the length of a lease. Previous leases were subject to certain limitations, including a term not to exceed 5 years and DOD\u2019s right to revoke the leases at will. Although leasing property allows its reuse before cleanup has been completed, DOD is still liable for environmental cleanup costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Alternatives for Disposing of Unneeded Real Estate", "paragraphs": ["Once property is no longer needed by a federal agency, the property is declared excess by the agency and is offered to other federal agencies to satisfy their requirements. Excess property that is not selected by federal agencies is declared surplus to the federal government. At that point, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 authorizes disposal of the property through a variety of means, including transfers to states and local governments for public benefit purposes and negotiated or public sales. Additionally, a 1993 amendment to the BRAC legislation states that under certain circumstances, surplus real property can be transferred to local redevelopment authorities under economic development conveyances for economic development and job creation purposes. This section enables communities to obtain property under more flexible finance and payment terms than previously existed. For example, a community can request property at less than fair market value if it can show the discount is needed for economic development.", "An important step for communities as they seek to recover from the adverse effects of base closures is to organize local base reuse authorities to interact with DOD on base closure, property disposal, and reuse issues. As shown in figure 1.1, local reuse authorities generally seek surplus property under one of the public benefit transfer or economic development authorities because these can be no-cost or no-initial cost acquisitions. If the property reuse does not meet the requirements for these conveyances, local reuse authorities can still pursue a negotiated sale without competing with other interested parties. Any surplus property that remains is available for sale to the general public."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Accounting Precisely for Costs and Savings Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["While our previous work has shown that BRAC savings are likely to be substantial, accounting precisely for the costs and savings of BRAC actions is a difficult task. DOD does not have systems in place to track and update savings. Further, some costs associated with BRAC actions, such as federal assistance to BRAC-affected communities, are not included in BRAC implementation budgets and are not considered when calculating overall costs.", "We have previously reported that savings from prior BRAC rounds are expected to be substantial, although DOD has not always documented them well or updated them on a regular basis so as to provide the precision needed to support savings claims. Likewise, as stated in our July 1997 report, significant net savings are likely once up-front closure costs have been paid, although such costs have been higher than initially estimated and have caused net savings not to be realized as quickly as DOD projected.", "The first publicly released costs and savings forecasts from BRAC actions are the numbers typically associated with DOD\u2019s list of proposed closures and realignments that are endorsed by the commission. DOD\u2019s and the commissions\u2019 initial BRAC decision-making did not include the cost of environmental restoration, in keeping with DOD\u2019s long-standing policy of not considering such costs in its BRAC decision-making, whereas subsequent BRAC implementation budget estimates do. This policy is based on DOD\u2019s obligation to cleanup contaminated sites on military bases regardless of whether they are closed. We agree with DOD in not considering these costs in developing its cost and savings estimates as a basis for base closure recommendations. At the same time, we agree with DOD\u2019s position that environmental restoration costs are a liability to it regardless of its base closure decisions, and we have reported that these costs are substantial. The subsequent inclusion of environmental cleanup costs in DOD\u2019s budget has the practical effect of reducing the short-term savings from BRAC actions and delaying the beginning of net annual recurring savings.", "We have also reported that another difficulty in precisely determining BRAC savings is that accounting systems\u2014not just those in DOD\u2014are designed to record disbursements, not savings. The services develop savings estimates at the time they are developing initial BRAC implementation budgets, and these are reported in DOD\u2019s BRAC budget justifications. Because DOD\u2019s accounting systems do not track savings, updating these estimates requires a separate data tracking system, which DOD does not have. The lack of updates is problematic because initial savings estimates are based on forecasted data that can change during actual implementation, thereby increasing or decreasing the amount of savings. We have recommended that regardless of whether the Congress authorizes future BRAC rounds, DOD needs to improve its periodic updating and reporting of savings projections from prior BRAC decisions. As stated in our July 1997 report, this information has been needed to strengthen DOD\u2019s budgeting process and ensure that correct assumptions were being made regarding expected reductions in base operating costs, as well as to provide greater precision to DOD\u2019s estimates of BRAC savings.", "We have also noted that not all federal costs associated with implementing base closures are included in DOD\u2019s BRAC implementation budgets. We previously reported that various forms of federal assistance have been made available to communities, including planning assistance to help communities determine how they could best develop the property, training grants to provide the workforce with new skills, and grants to improve the infrastructure on bases. Our 1996 report stated that over $780 million in direct financial assistance to areas affected by the 1988, 1991, and 1993 BRAC rounds was not included in the BRAC budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Economic Impact Concerns Are of Lower Value in the BRAC Decision-making Process", "paragraphs": ["The economic impact on communities affected by BRAC actions has been a long-standing source of public anxiety. Because of this concern, DOD included economic impact as one of eight criteria it used for making BRAC recommendations in the last three BRAC rounds. While economic impact did not play as large a role in initial BRAC deliberations as did other criteria and was not a key decision factor, such as military value, its importance was such that DOD components were required to calculate the economic impact of each of their recommendations.", "For BRAC 1995, where the cumulative economic impact of prior BRAC rounds also became a concern, we found little documentation indicating that DOD components had eliminated potential closure or realignment candidates from consideration for economic impact reasons. While defense civilian job loss and other adverse effects on communities are an inescapable byproduct of base closures, at least in the short term, we noted in our July 1997 report that some limited studies indicated that, in a number of BRAC-affected communities, the local economies appeared to be able to absorb the economic losses, though some communities were faring better than others. To some extent, it appears that the various federal programs and benefits provided to those communities affected by BRAC actions helped to cushion the impact of base closures.

DOD issued its report in April 1998 and concluded that BRAC costs were below or close to its original estimates and that BRAC actions would save billions of dollars after up-front costs were paid. DOD emphasized that excess capacity in its installations warrants two additional BRAC rounds and that upkeep for unneeded installations wastes resources needed for modernization. DOD also reported that BRAC rounds enhanced military capabilities primarily by enabling the services to consolidate activities and shift funding from infrastructure support to other priorities. In our review of DOD\u2019s report, we agreed that BRAC savings would be substantial after up-front costs were paid but questioned the preciseness of the estimates.

In performing our economic assessment, we used unemployment rates and per capita income as measures for analyzing changes in the economic condition of affected communities. We chose to use unemployment rates and per capita income as key performance measures because (1) DOD used these measures in assessing the economic condition of local areas in its economic impact analysis for recommended BRAC locations in the closure rounds and (2) these measures are commonly used by economists to gauge changes in the economic health of an area over time. During our site visits, we collected additional information to (1) enhance our understanding of the relationship between base closures and local communities and (2) provide a close-up of how a base closure affects individual communities.", "To establish a baseline for our economic analysis, we obtained selected economic indicator data from the Logistics Management Institute (LMI), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center that maintains a database of key economic data for impact areas surrounding base closures during the four rounds.

The employment data originated in the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the income and population data, which were only available through 1995, came from the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The economic impact areas, based on 1990 census data, were defined using accepted standard definitions for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan statistical areas and reflected the impact areas used in the 1995 BRAC round.

Among the reasons the services have given for the estimate decrease are factors such as enhanced estimating capability based on experience, improved site identification, and use of innovative technology. As DOD noted, some early estimates were based on worst-case scenarios, which have generally not occurred. DOD also sometimes assumed that it would be required by local redevelopment authorities to clean property to the highest cleanup standard, that of unrestricted use; this assumption has proved to be untrue in some cases. For example, at the Long Beach Naval Station, the estimated cost to complete cleanup at the installation decreased from $152.4 million in fiscal year 1996 to $85.4 million in fiscal year 1997. While the earlier estimate was based on dredging all contaminated harbor sediments, Navy officials said they were able to decrease the estimated cleanup cost by negotiating a reduced amount of dredging and cleanup with the community. Further, the adoption of some innovative cleanup technologies is expected to reduce costs.", "Ten years into the cleanup process, the military services have voiced increased confidence in their environmental cleanup estimates for sites where contamination exists. This confidence is due, in part, to what they perceive as their enhanced experience in identifying contaminated sites and selecting appropriate cleanup methods. The services report that they have used the experiences of successive closure rounds and their continued programs at active installations.", "Assessing the accuracy of estimates, however, is difficult because data upon which to base conclusions are limited. Fiscal year 1996 was the first full year in which the services used a new model, referred to as the cost-to-complete model, to develop their estimates. Whereas earlier estimates were based on completing \u201cprojects,\u201d which could involve multiple sites with differing cleanup requirements, the new model formulates estimates on a site-by-site basis. The services stated that these cost-to-complete estimates are based on current remedies and known contamination; the discovery of new contamination or the development of new technology could change them.

For example, cleaning up contaminated ground water, an environmental problem at many closing bases, is often expensive. Further, given available technology, cleaning up UXO is costly, labor intensive, time-consuming, and dangerous. According to a recent Defense Science Board Task Force report, DOD does not know the full extent of the UXO problem at its domestic bases, BRAC or otherwise, so it cannot accurately estimate cleanup costs. However, the Board\u2019s report indicates that over 15 million acres on about 1,500 sites are potentially UXO contaminated. The report notes that even if only 5 percent of the suspected sites require cleanup, costs could exceed $15 billion. While BRAC bases represent only a portion of this acreage, UXO contamination is a potentially costly and unresolved problem at BRAC bases. Issues still to be determined are how much acreage will require cleanup and to what degree.", "According to DOD, efforts are underway to identify requirements and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the need for a UXO program, and the services are identifying UXO requirements in their budgetary planning.

An engineer in the Environmental Protection Agency noted that this technique could reduce the per-ton cleanup cost of contaminated soil from $1,000 to $300.

The residential cleanup standard, which involves having no restrictions on the future use of the property, can be the highest and costliest to achieve.

Local officials from Atwater (Castle Air Force Base area), Gosnell (Eaker Air Force Base area), and Ayer and Shirley (Fort Devens area) described how rental units that catered to single service personnel had to lower rents and perhaps offer weekly rents to stay in business. In two communities, local officials told us that the result was an influx of a less stable population, which often led to undesirable conditions, such as increased crime and disorderly conduct and a drain on public assistance resources. Several officials from Atwater mentioned that DOD\u2019s program to purchase housing from transferring military and defense personnel lowered housing values. However, officials from communities surrounding Eaker Air Force Base and Fort Devens told us that the market for single-family homes has recovered and in some cases has exceeded preclosure levels. For example, housing values have increased in the communities surrounding Eaker Air Force Base.", "The communities we visited generally regretted the loss of base personnel, with whom they had good relationships. The loss was often described as a cultural loss rather than an economic one. This loss was less pronounced in the urban areas, but in the rural towns, the bases had brought in people with diverse backgrounds from various parts of the country. Officials described how local institutions benefited from these outsiders\u2019 viewpoints and experiences, particularly in communities where the military people became involved with the local government, the schools, and the arts. An official from one of the communities near Fort Devens remarked about the high quality of people that had entered the community who worked at the Army Intelligence school. In Beeville, some local officials told us about the pride they had at being the home of Chase Field, which trained naval pilots.", "Base employees were also affected by an installation\u2019s closure. While many base employees accept transfers to other facilities during a base closure, those who choose to remain in the local community may face periods of unemployment. In cases where the military base provided most of the high-paying, high-skilled jobs for the area, as was the case at Castle Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Chase Field, some former base employees who chose to remain in the area reportedly had difficulty finding a job at a comparable salary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong National Economy and Diversified Local Economies Help Communities Recover", "paragraphs": ["Several factors play a role in determining the fate of the economies of closure communities and the recovery of communities (see fig. 5.6). Officials from several of the communities we visited cited the strong national or regional economy as one explanation of why their communities were able to avoid economic devastation and find new areas for economic growth. The national unemployment rate for 1997 was the lowest in a generation. Officials from the communities surrounding Castle and Eaker Air Force Bases said employers are now finding their communities attractive because these rural areas have higher unemployment rates and therefore a large population looking for jobs. These observations are consistent with a 1993 report in which the Congressional Budget Office reviewed the impacts of DOD\u2019s downsizing on defense workers, stating that the best solution for displaced defense workers is a growing economy.", "Officials from each of the communities expressed the importance of having other local industries that could soften the impact of job losses from a base closure. Urban communities, as officials from the more urban areas confirmed, are better able to absorb the job losses from a base closure because they have more diversified economies that provide a wider range of job and business opportunities. In a January 1998 report, we examined defense-related spending trends in New Mexico and the relationship between those trends and New Mexico\u2019s economy. We reported that while defense-related spending has been declining in the state, the state\u2019s gross product and total per capita income have been increasing and that this economic growth may be due to efforts to diversify the economy away from defense.", "Officials also pointed to several other economic forces at work in their regions at the time of a closure, during the transition period, and at the current time. For example, officials from the communities surrounding Fort Devens said that at the time of the closure, the area was suffering from the downsizing and restructuring of the computer industry. Today, those same communities are benefiting from the economic growth in the larger Boston metropolitan area. Philadelphia has been going through deindustrialization for the past 20 years. Officials from Philadelphia said their city has been also losing job and population for many years\u2014the closure of the shipyard was not the first big loss they have experienced. However, at the time the closure was announced, the shipyard was the largest manufacturing concern in the region, and one official said that it is difficult for any city to lose such a large employer even if the loss does not fundamentally hurt the local economy of a large metropolitan area like Philadelphia. Figure 5.7 describes the economic and regional context of the base closure for the communities we visited.", "The rural areas we visited, where agriculture has historically dominated the economy, have benefited from their efforts to diversify. In Blytheville, Arkansas, for example, where Eaker Air Force Base closed, the steel industry found a foothold in the late 1980s before the announcement of the base closure and has been a growing presence ever since. The Blytheville area is attractive to the steel companies because of its access to the Mississippi river and a major interstate as well as an available labor pool. Beeville, Texas, where Chase Field closed, has a long history of farming and ranching, but has recently benefited from an expanding state prison industry. In these cases, the emergence of major employers was coincidental with the base closure, but officials in both towns stated the importance of these employers to recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local Officials Stated That Base Reuse and Government Assistance Contribute to Economic Recovery", "paragraphs": ["The redevelopment of base property is widely viewed as a key component of economic recovery for communities experiencing economic dislocation due to jobs lost from base closures. The closure of a base makes buildings and land available for a new use that can generate new economic activity in the local community. DOD\u2019s Office of Economic Adjustment surveys the local reuse authorities representing base closures from all four rounds on the number of jobs that have been created from redevelopment of bases. As of March 1998, the Office of Economic Adjustment reported that reuse of base property from closed bases had generated almost 48,000 new jobs (compared with approximately 100,000 government civilian and contractor estimated job losses from BRAC actions). Table 5.2 shows the number of jobs created from redevelopment of base property at the six closed bases we visited.", "From our meetings with local officials, publicizing redevelopment goals and efforts for former bases is a key strategy for attracting industry and helping communities gain confidence in recovery from the closure. For example, Philadelphia officials recently closed a deal with Kvaerner Shipbuilding of Norway that will bring several hundred shipbuilding jobs back to the shipyard. Though this deal will not replace about 7,000 shipyard lost jobs from the closure, it has helped to allay fears that the shipyard would stay idle in the long term. Officials from other communities stressed the importance of successful base redevelopment to their communities\u2019 long-term economic health.", "We did not attempt to assess the extent that government assistance programs speeded economic recovery of communities experiencing base closures. However, some officials emphasized that federal assistance in the form of planning and infrastructure grants helps communities overcome many barriers to redevelopment, such as the complex property disposal process and deteriorating or outdated infrastructure. Specifically, local officials told us that Office of Economic Adjustment grants helped them plan for redeveloping base property and Economic Development Administration grants provided funding for infrastructure improvements to integrate base property into the community\u2019s infrastructure. A recent study requested by the Economic Development Administration and prepared by a research team led by Rutgers University evaluated the success of the Economic Development Administration\u2019s defense adjustment grants in helping local communities diversify away from dependence on former military bases or defense contractors. The study concluded that the assistance succeeded in aiding job creation and economic recovery from base closures and defense downsizing.", "In helping base employees adjust to closures, the communities took advantage of federal, state, and local programs to provide displaced workers with career transition counseling, job retraining, and placement services. One major effort to assist displaced workers occurred in Philadelphia. According to Navy data, about 8,000 civilian jobs were eliminated by the shipyard\u2019s closure from 1991 to 1996. Of these 8,000 employees, about 1,400 were laid off, 2,000 accepted separation incentives, and almost 2,000 transferred to other military installations while hundreds left through retirement, disability separation, and resignation. The Philadelphia base created a career transition center that provided one-on-one counseling to over 4,000 workers, as well as skills assessments, workshops, on-site retraining, and information on career choices. The center formed partnerships with the Private Industry Council, state employment office, and local colleges to ensure that every opportunity for retraining and assistance was used. The shipyard developed flexible training plans for the employees with the Navy reassigning people to new positions that supported their training. One official expressed frustration that more shipyard workers did not use the training opportunities and suggested that a barrier to assisting workforces similar to the one at the Philadelphia shipyard is the older age of this workforce. Most of the shipyard work force had been doing shipyard work all their working lives and did not want to start at the bottom again or learn a new trade despite the fact that the Philadelphia area has a lot of jobs, such as in construction, that would be suitable with some retraining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property Transfer Process Continues to Frustrate Local Leaders", "paragraphs": ["The most consistent major concern cited by the officials in the six communities we visited was that the transfer of property to the reuse authority was slow. (See ch. 2 for a discussion on DOD\u2019s progress in transferring base property.) In the case of Eaker Air Force Base, some of the property was conveyed to the reuse authority through an economic development conveyance just this past September. The Bee Development Authority still does not have title to a large portion of Chase Field. The local reuse authority for Castle Air Force Base is in the process of obtaining an economic development conveyance. In each of these cases, the base had been closed sometime between 1993 and 1996. However, both Fort Benjamin Harrison and Fort Devens reuse authorities have title to base property, and the Fort Devens authority has been especially successful in turning over property to commercial enterprises.", "One problem caused by transfer delays is the increased cost of rehabilitating the facilities, which continue to deteriorate from the time of closure to the transfer of title. This situation is occurring in Beeville, Texas, despite the fact that a large portion of the base was transferred to the state of Texas through a public benefit conveyance for state prison facilities. Officials from the Bee Development Authority said they wish to diversify the local economy by attracting manufacturing to the area; they see the remaining base property as an asset to attract such development. However, a large hangar and office facility is deteriorating because the reuse authority does not have the money to maintain it, nor can it attract businesses that would supply maintenance funds without title to the facility. Two Beeville officials suggested the absence of a DOD base transition coordinator, an on-site official who serves as an advocate for the community and a local point of contact with the federal government, may have contributed to the local authority\u2019s problems.", "Local officials stated that DOD officials responsible for property disposal do not seem to understand that delaying property conveyance is bad for business. Some local officials told us they do not think that responsible offices have enough real estate expertise. For example, some officials told us that property appraisals did not consider the cost of bringing a building up to local health and safety codes and therefore overvalued the property. Consistent with DOD statements in chapter 2, local officials acknowledged that some of the delay is due to property disposal process requirements. In addition, some local officials said transition delays are due to the lengthy environmental cleanup process.", "DOD officials agreed that the property disposal process can be frustrating to base reuse and economic recovery efforts but explained that DOD was using all available policy options to speed the process and remain within the boundaries of the law. A DOD official also noted that 1991 base closures may not have benefited as much from initiatives begun in 1993 to speed the process of transferring property to communities. These initiatives included the creation of economic development conveyances and base transition coordinators. Many officials said that once the transition is completed, they will be able to attract tenants, and they believed that in the long run, the community could generate more economic activity and accrue other quality of life dividends such as parks and recreation facilities than when the base was active."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A majority of base closure communities have been able to absorb the economic loss without a significant economic decline. A growing national economy and a diverse regional economy play significant roles in economic recovery, making it easier for communities to absorb job losses and generate new business activity. However, some communities are not economically strong based on economic indicators and may have incurred deeper and longer economic impacts from base closures.", "Local officials said the impact from base closure was not as bad as they had feared. Though some communities encountered negative economic impacts during the transition from the announcement of base closure to recovery, local officials said they are optimistic about the long-term outlook for their communities. They told us they now view a base closure as an opportunity for their community to craft a new identity for itself and diversify the local economy.
