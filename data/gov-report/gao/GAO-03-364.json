FHFB's chair has the authority to appoint and remove officials and reorganize the agency without a vote by the board. In contrast, statutes, regulations, and practices limit the chairs' authorities at most other regulators. In particular, the boards or commissions at these agencies approve most senior-level appointments and several boards approve major reorganizations. The basis for the FHFB chair's comparatively broad administrative authority is a delegation of authority, which the board passed in 1990 and 1993. The delegation allows the chair to make and implement key decisions without obtaining or benefiting from the views of all board members and has contributed to sometimes bitter conflicts among board members over the past 8 years. Although FHFB provided significant financial compensation to staff subject to the RIF, its procedures were not fully consistent with all applicable federal age discrimination statutes and regulations. For example, FHFB presented a settlement agreement to separated staff that offered 3 to 6 months salary in exchange for, among other things, the employees agreeing to waive their rights to file charges, complaints, or appeals with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). EEOC regulations implementing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act do not permit waivers of employees' rights to file charges or complaints with EEOC. In addition, FHFB did not advise the affected employees in writing to consult an attorney prior to signing the agreements as is required. Although for several years FHFB did not take steps to correct weaknesses in its FHLBank examination program that GAO identified in a 1998 report, FHFB's current Chair has recently undertaken several steps to improve its examinations. In 1998, and again in 2002, GAO found that FHFB performed limited reviews of FHLBank functions that are critical in managing the banks' financial and operational risks. Among other changes announced in 2002, FHFB plans to increase the number of examiners from 10 to 24 and revise its examination approach to focus on the major risks and quality of controls at each FHLBank. Although these changes have the potential to improve FHFB's examination program, it is too soon to assess their effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we review selected operations of  the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and its ability to fulfill its  critical mission to regulate the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBank  System). The FHLBank System consists of 12 Federal Home Loan Banks  (FHLBanks), whose mission is to promote housing and community finance.  To do so, the FHLBank System issues debt in the financial markets; and  each of FHLBanks makes loans, also known as advances, to member  financial institutions, such as thrift institutions and commercial banks, that  are located in its district. As of September 30, 2002, total FHLBank System  outstanding debt obligations stood at $668 billion. Although due to  conservative underwriting standards the FHLBank System has never  experienced a loss on an advance, it faces additional risks due to the recent  rapid growth of direct mortgage acquisition programs. The direct  acquisition of mortgages adds to the FHLBanks\u2019 interest rate and credit  risks, and the banks have developed increasingly sophisticated systems to  manage these risks.", "FHFB has a five-member board, of which no more than three members can  be from the same political party. FHFB\u2019s primary mission is to help ensure  that the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner. FHFB is also  responsible for ensuring that FHLBanks carry out their housing and  community development mission and comply with applicable statutes and  regulations. To fulfill its mission, FHFB conducts examinations of  FHLBanks, and other supervisory activities. FHFB also appoints public  interest directors to serve on the boards of each of the FHLBanks.", "In the past year, FHFB board members have been involved in several  publicized disputes. The current Chair (John T. Korsmo) has taken several  key administrative initiatives, including reorganizing FHFB, which he  believes are necessary to improve the agency\u2019s oversight. However,  FHFB\u2019s Democratic board members, who are currently in the minority on  the board, have stated that the Chair acted unilaterally and did not  adequately consult them about these administrative initiatives. Board  members have also stated that they were not adequately consulted about  other issues that are the responsibility of the FHFB, such as the  appointment of public interest directors. Similar disputes between the  FHFB chair and other board members periodically took place when  Democratic Chair Bruce Morrison served from 1995 through 2000.", "As discussed with your staff, we assessed a range of issues relating to  FHFB\u2019s operations and its abilities to fulfill its critical regulatory mission.  Specifically, our report objectives are as follow:  compare the FHFB chair\u2019s administrative authorities to those of the  chairs of other financial regulators and discuss the basis for that  authority;   assess FHFB\u2019s compliance with selected applicable statutes and  procedural requirements in connection with a reduction-in-force (RIF)  that was carried out as part of an agency reorganization announced on  August 7, 2002;  assess FHFB\u2019s progress in enhancing its FHLBank safety and soundness   provide historical data showing the political contributions of FHLBank  public interest directors prior to their appointments; and   compare FHFB\u2019s use of Schedule C appointments and the organization  of its public and congressional affairs functions with the practices of  other financial regulatory agencies.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed applicable statutes, regulations,  and practices that determine the scope of authority of the FHFB chair and  the authorities of the heads of six other federal financial regulatory  agencies. These agencies are the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA),  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed Board).

Among financial  regulators, single directors head the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Federal  Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). In contrast, boards or  commissions run FHFB, the Fed Board, NCUA, SEC, CFTC, FDIC, and  FCA. Advantages and disadvantages exist for both models. In the single- director model, the director is responsible for making all the decisions at  the agency, without the potential hindrance of having to consult or get the  approval of board members. The primary advantage of the board model is  that it provides the potential to benefit from the diverse perspectives and  experiences of board members. However, one potential disadvantage of the  board model is that consultation among board members could create  inefficiencies in running the agency.", "To overcome the potential inefficiencies associated with the board model,  responsibilities for policy and day-to-day administration are divided  between the board and chair at many regulatory agencies. Policy decisions  include making rules and regulations or authorizing enforcement actions.  Day-to-day administration might include directing staff, overseeing safety  and soundness examinations, and expending funds as authorized by the  board. Administrative responsibilities that are often considered to be more  significant (that is, not day-to-day) include the hiring and removal of senior  officials and restructuring the agency.", "FHFB has a five-member board of directors. The Secretary of the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) serves as an ex  officio member, and the remaining four full-time directors are appointed by  the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for 7-year terms.  Each of the four appointed directors must have experience or training in  housing finance or a commitment to providing specialized housing credit.  Not more than three of the five members can be from the same political  party. The President designates one of the four appointed members to serve  as chair.

From 1990 to 1993, the  board operated with four appointed members who served on a part-time  basis. Beginning in January 1994, FHFB board membership became full  time. However, from 1994 through 2001, the board operated with at least  one vacant seat and sometimes two or three. In December 2001, the  President appointed FHFB\u2019s new chair, and the board operated with four  full-time appointed members plus the HUD designee throughout 2002.", "As of September 2002, FHFB\u2019s 104 staff members were organized into four  program offices:  Office of Supervision (OS) \u2013 The office is responsible for conducting on- site examinations of the FHLBanks and the FHLBank System\u2019s Office of  Finance and conducting off-site monitoring and analysis.

According  to former FHFB Chair, Dan Evans, the 1990 delegation of authority  facilitated the administration of the agency due in part to the fact that  board members served on a part-time basis. According to the FHFB former  managing director who served under Evans, the agency\u2019s part-time board  members spent most of their time in geographic locations across the  United States and came to Washington several days each month to conduct  the agency\u2019s business, particularly policy issues. According to Evans and  the former managing director, the 1990 delegation facilitated the  administration of FHFB as convening the part-time board members for  administrative decisions was challenging. The 1990 delegation of authority  authorizes the chair to \u201c. . . effect the overall management, functioning, and  organization . . .\u201d of the FHFB. Although FHFB\u2019s statute authorizes the  board to employ and set the compensation of agency staff, the delegation  of authority ceded appointment, removal, and pay authorities to the chair.  The delegation of authority included a provision that allowed board  members to challenge decisions made under the delegation, obligating the  chair to call a special session of the board to consider any matter or  business at the request of any two or more board members.", "In November 1993, FHFB\u2019s part-time board made technical revisions to the  1990 delegation of authority that allowed the HUD secretary to serve as the  chair in the absence of a chair or vice chair. Otherwise, the terms of the  1993 delegation are substantially similar to the 1990 delegation and grant  significant administrative authority to the FHFB chair (see fig. 2).    According to a 1996 FHFB OGC memorandum that discusses the basis for  the delegation and FHFB\u2019s former managing director, some of the part-time  board members did not continue on the board as full-time members. The  FHFB memorandum states that the part-time board members were  concerned that the agency would not be able to function in the absence of  the chair and other board members. The 1993 delegation of authority has  remained in effect because it has not been overturned by a majority vote of  the board.", "The FDIC board has also voted to give significant administrative authority  to its chair through its bylaws and a delegation of authority. Through its  bylaws, the FDIC board delegated certain appointment authority as well as  reorganization authority to the chair. On January 29, 2002, the board  members voted unanimously to delegate additional authority to the chair.  The delegation expanded the chairs\u2019 authority to appoint senior officials  without a board vote.

For example, the report  found that FHFB examiners did not thoroughly review FHLBank internal  control systems. Internal controls are defined as arrangements, such as  procedures, organization structure, and technical methods, designed to  provide reasonable assurance that (1) assets are protected from  unauthorized use or disposition; (2) transactions are in compliance with  law, regulation, FHFB policy, and the policy directives of the FHLBank\u2019s  director and management; and (3) financial reporting is accurate.  According to our report, in September 1996, FHFB examinations stated  that internal control reviews were \u201climited.\u201d FHFB officials cited the  limited number of examiners, 8 to 10 individuals, as one explanation for not  conducting thorough internal control evaluations.", "From 1998 through 2001, FHFB did not develop an examination program to  ensure that each FHLBank has established an adequate internal control  system. We reviewed all 36 FHFB bank examinations conducted in 1999 to  2001. Each of the 36 examinations stated that the review of internal  controls was \u201climited in scope and did not involve a comprehensive review  of the entire system of controls.\u201d As of late July 2002, FHFB had 10  examiners, or the same number as in 1998. Moreover, from 1998 through  2002, direct mortgage acquisition programs added risks to the FHLBank  System and the FHLBanks developed increasingly complex approaches to  manage these risks.", "Further, our 1998 report noted that FHFB examination workpapers did  not adequately document corporate governance reviews or indicate that  such reviews were conducted. Board of director and management  oversight are essential elements of the corporate governance of financial  institutions and financial and other risk management. At the September  2002 FHFB board meeting, discussion among board members suggested a  concern about the lack of emphasis on corporate governance in the  examinations. One board member stated that he believes the FHLBanks\u2019  corporate governance is \u201cuneven\u201d and that FHFB\u2019s examinations have not  devoted sufficient attention to this critical area. The Chair and the other  board member discussed directing FHFB\u2019s examination staff to conduct an  audit of corporate governance in the FHLBank System. The next section  discusses this audit.", "Our 1998 report noted that off-site monitoring in the FHFB examination  program was weak and conducted in an uncoordinated manner. Off-site  monitoring involves the analysis of financial data to monitor bank financial  performance and to identify risks. Off-site monitoring can serve as an  effective means to supplement the work of examiners working on-site.  Regular monitoring between examinations, which generally take place on  an annual basis, is important because the FHLBanks\u2019 financial conditions  and risks can change significantly in a short period. The 1998 report noted  that OS off-site monitoring consisted of four periodic reports as well as  monthly reviews of various bank information. While these reports were  potentially beneficial, FHFB suspended them in 1997 due to staff  constraints in OS. The 1998 report also noted that coordination between  OPRA and OS on off-site monitoring activities was lacking.", "We found that FHFB\u2019s off-site monitoring program is still limited. For  example, FHFB\u2019s OS director said that in July 2002 that only one individual  performs off-site monitoring functions. Rather than assess the financial  performance of the FHLBanks, the director said that the individual tracks  FHLBank compliance with existing examination recommendations.  Although this function is important, it does not provide FHFB with  information about safety and soundness issues, such as changes in the  FHLBanks\u2019 financial condition. A more comprehensive off-site monitoring  program could help alert FHFB officials to the need for an on-site  examination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHFB Has Initiated Steps to Significantly Revise the FHLBank Examination Program", "paragraphs": ["In August 2002, FHFB\u2019s Chair announced that FHFB would significantly  increase the resources devoted to OS. FHFB set the fiscal year 2003 budget  for OS at $9.7 million, a $2.8 million increase from fiscal year 2002 funding  levels. FHFB also hired a new OS director and deputy director, both of  whom have experience in examinations at other financial regulatory  agencies. FHFB also plans to increase the number of examination staff  from 10 to 24 by fiscal year 2004 and to open satellite locations in different  parts of the country in which to base examiners. Under the previous  examination approach, 8 to 10 examination staff spent 6 to 7 months on  travel each year. FHFB officials said satellite locations would reduce travel  demands on the examination staff and aid in hiring and retaining qualified  staff. At the time of our review, OS was in transition; however, FHFB had  increased the number of examiners. As of February 5, 2002, there were 14  examiners on staff at FHFB, an increase of 4.", "According to the OS Director, FHFB also plans to significantly change its  approach to conducting examinations to obtain a fuller understanding of  FHLBank operations as FHLBank System business becomes more  complex. Prior to September 2002, FHFB assigned its examiners to teams  that included 4 to 5 members. In general, each examiner was responsible  for conducting annual examinations at 6 of the 12 FHLBanks. According to  FHFB officials, the examination teams reviewed different banks from year  to year, and their membership was rotated as well. Therefore, an FHFB  examiner might work on a particular bank\u2019s examination one year but not  the next. Moreover, FHFB examiners did not necessarily specialize in the  areas (e.g., credit risk, interest rate risk, or affordable housing programs)  that are examined on an annual basis. Instead, an examiner might review  a bank\u2019s interest rate risk operations at one examination and review  another bank\u2019s affordable housing program at the next examination.", "The OS Director said that under the revised examination approach, by the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, FHFB plans to have three examination  teams in place. Each team will consist of 8 members, with each team  responsible for 4 of the 12 FHLBanks for 3 to 4 years. In addition, each  examiner will focus on a particular area, such as interest rate risk or  affordable housing compliance, at each of the four FHLBank examinations  for which the individual is responsible annually. For example, the OS  Director said that two recent hires on the examination staff have expertise  in the area of corporate governance. According to FHFB, as of February  2003, OS had completed ten targeted corporate governance reviews at the  FHLBanks, and expects to complete a final report on all 12 banks\u2019  corporate governance by March 2003.", "The OS Director also said that FHFB plans to develop a proactive and risk- based management approach to conducting FHLBank examinations. Prior  to FHFB\u2019s recently announced changes to its examination program,  examiners might examine a particular FHLBank as of June 30 of a  particular year. The examiners would then assess whether the bank was  operated in a safe and sound manner and complied with all laws and  regulations as of that date. Under the new risk management approach, the  OS director said that the examination staff would try to identify the future  risks facing each FHLBank and develop plans to help ensure that FHLBank  management establish systems and controls to adequately manage those  risks.", "Overall, FHFB\u2019s planned examination program is similar to the  examination program of OFHEO, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are large government-sponsored,  privately owned and operated corporations chartered by Congress to  enhance the availability of mortgage credit across the nation during good  and bad economic times. Similar to FHFB\u2019s proposed examination  program, OFHEO has established a risk-based examination program that  assesses the controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use to manage  significant risks. In addition, OFHEO assigns staff with specialized skills,  such as interest rate risk management, to its examination teams. OCC,  FDIC, OTS and the Fed Board have also implemented similar risked-based  examination programs.", "FHFB has plans to expand off-site monitoring. Specifically, as of October  21, 2002, an FHLBank analyst was assigned to each FHLBank in an effort to  enhance the OS off-site monitoring program. According to the OS Director,  the recently announced merger between OS and OPRA (see figs. 3 and 4)  provides opportunities for FHFB to enhance its off-site monitoring  capability.

The delegation prevents the full board from  participating in key administrative decisions that have potential policy  implications. At a January 29, 2003, FHFB board meeting, the board in a  close 3 to 2 vote along party lines rejected a proposal to revise the  delegation of authority that would have required board approval for senior  appointments and major agency reorganizations. Although FHFB board  member staff exchanged proposed language to revise the delegation of  authority prior to the meeting, there was little collaboration among the  staff. While the FHFB board has determined that the delegation remains  the most efficient means to administer the agency, we continue to believe  that the decision potentially frustrates one of Congress\u2019 objectives in  establishing a board to regulate the FHLBank System. That is, the board  structure is designed to help ensure that key decisions benefit from the  experiences and perspectives of all board members. In addition, the FHFB  board\u2019s decision will likely result in the continuation of the sometimes  bitter conflicts that have periodically characterized the relationships  among board members over the past 8 years.", "Going forward, the FHFB board would benefit from considering a range of  options that would involve all board members in key administrative  decisions. Some of these options may not involve any changes to the  current delegation of authority. For example, the chair could notify and  brief other board members of key administrative decisions prior to their  implementation and seek other board members\u2019 advice and counsel on  these decisions. Or, the FHFB board could consider practices at other  financial regulatory agencies that provide for board or commission  involvement in key administrative decisions. At CFTC, for instance, the  chair\u2019s authority to reorganize the agency is similar to that of the FHFB  chair, but CFTC\u2019s practice has been for the chair to submit major  reorganization proposals to the commission for a vote. In addition, board  members and their staffs could work together to determine if there are any  areas of agreement on approaches\u2014including revising the delegation of  authority\u2014that would increase board participation in key administrative  decisions while preserving the chair\u2019s authority to administer the agency on  a day-to-day basis.

The regulations  go on to state that the existence of a program will be determined based  upon the facts and circumstances of each case. A \u201cprogram\u201d exists when an  employer offers additional consideration for the signing of a waiver  pursuant to an exit incentive or other employment termination (e.g., a  reduction in force) to two or more employees. The regulations also state  that typically, an involuntary termination program is a standardized  formula or package of benefits that is available to two or more employees.  The terms of the program are generally not subject to negotiation between  the parties. The regulations make clear that the number and identity of  employees who must be provided with the information will depend on how  the employer chose persons who would be offered consideration for  signing a waiver. In some cases, the information requirement extends to all  employees within a certain job category; and in some cases, extends to all  employees within a particular division or to all employees in the employer\u2019s  facility.", "The legislative history of OWBPA indicates that group termination  programs raise additional issues and require additional protection for  individuals from whom a waiver is sought. These informational  requirements are designed to permit older workers to make more informed  decisions in group termination programs. The employees affected by these  programs have little or no basis to suspect that action is being taken based  on their individual characteristics. The Senate Report explains that the  principal difficulty encountered by older workers in these circumstances is  their inability to determine whether the program gives rise to a valid claim  under ADEA and that the need for adequate information and access to  advice before waivers are signed is especially acute."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Federal Housing Finance Board", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from FHFB Board Members Franz S.
