Projections for how long the current constellation will be fully capable have increased by nearly 2 years to June 2021, affording some buffer to offset any additional satellite delays.

GAO will continue to monitor OCX progress.", "DOD has made some progress on initial testing of the receiver cards needed to utilize the M-code signal. However, additional development is necessary to make M-code work with over 700 weapon systems that require it. DOD has begun initial planning for some weapon systems, but more remains to be done to understand the cost and schedule needed to transition to M-code receivers. The preliminary estimate for integrating and testing a fraction of the weapon systems that need the receiver cards is over $2.5 billion through fiscal year 2021 with only 28 fully and 72 partially funded (see figure). The cost will increase by billions when as yet unfunded weapon systems are included.", "The level of development and procurement effort beyond the initial receiver cards is significant and will require close coordination across DOD. After the Air Force develops initial cards, the breadth and complexity of this acquisition will multiply, as the offices responsible for upgrading hundreds of weapon systems begin their own individual efforts to further develop and test the cards. However, DOD does not have an organization assigned to collect test data, lessons learned, and design solutions so that common design solutions are employed to avoid duplication of effort as multiple entities separately mature receiver cards. DOD therefore risks paying to repeatedly find design solutions to solve common problems because each program office is likely to undertake its own uncoordinated development effort."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD should assign responsibility to an organization to collect test data, lessons learned, and design solutions so they may be shared.

More OCX block 0 delays in early fiscal  year 2017 complicated Air Force test plans, resulting in changes to the  sequence and timing of events, the introduction of concurrency at various  points throughout the testing, the use of incomplete software in early  testing, and an increase in the likelihood of discovering issues later in pre- launch integrated testing.

Under this  newer proposed schedule Raytheon forecasts delivering blocks 1 and 2 in  December 2020 with 6 months of extra schedule\u2014a 30-month schedule  extension\u2014to account for unknown technical issues before OCX blocks 1  and 2 are due to the Air Force in June 2021. The Air Force projects  operating OCX in fiscal year 2022 after completing 7 months of  operational testing post-delivery.", "Three factors place delivery of OCX blocks 1 and 2 in June 2021 at high  risk for additional schedule delays and cost increases:", "First, the newly proposed June 2017 rebaselined schedule assumes  significant improvements in the speed of software coding and testing  that have not yet been proven, but will be introduced at various  periods as software development proceeds. Whether Raytheon can  achieve the majority of these efficiencies will not be known until the  end of fiscal year 2018. However, the Defense Contract Management  Agency, which independently oversees Raytheon\u2019s work developing  OCX, noted in July 2017 a number of risks to the schedule, including  that some initial assumed efficiencies had not been demonstrated.  Specifically, they noted for initial coding on block 1 that Raytheon had  achieved only 60 percent of the software integration maturity planned  to that point in time in conjunction with greater numbers of software  deficiencies that will require more time than planned to resolve.", "Second, the proposed rebaseline schedule has not yet undergone an  integrated baseline review (IBR) to verify all of the work that needs to  be done is incorporated into that schedule. The IBR is a best practice  required by the Office of Management and Budget on programs with  earned value management. An IBR ensures a mutual understanding  between the government and the contractor of the technical scope,  schedule, and resources needed to complete the work. We have  found that too often, programs overrun costs and schedule because  estimates fail to account for the full technical definition, unexpected  changes, and risks. According to prior plans, the IBR would have  taken place in early 2017, but it has been delayed multiple times for a  number of reasons. A significant and recurring root cause of delays on  the OCX program has been a lack of mutual understanding of the  work between the Air Force and Raytheon.", "The IBR start was scheduled for November 2017 with completion in  February 2018. Once conducted, the review may identify additional  work not in the proposed schedule that needs to be completed before  delivery. For example, Raytheon is conducting a review of hardware  and software obsolescence. If significant additional obsolescence  issues are found that need to be resolved before OCX blocks 1 and 2  are delivered, the projected delivery date may need to be delayed  further at additional cost.", "Third, the OCX contract will likely be modified because the Air Force  needs to incorporate into its contract with Raytheon a number of  changes that are not currently a part of the proposed schedule.  According to Air Force and contractor officials, negotiations are under  way to determine which of these changes will be incorporated before  OCX blocks 1 and 2 are delivered and which may be added after  delivery. Air Force officials said that the incorporation of changes  should be completed by February 2018.", "Schedule risk assessments for OCX blocks 1 and 2 delivery vary, making  it unclear when the full M-code broadcast will finally be operational.  Government assessments of Raytheon\u2019s performance continue to  indicate more schedule delays are likely. Table 4 shows the varying  assessments of potential schedule delays by the Defense Contract  Management Agency and the Air Force to the proposed June 2021  delivery date and the subsequent operational date that occurs 7 months  later.", "In 2015, we made four recommendations to the Secretary of Defense,  one of which was to use outside experts to help identify all underlying  problems on OCX and develop high confidence cost and schedule  estimates, among others, in order to provide information necessary to  make decisions and improve the likelihood of success. To date, none of  these recommendations have been fully implemented but DOD has taken  steps to address some of them. Further, because the Air Force has  undertaken the COps and MCEU programs to provide interim capabilities  to mitigate OCX delays for the full broadcast capability, we are not  making additional recommendations at this time but will continue to  monitor progress and risks to the acquisition of OCX."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Greater Coordination Needed to Prevent Duplication of Effort Developing and Fielding M-code Receivers", "paragraphs": ["While technology development for the M-code receiver cards is  underway, DOD has developed preliminary\u2014but incomplete\u2014plans to  fully develop and field M-code receiver cards across the more than 700  weapon systems that will need to make the transition from the current  technology. DOD has prepared initial cost and schedule estimates for  department-wide fielding for a fraction of these weapon systems. While  the full cost remains unknown, it is likely to be many billions of dollars  greater than the $2.5 billion identified through fiscal year 2021 because  there is significant work remaining to verify the initial cards work as  planned and to develop them further after the MGUE increment 1  program ends. Without greater coordination of integration test results,  lessons learned, and design solutions DOD is at risk of duplicated  development work as multiple weapon system programs separately  mature and field similar technologies on their own. Further, with the full  M-code broadcast available in fiscal year 2022, a gap\u2014the extent of  which is unknown\u2014between operationally broadcasting and receiving M- code exists.

For example, one contractor has achieved its initial security  certification from the Air Force, which is a key step toward making the  MGUE increment 1 receiver test card available for continued  development and eventual procurement. Further, the MGUE increment 1  program is also conducting risk reduction testing in preparation for formal  developmental verification testing, an important step that ensures the  receiver cards meet technical requirements. Programs throughout DOD  can make risk-based decisions to develop and test the receiver test cards  after technical verification of the card\u2019s hardware and software.

For  example, for MGUE increment 1, the Air Force must define additional  technical requirements in order for the M-code receiver cards to be  compatible and communicate with existing weapon systems. The Air  Force will also need to conduct operational tests for each of the lead  platforms\u2014the Stryker ground combat vehicle; B-2 Spirit bomber; JLTV;  and DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyer\u2014before the full M-code signal is  available with OCX. Because these tests will instead be conducted with  the limited signal provided by MCEU, DOD risks discovering issues  several years later once full operational testing is conducted. Further,  according to military service officials and assessments by DOT&E, this  operational testing will only be minimally applicable to other weapon  systems because those other weapon systems have different operational  requirements and integration challenges than the four lead platforms. As  a result, additional development and testing will be necessary on an  undetermined number of the remaining weapon systems to ensure the  receiver cards address each system\u2019s unique interfaces and  requirements. In 2018, DOD will also formally begin development for  MGUE increment 2. Increment 2 will provide more compact receiver  cards to be used when size, weight, and power must be minimized, such  as on handheld receivers, space receivers, and munitions where  increment 1 receiver cards are too large to work.", "The military services are working to mitigate some of these development  challenges. For example, Army officials told us they do not plan to field  MGUE receiver cards on its lead platform, the Stryker, due to ongoing  gaps in technical requirements. In addition, there is not a lead platform to  demonstrate increment 1 on munitions since munition requirements were  planned to be addressed in increment 2. However, to address its needs,  the Army has initiated efforts to modify the MGUE increment 1 receiver  card for some munitions that would otherwise need to wait for MGUE  increment 2 technologies. Individual munition program offices within other  military services have begun to do so as well. According to military  service officials from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, it is essential  that user needs are met by increment 2, or they will have to conduct  additional development and testing. The Army previously identified gaps  in increment 1 that the Air Force has either addressed in increment 1, has  deferred to increment 2, or will need to be addressed outside of the  MGUE increment 1 and 2 programs. Army and Navy officials also stated  that they were concerned that any disagreements in requirements for  increment 2 could lead to further fielding delays.", "Finally, the transition from existing GPS receiver cards to M-code receiver  cards is likely to take many years. We recently reported that transitioning  all DOD platforms to the next generation of receiver cards will likely take  more than a decade. A lengthy transition has happened before, as  previous efforts to modernize GPS to the current receiver cards, begun in  2003, are still underway and the older receiver cards are still being used.  As a result, DOD anticipates that warfighters will have to operate with a  mix of older and newer receiver cards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Begun Cost and Schedule Planning; Full Cost Is Unknown but Likely to be Many Billions of Dollars", "paragraphs": ["DOD has begun collecting preliminary information on M-code  requirements for individual weapon systems. In December 2016, the USD  AT&L directed the military services, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA),  and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to submit implementation  plans with M-code investment priorities across weapon systems and  munitions, including projected costs and schedules. According to DOD,  these M-code implementation plans are intended to provide DOD with a  management and oversight tool for the fielding effort. In February 2017,  each organization submitted its own implementation plan to USD AT&L.", "These plans were then briefed to the PNT Executive Management Board  and PNT Oversight Council in February and March, respectively.", "However, these implementation plans are preliminary and based on  assumptions about the Air Force\u2019s ability to achieve MGUE increment 1  and 2 technical requirements, the timeline required to do so, and the  amount of development and test work that will remain for the receiver  cards to be ready for production and fielding after the programs end.  Since the MGUE increment 2 program has not started development, it  has not yet finalized requirements. Once approved, the increment 2  program office will produce an acquisition strategy, schedule, and cost  estimate. However, after the MGUE increment 2 program ends there is no  detailed plan for completing development, testing, and fielding of M-code  receiver cards for weapon systems across the department.", "DOD has preliminary cost and schedule estimates for some weapon  programs, but lacks a total cost at this point because the department  does not include all efforts initiated by programs to meet specific needs,  including those outside the MGUE increment 1 and 2 programs. The  initial M-code implementation plans responded to what was requested but  do not individually identify what the total cost will be for each organization  to develop and field M-code receiver cards, so a total cost can be  determined across DOD. Because USD AT&L required that the  implementation plans include funding and schedule estimates for 2 to 3  years while directing that plans be resubmitted, at a minimum, every 2  years, weapon systems that will need M-code but were not considered an  immediate priority were not included in the initial submissions. In addition,  the military services, MDA, and SOCOM provided only initial cost  estimates. According to military service officials, these estimates were  based on the current MGUE increment 1 program schedule and technical  development and include risk-based decisions to partially fund specific  programs until the MGUE increment 1 program matures. According to a  USD AT&L official, the plans would both facilitate M-code implementation  planning for the department and inform the issuance of waivers. The  official stated that as the acquisition programs critical to providing M-code  capability mature, future implementations plans should provide more  comprehensive estimates of cost and schedule to achieve M-code  implementation for the department.", "Our analysis of the M-code receiver card implementation plans found that  initial funding estimates indicate a cost of over $2.5 billion to integrate and  procure M-code receiver cards on only a small number of weapon  systems out of the hundreds of types that need M-code receiver cards.  The full cost will be much larger\u2014likely many billions of dollars because  the majority of the weapon systems that need M-code receiver cards are  not funded yet or are only partially funded, according to the M-code  implementation plans. Specifically, the military services, MDA, and  SOCOM identified 716 types of weapon systems in their February 2017  implementation plans that require almost a million M-code receiver cards.  For example, the JLTV fleet\u2014which provides protection for passengers  against current and future battlefield threats for multiple military  services\u2014is one type of weapon system that will eventually need almost  25,000 receiver cards. Of the 716 types of weapon systems that will need  M-code receiver cards, only 28\u2014or less than 4 percent\u2014are fully funded  through fiscal year 2021. The remainder have either partially funded M- code development and integration efforts (72 weapon systems), or do not  yet have funding planned (616 weapon systems). Additionally, the  preliminary estimates to develop and procure M-code receivers on  selected weapon systems do not all include funding beyond fiscal year  2021 that will be needed for further development, integration, and  procurement. This means that DOD and Congress do not have visibility  into how much additional funding could be needed to fully fund the  remaining 96 percent of all weapon systems that need M-code receivers.  Figure 11 shows the M-code development and integration efforts that are  funded, partially funded, or unfunded through fiscal year 2021 across  DOD weapon systems that will need M-code receiver cards.", "Because the implementation plans are a first step toward providing DOD  leadership insight on this large set of acquisitions and they will be  updated at least every 2 years by the different organizations within DOD,  we are not making a recommendation at this time.

DOD has designated the Air Force to lead initial development of both  larger and smaller test cards that other organizations will need to develop  further to meet their individual needs. After the Air Force develops initial  cards for both sizes, the breadth and complexity of this acquisition will  multiply, as the offices responsible for upgrading hundreds of weapon  systems begin their own individual efforts to further develop and test the  cards so they work for the unique needs of their specific system.

We  previously found that duplication occurs when two or more agencies or  programs are engaged in the same activities. In this case, because the  individual organizations and program offices are likely to be pursuing  individual and uncoordinated receiver card programs at different times  with different contractors, DOD is at risk for significant duplication of  effort.

We previously found that the absence of a  formal process for coordination results in the potential for duplication,  overlap, and fragmentation. DOD therefore risks paying to repeatedly  find design solutions to solve common problems because each program  office is likely to undertake its own uncoordinated development effort.  Some duplicated effort may already be occurring. Air Force officials have  expressed concern that work is already being duplicated across the  military services in developing embedded GPS systems to be integrated  into aircraft.

We obtained information dated May 2016 from  the Air Force predicting the reliability for 63 GPS satellites\u2014each of the  31 current (on-orbit as of July 2017) and 32 future GPS satellites\u2014as a  function of time. Each satellite\u2019s total reliability curve defines the  probability that the satellite will still be operational at a given time in the  future. It is generated from the product of two reliability curves\u2014a wear- out reliability curve defined by the cumulative normal distribution, and a  random reliability curve defined by the cumulative Weibull distribution.  For each of the 63 satellites, we obtained the two parameters defining the  cumulative normal distribution, and the two parameters defining the  cumulative Weibull distribution. For each of the 32 unlaunched satellites  we included in our model, we also obtained a parameter defining its  probability of successful launch, and its current scheduled launch date.  The 32 unlaunched satellites include 10 GPS III satellites currently under  contract and 22 GPS III satellites planned for contract award in late 2018;  launch of the final GPS III satellite we included in our model is scheduled  for October 2031.

We then used  our Monte Carlo simulation model to examine the effect of delays to the  operational induction of the GPS III satellites into the constellation. We  reran the model based on month/year delay scenarios, calculating new  probabilities that at least 24 satellites would still be operational as a  function of time, determining in terms of month/year the point at which a  satellite would be required to enter operations to maintain an  uninterrupted maintenance of the 95 percent probability of 24 satellites in  operation.
