Most agencies though, have not yet progressed to the stage that their systems are substantially compliant, and some agencies have made little progress. Accordingly, agencies continue to fall short in their attempts to establish the financial systems needed to create the full range of information needed for effective day-to-day management. In fiscal year 2006, auditors for 17 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported that agencies' financial management systems did not substantially comply with at least one of the three FFMIA requirements. Based on audit reports, GAO identified six types of problems primarily related to agencies' systems. These problems with agency financial systems remain a significant obstacle to supporting effective management of the federal government. With regard to improvement initiatives, GAO noted continued progress in two key areas: (1) agencies' required remediation plans and (2) the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) efforts to address system implementation problems. All 12 of the remediation plans GAO reviewed included corrective actions, but several were missing key elements. Moreover, agencies continue to struggle with efforts to modernize their financial management systems. This problem is particularly acute at the Department of Defense. Agency modernization efforts have been consistently hampered by failure to follow best practices in systems development and implementation, commonly referred to as disciplined processes. As a result, these efforts far too often do not meet cost, schedule, and performance goals. To help address these problems, OMB has demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of the financial management line of business initiative.

The CFO Act laid  the foundation for a comprehensive reform of federal financial  management by establishing a leadership structure, requiring audited  financial statements, and strengthening accountability reporting. This act  also requires agencies to implement modern financial management  systems in order to attain the systematic measurement of performance;  the development of cost information; and the integration of program,  budget, and financial information for management reporting.

This series of legislation started with  the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), which the  Congress passed to strengthen internal controls and accounting systems  throughout the federal government, among other purposes. Issued  pursuant to FMFIA, the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government provides the standards that are  directed at helping agency managers implement effective internal control,  an integral part of improving financial management systems. Internal  control is a major part of managing an organization and comprises the  plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions, goals, and  objectives. In summary, internal control helps government program  managers achieve desired results through effective management of public  resources.", "Effective internal control also helps in managing change to cope with  shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities. As programs  change and agencies strive to enhance operational processes and  implement new technological developments, management must  continually assess and evaluate its internal control to ensure that the  control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.  While agencies had achieved some early success in identifying and  correcting material internal control and accounting system weaknesses,  their efforts to implement FMFIA had not produced the results intended  by the Congress.", "Therefore, beginning in the 1990s, the Congress passed additional  management reform legislation to improve the general and financial  management of the federal government. This legislation includes the        (1) CFO Act of 1990, (2) Government Performance and Results Act of  1993, (3) Government Management Reform Act of 1994, (4) FFMIA,      (5) Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, (6) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of  2002, (7) Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, (8) The Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002, and (9) Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) Financial Accountability Act of 2004. The  combination of reforms ushered in by these laws, if successfully  implemented, provides a solid foundation to improve the accountability of  government programs and operations as well as to routinely produce  valuable cost and operating performance information. These financial  management reform acts emphasize the importance of improving financial  management of the federal government.", "In particular, building on the foundation laid by the CFO Act, FFMIA  emphasizes the need for CFO Act agencies to have systems that ensure  ongoing accountability and generate reliable, useful, and timely  information for decision-making purposes. FFMIA requires the  departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and  maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with    (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable  federal accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction level.  FFMIA also requires auditors to state in their CFO Act financial statement  audit reports whether the agencies\u2019 financial management systems  substantially comply with these three FFMIA systems requirements.

Specifically, this guidance calls for auditors to provide  negative assurance when reporting on an agency system\u2019s FFMIA  compliance. Second, in the OMB Memorandum, Revised Implementation  Guidance for the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act        (Jan. 4, 2001), OMB provides guidance for agencies and auditors to use in  assessing substantial compliance. The guidance describes some of the  factors that should be considered in determining whether an agency\u2019s  systems substantially comply with FFMIA\u2019s three requirements and  examples of indicators that should be used in assessing whether an  agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance with each of the three  FFMIA requirements.

These sections include detailed audit steps for testing  agency systems\u2019 substantial compliance with the requirements of FFMIA.", "As detailed in appendix V, we have also issued a series of checklists to  help assess whether agencies\u2019 systems meet systems requirements. The  FAM guidance on FFMIA assessments recognizes that while financial  statement audits offer some assurance on FFMIA compliance, auditors  should design and implement additional testing to satisfy FFMIA criteria.  For example, in performing financial statement audits, auditors generally  focus on the ability of the financial management systems to process and  summarize financial information that flows into annual agency financial  statements. In contrast, FFMIA requires auditors to assess whether an  agency\u2019s financial management systems comply with system requirements,  accounting standards, and the SGL. To do this, auditors need to consider  whether agency systems provide reliable, useful, and timely information  for managing day-to-day operations so that agency managers would have  the necessary information to measure performance on an ongoing basis  rather than just at year end. Further, OMB\u2019s current audit guidance calls  for financial statement auditors to review performance information for  consistency with the financial statements, but does not require auditors to  determine whether this information is available to managers for day-to-day  decision making as called for by the FAM guidance for testing compliance  with FFMIA.

To determine whether the data were sufficiently reliable, we  performed the following procedures. We gained an understanding of the  quality control environments at the respective IGs; leveraged our  understanding of the methodology used by the IGs and their contract  auditors in past years to reach conclusions with respect to FFMIA  compliance at the respective agencies; considered management responses  to the auditor\u2019s findings and conclusions; and asked questions to improve  our understanding of the procedures applied and/or conclusions drawn,  where appropriate. We also reviewed the data for obvious inconsistencies  or errors, completeness, and changes from the prior year. When we found  data which were inconsistent or incomplete we brought them to the  attention of the cognizant IG staff and worked with them to resolve any  issues before using the data as a basis for this report. When we  encountered data that varied from the prior year, we reviewed the PAR  and/or IPA report to determine the reason for the change.

The problems identified in these reports are consistent with  long-standing financial management weaknesses we have reported based  on our work at a number of agencies. However, we caution that the  occurrence of problems in a particular category may be even greater than  auditors\u2019 reports of FFMIA noncompliance would suggest, because  auditors may not have identified all instances of noncompliance with  systems requirements and included all problems in their reports. Further,  we identified other GAO and IG reports that discussed financial  management systems issues and summarized the reports. We also  obtained data from agencies\u2019 annual PAR reports. We also met with OMB  officials to discuss their current efforts to improve federal financial  management and address our prior recommendations related to FFMIA. In  addition, we reviewed documentation provided by OMB regarding its  current initiatives.", "We conducted our work from January through June 2007, in accordance  with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

Most agency systems, though, are not yet substantially in  compliance with FFMIA\u2019s requirements. As shown in figure 3, IGs and  their contract auditors reported for fiscal year 2006 that 17 of the 24 CFO  Act agencies did not substantially comply with at least one of FFMIA\u2019s  three requirements\u2014federal financial management systems requirements,  applicable federal accounting standards, or the SGL at the transaction  level.

However, it would be erroneous to assume  that statements of negative assurance provided by auditors for the six  agencies equate to compliance with FFMIA. Auditors\u2019 assessments for  three agencies changed from fiscal year 2005 to 2006. For fiscal year 2006,  auditors for GSA provided negative assurance that GSA\u2019s financial  management systems, as a whole, were substantially compliant with  FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. Auditors for AID provided positive assurance  that AID\u2019s financial management systems complied with FFMIA in fiscal  year 2006. In fiscal year 2005, both AID and GSA were deemed  noncompliant with FFMIA by the independent auditors. According to  management, AID was able to become compliant due to completion of  outstanding remediation items and the worldwide deployment of its  financial management system. Conversely, auditors for the Department of  Labor (Labor) reported that Labor\u2019s financial management systems did not  substantially comply with FFMIA requirements in fiscal year 2006, but had  provided positive assurance of FFMIA compliance in fiscal year 2005. The  change was primarily due to weaknesses Labor auditors identified  concerning general computer access controls, application access controls,  and related manual controls."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FFMIA Guidance Issues", "paragraphs": ["Auditors for six agencies (Commerce, EPA, GSA, NSF, OPM, and SSA)  provided negative assurance that the agencies\u2019 systems were compliant  with FFMIA requirements. Auditors provide negative assurance when they  state that nothing came to their attention during the course of their  planned procedures to indicate that the agency\u2019s financial management  systems did not meet FFMIA requirements. Although OMB\u2019s current audit  guidance instructs auditors to test for compliance with FFMIA, it does  not provide guidance on the nature and extent of tests to be performed. It  calls for auditors to provide negative assurance when reporting whether  an agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance with the three FFMIA  requirements. However, financial statement users not familiar with the  concept of negative assurance may incorrectly assume that these six  agencies\u2019 systems have been fully tested by the auditors and that the  agencies have achieved FFMIA compliance. In addition, without  adequately testing systems for FFMIA compliance in a manner that is  sufficient to support an opinion, auditors may not identify all areas of  noncompliance; therefore, the number of problems may be even greater  than those currently disclosed in auditors\u2019 reports on FFMIA compliance  based on negative assurance.", "As we have previously reported, from our perspective, FFMIA requires  auditors to provide positive assurance, which is an opinion. Section 803  (b) (1) of FFMIA requires auditors to \u201creport whether the agency financial  management systems comply with the requirements of .\u201d  Providing positive assurance on FFMIA compliance involves additional  testing to determine whether an agency\u2019s financial management systems  comply substantially with systems requirements, the SGL at the  transaction level, and accounting standards. The procedures necessary to  provide such assurance go beyond those needed for performing a financial  statement audit. While financial statement audits in general will offer some  assurance on FFMIA compliance, auditors should also design and  implement additional testing to satisfy the criteria in FFMIA. For example,  in fiscal year 2006, agency auditors for AID stated that they interviewed  staff and contract personnel and reviewed documentation related to the  capabilities of Phoenix, AID\u2019s core financial system. According to AID  auditors, they examined documentation, including reports, system queries,  system screen captures, testing documents generated during system  implementation, and documents generated for certification and  accreditation activity in order to determine if the implemented systems  provide complete, accurate, and timely information for managing day-to- day operations necessary to achieve positive assurance. When reporting  an agency\u2019s financial management systems to be in substantial  compliance, positive assurance from independent auditors can provide  users with confidence that the agency systems provide the reliable, useful,  and timely information envisioned by the act. The fact that AID\u2019s auditors  provided positive assurance on FFMIA compliance is a noteworthy  achievement.", "In addition, performing audit procedures designed to provide positive  assurance of an agency\u2019s financial management systems\u2019 substantial  compliance with FFMIA requirements can identify weaknesses and lead to  improvements that enhance the performance, productivity, and efficiency  of federal financial management systems in support of day-to-day  managerial decision making. It also provides a clear \u201cbottom line,\u201d  whereas negative assurance does not. Some auditors we interviewed in  prior years indicated that a revision to OMB\u2019s guidance on FFMIA  reporting would be necessary for them to provide an opinion of FFMIA  compliance. Therefore, as we have discussed in prior reports covering  fiscal years 2000 through 2005, we continue to believe that our prior  recommendation for OMB to require agency auditors to thoroughly  examine agencies\u2019 financial management systems and provide a statement  of positive assurance when reporting an agency\u2019s systems to be in  substantial compliance with the three FFMIA systems requirements is  appropriate and required. Doing so will be key to achieving the act\u2019s goal  of effective financial management systems across government.", "However, OMB has not concurred with our recommendation in its  responses to our prior reports and in its comments on a draft of this  report. For example, last year, in response to our report on fiscal year  2005 FFMIA results, OMB stated that the broad scope of the President\u2019s  Management Agenda and the fundamental changes occurring under the  Financial Management Line of Business initiative, combined with  strengthened reporting requirements under Circular No. A-123, are helping  agencies identify and correct FFMIA deficiencies. In that context, OMB  reiterated its belief that requiring a statement of positive assurance would  prove only marginally useful.", "Further, as we have previously reported, a number of auditors have  expressed a need for clarification on the definition of \u201csubstantial  compliance.\u201d They cited a need for additional guidance to assist them in  assessing whether agency systems substantially comply with the three  FFMIA requirements. The auditors reported a need for clearer guidance  from OMB on assessing FFMIA compliance that is consistent with the  GAO/PCIE FAM. As a result, we continue to believe that implementation  of our recommendation for OMB to explore clarifying the definition of  \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d would be useful. Other related concerns of  agency auditors included a need for (1) more clearly defined and objective  criteria to assist in their determination of FFMIA compliance, (2) more  specific guidance on testing and sampling methodologies, and   (3) additional guidance for assessing compliance with certain accounting  standards, such as the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting  Standards (SFFAS) No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and  Standards for the Federal Government. In its comments on prior reports,  OMB stated that its growing experience helping agencies implement the  PMA enables it to refine the existing FFMIA indicators associated with  substantial compliance.

While at some agencies, the problems  were so serious that they affected the auditor\u2019s opinion on the agency\u2019s  financial statements, at other agencies, the auditors cited problems that  represented significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal  control, but were not material to the financial statements as a whole.", "Figure 4 shows the relative frequency of these problems at the agencies  reported to have noncompliant systems from fiscal years 2002 through  2006. The same six types of problems have been cited by auditors although  the auditors may not have reported these problems as specific reasons for  their systems\u2019 lack of substantial compliance with FFMIA\u2019s requirements.  Some agencies have made little progress addressing these areas.

A number of those corrective actions involve  implementing new financial management systems, which over time has  proven to be very challenging. Efforts to modernize financial management  systems have often exceeded budgeted costs, experienced delays in  delivery dates, and not provided the anticipated system functionality and  performance. This problem is particularly serious at the Department of  Defense. To help provide a governmentwide solution, OMB has developed  the financial management line of business (FMLOB) initiative. While  progress has been made in defining standard business processes and  issuing draft guidance to facilitate a smooth transition to shared service  providers, the FMLOB initiative involves complex issues that have far- reaching implications for the government and private sector shared  service providers.

However, these efforts  far too often result in systems that do not meet their cost, schedule, and  performance goals. While agencies anticipate that the new systems will  provide reliable, useful, and timely data to support managerial decision  making, our work and that of others has shown that has often not been the  case. For example, many of DOD\u2019s over 2,000 business systems are  nonintegrated, stove piped, and not capable of providing departmental  management and the Congress accurate and reliable information on DOD\u2019s  day-to-day operations. For decades, DOD has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems. In 1995, we designated DOD\u2019s  business systems modernization program as high-risk, and we continue to  designate it as such in our most recent high-risk report. In another case,  HHS has been plagued with systems implementation issues with its  Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) from inception.

DHS halted implementation of the Electronically  Managing Enterprise Resources for Government Effectiveness and  Efficiency (Emerge2) program in December 2005, which was expected to  integrate financial management systems across the entire department and  to address its financial management weaknesses. DHS officials have stated  that approximately $52 million in total was spent on the Emerge2 project  before it was halted. In fiscal year 2006, we testified and provided an  assessment of the status of DHS\u2019s efforts to modernize its financial  management systems. In early March 2007, DHS officials issued a high- level plan to address the existing internal control weaknesses. However, as  we recently reported and testified, more detailed implementation  strategies will be necessary to fully address the financial management  system challenges. DHS has received permission from OMB to leverage its  current investments by consolidating and migrating components to either  the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) or Customs and Border  Protection financial management systems models. Our concern is that  these components have numerous financial management weaknesses. For  example, auditors for TSA reported that they were unable to provide  sufficient evidential matter or make knowledgeable representations to  support fiscal year 2005 and 2006 transactions and account balances,  particularly for budgetary accounting and undelivered orders, and  property, plant, and equipment, among others.", "The Department of Justice has developed plans for a Unified Financial  Management System (UFMS) intended to correct many of its financial  accounting and reporting issues.

The department\u2019s efforts over the past few  years to implement the UFMS to replace the seven major accounting  systems currently used throughout the department have been challenging.  For example, 2 years after the department selected a vendor for the  unified system, problems with funding, staff turnover, and other  competing priorities caused delays in implementation of the new system.  As of September 2006, none of Justice\u2019s accounting systems were  integrated with each other.

We have long  supported and called for initiatives to standardize and streamline common  systems, which can reduce costs and, if done correctly, improve  accountability. Likewise, OMB has correctly recognized that enhancing the  government\u2019s ability to implement financial management systems that are  capable of providing accurate, reliable, and timely information on the  results of operations needs to be addressed as a governmentwide solution,  rather than individual agency stove-piped efforts designed to meet a given  entity\u2019s needs. The FMLOB is a work in progress, and OMB has not yet  fully defined and implemented the processes necessary to successfully  complete it. In our March 2006 report, we recommended that careful  consideration of the following four concepts, each one building upon the  former, would be integral to the success of OMB\u2019s FMLOB initiative and  could help break the cycle of failure in implementing financial  management systems. The four concepts were (1) developing a concept of  operations, (2) defining standard business processes, (3) developing a  strategy for ensuring that agencies migrate to a limited number of service  providers in accordance with OMB\u2019s stated approach, and (4) defining and  effectively implementing disciplined processes necessary to properly  manage the specific projects.", "OMB has taken steps to develop the foundational guidance needed for the  FMLOB, but many challenging tasks remain. As we reported last year,  OMB has designated four federal agencies as shared service providers;  released a competition framework in May 2006; issued migration planning  guidance in September 2006; and encouraged private sector providers that  can satisfy the shared services requirements to participate in the  procurement process for these services. In November 2006, OMB released  an exposure draft of a common governmentwide accounting classification  structure that may address lack of standardization among agency  accounts. A critical factor for this project will be the ability to develop an  approach that captures all stakeholders\u2019 needs with minimal redundancy  and complexity.", "In addition, OMB and the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO)  have also developed and released an exposure draft for the funds control  standard business process and the payment management standard  business process. Further, in March 2007, the Financial Services  Assessment Guide (SAG) was issued to establish a set of financial service  metrics to facilitate an assessment of opportunities to improve  performance and affordability of financial services provided by shared  service providers and federal agencies. In order to promote consistency  among agencies and service providers, starting June 15, 2007, and every  month thereafter, OMB is requiring monthly reporting from all agencies on  their performance data through a single system managed by FSIO,  including data for each system listed as a core financial management  system.", "Furthermore, FSIO released its core financial system product compliance  test policy, documenting the specific core financial systems qualifications  test policy and procedures starting in 2007. This new policy provided  detailed information about each test, including schedule, scope, and  requirements to be tested. This is a useful tool to promote consistency in  core financial systems governmentwide, clarify the system requirements,  and reduce the risk that agencies will acquire noncompliant or ineffective  core financial system software. This, though, does not eliminate the need  for agencies to conduct comprehensive testing efforts to ensure that  financial system software meets their requirements, and the  implementation of FSIO-tested software does not guarantee that the  agencies will have financial systems that are compliant with FFMIA.", "While much has been accomplished by OMB, many important issues  remain unresolved. For example, one of the recommendations in our  March 2006 report called for a concept of operations to provide the  foundation for the FMLOB. An effective concept of operations would  describe, at a high level, (1) how all of the various elements of federal  financial systems and mixed systems relate to each other and (2) how  information flows from and through these systems. A concept of  operations would provide a useful tool to explain how financial  management systems at the agency and governmentwide levels can  operate cohesively. It would be geared to a governmentwide solution  rather than individual agency stove-piped efforts. Because the federal  government does not have an overall concept of operations, there is no  clear understanding of the interrelationships among federal financial  systems and how the shared service provider concept fits into this  framework. OMB officials recognize that standardization is important and  are developing a standard set of business processes in four areas: funds  control, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and financial reporting. In  addition, as the FMLOB initiative moves forward, there are numerous  additional areas where standardization is also important, such as  inventory, supplies, and material management, as well as the loan  management areas. Absent this standardization, shared service providers  have been designated without common business rules and potential  customer agencies continue to implement and operate individual stove- piped systems that may require additional work to adopt these processes.", "Further, as we reported in September 2006, there are a number of factors  that affect FFMIA compliance, including the quality of transaction data in  agency feeder systems; the success of converting data from legacy  systems; and the interaction of people, process, and technology within an  agency\u2019s environment. The shared service provider concept, if adopted,  will still require that agencies address long-standing human capital  problems and develop long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and  retaining an organization\u2019s total workforce to meet the needs of the future.  To date, none of the major CFO Act agencies has moved to an OMB- designated shared service provider to handle their financial management  system activities, although some agencies, such as DOT, GSA, and NRC  were already using the shared service provider concept prior to OMB\u2019s  financial management line of business initiative. In addition, other  agencies such as Labor, use a commercial shared service provider to  provide hosting and operations and maintenance services. There are some  major CFO Act agencies, such as EPA, HUD, Agriculture, and OPM that  are in the process of selecting a shared service provider for full financial  management systems activities. OMB officials told us that a successful  FMLOB outcome would be for agencies to solicit for government or  commercial shared service providers, identify the best value, and move  forward in the FMLOB process. Whether agencies move to a shared  service provider or implement their own systems, they must have  disciplined processes in place to achieve the intended results, within  established resources, and on schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comptroller General Convening Forum on FFMIA Issues", "paragraphs": ["To address the challenges CFO agency managers and auditors face in  implementing and maintaining financial management systems that meet  the intent of the CFO Act and the requirements of FFMIA, we are  convening a Comptroller General forum later this year in Washington, D.C.

OMB  stated that it was working aggressively to assist agencies in building a  strong foundation for financial management practices and also applauded  our plans to convene a forum on these issues.", "As in previous years, we and OMB have differing views on the necessity of  agency auditors providing a statement of positive assurance when  reporting agency systems to be in substantial compliance with the  requirements of FFMIA. OMB stated that its three major initiatives, the  PMA, FMLOB, and the revised Circular No. A-123, are helping agencies  identify and correct FFMIA deficiencies. Further, OMB stated that many of  the ongoing assessments required under the revised Circular No. A-123  mirror the types of assessments that would occur in establishing a  statement of positive assurance under FFMIA. As a result, OMB believed  that requiring a statement of positive assurance would be costly and would  not provide additional information that would be of benefit to the federal  agency, OMB, or the taxpayer.", "While we agree that these initiatives are helping drive improvements,  auditors need to consider other aspects of financial management systems  when assessing FFMIA compliance that are not fully addressed through  the current reporting structure. For example, in preparing the PMA  scorecard assessments, OMB officials meet with agencies to discuss a  number of financial management issues and have systems demonstrations.  Our concern is that some of the information provided by this approach  does not come under audit scrutiny and may not be reliable. Similarly,  internal control assessments performed under Circular No. A-123 are  management\u2019s judgments and are subject to an opinion-level review by  independent auditors only in limited circumstances. An opinion by an  independent auditor on FFMIA compliance would confirm whether an  agency\u2019s systems substantially met the requirements of FFMIA and could  also provide additional confidence in the information provided as a result  of the PMA, FMLOB, and Circular No. A-123 initiatives. In our view,  confidence that agency financial management systems provide reliable,  useful, and timely information to help government leaders invest  resources, oversee programs, and reduce costs, would be of significant  value to the federal agency, OMB, the Congress, and the taxpayer.  Moreover, to minimize the cost of providing an audit opinion, the  GAO/PCIE Financial Audit Manual includes a number of techniques that  auditors can use to reduce the incremental cost of providing positive  assurance.
