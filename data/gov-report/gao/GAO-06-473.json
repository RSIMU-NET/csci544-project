DOD officials agree that operational criteria are typically established and met prior to declaring a system operational, and that planning for new systems includes identifying personnel requirements, developing training programs, and identifying logistics and maintenance requirements. DOD has developed BMDS procedures and guidance, created an organization to integrate planning and operational support, and conducted some training and exercises. However, DOD has not established formal criteria for declaring that limited defensive operations or subsequent blocks of capability are operational or completed planning for security, training, and personnel. DOD has not done this because it is developing BMDS in a unique way and BMDS is exempted from traditional requirements guidance. Without specific operational criteria, the Secretary of Defense will not be in a sound position to objectively assess combatant commands' and services' preparations to conduct BMDS operations nor have a transparent basis for declaring BMDS operational, which will become more important as capabilities are added in subsequent blocks and Congress considers requests to fund operations. Without adequate planning, clear criteria, and identification of responsibility for ensuring necessary actions have been completed, it may be difficult for DOD to identify and prioritize actions, assure itself or Congress that the necessary pieces are in place before declaring the system operational, and determine whether the return on its significant development investment in BMDS can be realized. The FYDP, a major source of budget information, does not provide complete and transparent data on ballistic missile defense operational costs. DOD and GAO have repeatedly recognized the need to link resources to capabilities to facilitate decision making and oversight. However, complete and transparent ballistic missile defense operational costs are not visible in the FYDP because the FYDP's structure does not provide a way to identify and aggregate these costs. Four primary factors impair the visibility of ballistic missile defense operational costs in the current FYDP structure: (1) operational costs are included in many program elements and there is no mechanism to link and compile these costs, (2) the Missile Defense Agency is authorized to use research and development funds to pay for operational costs, (3) DOD has not included all known operational costs in its budget estimates, and (4) DOD has not identified all costs associated with the New Triad, of which BMDS is an important part. Without the ability to identify and assess total ballistic missile defense operational costs, neither the Secretary of Defense nor Congress has complete information to make funding and trade-off decisions among competing priorities; provide assurance that ballistic missile defense capabilities are affordable over time; and assess the costs of employing the New Triad."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has spent about $91 billion since the  mid-1980s to develop the capability to intercept and destroy incoming  ballistic missiles.

According to U.S. Strategic Command  officials, BMDS elements at the highest security level require, for example,  two lines of defensive security, including sensor fences and sufficient  personnel to achieve a specific response rate; integrated electronic  security systems; entry control; and access delay and denial systems.  These measures are expensive\u2014the Missile Defense Agency estimated  that security measures for three BMDS elements will cost about $350  million over fiscal years 2006-2011. However, Office of the Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Joint Staff, and other  DOD officials said that service estimates of security requirements  (personnel and costs) are generally higher and that some of these costs are  not budgeted by either the services or the Missile Defense Agency.  Furthermore, although U.S. Strategic Command has oversight  responsibility and has conducted some security inspections, Command  officials told us that ensuring security requirements are met will actually  be done by a service or the combatant command where the element is  located.", "As discussed above, the U.S. Strategic Command and the Joint Staff  recommended that the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics assign a \u201clead service\u201d for each  BMDS element that would be responsible for providing security, ensuring  security standards are met, and budgeting for any associated costs in the  next Future Years Defense Program (which will be for fiscal years 2008- 13). Although negotiations on this issue are ongoing, the Missile Defense  Agency agreed in December 2005 to fund the sea-based radar and forward- based radar costs for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, Air Force Cobra Dane  radar costs for fiscal year 2007, and contractor logistic support through  fiscal year 2013. However, DOD officials stated that there are significant  disagreements between the services and the Missile Defense Agency over  the levels of support and force protection required. Further, the services  and the Missile Defense Agency have not resolved disagreements over  which organization will fund operational costs or which organization will  provide and fund force protection beyond fiscal year 2007. It is not clear  whether the recent designation of lead service for only two BMDS  elements will help resolve these issues in time to be reflected in the  development of the fiscal years 2008-13 Future Years Defense Program.", "Funding issues could prevent DOD from meeting security requirements at  some locations before the system is declared operational. For example,  both Vandenberg and Schreiver Air Force Bases require a combination of  additional security personnel and technology improvements to meet  security requirements. Although some personnel were recently added and  the Air Force has requested funding for the technology improvements, as  of February 8, 2006, not all the required personnel and technology were in  place. The Army also had to increase the military police unit to protect the  missile fields at Fort Greely, Alaska, and the cost for snow removal is  nearly a million dollars a year. Security will become increasingly important  and costly as additional BMDS elements are placed in more locations,  particularly those outside the continental United States (see table 2). For  example, DOD is planning a third site for the ground-based element and is  planning for four forward-based radars, and officials have noted that the  estimated cost for protecting the forward-based radar could double for  austere locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combatant Commands\u2019 Training Plans and Readiness Assessments for BMDS Are Evolving", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has made progress in developing some training, the training  plans prepared by the combatant commands under the Joint Training  System are evolving as are readiness assessments for BMDS.

A further complication is that some of these program elements  also include costs for items that are not related to ballistic missile defense.  For example, one program element entitled Theater Missile Defense is  defined as including costs for theater missiles of all classes, including  tactical, cruise, and air-to-surface missiles. Another program element  includes all costs for all the Navy\u2019s destroyers, and does not distinguish  the 15 destroyers that DOD will operate to perform the ballistic missile  defense mission.

However, officials we spoke with from the Office of Secretary of Defense,  Comptroller and Program, Analysis, and Evaluation said that this practice  makes it much more difficult to derive an accurate estimate of operational  costs, because the research and development funds come from a different  appropriation and are not typically used to pay operational costs.

Considering that there is no common methodology  to identify and aggregate BMDS operational costs, we continue to believe  that corrective action is needed so that Congress and DOD have adequate  information to assess whether DOD\u2019s plans to field ballistic missile  defense capabilities are affordable. Complete and transparent BMDS  operational cost information is important to assess cost trends over time,  particularly as an increasing number of BMDS elements are fielded during  the next several years. Without this information, neither DOD nor  Congress will have the benefit of complete and adequate data to make  fully informed trade-off decisions within projected defense spending  levels. With respect to DOD\u2019s nonconcurrence on our previous  recommendation to account for New Triad costs in the FYDP, we note that  the Report of the House Armed Services Committee on the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 directed the Secretary of  Defense to modify the FYDP to identify and aggregate program elements  associated with the New Triad which, as we state in this report, includes  ballistic missile defense.", "We continue to believe that the specific actions we recommended are  needed for DOD to prepare for conducting BMDS operations and to assist  in DOD and congressional oversight of ballistic missile defense  operational costs. Because DOD did not indicate that it plans to implement  our recommendations, we have added a matter for Congress to consider  directing DOD to develop a comprehensive plan which includes  operational criteria and to develop a structure within the FYDP to identify  all ballistic missile defense operational costs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Commander, U.S. Strategic Command; the Commander, U.S. Northern  Command; and the Director, Missile Defense Agency. We will make copies  available to others upon request.

During this  review, we focused on assessing issues DOD faces in planning to operate  the BMDS such as operational criteria, training, security, and cost  transparency. We did not evaluate DOD\u2019s testing plans, research and  development programs, or the technical effectiveness of individual  elements as we have addressed these issues in other reports. Specifically,  we have issued two reports on the status of BMDS that included  assessments of program goals, testing plans, and progress in developing  each element. Our March 2005 report found that system performance  remains uncertain and unverified because DOD has not successfully  conducted an end-to-end flight test using operationally representative  hardware and software.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress in planning to operate the BMDS, we obtained  and reviewed relevant documents on ballistic missile defense operations  such as the National Security Presidential Directive 23 dated December  16, 2002; the Unified Command Plan dated January 10, 2003; various  combatant command contingency plans; BMDS Tactical Handbook;  various Joint Staff orders; DOD, Joint Staff, U.S. Strategic Command, and  service instructions and regulations; DOD memoranda providing guidance  for implementing the ballistic missile defense program; Integrated Training  Working Group briefings; Missile Defense Agency briefings and documents  explaining program status and plans; and briefings by DOD officials. We  also observed an exercise that involved the services and combatant  commands.", "To identify areas where planning was incomplete, we compared what DOD  had done with the planning principles for new weapon systems embodied   in DOD acquisition and requirements guidance and service instructions  and training plans explained in DOD\u2019s Joint Training System. We then  discussed the results of our comparisons with officials in the U.S. Strategic  Command; the Army\u2019s Space and Missile Defense Command; Office of the  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; Joint  Staff; and Missile Defense Agency.", "To determine the extent to which the FYDP provides complete and  transparent data on ballistic missile defense operational costs, we  analyzed the FYDP structure to determine whether it was designed to  readily identify the program elements that contain ballistic missile defense  operational costs and assessed whether these FYDP program elements  included all BMDS elements. In addition, we obtained and reviewed  documentation at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Army,  Navy, and Air Force to identify program elements that would include  ballistic missile defense operational costs. We met with DOD officials from  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Office of the  Director, Program, Analysis, and Evaluation, and the Office of the  Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to  discuss our approach and they agreed it was reasonable. We assessed the  reliability of the data by corroborating our list of defense mission  categories and some program elements with knowledgeable agency  officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "In addition, other organizations we visited to gain an understanding of  their roles in operating elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense System  included the Joint Staff, U.S. Army Headquarters and Space and Missile  Defense Command, the office of the Chief of Naval Operations\u2019 Surface  Warfare division, Air Force Headquarters and Space Command, the office  of the National Guard Bureau, the Army National Guard, and the Air  National Guard. To document how various commands would employ  BMDS in performing the ballistic missile defense mission, we met with  officials from the U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Nebraska, and the  U.S. Northern Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and observed an  exercise.", "We provided a draft of this report to DOD for their review and  incorporated their comments where appropriate.
