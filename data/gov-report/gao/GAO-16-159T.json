GAO submitted, or attempted to submit, 18 fictitious applications by telephone and online, 10 of which tested controls related to obtaining subsidized health-plan coverage available through the federal Marketplace in New Jersey and North Dakota, and through state marketplaces in California and Kentucky. GAO chose these four states based partly on a range of population sizes and whether the state had expanded Medicaid eligibility under terms of the act. The other 8 applications, among the 18 GAO made, tested marketplace and state controls under the marketplace system for determining Medicaid eligibility in these four states. The undercover results, while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of enrollees.

These verification steps include reviewing and validating information about an applicant's Social Security number, if one is provided; citizenship, status as a national or lawful presence; and household income and family size.", "For 10 fictitious applicants, GAO tested application and enrollment controls for obtaining subsidized health plans available through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace) (for New Jersey and North Dakota) and two selected state marketplaces (California and Kentucky). Although 8 of these 10 fictitious applications failed the initial identity-checking process, all 10 were subsequently approved by the federal Marketplace or the selected state marketplaces. Four applications used Social Security numbers that, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA), have never been issued, such as numbers starting with \u201c000.\u201d Other applicants had duplicate enrollment or claimed their employer did not provide insurance that meets minimum essential coverage.", "For 8 additional fictitious applicants, GAO tested enrollment into Medicaid through the same federal Marketplace and the two selected state marketplaces, and was able to obtain either Medicaid or alternative subsidized coverage for 7 of the 8 applicants. Specifically:", "Three were approved for Medicaid, which was the health-care program for which GAO originally sought approval. In each case, GAO provided identity information that would not have matched SSA records. For two applications, the marketplace directed the fictitious applicants to submit supporting documents, which GAO did (such as a fake immigration card), and the applications were approved. For the third, the marketplace did not seek supporting documentation, and the application was approved by phone.", "For four, GAO did not obtain approval for Medicaid; however, GAO was subsequently able to gain approval of subsidized health plans based on the inability to obtain Medicaid coverage. In 1 case, GAO falsely claimed that it was denied Medicaid in order to obtain the subsidized health plan when in fact no Medicaid determination had been made by the state at that time.", "For one, GAO was unable to enroll into Medicaid, in California, because GAO declined to provide a Social Security number. According to California officials, the state marketplace requires a Social Security number or taxpayer-identification number to process applications.", "According to officials from the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS), California, Kentucky, and North Dakota, the marketplaces and Medicaid offices only inspect for supporting documentation that has obviously been altered. Thus, if the documentation submitted does not show such signs, it would not be questioned for authenticity. GAO's work is continuing, and GAO plans to issue a final report at a later date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss enrollment for health-care  coverage obtained through the health-insurance exchanges, or  marketplaces, established under the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA) and, in particular, to discuss the preliminary results of  our undercover testing of eligibility and enrollment controls for the federal  Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace) and selected state  marketplaces for the 2015 coverage year. PPACA provides subsidies to  those eligible to purchase private health-insurance plans who meet  certain income and other requirements. With those subsidies and other  costs, the act represents a significant, long-term fiscal commitment for the  federal government. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the  estimated cost of subsidies and related spending under the act is $60  billion for fiscal year 2016, rising to $105 billion for fiscal year 2025, and  totaling $880 billion for fiscal years 2016\u20132025.", "While subsidies under the act are not paid directly to enrollees,  participants nevertheless benefit financially through reduced monthly  premiums or lower costs due at time of service, such as copayments.  Because subsidy costs are contingent on who obtains coverage,  enrollment controls that help ensure only qualified applicants are  approved for subsidized coverage are a key factor in determining federal  expenditures under the act. In addition, PPACA provided for the  expansion of the Medicaid program. Under the expansion, states may  choose to provide Medicaid coverage to nonelderly adults who meet  income limits and other criteria. Under PPACA, the federal government is  to fully reimburse states through fiscal year 2016 for the Medicaid  expenditures of \u201cnewly eligible\u201d individuals who gained Medicaid eligibility  through the expansion. According to the Office of the Actuary of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), federal expenditures  for the Medicaid expansion are estimated at $430 billion from 2014  through 2023.", "PPACA provides for the establishment of health-insurance marketplaces  to assist consumers in comparing and selecting among insurance plans  offered by participating private issuers of health-care coverage. Under  PPACA, states may elect to operate their own health-care marketplaces,  or they may rely on the federal Marketplace, known to the public as  HealthCare.gov. These marketplaces were intended to provide a single  point of access for individuals to enroll in private health plans, apply for  income-based subsidies to offset the cost of these plans\u2014which, as  noted, are paid directly to health-insurance issuers\u2014and, as applicable,  obtain an eligibility determination or assessment of eligibility for other  health-coverage programs, such as Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program. CMS, a unit of the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the establishment of these  online marketplaces, and the agency maintains the federal Marketplace.", "To be eligible to enroll in a \u201cqualified health plan\u201d offered through a  marketplace\u2014that is, one providing essential health benefits and meeting  other requirements under PPACA\u2014an individual must be a U.S. citizen or  national, or otherwise lawfully present in the United States; reside in the  marketplace service area; and not be incarcerated (unless incarcerated  while awaiting disposition of charges). To be eligible for Medicaid,  individuals must meet federal requirements regarding residency, U.S.  citizenship or immigration status, and income limits, as well as any  additional state-specific criteria that may apply.", "Marketplaces are required by PPACA to verify application information to  determine eligibility for enrollment and, if applicable, determine eligibility  for the income-based subsidies or Medicaid. These verification steps  include validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number, if one is  provided; verifying citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence  by comparison with Social Security Administration or Department of  Homeland Security records; and verifying household income and family  size by comparison with tax-return data from the Internal Revenue  Service, as well as data on Social Security benefits from the Social  Security Administration.", "In light of the government\u2019s substantial fiscal commitment under the act,  congressional requesters originally asked us to examine enrollment and  verification controls of the federal Marketplace. In July 2014, we  presented testimony on the results of our initial work, which focused on  application for, and approval of, coverage for fictitious applicants for the  2014 coverage year\u2014the first under the act\u2014through the federal  Marketplace. In July 2015, we testified on the final results of that work,  including the maintenance of the fictitious applicant identities and  extension of coverage through 2014 and into 2015, payment of federally  subsidized premiums on policies we obtained, and the Marketplace\u2019s  verification process for applicant documentation. We plan to issue a  final report on the results of our undercover eligibility and enrollment  controls testing for the 2014 coverage year shortly.", "Following the original request, you and other congressional requesters  asked us to continue to examine enrollment and verification controls of  the federal Marketplace and state marketplaces as well, for the 2015  coverage year\u2014the second under the act. My statement today is based  on the preliminary results and analysis from this ongoing work.  Specifically, today\u2019s statement describes the preliminary results of our  undercover testing of the federal Marketplace and selected state  marketplaces, for application, enrollment, and eligibility-verification  controls, for both qualified health-care plans and Medicaid, during the  act\u2019s second open-enrollment period ending February 2015. We plan to  issue a final report at a later date.", "To perform our undercover testing of the federal and selected state  eligibility and enrollment processes for the 2015 coverage year, we  created 18 fictitious identities for the purpose of making applications for  health-care coverage by telephone and online. The undercover results,  while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of enrollees.  For all 18 applications, we used publicly available information to construct  our scenarios. We also used publicly available hardware, software, and  materials to produce counterfeit or fictitious documents, which we  submitted, as appropriate for our testing, when instructed to do so. We  then observed the outcomes of the document submissions, such as any  approvals received or requests to provide additional supporting  documentation.", "Because the federal government, at the time of our review, operated a  marketplace on behalf of the state in about two-thirds of the states, we  focused part of our work on two states using the federal Marketplace\u2014 New Jersey and North Dakota. We chose these two states because they  had expanded Medicaid eligibility and also delegated their Medicaid  eligibility determinations to the federal Marketplace at the time of our  testing. In addition, we chose two state marketplaces, California and  Kentucky, for our undercover testing. We chose these two states, in part,  based on the states having expanded Medicaid eligibility and differences  in population.", "For 10 applicant scenarios, we tested controls for verifications related to  qualified health-plan coverage. Specifically, we created application  scenarios with fictitious applicants claiming to have impossible Social  Security numbers; claiming to be working for an employer that offers  health insurance, but not coverage that meets \u201cminimum essential\u201d  standards; or already having existing qualified health-plan coverage. We  made 4 of these 10 applications online and the other 6 applications by  phone. In these tests, we also stated income at a level eligible to obtain  both types of income-based subsidies available under PPACA\u2014a  premium tax credit, to be paid in advance, and cost-sharing reduction.", "For 8 additional applicant scenarios, we tested controls for verifications  related to Medicaid coverage. Specifically, our fictitious applicants  provided invalid Social Security identities, where their information did not  match Social Security Administration records, or claimed they were  noncitizens lawfully present in the United States and declined to provide  Social Security numbers. In situations where we were asked to provide  immigration document numbers, we provided impossible immigration  document numbers. We made half of these applications online and half  by phone. In these tests, we also stated income at a level eligible to  qualify for coverage under the Medicaid expansion, where the federal  government is responsible for reimbursing the states for 100 percent of  the Medicaid costs in 2015. In cases where we did not obtain approval for  Medicaid, we instead attempted, as appropriate, to obtain coverage for  subsidized qualified health plans in the same manner as described  earlier.", "After concluding our undercover testing, we briefed officials from CMS;  officials from the state marketplaces; and Medicaid officials from  California, Kentucky, and North Dakota on our results. We asked to brief  Medicaid officials from New Jersey but they declined our request. To  protect our undercover identities, we did not provide the marketplaces  with specific applicant identity information. CMS and selected state  officials generally told us that without such information, they could not  fully research handling of our applicants. We also reviewed laws,  regulations, and other policy and related information.", "We are conducting the work upon which this statement is based in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

As shown in figure 1, the federal Marketplace or  selected state marketplaces approved each of our 10 fictitious  applications for subsidized qualified health plans. We subsequently paid  premiums to put these policies into force.", "As the figure shows, for these 10 applications, we were approved for  subsidized coverage\u2014the premium tax credit, paid in advance, and cost- sharing reduction subsidies\u2014for all cases. The monthly amount of the  advance premium tax credit for these 10 applicants totaled approximately  $2,300 per month, or about $28,000 annually, equal to about 70 percent  of total premiums. For 4 of these applications, we used Social Security  numbers that could not have been issued by the Social Security  Administration. For 4 other applications, we said our fictitious applicants  worked at a company\u2014which we also created\u2014that offered health  insurance, but the coverage did not provide required minimum essential  coverage under PPACA. For the final 2 applications, we used an identity  from our prior undercover testing of the federal Marketplace to apply for  coverage concurrently at two state marketplaces. Thus, this fictitious  applicant received subsidized qualified health-plan coverage from the  federal Marketplace and the two selected state marketplaces at the same  time.", "For 8 applications among this group of 10, we failed to clear an identity- checking step during the \u201cfront end\u201d of the application process, and thus  could not complete the process. In these cases, we were directed to  contact a contractor that handles identity checking. The contractor was  unable to resolve the identity issues and directed us to call the  appropriate marketplace. We proceeded to phone the marketplaces and  our applications were subsequently approved. The other two applicants  were accepted by phone.", "For each of the 10 undercover applications where we obtained qualified  health-plan coverage, the respective marketplace directed that our  applicants submit supplementary documentation. The marketplaces are  required to seek postapproval documentation in the case of certain  application \u201cinconsistencies\u201d\u2014instances in which information an applicant  has provided does not match information contained in data sources that  the marketplace uses for eligibility verification at the time of application, or  such information is not available. If there is an application inconsistency,  the marketplace is to determine eligibility using the applicant\u2019s  attestations and ensure that subsidies are provided on behalf of the  applicant, if qualified to receive them, while the inconsistency is being  resolved using \u201cback-end\u201d controls. Under these controls, applicants will  be asked to provide additional information or documentation for the  marketplaces to review in order to resolve the inconsistency.", "As part of our testing, and to respond to the marketplace directives, we  provided counterfeit follow-up documentation, such as fictitious Social  Security cards with impossible Social Security numbers, for all 10  undercover applications.", "For all 10 of these undercover applications, we maintained subsidized  coverage beyond the period during which applicants may file supporting  documentation to resolve inconsistencies. In one case, the Kentucky  marketplace questioned the validity of the Social Security number our  applicant provided, which was an impossible Social Security number. In  fact, the marketplace told us the Social Security Administration reported  that the number was not valid. Despite this, however, the Kentucky  marketplace notified our fictitious applicant that the applicant was found  eligible for coverage. For the four fictitious applicants who claimed their  employer did not provide minimum essential coverage, the marketplace  did not contact our fictitious employer to confirm the applicant\u2019s account  that the company offers only substandard coverage.", "In August 2015, we briefed CMS and California and Kentucky state  officials on the results of our undercover testing, to obtain their views.  According to these officials, the marketplaces only inspect for documents  that have obviously been altered. Thus, if the documentation submitted  does not appear to have any obvious alterations, it would not be  questioned for authenticity. In addition, according to Kentucky officials, in  the case of the impossible Social Security number, the identity-proofing  process functioned correctly, but a marketplace worker bypassed identity- proofing steps that would have required a manual verification of the  fictitious Social Security card we submitted. The officials told us they plan  to provide training on how to conduct manual verifications to prevent this  in the future.", "As for our employer-sponsored coverage testing, CMS and California  officials told us that during the 2015 enrollment period, the marketplaces  accepted applicants\u2019 attestation on lack of minimum essential coverage.  As a result, the marketplaces were not required to communicate with the  applicant\u2019s employer to confirm whether the attestation is valid. Kentucky  officials told us that applicant-provided information is entered into its  system to determine whether the applicant\u2019s claimed plan meets  minimum essential coverage standards. If an applicant receives a  qualified health-plan subsidy because the applicant\u2019s employer- sponsored plan does not meet the guidelines, the Kentucky marketplace  sends a notice to the employer asking it to verify the applicant  information. The officials told us the employer letter details, among other  things, the applicant-provided information and minimum essential  coverage standards. However, our fictitious company did not receive such  notification.", "CMS, California, and Kentucky officials also told us there is no current  process to identify individuals with multiple enrollments through different  marketplaces. CMS officials told us it was unlikely an individual would  seek to obtain subsidized qualified health-plan coverage in multiple  states. We conducted this portion of our testing, however, to evaluate  whether such a situation, such as a stolen identity, would be possible.  CMS officials told us the agency would need to look at the risk associated  with multiple coverage.", "Kentucky officials told us that in response to our findings, call center staff  have been retrained on identity-proofing processes, and that they are  improving training for other staff as well. They also said they plan  changes before the next open-enrollment period so that call center  representatives cannot bypass identity-proofing steps, as occurred with  our applications. Further, they said they plan to improve the process for  handling of applications where employer-sponsored coverage is at issue.  Also in response to our findings, California officials said they are  developing process improvements and system modifications to address  the issues we raised, and would share details later.", "Finally, in the case of the federal Marketplace in particular, for which, as  noted, we conducted undercover testing previously, we asked CMS  officials for their views on our second-year results compared to the first  year. They told us the eligibility and enrollment system is generally  performing as designed. According to the officials, a key feature of the  system, when applicant information cannot immediately be verified, is  whether proper inconsistencies are generated, in order that they can be  addressed later, after eligibility is granted at time of application. Earlier,  CMS officials told us the overall approach is that CMS must balance  consumers\u2019 ability to effectively and efficiently select Marketplace  coverage with program-integrity concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Results of Undercover Attempts to Obtain Medicaid Coverage through the Federal Marketplace and Selected State Marketplaces", "paragraphs": ["In addition to our applications for subsidized private health plans, we also  made eight additional fictitious applications for Medicaid coverage in  order to test the ability to apply for that program through the  marketplaces.

For  three of the eight applications, we were approved for Medicaid, as  originally sought.

Later on that same day, we phoned the  federal Marketplace again and falsely claimed that the New Jersey  Medicaid office denied our Medicaid application.

We did not receive notification of denial from  the federal Marketplace. Subsequently, we called the federal Marketplace  and applied for subsidized qualified health-plan coverage. The federal  Marketplace approved the application, granting an advance premium tax  credit plus the cost-sharing reduction subsidy.
