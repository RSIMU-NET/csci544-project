GAO found that federal and local efforts to improve resilience can reduce the effects and costs of future disasters. FEMA has made progress in this area, but in November 2017, GAO found that more consistent planning could help ensure that rebuilding efforts incorporate hazard mitigation, which would increase the resilience of infrastructure during future disasters. GAO recommended that FEMA take steps to consistently integrate hazard mitigation into its recovery process. FEMA is working to address these recommendations.", "Managing long-term recovery. GAO's work has shown that federal recovery programs are complicated and can be slow to provide assistance. For example, in October 2019, GAO reported that local officials described onerous documentation requirements in FEMA's Public Assistance program and the unique challenge of removing debris following the 2017 wildfires. GAO recommended that FEMA assess its operations to identify actions to enhance future recovery from severe wildfires. In March 2019, GAO reported that the ad hoc nature of disaster recovery block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development delayed the availability of funding. GAO recommended, among other things, that Congress consider permanently authorizing this grant program to meet the needs of disaster survivors in a timely manner.", "FEMA workforce management. GAO has previously reported on long-standing workforce management challenges, such as ensuring an adequately-staffed and trained workforce to provide effective assistance. For example, GAO reported in September 2018 that the 2017 disasters overwhelmed FEMA's workforce and a lack of trained staff with program expertise led to complications in its response efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria. While FEMA has taken actions to address several of GAO's workforce management-related recommendations since 2016, a number of recommendations have not yet been implemented.

According to FEMA\u2019s 2017 after action report, the 2017  hurricanes and wildfires collectively affected 47 million people, and  hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all rank among the top five costliest  hurricanes on record. The 2018 hurricane season followed with  hurricanes Florence and Michael, causing nearly $50 billion of damage,  according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Furthermore, the deadly and destructive wildfires continued into 2018,  including the Camp Fire in northern California, which destroyed more than  18,500 buildings and was the costliest and deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s  history. In March 2019, the Midwest experienced historic flooding that  affected millions of acres of agriculture, numerous cities and towns, and  caused widespread damage to public infrastructure. Collectively, these  extreme weather events have stretched and strained federal response  and recovery efforts and staff.", "The rising number of natural disasters and increasing state, local, and  tribal reliance on federal disaster assistance is a key source of federal  fiscal exposure\u2014which can come from federal responsibilities, programs,  and activities, such as national flood insurance, that may legally commit  or create the expectation for future spending. Since 2005, federal  funding for disaster assistance is at least $450 billion, most recently for  catastrophic hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other losses in 2017 and  2018. Disaster costs are projected to increase as extreme weather  events become more frequent and intense due to climate change\u2014as  observed and projected by the U.S. Global Change Research Program  and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.", "One way to save lives, reduce future risk to people and property, and  minimize federal fiscal exposure from natural disasters is to enhance  resilience. For example, in September 2018, we reported that elevated  homes and strengthened building codes in Texas and Florida prevented  greater damages during the 2017 hurricane season. Further, in October  2018, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) was enacted,  which focuses on improving preparedness, mitigation, response and  recovery. Specifically, the DRRA contains provisions that address many  areas of emergency management, including wildfire mitigation, public  assistance, and individual assistance, among others.

In particular, they had difficulty  navigating multiple federal grant programs and applying federal resources  toward their most salient risks because of the fragmented and reactive  nature of the funding. In our 2015 report, we recommended that the  Mitigation Framework Leadership Group\u2014an interagency body chaired  by FEMA\u2014create a National Mitigation Investment Strategy to help  federal, state, and local officials plan for and prioritize disaster resilience  efforts. In August 2019, FEMA took action to fully implement our  recommendation by publishing this strategy.", "Second, in November 2017, we found that FEMA had taken some actions  to better promote hazard mitigation as part of its Public Assistance grant  program, which provides grant funding for cost-effective hazard mitigation  measures to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to people and property  from future disasters and their effects. However, we also reported that  more consistent planning for, and more specific performance measures  related to, hazard mitigation could help ensure that mitigation is  incorporated into recovery efforts. We recommended, among other  things, that FEMA (1) standardize planning efforts for hazard mitigation  after a disaster and (2) develop performance measures for the Public  Assistance grant program to better align with FEMA\u2019s strategic goal for  hazard mitigation in the recovery process. The Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) concurred with our recommendations, and officials  reported taking steps to increase coordination across its Public  Assistance, mitigation, and field operations to ensure hazard mitigation  efforts are standardized and integrated into the recovery process.  Additionally, FEMA officials reported taking actions to begin developing  disaster-specific mitigation performance measures. However, FEMA has  yet to finalize these actions, such as by proposing performance measures  to FEMA senior leadership. As such, we are continuing to monitor  FEMA\u2019s efforts to address these recommendations.", "Third, in September 2017, we reported that the methods used to estimate  the potential economic effects of climate change in the United States\u2014 using linked climate science and economics models\u2014could inform  decision makers about significant potential damages in different U.S.  sectors or regions, despite the limitations. For example, for 2020  through 2039, one study estimated between $4 billion and $6 billion in  annual coastal property damages from sea level rise and more frequent  and intense storms. We found that the federal government has not  undertaken strategic government-wide planning on the potential  economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft  appropriate federal responses. As a result, we recommended the  Executive Office of the President, among others, should use information  on the potential economic effects of climate change to help identify  significant climate risks facing the federal government and craft  appropriate federal responses, such as establishing a strategy to identify,  prioritize, and guide federal investments to enhance resilience against  future disasters.

Through these programs, the federal  government obligates billions of dollars to state, tribal, territorial, and local  governments, certain nonprofit organizations, and individuals that have  suffered injury or damages from major disaster or emergency incidents,  such as hurricanes, tornados, or wildfires. In September 2016, we  reported that, from fiscal years 2005 through 2014, FEMA obligated  almost $46 billion for the Public Assistance program and over $25 billion  for the Individual Assistance program. According to FEMA\u2019s September  2019 Disaster Relief Fund report, total projected obligations through fiscal   year 2019 for the Public Assistance and Individual Assistance programs  since August 1, 2017, are approximately $19 billion and $9 billion,  respectively. Further, in March 2019, we reported that in response to the  2017 disasters, HUD had awarded approximately $32.9 billion in CDBG- DR funds to four grantees as of February 2019\u2014$19.9 billion to Puerto  Rico, $9.8 billion to Texas, $1.9 billion to the USVI, and $1.3 billion to  Florida. As of September 2019, much of these awarded funds had been  allocated to the grantees via Federal Register notices with the exception  of Puerto Rico. HUD had not allocated the remaining $10.2 billion it  awarded to Puerto Rico as of September 10, 2019, due to recent  concerns about the territory\u2019s governance and financial management  challenges.

It is a complex and multistep  program administered through a partnership among FEMA, state, and  local officials. Prior to implementing the Public Assistance program,  FEMA determines a state, territorial or tribal government\u2019s eligibility for  the program using primarily the per capita damage indicator. In our  September 2018 report on federal response and recovery efforts for the  2017 hurricanes and wildfires, we reported on FEMA\u2019s implementation of  the Public Assistance program, which has recently undergone significant  changes as a result of federal legislation and agency initiatives.  Specifically, we reported on FEMA\u2019s use of its redesigned delivery model  for providing grants under the Public Assistance program, as well as the  alternative procedures for administering or receiving such grant funds that  FEMA allows states, territories, and local governments to use for their  recovery. Our prior and ongoing work highlight both progress and  challenges with FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program, including the  agency\u2019s methodology for determining program eligibility, the redesigned  delivery model, and the program\u2019s alternative procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Criteria for Determining Public Assistance Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["In September 2012, we found that FEMA primarily relied on a single  criterion, the per capita damage indicator, to determine a jurisdiction\u2019s  eligibility for Public Assistance funding.

Our analysis of actual and  projected obligations for 508 disaster declarations in which Public  Assistance was awarded during fiscal years 2004 through 2011 showed  that fewer disasters would have met either the personal income-adjusted  or the inflation-adjusted Public Assistance per capita indicators for the  years in which the disaster was declared. Thus, had the indicator been  adjusted annually since 1986 for personal income or inflation, fewer  jurisdictions would have met the eligibility criteria that FEMA primarily  used to determine whether federal assistance should be provided, which  would have likely resulted in fewer federal disaster declarations and lower  federal costs.", "We recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop and  implement a methodology that more comprehensively assesses a  jurisdiction\u2019s capacity to respond to and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance, including fiscal capacity and consideration of  response and recovery capabilities. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and, in January 2016, FEMA was considering  establishing a disaster deductible, which would have required a  predetermined level of financial or other commitment before FEMA would  have provided assistance under the Public Assistance program. In  September 2019, FEMA told us that it was considering options for  alternative methodologies for, among other things, assessing a  jurisdiction\u2019s independent capacity to respond to and recover from  disasters. In addition, the DRRA includes a provision directing the FEMA  Administrator to initiate rulemaking to update the factors considered when  evaluating requests for major disaster declarations. According to FEMA  documentation, as of September 2019, the agency was working to  implement this provision through rulemaking proposals, including  increasing the per capita indicator to account for inflation. Until FEMA  implements a new methodology, the agency will not have an accurate  assessment of a jurisdiction\u2019s capabilities and runs the risk of  recommending that the President award Public Assistance to jurisdictions  that have the capacity to respond and recover on their own."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Redesigned Public Assistance Delivery Model", "paragraphs": ["In November 2017, we reported that FEMA redesigned its delivery model  for providing grants under the Public Assistance program. As part of the  redesign effort, FEMA developed a new, web-based case management  system to address past challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant  documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the  status of Public Assistance projects. Both FEMA and state officials  involved in testing the redesigned delivery model stated that the new case  management system\u2019s capabilities could lead to greater transparency and  efficiencies in the program. However, we found that FEMA had not fully  addressed two key information technology management controls that are  necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. We  recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) establish controls for  tracking the development of system requirements, and (2) establish  system testing criteria, roles and responsibilities, and the sequence and  schedule for integration of other relevant systems. DHS concurred with  these recommendations and, as of October 2019, has fully implemented  both. FEMA\u2019s original intention was to implement the redesigned delivery  model for all future disasters beginning in January 2018. However, in  September 2017, FEMA expedited full implementation of the redesigned  model shortly after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. In September 2018,  we reported that local officials continued to experience challenges with  using the new Public Assistance web-based, case management system  following the 2017 disasters, such as not having sufficient guidance on  how to use the new system and delays with FEMA\u2019s processing of their  projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Assistance Alternative Procedures in Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands", "paragraphs": ["Our prior and ongoing work highlight the challenges with implementing  the Public Assistance program, including the alternative procedures, in  Puerto Rico and the USVI. In particular, our work has identified  challenges related to (1) developing fixed-cost estimates and (2)  implementing flexibilities provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  This Act allows FEMA, Puerto Rico, and the USVI to repair and rebuild  critical services infrastructure\u2014such as medical and education facilities\u2014 so it meets industry standards without regard to pre-disaster condition  (see fig. 1).", "Unlike in the standard Public Assistance program where FEMA will fund  the actual cost of a project, the Public Assistance alternative procedures  allow awards for permanent work projects to be made on the basis of  fixed-cost estimates to provide financial incentives for the timely and cost- effective completion of work. FEMA officials in Puerto Rico and the USVI  stated that the development of a \u201ccost factor\u201d for use in the fixed-cost  estimating process had slowed the pace of FEMA obligations for  permanent work projects. Specifically, these factors are intended to  ensure that the costs associated with implementing projects in Puerto  Rico and the USVI are sufficiently captured when developing the fixed- cost estimates for alternative procedures projects. Since incorporating the  cost factor into the fixed-cost estimating process will increase the amount  of funding obligated for any given permanent work project, FEMA officials  explained that Puerto Rico and the USVI had an incentive to delay the  obligation of individual projects until this factor was finalized. For  example, FEMA officials in the USVI told us in May 2019 that obligations  for permanent work projects in the territory had been mostly on hold since  October 2018 while an independent contractor worked to develop the  USVI-specific cost factor.", "FEMA officials told us that USVI officials disagreed with the initial USVI- specific cost factors the independent contractor proposed. USVI officials  contended that the cost factors were insufficient in accurately capturing  the unique circumstances that influence construction costs in the territory,  such as the limited availability of local resources and the need to import  materials and labor. In May 2019, the contractor proposed a new cost  factor, which FEMA approved on an interim basis pending further  analysis. In July 2019, FEMA officials told us that while additional  analyses are required to ensure its final process for developing fixed-cost  estimates in the USVI accurately captures construction costs, using this  interim cost factor in the meantime allows FEMA and USVI officials to  move forward with the development and final approval of alternative  procedures projects. In August 2019, a senior USVI official told us the  territory plans to begin using the interim cost factor, where appropriate, to  keep projects progressing forward. However, this official stated that the  USVI questioned whether the interim cost factor did, in fact, sufficiently  capture the actual costs of construction in the USVI. Given the  uncertainty around these fixed-cost estimates, USVI officials told us the  territory will need to balance the potential flexibilities provided by the  alternative procedures program with the financial risk posed by cost  overruns when deciding whether to use the alternative procedures or the  standard Public Assistance program for any given permanent work  project. Specifically, these officials stated that the USVI plans to pursue  alternative procedures projects that do not include high levels of  complexity or uncertainty to reduce the risk of cost overruns, especially  given its already difficult financial situation.", "In addition, according to FEMA guidance, the Puerto Rico-specific cost  factor was developed by a third-party center of excellence comprising  personnel selected by FEMA and Puerto Rico. Through our ongoing  work we learned that FEMA convened a panel of FEMA engineers to  assess the cost factor methodologies proposed by the center of  excellence. In July 2019, FEMA approved the use of a cost factor  designed to account for location-specific construction costs in Puerto Rico  to ensure that fixed-cost estimates for alternative procedures projects are  accurate. This cost factor consists of cost indices to apply to urban, rural,  and insular (the islands of Vieques and Culebra) areas of Puerto Rico.  According to FEMA officials, these cost indices will compile location- specific construction costs for each of these three areas. We are currently  assessing FEMA\u2019s process for developing cost estimates for projects  under both the standard and alternative procedures programs, and plan  to report our results in early 2020.", "As of September 2019, FEMA officials told us the agency had obligated  funding for 14 alternative procedures projects in Puerto Rico out of  approximately 9,000 projects FEMA and Puerto Rico are working to  develop for inclusion in the program. According to FEMA guidance,  Puerto Rico must use the alternative procedures for all large permanent  work projects and its deadline for finalizing the fixed-cost estimates for  these projects was October 11, 2019. However, on October 8, 2019,  Puerto Rico requested that FEMA extend this deadline. In response,  FEMA acknowledged that Puerto Rico and FEMA have significant work  remaining to develop and finalize the fixed-cost estimates for alternative  procedures projects. As a result, FEMA authorized all parties to continue  developing these projects while FEMA works to establish a new deadline  for finalizing fixed-cost estimates in Puerto Rico.", "Unlike Puerto Rico, the USVI has the flexibility to pursue either the  alternative procedures or the standard procedures on a project-by-project  basis. As of September 2019, FEMA had obligated funding for two  alternative procedures projects in the USVI. As the USVI\u2019s deadline for  finalizing these projects is in March 2020, it is too early to gauge the  extent to which the alternative procedures will play a role in the USVI\u2019s  long-term recovery strategy.", "In addition, our preliminary observations indicate that FEMA, Puerto Rico,  and USVI officials have reported challenges with the implementation of  the flexibilities authorized by section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act.  This section of the Act allows for the provision of assistance under the  Public Assistance alternative procedures to restore disaster-damaged  facilities or systems that provide critical services to an industry standard  without regard to pre-disaster condition. Officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s  central government stated that they disagreed with FEMA\u2019s interpretation  of the types of damages covered by section 20601 of the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2018. In response, FEMA officials in Puerto Rico stated  they held several briefings with Puerto Rico\u2019s central recovery office to  explain FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the section. Further, FEMA officials in  the USVI told us that initially, they had difficulty obtaining clarification from  FEMA headquarters regarding how to implement key components of  section 20601 of the Act. In June 2019, the Additional Supplemental  Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of 2019 was signed into law and  provides additional direction to FEMA regarding the implementation of  section 20601. Among other things, this legislation includes a provision  directing FEMA to change its process for determining whether a disaster- damaged facility is eligible for repair or replacement. FEMA evaluated  this and other provisions of the Act and, in September 2019, issued an  updated policy to provide clear guidance moving forward, according to  agency officials. We will continue to evaluate these identified challenges  and any efforts to address them, as well as other aspects of recovery  efforts in the USVI and Puerto Rico, and plan to report our findings in  November 2019 and January 2020, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Program", "paragraphs": ["The Individual Assistance program provides financial and direct  assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met  through other means, such as insurance.

We found that aspects of the application process  for FEMA assistance were challenging for older individuals and those with  disabilities. Further, according to stakeholders and FEMA officials,  disability-related questions in the Individual Assistance registration  materials were confusing and easily misinterpreted. While FEMA had  made some efforts to help registrants interpret the questions, we  recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) implement new  registration-intake questions that improve FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and  address survivors\u2019 disability-related needs, and (2) improve  communication of registrants\u2019 disability-related information across FEMA  programs. DHS concurred with the first recommendation, and officials  reported that in May 2019 the agency updated the questions to directly  ask individuals if they have a disability. The agency has taken actions to  fully implement this recommendation and, according to FEMA\u2019s analysis  of applications for assistance following recent disasters\u2014which used the  updated questions\u2014the percentage of registrants who reported having a  disability increased.", "However, DHS did not concur with the second recommendation, noting  that it lacks specific funding to augment its legacy data systems. FEMA  officials stated that they began a long-term data management  improvement initiative in April 2017, which they expect will ease efforts to  share and flag specific disability-related data. While we acknowledge  FEMA\u2019s concerns about changing legacy systems when it has existing  plans to replace those systems, we continue to believe there are other  cost-effective ways that are likely to improve communication of  registrants\u2019 disability-related information prior to implementing the system  upgrades. For example, FEMA could revise its guidance to remind  program officials to review the survivor case file notes to identify whether  there is a record of any disability-related needs.", "We also have work underway to assess FEMA\u2019s Individuals and  Households Program, a component program of Individual Assistance.  Through this program, as of April 2019, FEMA had awarded roughly $4.7  billion in assistance to almost 1.8 million individuals and households for  federally-declared disasters occurring in 2017 and 2018. Specifically, we  are analyzing Individuals and Households Program expenditures and  registration data for recent years; reviewing FEMA\u2019s processes, policies,  and procedures for making eligibility and award determinations; and  examining survivors\u2019 reported experiences with this program, including  any challenges, for major disaster declarations occurring in recent years.

In March 2019, we reported on the status of  CDBG-DR grants following the 2017 disasters, plans for monitoring the  program, and challenges HUD and grantees faced in administering these  grants. We found that HUD lacked adequate guidance for staff  reviewing key information, such as the quality of grantees\u2019 financial  processes and procedures and assessments of grantees\u2019 capacity and  unmet needs. Further, we found HUD had not completed monitoring or  workforce plans that identify key risk factors and critical skills and  competencies required for program implementation, among other things.  In addition, we found that Congress has not established permanent  statutory authority for CDBG-DR but rather has used supplemental  appropriation legislation to authorize HUD to establish requirements via  Federal Register notices. Without such permanent statutory authority,  HUD must customize grantee requirements for each disaster. The ad hoc  nature of CDBG-DR has created challenges for CDBG-DR grantees, such  as lags in accessing funding and coordinating these funds with other  disaster recovery programs. For example, it took 154 days (or 5 months)  for HUD to issue the requisite Federal Register notice after the first  appropriation for the 2017 hurricanes. According to HUD officials, they  delayed issuance of the first notice for the 2017 hurricanes because they  expected a second appropriation and wanted to allocate those funds in  the same notice. However, because the second appropriation took longer  than HUD expected, the first notice allocated only the first appropriation.", "We recommended that Congress consider permanently authorizing a  disaster assistance program to address unmet needs in a timely manner.  In addition, we made five recommendations to HUD. Specifically, we  made two recommendations to HUD regarding developing additional  guidance for staff to use when reviewing grantees\u2019 planning  documentation. HUD partially agreed with these two recommendations,  stating that some of this guidance was already in place. Because HUD  acknowledged that providing additional guidance would improve its  review process, we revised these two recommendations accordingly to  reflect the need for additional guidance. We also made three additional  recommendations to HUD, including that the agency should develop a  monitoring plan for grants and conduct workforce training. HUD generally  agreed with these recommendations and indicated it planned to develop  monitoring strategies. HUD also stated that it had developed a staffing  plan, but we noted the agency still needed to conduct workforce planning  to determine if the number of staff the agency planned to hire was  sufficient.

We found that some needs related to mass care were  unmet. For example, local officials in Texas said flooded roads prevented  trucks from delivering supplies. Further, mass care providers encountered  challenges in part because state and local agreements with voluntary  organizations that help to provide mass care to disaster survivors did not  always clearly detail what services these organizations were capable of  providing. Among other things, we also found that while state, territorial,  and local grantees of federal disaster preparedness grants are required to  regularly submit information on their capabilities to FEMA, the mass care  information some grantees provided to FEMA was not specific enough to  aid its response in 2017. Moreover, as FEMA does not require grantees  to specify the organizations providing mass care services in their  capabilities assessments, grantees and FEMA may not be collecting  reliable information on capabilities.", "As a result of our findings in this report, we made one recommendation to  DHS, four recommendations to FEMA, and one recommendation to the  American Red Cross. Specifically, among other things, we  recommended that FEMA should emphasize the importance of defining  roles and responsibilities in its guidance to grantees in states and  localities and require them to solicit key capabilities information from  mass care providers. DHS concurred with four recommendations, but did  not concur with our recommendation requiring grantees to solicit key  information from organizations providing mass care services and to  specify these organizations in capability assessments. Specifically, DHS  and FEMA stated that requiring grantees to include this information is not  the most effective approach and would increase their burden. We  modified our recommendation to address this concern and continue to  believe that grantees should make an effort to include mass care  providers in assessing capabilities. We will continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s  progress in fully addressing these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wildfire Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Further, in October 2019, we reported on the assistance FEMA provided  to jurisdictions in response to major disaster declarations stemming from  wildfires from 2015 through 2018 (see fig. 2). We found that FEMA  helped state and local officials obtain and coordinate federal resources to  provide for the needs of wildfire survivors and provided more than $2.4  billion in federal assistance. However, state and county officials also  described challenges in responding to wildfire disasters. For example,  onerous documentation requirements for FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance grant  program, a shortage of temporary housing for survivors, and the unique  challenge of removing wildfire debris led to over-excavation on some  homeowners\u2019 lots and lengthened the rebuilding process. We also found  that while FEMA had developed an after-action report identifying lessons  learned from the October and December 2017 wildfires, the agency could  still benefit from a more comprehensive assessment of its operations to  determine if any changes are needed to better respond to the threat  posed by increased wildfire activity.", "We recommended that FEMA assess operations to identify any additional  updates to its management controls\u2014such as policies, procedures, or  training\u2014that could enhance future response and recovery from large- scale and severe wildfires. DHS agreed with our recommendation and  described a number of ongoing and planned actions it would take to  address it, including supporting states\u2019 efforts to house disaster survivors,  developing guidance for housing grants authorized by the DRRA, and  taking steps to identify areas of innovation in response to wildfire  disasters. DHS anticipates that these efforts will be put into effect by  December 2020 and we will continue to monitor DHS and FEMA\u2019s  progress in addressing this recommendation.", "In October 2019, we reported on federal efforts to support electricity grid  recovery in Puerto Rico. We found that FEMA and other federal  agencies can support long-term electricity grid recovery efforts and  incorporate resilience through three primary roles\u2014providing funding and  technical assistance and coordinating among local and federal agencies.  However, we found that zero permanent, long-term grid recovery projects  in Puerto Rico had received funding as of July 2019 as Puerto Rico was  still establishing priorities for permanent work. Further, we found that  certain challenges are hindering progress on electricity grid recovery  efforts in Puerto Rico, including uncertainty about the kinds of projects  that may be eligible for federal funding, local capacity constraints,  uncertainty about available federal funding, and the need for coordination  among local and federal stakeholders.", "As a result of our findings, we made three recommendations to FEMA  and one recommendation to HUD. Specifically, we recommended that  FEMA should provide clear written policies, guidance, or regulations to  clarify its plans for implementing new authorities provided by the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and take steps to enhance coordination  among local and federal entities. DHS concurred with these  recommendations and stated it is working to address them. In addition,  we recommended that HUD establish timeframes and a plan for  publication of the grant process and requirements specifically for CDBG- DR funding for improvements to Puerto Rico\u2019s electricity grid. In its  response to this recommendation, HUD stated that it is closely working  with its federal partners on the requirements for this funding in Puerto  Rico, but did not specifically state whether it would establish the  timeframes and a plan for publication of the grant process and  requirements as we recommended. We continue to believe that this  action is needed since without this information, local entities will continue  to be uncertain regarding what is eligible for CDBG-DR funding. We will  continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s and HUD\u2019s progress in addressing these  recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Longstanding Workforce Management Challenges Exacerbate Key Issues with Response and Recovery Operations", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s experiences during the 2017 disasters highlight the importance of  continuing to make progress on addressing the long-standing workforce  management challenges we have previously reported on and continue to  observe in our ongoing work. In particular, our work has identified  challenges related to (1) recruiting, maintaining, and deploying a trained  workforce, (2) the Incident Management Assistance Team program, (3)  Public Assistance program staffing, (4) contracting workforce shortages,  (5) assistance to older adults and people with disabilities, and (6)  workforce capacity and training.", "Recruiting, maintaining, and deploying a trained workforce. In  September 2018, we reported that the 2017 disasters\u2014hurricanes  Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the California wildfires\u2014resulted in  unprecedented FEMA workforce management challenges, including  recruiting, maintaining, and deploying a sufficient and adequately-trained  FEMA disaster workforce. FEMA\u2019s available workforce was  overwhelmed by the response needs caused by the sequential and  overlapping timing of the three hurricanes. For example, at the height of  FEMA workforce deployments in October 2017, 54 percent of staff were  serving in a capacity in which they did not hold the title of \u201cQualified\u201d\u2014 according to FEMA\u2019s qualification system standards\u2014a past challenge  we identified. FEMA officials noted that staff shortages and lack of trained  personnel with program expertise led to complications in its response  efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria.", "FEMA\u2019s Incident Management Assistance Team program. In February  2016, we reported on, among other things, FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement,  assess, and improve its Incident Management Assistance Team  program. We found that while FEMA used some leading practices in  managing the program, it lacked a standardized plan to ensure that all  national and regional Incident Management Assistance Team members  received required training. Further, we found that the program had  experienced high attrition since its implementation in fiscal year 2013. We  recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop (1) a plan to  ensure that Incident Management Assistance Teams receive required  training, and (2) a workforce strategy for retaining Incident Management  Assistance Team staff. DHS concurred with the recommendations. FEMA  implemented our first recommendation by developing an Incident  Management Assistance Team Training and Readiness Manual and  providing a training schedule for fiscal year 2017. In response to the  second recommendation, FEMA officials stated in July 2018 that they  plan to develop policies that will provide guidance on a new workforce  structure, incentives for Incident Management Assistance Team  personnel, and pay-for-performance and all other human resource  actions. We are continuing to monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts to address this  recommendation.", "Public Assistance program staffing. In November and December 2017,  we reported on staffing challenges in FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program.  In November 2017, we reported on FEMA\u2019s efforts to address past  workforce management challenges through its redesigned Public  Assistance delivery model. As part of the redesign effort, FEMA created consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize Public  Assistance staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new  specialized positions to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants.  However, we found that FEMA had not assessed the workforce needed to  fully implement the redesigned model, such as the number of staff  needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals. Further,  in December 2017, we reported on FEMA\u2019s management of its Public  Assistance appeals process, including that FEMA increased staffing  levels for the appeals process from 2015 to 2017. However, we found  that FEMA continued to face a number of workforce challenges, such as  staff vacancies, turnover, and delays in training, which contributed to  processing delays.", "Based on our findings from our November and December 2017 reports,  we recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) complete  workforce staffing assessments that identify the appropriate number of  staff needed to implement the redesigned Public Assistance delivery  model, and (2) document steps for hiring, training, and retaining key  appeals staff, and address staff transitions resulting from deployments to  disasters. DHS concurred with our recommendations to address  workforce management challenges in the Public Assistance program and  have reported taking some actions in response. For example, to address  the first recommendation, FEMA officials have developed preliminary  models and estimates of staffing needs across various programs,  including Public Assistance. However, as of October 2019, the agency  has not yet taken actions to implement this recommendation. To address  the second recommendation, FEMA has collected information on the  amount of time regional appeals analysts spend on appeals, and the  inventory and timeliness of different types of appeals. FEMA officials  stated in September 2018 that they plan to assess this information to  prepare a detailed regional workforce plan. In May 2019, FEMA sent us  additional information and documentation involving its analysis of appeal  inventory and timeliness. As of October 2019, we are evaluating the  information provided by FEMA to determine if they have addressed this  recommendation.", "Contracting workforce shortages. In April 2019, we reported on the  federal government\u2019s contracting efforts for preparedness, response, and  recovery efforts related to the 2017 hurricanes and California wildfires.  We found, among other things, that contracting workforce shortages  continue to be a challenge for disaster response and recovery. Further,  although FEMA\u2019s 2017 after-action report recommended increasing  contract support capacities, it did not provide a specific plan to do so. We  also found that while FEMA evaluated its contracting workforce needs in  a 2014 workforce analysis, it did not specifically consider contracting  workforce needs in the regional offices or address Disaster Acquisition  Response Team employees. In our April 2019 report, we  recommended, among other things, that FEMA assess its workforce  needs\u2014including staffing levels, mission needs, and skill gaps\u2014for  contracting staff, to include regional offices and Disaster Acquisition  Response Teams, and develop a plan, including timelines, to address any  gaps. DHS concurred with this recommendation and estimates that it  plans to implement it in the fall of 2019.", "Assistance to older adults and people with disabilities. In our May  2019 report on FEMA disaster assistance to older adults and people with  disabilities following the 2017 hurricanes, we found that FEMA began  implementing a new approach to assist individuals with disabilities in June  2018, which shifted the responsibility for directly assisting individuals with  disabilities from Disability Integration Advisors\u2014which are staff FEMA  deploys specifically to identify and recommend actions needed to support  survivors with disabilities\u2014to all FEMA staff. To implement this new  approach, FEMA planned to train all of the agency\u2019s deployable staff and  staff in programmatic offices on disability issues during response and  recovery deployments. According to FEMA, a number of Disability  Integration Advisors would also deploy to advise FEMA leadership in the  field during disaster response and recovery. We found that while FEMA  has taken some initial steps to provide training on the changes, it had not  established a plan for delivering comprehensive disability-related training  to all staff who will be directly interacting with individuals with disabilities.  We recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop a plan for  delivering training to FEMA staff that promotes competency in disability  awareness and includes milestones and performance measures, and  outlines how performance will be monitored. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and reported plans to update FEMA\u2019s position task  books for all deployable staff with information that promotes competency  in disability awareness. In July 2019, officials told us FEMA plans to hire  new staff to focus on integrating the disability competency FEMA-wide  and work with FEMA\u2019s training components to ensure that disability- related training is consistent with the content of the position task books.  We will continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts to address our  recommendation.", "FEMA\u2019s workforce capacity and training. In addition to our prior work  on FEMA\u2019s workforce management challenges related to specific  programs and functions, we are continuing to evaluate FEMA\u2019s workforce  capacity and training efforts during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons.  Our preliminary observations indicate that there were challenges in  FEMA\u2019s ability to deploy staff with the right kinds of skills and training at  the right time to best meet the needs of various disaster events. For  example, according to FEMA field leadership we interviewed, for some of  the functions FEMA performs in the field, FEMA had too few staff with the  right technical skills to perform their missions\u2014such as inspections of  damaged properties\u2014efficiently and effectively. For other functions, these  managers also reported that they had too many staff in the early stages of  the disaster, which created challenges with assigning duties and  providing on-the-job training. For example, some managers reported that  they were allocated more staff than needed in the initial phases of the  disaster, but many lacked experience and were without someone to  provide direction and mentoring to ensure they used their time efficiently  and gained competence more quickly. In focus group discussions and  interviews with field managers, FEMA officials told us that difficulties  deploying the right mix of staff with the right skills led to challenges such  as delays in making purchases to support FEMA operations, problems  with properly registering applicants for FEMA programs, or poor  communication with nonfederal partners. Nonetheless, FEMA staff have  noted that, despite any suboptimal circumstances during disaster  response, they aimed to and have been able to find a way to deliver the  mission.", "As part of this ongoing work, FEMA field leadership and managers also  reported challenges using agency systems to ensure the availability of the  right staff with the right skills in the right place and time. FEMA uses a  system called the Deployment Tracking System to, among other things,  help identify staff available to be deployed and activate and track  deployments. To help gauge the experience level and training needs of its  staff, the agency established the FEMA Qualification System (FQS),  which is a set of processes and criteria to monitor staff experience in  competently performing tasks and completing training that correspond to  their job titles. According to the FQS guidance, staff who have been able  to demonstrate proficient performance of all the relevant tasks and  complete required training receive the designation \u201cqualified,\u201d and are  expected to be ready and able to competently fulfill their responsibilities.  Those who have not, receive the designation \u201ctrainee,\u201d and can be  expected to need additional guidance and on-the-job training. FQS  designations feed into the Deployment Tracking System as one key  variable in how the tracking system deploys staff. Among other  challenges with FEMA\u2019s Deployment Tracking System and Qualification  System, FEMA managers and staff in the field told us in focus group  discussions that an employee\u2019s recorded qualification status was not a  reliable indicator of the level at which deployed personnel would be  capable of performing specific duties and responsibilities or their general  proficiency in their positions, making it more difficult for managers to know  the specialized skills or experience of staff and effectively build teams.  We are continuing to assess these and other reported workforce  challenges and plan to report our findings in spring 2020.", "Thank you, Chairwoman Titus, Ranking Member Meadows, and Members  of the Subcommittee.
