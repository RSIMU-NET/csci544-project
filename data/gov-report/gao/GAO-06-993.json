NOAA has taken steps to implement lessons learned from past satellite programs, but more remains to be done. Prior satellite programs--including a prior GOES series, a polar-orbiting environmental satellite series, and various military satellite programs--often experienced technical challenges, cost overruns, and schedule delays. Key lessons from these programs include the need to (1) establish realistic cost and schedule estimates, (2) ensure sufficient technical readiness of the system's components prior to key decisions, (3) provide sufficient management at government and contractor levels, and (4) perform adequate senior executive oversight to ensure mission success. NOAA has established plans to address these lessons by conducting independent cost estimates, performing preliminary studies of key technologies, placing resident government offices at key contractor locations, and establishing a senior executive oversight committee.

Prior to the GOES-R series, NOAA was responsible  for program funding, procurement of the ground elements, and on-orbit  operation of the satellites, while NASA was responsible for the  procurement of the spacecraft, instruments, and launch services.

Specifically, within a year of the contract award, the  program cost estimate increased by $1.2 billion, from $6.9 billion to $8.1  billion, and the expected availability of the first satellite was delayed by 20  months. We reported in September 2004 that these cost increases and  schedule delays were caused, in part, by changes in the NPOESS funding  stream. Subsequently, in November 2005, we reported that problems in  the development of a critical sensor would likely cause program costs to  grow by at least another $3 billion and the schedule for the first launch  would likely be delayed by almost 3 years. The senior executive oversight  committee for NPOESS was expected to make a decision in December  2005 on the direction of the program\u2014which involved increased costs,  delayed schedules, and reduced functionality. We urged this committee to  make a decision quickly so that the program could proceed. However, in  late November 2005, the NPOESS program\u2019s anticipated cost growth  triggered a legislative requirement forcing DOD to reassess its options and  to recertify the program. In June 2006, DOD decided to reduce the  system\u2019s capabilities and number of satellites from six to four, and  announced that the newly-restructured program was estimated to cost  $11.5 billion and the launch of the first satellite had been delayed by at  least 4 years from the time the contract was awarded.", "NPOESS\u2019 problems involved a number of factors, including unrealistic  cost and schedule estimates, insufficient technical maturity of critical  sensors at a key development milestone, poor performance at multiple  levels of contractor and government management, insufficient executive  oversight, and excessive award fee payments to the contractor.  Specifically, in 2003, an Air Force cost group performed an independent  cost estimate for NPOESS and found that, based on actual outcomes from  historical programs similar to NPOESS, the program office underestimated  contract costs by almost $1 billion. This group also concluded that the  program office underestimated the required time needed to integrate the  sensors onto the spacecraft by almost 80 percent. Despite the differences  in planned cost and schedule, the program office moved forward with its  own estimates\u2014and, in turn, established unrealistic budgets that led, in  part, to the eventual restructuring of the program.", "Further, an independent review team charged with assessing the NPOESS  program found that the program management office did not sufficiently  validate the subcontractors\u2019 design work on various sensors. As a result,  the sensors were approved to move into production before they reached a  sufficient level of technical maturity. This resulted in unexpected technical  problems during sensor production.", "We also reported that the development issues on one critical sensor were  attributed, in part, to the subcontractor\u2019s inadequate project management.  Specifically, after a series of technical problems, internal review teams  sent by the prime contractor and the program office found that the  sensor\u2019s subcontractor had deviated from a number of contract,  management, and policy directives set out by the main office and that both  management and process engineering were inadequate. Neither the  contractor nor the program office recognized the underlying problems in  time to fix them. Further, an independent review team reported that the  program management office did not have the technical system engineering  support it needed to effectively manage the contractor. In addition, the  program office and contractor set aside less than 10 percent of their  budgets in management reserve\u2014an amount which was insufficient to  effectively deal with these technical problems. With just 2 years into the  contract, the prime contractor had spent or allocated over 90 percent of its  reserves.", "The involvement of the NPOESS executive leadership committee was also  inconsistent and indecisive\u2014it wavered from frequent heavy involvement  to occasional meetings with few resulting decisions. In the 32-month  period from May 2003 through December 2005, the committee met  formally six times.

Additionally, the launch of the first satellite of this series, which had been  planned for July 1989, did not occur until April 1994. This nearly 5-year  schedule delay left NOAA in danger of losing geostationary satellite  coverage, although no gap in coverage occurred. We reported that these  problems were caused by a number of factors, including insufficient  technical readiness of the satellite design prior to contract award,  unrealistic cost and schedule estimates, and inadequate management by  NOAA and NASA.", "Specifically, NOAA and NASA did not require any engineering analyses to  be completed prior to the award of the GOES I-M contract. As a result,  both agencies were unable to anticipate the level of complexity of NOAA\u2019s  requirements (related to the satellite\u2019s pointing accuracy) or the  contractor\u2019s approach to meeting those requirements. This unanticipated  design complexity led to additional analyses, redesigns, and  remanufacture of parts, which resulted in increased costs and schedule  delays. Additionally, the lack of adequate understanding of the system  prior to contract award also prevented program officials from establishing  realistic cost and schedule estimates for the program.", "The inadequate management of the GOES I-M program\u2014by both the  government and contractor\u2014played a significant part in its cost increases  and program delays. Specifically, NASA and NOAA made the decision to  forgo preliminary studies of the system because of fiscal constraints and  pressure to launch the first satellite as quickly as possible. This decision  was compounded by NASA\u2019s limited technical support in the areas of  optics, satellite control systems, and thermal engineering. Additionally,  both the prime contractor and major subcontractor had little experience in  directing the design of complex weather instruments. The subcontractor  had also noted that it was not prepared for GOES I-M. For example, the  instruments were expected to meet manufacturing and testing standards  that the subcontractor had never experienced before.

Further, an independent review  team chartered by DOD reported that a root cause of these problems was  that system requirements were not well understood by DOD when the  program began. Specifically, the requirements-setting process was often ad  hoc, many decisions on requirements were deferred to the contractor, and  the program was too immature to enter system design and development.  As a result, there was too much instability on the program after the  contract award\u2014leading DOD to undertake four major replanning efforts.

First, in the early phases of the AEHF program,  DOD substantially and frequently altered requirements\u2014resulting in major  design modifications that increased costs by millions of dollars. For  instance, a new requirement for additional anti-jamming protection led to  a cost increase of $100 million and an added set of requirements for  training, support, and maintainability that cost an additional $90 million.  Second, based on a satellite constellation gap caused by the failure of a  Milstar satellite, DOD accepted a high-risk schedule that turned out to be  overly optimistic and highly compressed\u2014leaving little room for error and  depending on a chain of events taking place at certain times. Third, AEHF  allocated 4 percent of its budget to management reserve\u2014which was an  inadequate amount to cover unforeseen problems for the duration of the  program. Between December 2002 and June 2005, the contractor had  depleted about 86 percent of its reserves with 5 years remaining on the  contract. Lastly, at the time DOD decided to accelerate the program, it did  not have the funding needed to support the activities or the manpower  needed to design and build the satellites more quickly. The lack of funding  also contributed to schedule delays, which in turn, caused more cost  increases.

The  program office is re-assessing its estimates based on preliminary  information from the three vendors contracted to develop preliminary  designs for the overall GOES-R system. Once the program office and  independent cost estimates are completed, program officials intend to  compare them and to develop a revised programmatic cost estimate that  will be used in its decision on whether to proceed into system  development and production. In addition, NOAA has planned for an  independent review team\u2014consisting of former senior industry and  government space acquisition experts\u2014to provide an assessment of the  program office and independent cost estimates for this decision milestone.  To improve its schedule reliability, the program office is currently  conducting a schedule risk analysis in order to estimate the amount of  adequate reserve funds and schedule margin needed to deal with  unexpected problems and setbacks. Finally, the NOAA Observing System  Council submitted a prioritized list of GOES-R system requirements to  the Commerce Undersecretary for approval. This list is expected to allow  the program office to act quickly in deleting lower priority requirements in  the event of severe technical challenges or shifting funding streams.", "While NOAA acknowledges the need to establish realistic cost and  schedule estimates, several hurdles remain. As discussed earlier, the  agency is considering reducing the requirements for the GOES-R program  to mitigate the increased cost estimates for the program. Therefore, the  agency\u2019s efforts to date to establish realistic cost estimates cannot be fully  effective in addressing this lesson until this uncertainty is resolved. NOAA  suspended the work being performed by its independent cost estimator  until a decision is made on the scope of the program. Further, the agency  has not yet developed a process to evaluate and reconcile the independent  and program office cost estimates once final program decisions are made.  Without this process, the agency may lack the objectivity necessary to  counter the optimism of program sponsors and is more likely to move  forward with an unreliable estimate.

One key decision point is when an agency decides on  whether the component is sufficiently ready to proceed from a preliminary  study phase into a development phase; this decision point results in the  award of the development contract. Another key decision point occurs  during the development phase when an agency decides whether the  component is ready to proceed from design into production (also called  the critical design review). Without sufficient technical readiness at these  milestones, agencies could proceed into development contracts on  components that are not well understood and enter into the production  phase of development with technologies that are not yet mature. For  example:    On the GOES I-M series, NOAA and NASA did not require engineering  analyses prior to awarding the development contracts in order to  accelerate the schedule and launch the first satellite. The lack of these  studies resulted in unexpected technical issues in later acquisition  phases\u2014including the inability of the original instrument designs to  withstand the temperature variations in the geostationary orbit.", "Both the NPOESS and SBIRS-High programs committed funds for system  development before the design was proven and before the technologies  had properly matured. For instance, at the critical design review milestone  for a key NPOESS sensor, the program office decided that the sensor was  ready to proceed into production even though an engineering model had  not been constructed. This sensor has since faced severe technical  challenges that directly led to program-wide cost and schedule overruns.", "To address the lesson learned from the GOES I-M experience, in 1997,  NOAA began preliminary studies on technologies that could be used on  the GOES-R instruments. These studies target existing technologies and  assessed how they could be expanded for GOES-R. The program office is  also conducting detailed trade-off studies on the integrated system to  improve its ability to make decisions that balance performance,  affordability, risk, and schedule. For instance, the program office is  analyzing the potential architectures for the GOES-R constellation of  satellites\u2014the quantity and configuration of satellites, including how the  instruments will be distributed over these satellites. These studies are  expected to allow for a more mature definition of the system  specifications.", "NOAA has also developed plans to have an independent review team  assess project status on an annual basis once the overall system contract  has been awarded.
