DHS is undertaking a number of large, complex investments as the federal government increasingly relies on contractors for roles and missions previously performed by government employees. One of the department's largest investments--the Deepwater program, now estimated to cost $24 billion--is the Coast Guard's major effort to replace or modernize its aircraft and vessels. Rather than using a traditional acquisition approach, the Coast Guard is using a system integrator to design, construct, deploy, support, and integrate the Deepwater assets.

A common theme in these reports is DHS's struggle, from the outset, to provide adequate support to its mission components in acquiring goods and services and to provide departmentwide oversight of its acquisition function. DHS has a stated goal of integrating the acquisition function more broadly across the department. GAO has reported that this goal has not yet been accomplished and has identified key impediments to achieving it. A management directive intended to integrate the acquisition line of business did not provide the Chief Procurement Officer with the enforcement authority needed in practice, and it does not pertain to all component agencies. Also, the procurement organizations within the department remained somewhat autonomous, and centralized acquisition oversight had not been implemented. While DHS's review process for major investments adopts some best practices, key decision-making reviews at certain points are not required. Investments that are not reviewed at the appropriate points can face a range of problems--such as redesign--resulting in significant cost increases and schedule delays. The Coast Guard's Deepwater program illustrates problems that can occur when effective program management and contractor oversight are not in place. In 2001, GAO described the Deepwater project as \"risky\" due to the unique, untried acquisition strategy for a project of this magnitude within the Coast Guard--a system-of-systems approach with the contractor as the integrator. In 2004, GAO reported that well into the contract's second year, key components needed to manage the program and oversee the system integrator's performance had not been effectively implemented. For example, integrated product teams, comprised of government and contractor employees, are the Coast Guard's primary tool for managing the program and overseeing the contractor. GAO found that the teams had not been effective due to changing membership, understaffing, insufficient training, lack of authority for decision-making, and inadequate communication among members. GAO also reported that, despite documented problems in schedule, performance, cost control, and contract administration throughout the first year of the Deepwater contract, the contractor had received a rating of 87 percent, which fell in the \"very good\" range and resulted in an award fee of $4.0 million. GAO's more recent work found that, while the Coast Guard had taken steps to address some of the problems, concerns remained about program management and contractor oversight. In addition to these overall management issues, there have been problems with the design and performance of specific Deepwater assets. Given the size of DHS and the scope of its acquisitions, GAO is continuing to assess the department's acquisition oversight process and procedures in ongoing work. GAO is also currently reviewing the status of the Deepwater program's implementation and contractor oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our reviews of the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) acquisition organization and  the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater program.

The success of this mammoth task\u2014 one of the biggest mergers ever to take place within the federal  government\u2014rests in large part on DHS\u2019s ability to implement the  necessary management structure and processes for effectively acquiring  goods and services. A wide range of contractor-provided products,  technologies, and services are critical to the department\u2019s ability to  achieve its mission of protecting the nation from terrorism.

Although DHS has made some progress transforming its  components into a fully functioning department, this transformation  remains high risk. DHS has yet to implement a corrective action plan that  includes a comprehensive transformation strategy, and its management  systems\u2014including those related to acquisition\u2014are not yet integrated  and wholly operational. DHS\u2019s acquisition systems will require continued  attention to help prevent waste and ensure that DHS can allocate its  resources efficiently and effectively.", "In fiscal year 2006, DHS reported obligating $15.6 billion in acquisitions,  making it the third largest federal department in spending taxpayer  dollars. DHS is undertaking large, complex investments as the federal  government increasingly relies on contractors for roles and missions  previously performed by government employees. Contractors have an  important role to play in the discharge of the government\u2019s  responsibilities, and in some cases the use of contractors can result in  improved economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.  At the same time, there  may be occasions when contractors are used to provide certain services  because the government lacks another viable and timely option. In such  cases, the government may actually be paying more than if such services  were provided by federal employees.  In this environment of increased  reliance on contractors, sound planning and contract execution are critical  for success.

As of August 2006,  according to DHS officials, only five staff were assigned to  departmentwide oversight responsibilities. The officials told us that,  because their small staff faces the competing demands of providing  departmentwide oversight and providing acquisition support for urgent  needs at the component level, they have focused their efforts on  procurement execution rather than oversight. Our prior work shows that  in a highly functioning acquisition organization, the chief procurement  officer is in a position to oversee compliance by implementing strong  oversight mechanisms.

Deepwater, for example, has been designated as a level 1  investment, meaning that it is subject to review at the highest levels within  the department. We reported in 2005 that DHS\u2019s framework for reviewing  its major investments adopts several best practices from lessons learned  from leading commercial companies and successful federal programs that,  if applied consistently, could refine its ability to reduce risk to meet cost  and delivery targets. One of these best practices is a knowledge-based  approach for managers to hold reviews at key decision points in order to  reduce risk before investing resources in the next phase of a program\u2019s  development. For example, DHS\u2019s investment review policy encourages  program managers to demonstrate a product\u2019s design with critical design  reviews prior to a production decision.", "However, we have found that, based on our extensive body of work on this  knowledge-based approach, additional program reviews could be  incorporated into the process as internal controls to better position DHS  to make well-informed decisions on its major, complex investments. For  example, DHS does not require a review to ensure that an investment\u2019s  design performs as expected before investing in a prototype. We also  reported that DHS review processes permitted low-rate initial production  to be well underway before a mandatory review gave the go-ahead to  proceed to production. A review prior to initiating low-rate initial  production was not mandatory; rather, it was held at the discretion of the  Investment Review Board (IRB). Our best practices work shows that  successful investments reduce risk by ensuring that high levels of  knowledge are achieved at these key points of development. We have  found that investments that were not reviewed at the appropriate points  faced problems\u2014such as redesign\u2014that resulted in cost increases and  schedule delays.

The management approach of using a system integrator has been used on  other government programs that require system-of-systems integration,  such as the Army\u2019s Future Combat System, a networked family of weapons  and other systems. This type of business arrangement gives the contractor  extensive involvement in requirements development, design, and source  selection of major system and subsystem subcontractors.", "Government agencies have turned to the system integrator approach when  they believe they do not have the in-house capability to design, develop,  and manage complex acquisitions. Giving contractors more control and  influence over the government\u2019s acquisitions in a system integrator role  creates a potential risk that program decisions and products could be  influenced by the financial interest of the contractor (who is accountable  to its shareholders), which may not match the primary interest of the  government--maximizing its return on taxpayer dollars.  The system  integrator arrangement creates an inherent risk, as the contractor is given  more discretion to make certain program decisions.  Along with this  greater discretion comes the need for more government oversight and an  even greater need to develop well-defined outcomes at the outset.", "The proper role of contractors in providing services to the government is  currently the topic of some debate.  I believe there is a need to focus  greater attention on what type of functions and activities should be  contracted out and which ones should not.  There is also a need to review  and reconsider the current independence and conflict of interest rules  relating to contractors.  Finally, there is a need to identify the factors that  prompt the government to use contractors in circumstances where the  proper choice might be the use of civil servants or military personnel.

We noted that the risks could be mitigated to varying  degrees, but not without management attention. Our assessment of the  Deepwater program in 2004 found that the Coast Guard had not effectively  managed the program or overseen the system integrator. We reported last  year that the Coast Guard had revised its Deepwater implementation plan  to reflect additional homeland security responsibilities as a result of the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

In 2005, we reported that decision making was to  a large extent stove-piped, and some teams lacked adequate authority to  make decisions within their realm of responsibility. One source of  difficulty for some team members has been the fact that each of the two  major subcontractors has used its own management systems and  processes to manage different segments of the program. We noted that  decisions on air assets were made by Lockheed Martin, while decisions  regarding surface assets were made by Northrop Grumman. This approach  can lessen the likelihood that a system-of-systems outcome will be  achieved if decisions affecting the entire program are made without the  full consultation of all parties involved. In 2006, we reported that Coast  Guard officials believed collaboration among the subcontractors to be  problematic and that ICGS wielded little influence to compel decisions  among them. For example, when dealing with proposed design changes to  assets under construction, ICGS submitted the changes as two separate  proposals from both subcontractors rather than coordinating the separate  proposals into one coherent plan. According to Coast Guard performance  monitors, this approach complicates the government review of design  changes because the two proposals often carried overlapping work items,  thereby forcing the Coast Guard to act as the system integrator in those  situations.", "In addition, we reported in 2004 that the Coast Guard had not adequately  communicated to its operational personnel decisions on how new and old  assets would be integrated and how maintenance responsibilities would be  divided between government and contractor personnel. We also found that  the Coast Guard had not adequately staffed its program management  function.

The FRC was intended  as a long-term replacement for the legacy 110-foot patrol boats. Coast  Guard engineers raised concerns about the viability of the FRC design  (which involved building the FRC\u2019s hull, decks, and bulkheads out of  composite materials rather than steel) beginning in January 2005. In  February 2006, the Coast Guard suspended FRC design work after an  independent design review by third-party consultants demonstrated,  among other things, that the FRC would be far heavier and less efficient  than a typical patrol boat of similar length, in part, because it would need  four engines to meet Coast Guard speed requirements.", "In moving forward with the FRC acquisition, the Coast Guard will end up  with two classes of FRCs.

However, because the delivery of  Deepwater assets are interdependent within this acquisition approach,  schedule slippages and uncertainties associated with potential changes in  the design and capabilities of the new assets have increased the risks that  the Coast Guard may not meet its expanded homeland security  performance requirements within given budget parameters and milestone  dates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Reviews Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["Given the size of DHS and the scope of its acquisitions, we are continuing  to assess the department\u2019s acquisition oversight process and procedures in  ongoing work. For example, we are currently reviewing DHS\u2019s use of  contractors to provide management and professional services, including  the roles they are performing and how their performance is overseen. In  addition, the conference report to the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007 directed DHS\u2019s Chief  Procurement Officer to develop a procurement oversight plan, identifying  necessary oversight resources and how improvements in the department\u2019s  performance of its procurement functions will be achieved. We have been  directed to review the plan and provide our observations to congressional  committees. We are also reviewing the department\u2019s use of performance- based acquisitions.", "We will also continue to review Deepwater implementation and contract  oversight. We are currently reviewing aspects of the Deepwater program  for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees\u2019 Subcommittees on  Homeland Security. Our objectives are to review (1) the status of the  development and delivery of the major aviation and maritime assets that  comprise the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater program; (2) the history of the  contract, design, fielding, and grounding of the converted 123-foot patrol  boats and operational adjustments the Coast Guard making to account for  the removal from service of the 123-foot patrol boats; and (3) the status of  the Coast Guard\u2019s implementation of our 2004 recommendations on  Deepwater contract management for improving Deepwater program  management, holding the prime contractor accountable for meeting key  program goals, and facilitating cost control through competition. We will  share our results with those committees in April of this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Due to the complexity of its organization, DHS is likely to continue to face  challenges in unifying the acquisition functions of its components and  overseeing their acquisitions\u2014particularly those involving large and  complex investments. Although the Coast Guard has taken actions to  improve its management of the Deepwater program and oversight of the  system integrator, problems continue to emerge as the program is  implemented. DHS and the Coast Guard face the challenge of effectively  managing this program to obtain desired outcomes while making decisions  that are in the best interest of the taxpayer. Given its experience with  Deepwater, the department would be wise to apply lessons learned to its  other major, complex acquisitions, particularly those involving a system  integrator.", "Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement.
