However, instead of reviewing both major and nonmajor regulations, OIRA\u2019s reviews are currently limited to significant regulatory actions (about 800 per year at proposed and final rulemaking). OIRA conducts those reviews before the publication of the rule in the Federal Register as a notice of proposed rulemaking and before its publication as a final rule.

The October 1995 and April 1996 editions of the Unified Agenda contained a \u201creinventing government\u201d data element that indicated whether the regulatory action was part of the administration\u2019s reinventing government effort and, if so, whether the result would be elimination of CFR text or revision of CFR text. In those entries, brief abstracts were usually included describing the action or proposed action. We discovered during our review that at least one agency (EPA) did not list all of its page elimination and revision efforts in the Unified Agenda. Nevertheless, the Unified Agenda is the most complete governmentwide compendium of those activities available.", "Of the 5,354 separate entries in the October 1995 and April 1996 editions of the Unified Agenda, a total of 1,562 entries had a \u201creinventing government\u201d data element. Of these, 211 entries indicated that the action involved the elimination of text in the CFR, and 1,351 entries said that the action would revise text. The agencies with the most reinvention entries were DOT (212 entries), the Department of the Interior (171 entries), and the Department of Health and Human Services (165 entries). Of the 211 rule elimination entries in the Unified Agenda, only 1 was considered economically significant, and 22 were classified as significant for noneconomic reasons. Forty-three of the 1,351 revisions were considered economically significant, and 386 were considered significant for noneconomic reasons. indicated that the regulations had not been enforced for some time. For example:", "VA said it was eliminating a regulation providing lump-sum payments to veterans involved in an incident in Texas in 1906.", "The Department of Energy said it was removing regulations \u201crelated to defunct programs of financial assistance for electric and hybrid vehicle research and methane transportation research.\u201d", "A proposed Department of Agriculture rule would eliminate the import licensing system for sugar exempted from an import licensing fee, which the Department said had been suspended in 1985 and eliminated on January 1, 1995.", "Another Department of Agriculture action removed its regulation pertaining to the Special Agricultural Workers program because \u201cthe program expired on December 1, 1988.\u201d", "FDA said it was proposing to eliminate certain regulations \u201cthat refer to substances no longer used in product formulations or to products that are no longer marketed.\u201d", "The abstracts also frequently indicated that CFR text was being eliminated because the requirements were duplicative of other requirements that remained in the CFR (about 28 percent of the rule elimination abstracts).", "The remaining 1,351 \u201cReinventing Government\u201d entries indicated they would revise text in the CFR \u201cto reduce burden or duplication, or streamline requirements.\u201d Of these, 287 did not contain an abstract describing the nature of the reinvention effort. Of the 1,064 entries that did have an abstract, the most common reason given for the action being taken was to clarify a regulatory requirement (about 28 percent of the entries). For example:", "The Department of the Interior said it was rewriting its civil penalty procedures \u201cin plain English.\u201d", "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it was proposing to revise its regulations on confined spaces \u201cto state more clearly the employer\u2019s duty to ensure effective rescue capability.\u201d", "The Department of the Treasury said revisions to one of its rules would \u201cprovide greater clarity by defining previously undefined terms.\u201d", "The Department of Justice proposed an amendment to \u201cclarify the requirement for installation of curb ramps at existing pedestrian walkways\u201d in response to \u201cpublic concerns about the unique and significant capital expense\u201d of such ramps.", "The Department of Labor said it was giving guidance to employers on the information they must keep to determine compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act \u201cto ensure that applicable standards are easily understandable and reasonable.\u201d", "Other commonly cited reasons for the revisions were to update requirements to reflect current statutes, science, or conditions (about 26 percent); to establish new regulatory procedures or standards (about 18 percent); and to change a regulation found to be overly burdensome to industry, state or local governments, or federal agencies (about 14 percent). In 110 of the entries (about 10 percent), the changes appeared to be implementing statutory requirements. For example, one of the Department of the Treasury entries indicated that its Office of Thrift Supervision had issued an interim final rule that revised its risk-based capital standards \u201cas required by Sections 208 and 350 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994.\u201d In these and other cases, the revisions appeared less like \u201creinventions\u201d than part of the standard rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Page Eliminations Appear Unlikely to Reduce Burden, but Effect of Revisions Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["We also examined the Unified Agenda abstracts to determine whether the actions being announced appeared to reduce substantive regulatory burden. We defined the term \u201cregulatory burden\u201d broadly to include the cost of compliance, any lack of flexibility allowed by the rule, and related paperwork requirements. We also said the regulatory burden could be on industry, state or local governments, or the federal government. Although we attempted to determine as objectively as possible whether the actions described in the abstracts were likely to decrease regulatory burden, our results should be viewed as informed opinions rather than the result of rigorous analysis because (1) no commonly agreed-upon way to measure regulatory burden exists, (2) the determination of whether burden is increased or decreased by a related action is an inherently subjective process, and (3) the abstracts in the Unified Agenda sometimes provided only cursory information about the regulatory action at issue.", "Nevertheless, in more than 60 percent of the page elimination entries, it did not appear that the CFR pages being eliminated would reduce substantive regulatory burden. As noted previously, most of these actions were being taken because the regulations being eliminated were obsolete, and many of these did not appear to have been enforced for some time.", "Therefore, for these entries there did not appear to be any reduction in substantive regulatory burden. In some cases, the agencies themselves indicated that the page eliminations would not alter existing regulatory requirements, as shown in the following examples:", "The Department of Justice said one of its actions to eliminate obsolete sections was \u201ceditorial and non-substantive in nature and ... no impact on governmental or nongovernmental entities.\u201d", "The Department of Commerce said that although an entire part within the CFR was being removed, \u201c(t)his final rule does not make substantive changes to the existing regulations.\u201d", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) said it was eliminating provisions that were unnecessary because they were redundant of the Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) statute, and would \u201cnot change the substantive requirements of the MRB regulations.\u201d HUD also said it was eliminating provisions that were redundant of the Community Development Block Grant\u2019s regulations without substantively changing the requirements.", "Another HUD rule removed \u201cnearly identical provisions\u201d in various parts of the CFR, but again HUD said it did not change the substance of the provisions.", "Officials from both EPA and DOT told us that at least one of the goals of their rule elimination effort was to remove \u201cdead wood\u201d and that no substantive regulatory burden was being eliminated in many instances. One EPA official said that no substantive regulatory burden would be eliminated by any of EPA\u2019s rule elimination efforts.", "In about a quarter of the cases, the Unified Agenda abstracts did not provide enough information to allow us to determine whether the rule elimination action would reduce burden. However, 19 of the rule elimination actions (about 10 percent) appeared to reduce substantive regulatory burden. For example:", "The Food Safety Inspection Service proposed removal of a requirement that it approve facilities and equipment before they are used in official establishments. The agency also proposed amending its prior approval of most voluntary, plant-operated partial quality control programs.", "The Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule to \u201crevoke the requirement for increased frequency reports to FDA for postmarketing adverse experience reporting.\u201d", "DOT proposed rescinding its standards regarding the location, identification, and illumination of motor vehicle controls and displays, relying on market forces instead of regulatory requirements to ensure proper markings.", "We could not clearly determine whether substantive regulatory burden would be reduced for more than half of the 1,064 CFR revisions for which there was an abstract.

Another EPA proposal in this area would reportedly save local governments $138 million annually.", "Again, I would like to emphasize that our characterizations of actions that appear to reduce substantive regulatory burden and those that do not appear to reduce burden are based on a review of what was, at times, very limited information. Also, even though an action to eliminate or revise a regulation may not reduce the substantive regulatory burden imposed by that regulation, it may result in a reduction in other types of burden by making the regulation clearer or easier to find. Some of the proposed changes may also make the regulatory process more effective or results oriented, even though their effect on regulatory burden may be unclear or negligible. A final verdict regarding the value of these initiatives will have to await the reaction of the regulated community.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
