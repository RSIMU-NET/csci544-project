As a major result of this investment, the Department is on the verge of activating our nation's first missile defense system for protecting the United States from intercontinental ballistic missile attacks out of Northeast Asia. This initial capability--referred to as Limited Defensive Operations (LDO)--is the first step of a national priority to develop, field, and evolve over time an overarching ballistic missile defense system (BMDS). To fulfill a congressional mandate, GAO assessed how well the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) met its cost, schedule, testing, and performance goals during fiscal year 2004. GAO assessed the program last year and will continue to provide assessments of MDA progress through 2006."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["By the end of fiscal year 2004, MDA carried out activities needed to field an initial missile defense capability, as planned. These included delivery and emplacement of Ground-based Midcourse Defense interceptors; upgrades of ground-based radars; enhancements to Aegis Navy ships for improved surveillance and tracking; development of command and control software for system operation; and tests to verify that components of this initial capability can communicate as part of an integrated whole. However, the performance of the system remains uncertain and unverified, because a number of flight tests slipped into fiscal year 2005 and MDA has not successfully conducted an end-to-end flight test using operationally-representative hardware and software. Additionally, based on our analysis of prime contractor cost and schedule performance, the development of BMDS elements cost approximately $370 million more than planned during fiscal year 2004. To cover much of this cost overrun, MDA deferred work planned for fiscal year 2004, redirected funds earmarked for other programs, and requested additional funds in its fiscal year 2005 budget to cover the cost of deferred work. In the future, MDA will likely face increased funding risks. MDA plans to request about $10 billion annually from DOD for BMDS development, procurement, and sustainment. However, DOD's acquisition programs are likely to be competing for a decreasing share of the total federal budget and MDA's programs are competing against hundreds of other DOD programs. Also, MDA continues to budget for unanticipated cost growth. For example, the Airborne Laser program plans to spend an additional $1.5 billion to develop and demonstrate a prototype aircraft. Furthermore, procurement and sustainment will demand increased funding as more missile defense components are fielded over time. MDA policy defines a block as an integrated set of capabilities fielded during the 2-year block cycle, but we observed that MDA's fielding goals do not consistently match its cost goals. For example, Block 2004 funds are used to procure 32 Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense missiles, but of these missiles, 11 will be delivered in 2004-2005 and the remaining missiles will be delivered during 2006-2007.

It is built around the Ground-based Midcourse Defense  (GMD) element, augmented by shipboard Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense  (Aegis BMD) radars, and integrated by the Command, Control, Battle  Management, and Communications (C2BMC) element. The Block 2004  BMDS also includes the Army\u2019s Patriot element for point defense of  deployed U.S. forces against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.  The Block 2006 program builds directly upon Block 2004. It continues  element development and funds the next increment of fielding that adds  interceptors, new radars, and enhanced battle management capabilities.", "MDA is also carrying out an extensive research and development effort to  expand its current operational capability into future blocks. During fiscal  year 2004, MDA funded the development of four other major BMDS  elements\u2014Airborne Laser (ABL), Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI),  Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS), and Terminal High  Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)\u2014in addition to those elements  comprising the Block 2004 defensive capability.

This variance stemmed primarily from  two sources. First, the program encountered unanticipated complexity in  manufacturing and in integrating advanced optics and laser components  for the prototype system. Second, the push to rapidly develop the  prototype aircraft caused the program to limit testing of subcomponents,  which, in turn, generated rework and modified requirements. To address  the negative variance for ABL, program officials told us that they  redirected funds originally earmarked for other program efforts.", "GMD incurred a negative cost variance of $220 million. The contractor  originally underestimated the cost of readying the element for LDO and  experienced unexpected problems requiring some rework of its kill  vehicle. Additionally, in response to explosions at a subcontractor\u2019s  propellant mixing facility, the program incurred cost to transition  operations to a new vendor. To address its negative cost variance for  GMD, MDA deferred some work planned for completion in fiscal year 2004  into fiscal year 2005, and, to cover these increased costs, requested and  received additional money in its fiscal year 2005 budget. MDA also  directed other programs within the agency, such as Test and Evaluation, to  pick up GMD\u2019s portion of the cost of work tasks that benefited both  programs. Employing established EVM analysis techniques, we estimate  that the GMD contract\u2014which ends in September 2007\u2014will overrun its  budget by between $593 million and $950 million at its completion  assuming no corrective actions are taken.", "The negative STSS cost variance was largely attributed to a subcontractor  who had a number of quality and systems-engineering problems in  developing the payload\u2014sensors and supporting subsystems\u2014onboard  the two STSS demonstration satellites.

Based on DOD\u2019s  Future Years Defense Plan for fiscal years 2006-2011, MDA plans to  request, on average, Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation  (RDT&E) funding of about $10 billion annually. This funding supports  continued development, procurement, and sustainment of hardware and  software that MDA is fielding. However, sources outside and within DOD  are expected to put pressure on MDA\u2019s share of research and development  dollars.", "One factor for the increasing pressure is that DOD\u2019s acquisition programs  such as ballistic missile defense are likely to be competing for a decreasing  share of the federal budget. These programs are categorized as  \u201cdiscretionary spending\u201d as opposed to \u201cmandatory spending,\u201d such as  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In fiscal year 2004, discretionary  spending accounted for about 39 percent of the federal budget. The  Congressional Budget Office projects that discretionary spending is likely  to decrease to 36 percent of the federal budget by fiscal year 2009 and to  32 percent in by fiscal year 2014.", "A second factor is competing demands for funding within DOD. For  example, although missile defense is seen as a national priority and has  been funded nearly at requested levels in the past few years, MDA is facing  budget cuts. Indeed, DOD\u2019s Program Budget Direction of December 2004  called for MDA to plan for a $5 billion reduction in funding over fiscal  years 2006-2011. In addition, MDA is receiving about 13 percent of the $70  billion RDT&E budget in fiscal year 2005 but must continue to compete  with hundreds of existing and planned technology development and  acquisition programs for RDT&E funding. Cost growth of existing weapon  programs puts additional pressure on MDA\u2019s share. We found, for  example, that RDT&E cost estimates grew $6.7 billion for the Joint Strike  Fighter in calendar year 2003 and $9.2 billion for the Future Combat  System in fiscal year 2004.", "The third factor comes from within MDA itself. The agency continues to  respond to cost growth of ongoing programs to enhance the components  and elements of the BMDS. As noted above, ABL, GMD, and STSS incurred  a collective negative cost variance of approximately $370 million in fiscal  year 2004 and, as we reported last year, MDA elements incurred a  collective negative cost variance of about $380 million in fiscal year 2003.  Unless MDA can mitigate these cost variances, significant cost overruns  could occur on these contracts in the future. Estimating cost and schedule  targets of new and complex technologies can be difficult and, as  demonstrated, are often underestimated. Furthermore, hardware made  available for operational purposes is not being fully tested before being  fielded. If the need arises to correct problems identified in subsequent  testing, removing and recalling this hardware could prove costly.", "A fourth factor for the increasing pressure on MDA\u2019s RDT&E budget is  that MDA is starting to field components of the BMDS, whose production,  operation, and sustainment are also funded by RDT&E dollars. A flat  RDT&E budget combined with growing fielding costs would result in a  decrease in investment in research and development\u2014MDA\u2019s primary  mission. According to program documentation, MDA\u2019s budget for its  fielding activities between fiscal years 2006 and 2011 includes an average  of $1.76 billion per year for procuring BMDS assets and an additional $400  million per year for sustaining the fielded capability. However, the fielding  costs can be expected to increase in the years to come as more  components of GMD, Aegis BMD, and THAAD are integrated into the  BMDS.", "Operations and support (O&S) costs of fielded systems are generally  significant and can be expected to be substantial for operational  capabilities of the BMDS. In our 2003 report on total-ownership (life-cycle)  cost, we found that the cost to develop and procure a weapon system  usually represents about 28 percent of the weapon system\u2019s life-cycle cost;  O&S costs typically account for the remaining 72 percent of a weapon\u2019s  systems total life-cycle cost. The only BMDS element thus far with a life- cycle cost estimate, the Army\u2019s Patriot-MEADS missile defense program,  has comparable life-cycle cost percentages. According to the Army\u2019s  Lower-Tier Project Office, the Patriot-MEADS development cost accounts  for 6.4 percent, procurement accounts for 21.2 percent, and O&S costs  account for 72.4 percent of the total life-cycle cost of $151 billion.", "DOD officials cautioned us that estimating life-cycle costs of missile  defense capabilities involves considerable uncertainty. For example, O&S  costs depend on the state of readiness of the fielded system, which is  difficult to predict. In addition, historical data of component reliability in  the field and the cost to repair operational missile defense assets are  essentially nonexistent. Furthermore, life-cycle cost estimates of standard  DOD weapon systems assume O&S costs apply for long periods of time, on  the order of 20 years. Components of the BMDS, however, might be in the  field for shorter durations. Finally, our previous work recognized that  life-cycle cost estimates for revolutionary systems such as the ABL  program, which utilize new technologies in unproven applications, are  unknown. When fielded, operation and support efforts for ABL could be  substantial because ABL will require unique support for its laser and  beam-control components and ground infrastructure for chemical storage,  mixing, and handling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Is Not Consistently Matching Cost and Fielding Goals", "paragraphs": ["In assessing the extent MDA achieved its stated goals in fiscal year 2004,  we observed that MDA\u2019s cost goal for a given block is not consistently  aligned with that block\u2019s fielding goals.
