Under section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, the President is allowed to call up to 1 million National Guard and Reserve members to active duty for up to 2 years. GAO was asked to review issues related to the call-up of reservists following September 11, 2001. GAO examined (1) whether the Department of Defense (DOD) followed existing operation plans when mobilizing forces, (2) the extent to which responsible officials had visibility over the mobilization process, and (3) approaches the services have taken to provide predictability to reservists. GAO also determined the extent to which the Ready Reserve forces, which make up over 98 percent of nonretired reservists, were available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 300,000 of the 1.2 million National Guard and Reserve personnel have been called to active duty since September 11, 2001. They fought on the front lines in Iraq; tracked terrorists throughout Asia and Africa; maintained the peace in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and now Iraq; and participated in a wide range of domestic missions. However, DOD's process to mobilize reservists after September 11 had to be modified and contained numerous inefficiencies. Existing operation plans did not fully address the mobilization requirements needed to deal with the terrorist attacks or uncertain overseas requirements. For example, no previous requirements called for the extended use of National Guard and Reserve members to fly combat air patrols over the nation's capital and major cities. Because DOD could not rely on existing operation plans to guide its mobilizations, it used a modified process that relied on additional management oversight and multiple layers of coordination, which resulted in a process that was slower and less efficient than the traditional process. Under the modified process, the Secretary of Defense signed 246 deployment orders to mobilize over 280,000 reservists compared to the less than 10 deployment orders needed to mobilize over 220,000 reservists during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. DOD did not have visibility over the entire mobilization process primarily because it lacked adequate systems for tracking personnel and other resources. DOD's primary automated readiness reporting system could not adequately track the personnel and other resources within the small units that were frequently needed. Also, visibility was lost because some services' active and reserve systems for tracking personnel were incompatible, resulting in ad hoc coordination between active and reserve officials. Both groups often resorted to tracking mobilizations with computer spreadsheets. In addition, some reservists were deployed beyond dates specified in their orders or stayed on alert for more than a year and never mobilized because officials lost visibility. The services have used two primary approaches--predictable operating cycles and advance notification--to provide time for units and personnel to prepare for mobilizations. All the services provide predictability to portions of their forces through some type of standard operating cycle, but only the Air Force has a standard operating cycle that brings predictability to both its active and reserve forces. The Army prioritizes its units, and lower-priority units generally need extra training and preparation time before deploying. Yet, since September 11, a number of lower-priority units have been mobilized with relatively little advance notice. Despite the large number of lower-priority units within the Army Guard and Reserve, the Army does not have a standard operating cycle to provide predictability to its reserves. Without such a concept, the Army's opportunities to provide extra training and preparation time to its reserve forces are limited. Mobilizations were hampered because one-quarter of the Ready Reserve was not readily available for mobilization. Over 70,000 reservists could not be mobilized because they had not completed their training requirements, and the services lacked information needed to fully use the 300,000 pretrained IRR members."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Mobilization is a complex process used to move the military from its  peacetime posture to a heightened state of readiness to support national  security objectives in time of war or other national emergency.

The process involves many different  organizations and, while reserve component officials have a role in the  process, civilian leaders and active military officials within the Department  of Defense (DOD) take the lead in the process. Active component officials  generate and validate mobilization requirements, and civilian leaders  approve requests to alert, mobilize, and deploy forces.

We also collected  and analyzed information on the roles and responsibilities of key  mobilization officials, the steps of the mobilization process, and the  methods and systems used to track mobilization requirements and  reservists who had been mobilized. To gain first-hand knowledge about  the effects of mobilizations on individual reservists, we interviewed both  unit and individual reservists at sites where they were deployed or  undergoing mobilization processing and training. We also observed DOD\u2019s  2-1/2 day November 2002 symposium where senior military and civilian  officials came together and reviewed the mobilization process.

Reserve forces can be divided  into three major categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and  the Retired Reserve. The Ready Reserve had approximately 1.2 million  Guard and Reserve members at the end of fiscal year 2002, and its  members were the only reservists who were subject to mobilization under  the partial mobilization declared by President Bush on September 14,  2001.", "Within the Ready Reserve, there are three subcategories: the Selected  Reserve, the IRR, and the Inactive National Guard. Members of all three  subcategories are subject to mobilization under a partial mobilization.", "In fiscal year 2002, the Selected Reserve had 882,142 members. Members  of the Selected Reserve are all the personnel who are active members of  the National Guard or Reserve units who participate in regularly  scheduled training. As a result, they draw regular pay for their reserve  service. It also includes individual mobilization augmentees\u2014individuals  who train regularly, for pay with active component units.  In fiscal year 2002, the IRR had 314,037 members. During a partial  mobilization these individuals, who were previously trained during periods  of active duty service, can be mobilized to fill requirements. Each year, the  services transfer thousands of personnel who have completed the active  duty or Selected Reserve portions of their military contracts, but who have  not reached the end of their minimum service obligations, to the IRR.", "However, IRR members do not participate in any regularly scheduled  training, and they are not paid for their membership in the IRR.  In fiscal year 2002, the Inactive National Guard had 3,142 Army National  Guard members. This subcategory contains individuals who are  temporarily unable to participate in regular training but who wish to  remain attached to their National Guard units.

It  continued to use this authority to mobilize reservists for ongoing  operations in these areas even after the partial mobilization authority  (section 12302) was invoked on September 14, 2001.", "The partial mobilization authority has been used to support both domestic  and overseas missions related to the global war on terrorism, including the  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. After invoking section 12302 on  September 14, 2001, the President delegated his mobilization authority to  the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation. The  Secretary of Defense further delegated this authority to the service  secretaries and allowed them to delegate the authority to any civilian  official who was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  When the Secretary of Defense delegated his authority, he set limits on the  numbers of personnel that the services could mobilize. On September 14,  2001, the Secretary of Defense assigned the Army a mobilization cap of  10,000 personnel; the Navy a cap of 3,000; the Marine Corps a cap of 7,500;  and the Air Force a cap of 13,000, for a total cap of 33,500. The caps were  raised several times, but in aggregate they have remained below 300,000  since they were first established.", "Since September 11, 2001, the services have also made extensive use of  their section 12301(d) authority. This authority can involve complicated  administrative processing because reservists must volunteer to be  activated, and individuals who are brought on to active duty under this  authority have varying starting and ending dates. However, this authority  provides flexibility that is advantageous to both individual reservists  members and the services. The reservists can schedule their active duty  periods around family and work responsibilities, and the services are not  constrained by the numerical caps and time limitations of other  mobilization authorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mobilization Process", "paragraphs": ["As figure 1 indicates, mobilization is a decentralized process that requires  the collaboration of many organizations throughout DOD.", "The mobilization process typically begins with the component  commanders, who are responsible for commanding their services\u2019 active  and reserve forces within a combatant commander\u2019s area of  responsibility. The component commanders identify requirements for  wars or contingency operations within their areas of responsibility and  submit the requirements to the combatant commanders. The combatant  commanders, who have responsibility and operational control over forces  from two or more services, consolidate the requirements from their  component commanders and develop \u201crequests for forces\u201d (RFF). Each  RFF generally identifies the mission, along with the equipment, personnel,  units, types of units, or general capabilities that are necessary to carry out  the mission. RFFs may be very detailed or very general, depending on the  nature of the mission. Furthermore, RFFs typically contain requirements  that must be filled by more than one service.", "The combatant commanders send RFFs to the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, who is the principal military advisor to the President and  the Secretary of Defense on mobilization matters. The Joint Staff validates  and prioritizes requirements from the combatant commanders and then  sends draft deployment orders via E-mail to the supporting commanders,  who will supply forces or equipment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff considers (1) the assessments of the service headquarters, reserve  component commanders, and supporting combatant commanders;   (2) input from his own staff; and (3) the technical advice, legal opinions,  and policies provided by OSD. The Chairman then makes a  recommendation to the Secretary of Defense concerning the timing of  mobilizations and the units or individuals to be mobilized.", "When the Secretary of Defense completes his review of the validated RFF  and is satisfied with the mobilization justification, he authorizes the  deployment of forces, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issues  a deployment order. The services then review the approved requirements  on the deployment order and coordinate with applicable force providers  and reserve component headquarters to check the readiness of the units  that had been projected to fill the requirements. If necessary, units or  individuals may be identified to substitute for, or augment, the units and  individuals that were originally projected. When the units or individuals  are firmly identified for mobilization, the assistant secretaries of the  military departments who have responsibilities for manpower and reserve  affairs issues approve the mobilization packages.", "Finally, the services issue mobilization orders to units and individuals.  These orders state where and when to report for duty, as well as the length  of duty. In September 2001, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Personnel and Readiness), which is responsible for developing the  policies, plans, and programs to manage the readiness of both active and  reserve forces, issued a memorandum containing specific mobilization  guidance. This guidance instructed the military departments to write  mobilization orders for 1 year but allowed the service secretaries the  option of extending mobilizations for a second year.", "In subsequent mobilization guidance, issued in January, March, and July  2002, the Under Secretary instructed the services to use volunteers to the  maximum extent possible, so that involuntary mobilizations would be  minimized. In conjunction with the services, the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, which has overall responsibility  for reserve policies and procedures within DOD, set a goal to provide  reservists with 30 days notice prior to mobilization, when operationally  feasible. The services took different approaches when alerting their  reservists prior to mobilization. The Army took the most formal approach  and attempted to provide its reservists with official orders 30 days prior to  their mobilization dates. The other services took less formal approaches  and tried to notify reservists of impending mobilizations and deployments  when requirements were identified or validated, or at some other key  point in the mobilization process.", "According to DOD officials, the mobilization process\u2014from the time a  requirement is generated until the time that a reservist reports to a  mobilization site to fill that requirement\u2014can take anywhere from 1 day to  several months, but it normally takes several weeks. Based on our  observations at mobilization processing sites and discussions with  mobilization officials, we found that most reservists were able to complete  their required briefings, screenings, and administrative functions within 24  to 96 hours after reaching their mobilization sites. However, some  reservists required lengthy postmobilization training before they were able  to deploy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reserve Tempo", "paragraphs": ["Unreliable and inconsistent data make it difficult to quantify the exact  change in the tempo of reserve operations since September 11, 2001.  Officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve  Affairs have characterized mobilization data from the early days and  weeks following September 11 as questionable. In addition, because  reservists can perform a wide variety of sometimes-overlapping training  and operational missions, in a variety of voluntary or involuntary duty  statuses, mobilization data have been captured differently over time. For  example, because the state governors mobilized large numbers of National  Guard troops to provide security at their civilian airports, DOD\u2019s  mobilization figures for most of 2002 included state active duty figures as  well as figures for federal mobilizations. However, state active duty was  dropped from DOD\u2019s mobilization figures after the National Guard moved  out of the last civilian airport in September 2002. It is also difficult to fully  capture increases in reserve tempos because mobilization figures that are  based strictly on section 12302 partial mobilization orders ignore the  major contributions of reserve volunteers, some of whom are serving  lengthy tours under section 12301(d) orders. Despite the identified data  challenges, figure 2 uses consistently reported data to demonstrate that  reserve mobilizations have not dipped below 50,000 during any week since  January 2002.

We assessed the relations between reservists and their  civilian employers, focusing specifically on DOD\u2019s outreach efforts  designed to improve these important relationships. We found that many  employers we surveyed were not receiving adequate advance notice prior  to their reservist employees\u2019 departure for military duty. We reported that  in spite of repeated memoranda from the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Reserve Affairs, advance notification continued to be a problem and  that the services had not consistently met the 30-day advance notification  goal. We recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the services to  determine how many orders are not being issued 30 days in advance of  deployments and why, and then take the necessary corrective actions  toward fuller compliance with the goal.

We also examined whether the Army is  collecting and maintaining information on reservists\u2019 health. In April 2003,  we reported that without adequate examinations, the Army may train,  support, and mobilize reservists who are unfit for duty. Further, the Army  had not consistently carried out the statutory requirements for monitoring  the health and dental status of Army early deploying reservists. At the  early deploying units we visited, approximately 66 percent of the medical  records were available for review. We found that about 68 percent of the  required physical examinations for those over age 40 had not been  performed and that none of the annual medical certificates required of  reservists had been completed by reservists and reviewed by the units.

Units provide readiness reports to a central site  where the data are processed and stored and then distributed to decision  makers. The information in the system is supposed to support crisis  response planning as well as deliberate planning. However, the services  are only required to register forces that are included in operation plans or  other war-planning documents. Generally, all large units report their  readiness in the system. However, resources within the units are not  necessarily reported. For example, GSORTS could show that a specific  unit is not ready to perform its mission, but fail to capture information that  would indicate that some of the personnel and equipment within the unit  are capable of performing their mission. Such information would benefit  the services in their efforts to assemble the forces needed to meet joint  organizational requirements.", "Because the Air Force combined various capabilities into nontraditional  force groups in support of its Aerospace Expeditionary Force, it  recognized the need to report readiness for small \u201cbuilding block\u201d units  that could be combined to provide the needed capabilities.

Additionally, Air Force  officials told us that their major commands have had trouble filling new  requirements because they cannot consistently determine who has  volunteered and who is already serving on active duty. Because of limited  visibility, some Navy processing personnel did not know in advance which  reservists had been ordered to their mobilization processing sites or when  the reservists were expected to report.", "Air Force officials said that they either totally lost or had diminished  visibility over their reservists once they were mobilized and assigned to  active commands. Reserve component officials from the Air Force said  that a tracking system does not exist to effectively monitor reservists from  the time they are mobilized and assigned to an active command to the time  they are demobilized and return to their normal reserve status. As a result,  reservists were deployed beyond their scheduled return dates and were  not able to take the leave to which they were entitled prior to the  expiration of their orders. Reserve officials said that this happened  because replacement personnel had not arrived in time to relieve the  reservists and the active commands were not willing to send the deployed  reservists home until replacements had arrived. In many cases, Air Force  reserve component headquarters said they did not have visibility over the  replacement personnel because these personnel were coming from active  component units.", "The Army experienced situations where the lack of visibility contributed  to the breaking of service policies.

The Army\u2019s force providers were to review the list  of units on alert each month and determine whether the units needed to  remain on alert. If the force providers needed to keep any units on alert  beyond 90 days, they could request an extension from the Assistant  Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs).

Officials in both the Air National Guard and the Air Force  Reserve told us that they did not know whether they were supposed to  follow the old \u201cofficial\u201d instruction or the revised (but unsigned)  instructions. The lack of clear guidance led to situations where Air  National Guard units had been mobilized without the knowledge of the Air  National Guard headquarters\u2019 crisis action teams, consisting of officials  responsible for matching requirements with available units and personnel.  For example, on February 22, 2003, the Air Mobility Command mobilized  the 163rd Air Refueling Wing at the March Air Reserve Base. When we  contacted the Air National Guard crisis action team 3 days later, the team  was unaware that the 163rd had been mobilized. According to a senior  level Air National Guard official, the Air Mobility Command had bypassed  the Guard\u2019s crisis action team and directly notified the unit of the  mobilization. According to this official, the Guard\u2019s crisis action team had  been bypassed on mobilizations directed by both the Air Mobility  Command and the Air Combat Command.", "The lack of clear guidance for mobilizing reservists also slowed down the  Army\u2019s mobilization process. On October 24, 2001, the Army issued  guidance on the mobilization process. However, according to senior Army  policy officials, the Army\u2019s initial personnel replacement policy was  unclear. This led to cases where the Army Reserve would send a request  for a requirement to fill an empty position through the entire mobilization  process rather than simply attempt to fill the position with another  qualified individual. Between September 2001 and June 2002, the Army  Reserve submitted 567 requests for just one individual because the initial  person selected could not fill the position. These requests slowed down  the mobilization process as each request was reviewed. The Army recently  drafted a policy to clarify its replacement procedures.", "The Navy\u2019s failure to update its guidance on the delegation of mobilization  authority led to a redundancy of efforts. In June 2002, the Secretary of  Defense, under the President\u2019s partial mobilization authority, delegated  mobilization authority to the service secretaries and permitted further  delegation only to civilian officials who were appointed by the President  and confirmed by the Senate. However, the Navy had not updated its  mobilization authority guidance, and consequently the Secretary of the  Navy continued delegating mobilization authority to the Chief of Naval  Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who in turn  continued to approve mobilizations until 2003.

For example, the Air Force found that the roles and  responsibilities of its crisis action teams had not been adequately defined  and that there was insufficient coordination between these crisis action  teams during the planning and execution stages of the mobilization  process. This led to different interpretations of the policies concerning the  use of volunteers.

In  August 1998, the Air Force adopted the Expeditionary Aerospace Force  concept to help it manage its commitments while reducing the deployment  burden on its people. This concept established a standard 15-month  operating cycle and divided the Air Force into 10 groups, each containing a  mix of active, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve forces. Two  groups were scheduled to deploy during each of the five, 3-month  increments within the standard 15-month operating cycle. However,  because two groups contained more forces than were generally needed to  cover worldwide contingency operations, and because the predictable  cycles provided reservists with months of advance notice, the Air Force  Reserve and the Air National Guard were able to rely on volunteers to  meet significant portions of their requirements, thus avoiding large-scale  involuntary mobilizations.", "While the predictability offered by the Air Force\u2019s standard operating cycle  has proved beneficial during \u201csteady state\u201d operations, the Expeditionary  Aerospace Force concept is not yet able to deal with large and rapid  surges in requirements.

For the last 4 years, a contractor has been regularly matching the Army\u2019s  entire personnel database of bad addresses with a credit bureau\u2019s address  database. For over 10 years, the Army has used another contractor to  update a small number of addresses, one at a time. Despite these efforts,  the Army still had over 40,000 bad addresses in its database as of April  2003, and it recently contracted with its second contractor to do batch  updates rather than one-at-a-time updates. The Marine Corps just started  using its contractor. Finally, the Army and the Coast Guard have  implemented Web-based systems that encourage IRR members to update  critical contact information on the Internet. According to an official  representing the Naval Reserve Personnel Center, the Navy has also  started to create a Web-based screening questionnaire to better track IRR  members. However, these efforts are not linked to a results-oriented  management framework that establishes specific goals to improve access  to accurate addresses and identifies the resources and performance  measures necessary to ensure success.", "Finally, the services order a small number of their IRR members to  participate in a 1-day screening event at a specific site to verify they are fit  and available for mobilization. The screening events focus on a specific  number of IRR members to verify their physical existence, condition, and  personal contact data. Even though the total number of IRR members  ordered to report for screening during a fiscal year is relatively small, the  services have met with limited success as the screening event participation  rates in table 4 indicate.", "As indicated in table 4, the Army and the Air Force have not conducted  screenings since 2000 and 2001, respectively. An Army Personnel  Command After Action Report concluded that screenings should not be  conducted until clear objectives are established and realistic cost and  benefit assessments are completed. The Air Force also decided not to  conduct screening events. Thus, these two services are not using one of  their three primary methods to gain and maintain access to their IRR  members.", "Furthermore, table 3 shows that the participation rates are relatively low.  The services indicated that the low screening event participation rates  were based on the services\u2019 inability to contact members of the IRR  because of incorrect addresses; IRR members who were excused because  of stated conflicts involving work, vacation plans, religious issues, or  physical disabilities among others; and members who ignored orders and  avoided participation in the screening events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Services Lack Results-Oriented Goals and Performance Measures to Improve Use of IRR Access", "paragraphs": ["The services do not have results-oriented goals and performance measures  to improve their reliance on the three primary methods to access IRR  members. Specifically, the services have concentrated their efforts on exit  briefings, questionnaires to update critical information, and periodic  screening events. However, they have not focused on the results of those  activities, as evidenced by persistent low response rates to questionnaires  and low screening event participation rates. By focusing on the execution  of these activities rather than their results, the services have not    established objective, quantifiable, and measurable performance goals to  improve the results of their three primary efforts to access;    established a basis for comparing actual program results with the goals in  order to develop performance indicators to track their progress in  attaining results-oriented goals; and    described the resources and means required to verify and validate  measured values."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSD and Service Policies Have Discouraged the Use of the IRR", "paragraphs": ["OSD and service policies have discouraged the use of the IRR because IRR  members do not participate in any regularly scheduled training and thus  are not regularly paid. The policies are also intended to avoid the negative  effects on individual IRR members. For example, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness provided guidance dated July 19,  2002, to the services that emphasized the use of volunteers before  involuntarily mobilizing reservists to minimize the effects of mobilization  on the lives of the reservists, their families, and their employers.", "Policies intended to avoid the negative effects on individual reservists may  be disruptive to all reservists as well as to entire units, because they  contribute to situations where individual mobilization requirements are  filled with personnel from reserve units, thus creating personnel shortages  within the units that had supplied the reservists and affecting the units\u2019  readiness to mobilize and deploy. For example, in its reluctance to use the  IRR, the Army filled many of its individual mobilization requirements with  personnel from reserve units. In doing so, the Army created personnel  shortages within the units that had supplied the reservists. In some cases,  the Army had to later locate and transfer replacement personnel into these  units when the units were mobilized, thus transferring several unit  personnel as a result of a single individual requirement. Specifically, the  Army mobilized a combat support hospital unit that was 142 individuals  short, including the commanding officer, of its authorized strength of 509  personnel. To increase the hospital unit\u2019s strength to an acceptable level  for mobilization, the Army took a commanding officer and other needed  personnel from four reserve units. By taking this course of action, the  Army immediately degraded the mission capability and readiness of the  four affected units. The Army compounded this negative effect when it  later mobilized the already significantly degraded unit that gave up its  commanding officer to the hospital unit.", "Further, the reluctance of one service to use the IRR can affect other  services. For example, the Air Force\u2019s reluctance to access any of its more  than 44,000 IRR members has left the responsibility for guarding Air Force  bases to over 9,000 Army National Guard unit personnel. According to a  senior Air Force official, the Air Force did not even consider using its own  IRR pool. Because the Army National Guard volunteered for the mission,  the Air Force did not consider mobilizing any of its 3,900 IRR members  who held security force specialty codes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["About 300,000 of the 1.2 million National Guard and Reserve personnel  have been called to active duty since September 11, 2001.

However, the process  to mobilize reservists had to be modified and contained numerous  inefficiencies. Existing operation plans did not adequately address the  mobilization requirements needed to deal with terrorist attacks and  overseas requirements. We recognize that some threats are impossible to  predict but until the combatant commanders identify all of the  mobilization requirements that have evolved since September 11, 2001\u2014 and create or update their operation plans as necessary to account for  these requirements\u2014DOD risks the continued need for additional  management oversight and coordination between officials to fill  mobilization requirements, thus slowing the mobilization effort and  making it less efficient.", "DOD officials also did not have visibility over the entire mobilization  process. Specifically, without the ability to capture the readiness of  personnel and other resources within the small units that were frequently  needed by combatant commanders, the Army and the Navy will continue  to face difficulties in their efforts to assemble the forces needed to meet  joint organizational requirements. Furthermore, until all of the services  develop fully integrated automated systems that provide for the seamless  transfer of reservists\u2019 information between reserve and active  components, the components will continue to face cumbersome  workarounds to obtain the data to track the length of reservists\u2019  mobilization or their deployment status. In addition, until the services  update key mobilization instructions, notices, and publications to reflect  the modified mobilization process, DOD and the services risk continued  mobilization slowdowns and duplication of efforts.", "All of the services provide predictability to portions of their active forces  through some type of standard operating cycle, but only the Air Force has  a standard operating cycle that brings predictability to both its active and  reserve forces. Moreover, the Army\u2019s reserve forces face increasing use to  meet operational requirements. However, without a standard operating  concept to help increase predictability for its units, the Army risks  mobilizing units and individuals that are unprepared for deployment.", "Finally, the services have limited access to portions of the Ready Reserve  and are thus forced to spread requirements across the remaining reserve  force, leading to longer or more frequent deployments. Specifically, the  services\u2019 use of their primary IRR access methods\u2014exit briefings,  questionnaires, and screenings\u2014did not obtain the results necessary to  gain and maintain access to their members. Until the services develop  results-oriented goals and performance measures to improve the use of  their primary methods to access IRR members, the services will be unable  to systematically identify opportunities to better access their IRR  members for mobilization. Moreover, OSD and service policies have  discouraged the use of the IRR in order to avoid the negative effects on  individual IRR members.

To find out how the services screen and fill  requirements, as well as their procedures for turning generic \u201ccapability\u201d  type requirements into actual unit and personnel requirements, we met  with, and collected and analyzed data from, a variety of active and reserve  component offices within each of the services.

We also discussed and observed the operation of the classified and  unclassified automated systems that are being used to track mobilized  units and individuals, as well as mobilization requirements. The Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs served as our  primary source for aggregate personnel and mobilization data. However,  data from the early days and weeks following September 11, 2001, are not  reliable.
