Federal agencies are responsible for their hiring processes, but must generally comply with applicable Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules and regulations. Congressional requesters asked GAO to identify federal hiring obstacles, provide examples of innovative hiring practices, and identify opportunities for improvement. To address these issues, GAO interviewed the human resources directors in 24 largest departments and agencies, analyzed the hiring practices of five federal executive branch agencies, and reviewed OPM's role in the hiring process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There is widespread recognition that the current federal hiring process all too often does not meet the needs of agencies in achieving their missions, managers in filling positions with the right talent, and applicants for a timely, efficient, transparent, and merit-based process. Numerous studies over the past decade have noted problems with the federal hiring process. Nearly all of the federal human resource directors from the 24 largest federal agencies told us that it takes too long to hire quality employees. According to data compiled by OPM, the estimated time to fill a competitive service position was typically more than 3 months, with some human resources directors citing examples of hiring delays exceeding 6 months. The competitive hiring process is hampered by inefficient or ineffective practices, including defining a vacant job and pay that is bound by narrow federal classification standards, unclear job announcements, the quality of certain applicant assessment tools, time-consuming panels to evaluate applicants, and the \"rule of three\" that limits selecting managers choice of candidates. Equally important, agencies need to develop their hiring systems using a strategic and results-oriented approach. GAO studied five agencies that human capital experts identified as having taken steps to improve parts of the hiring process--the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of the Army, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and Forest Service. Some of these practices might help agencies across government improve their hiring processes. OPM recognizes that the federal hiring process needs reform and has a major initiative to study the federal hiring process. OPM's efforts will be most effective to the extent to which they help transform agency hiring practices from process focused to mission-focused hiring tools that are more closely integrated into agencies strategic plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A high performance organization needs a dynamic, results-oriented  workforce with the requisite talents, multidisciplinary knowledge, and up- to-date skills to ensure that it is equipped to accomplish its mission and  achieve its goals.  To acquire such a workforce and replace the huge cohort  of federal employees eligible for retirement within the next 5-10 years  demands that agencies have effective hiring processes so that they can  compete for talented people in a highly competitive job market.  Governmentwide, the number of federal new hires was about 50,000 a year  in the mid-1990s, when many agencies were downsizing, but totaled more  than 143,000 in fiscal year 2002.  The annual number of new hires could  easily increase to more than 150,000 as agencies take actions to address the  security needs arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and  to fill vacancies created by the large number of employees expected to  retire over the next few years.

As shown in figure 1, the majority of federal  hiring is for competitive service positions, and most are filled through the  competitive examination process, which is governed by statutes and OPM  regulations.   In fiscal year 2001, about 72 percent (75,000 of the 104,000) of  jobs that were filled were staffed using competitive service hiring  authorities.   In fiscal year 2002, with the increased excepted service hiring  of the Transportation Security Administration, the percentage of  competitive service hires dropped to 52 percent (74,000 of 143,000).", "While recognizing the need for flexibility in hiring employees, the federal  government seeks to ensure that appointments comply with the  cornerstone of federal hiring\u2014the merit principles.

Congress has retained  the principle of appointment by merit throughout its various amendments  and compilations of civil service laws.  In enacting the Civil Service Reform  Act of 1978, Congress reiterated the importance of merit in hiring by  including a merit principle, which requires that \u201cecruitment should be  from qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an endeavor to  achieve a work force from all segments of society, and selection and  advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability,  knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that  all receive equal opportunity.\u201d  OPM is responsible for ensuring that the  personnel management functions it delegates to agencies are conducted in  accordance with merit principles and the standards it has established for  conducting those functions.  In January 1996, OPM delegated examining  authority, acting under the authority of Public Law 104-52, to federal  agencies for virtually all positions in the competitive service.

Another HR director  noted that many managers, supervisors, and job applicants do not  understand the rules and procedures governing federal employment.  She  said that because of the lack of expertise and complicated process, the  agency often loses out in competition with the private sector because of its  inability to make timely job offers. Another HR director told us that a  significant factor that hampers hiring is the paperwork-intensive hiring  process that continues from application, rating and ranking of applicants  and production of best qualified lists, through to the \u201c17 forms\u201d that a new  hire must complete before being brought onboard.", "Although, as noted above, nearly all HR directors and others note that the  time to hire is too long for most federal hires.  Comprehensive department  or governmentwide data are not available; however, in fiscal year 2002,  OPM compiled and analyzed data on time-to-hire and found that it typically  took 102 days for agencies to fill a vacancy using the competitive process.   OPM defined the time to hire time frame as the time between when the  request to hire or fill a position was received in the HR office to the  appointment of an applicant to the position.

The  USGS approach was to focus on automating its hiring process for all of its  occupations, except research Senior Executive Service positions, in order  to reduce hiring time, increase the number of applicants, and better serve  its internal and external customers.  Army\u2019s approach was a data-driven  approach\u2014Army developed automated tools to identify weaknesses in its  hiring process and identified an approach to overcome them, including  automation.  Census\u2019s approach, in reaction to the need to quickly hire 500  specialists for the 2000 Census, was to work with OPM to jointly develop an  automated hiring system for three mission-critical occupations and later to  work toward integrating hiring for all its occupations into its parent  organization\u2019s automated hiring system.  And, as discussed later, OPM also   identified hiring improvements as a critical goal in its strategic plan and has  a multi-faceted hiring initiative under way.

Defining the job and  setting pay must be based on federal job classification standards, which are  set forth in the Classification Act of 1949.  The classification process and  standard job classifications were generally developed decades ago when  typical jobs were more narrowly defined and in many cases, were clerical  or administrative.  However, today\u2019s knowledge-based organizations\u2019 jobs  require a much broader array of tasks that may cross over the narrow and  rigid boundaries of job classifications.  The federal job classification  process not only delays the hiring process, but more important, the  resulting job classifications and related pay might not match the actual  duties of the job.  This mismatch can hamper efforts to fill the positions  with the right employees.", "Once management decides to fill a vacant position, or create a new  position, the HR office is called upon to see if a position description exists.   If a position description does not exist or is not accurate for the vacant  position, a position description must be completed.

The  Classification Act of 1949 provides a plan for classifying positions and sets  out 15 grade levels.  The law expresses these grade levels in terms of the  difficulty and level of responsibility for a specific position.  OPM develops  standards that must be consistent with the principles in the Classification  Act of 1949.  The classification system categorizes jobs or positions  according to the kind of work done, the level of difficulty and  responsibility, and the qualifications required for the position, and serves as  a building block to determine the pay for the position.  Today\u2019s knowledge- based organizations\u2019 jobs require a much broader array of tasks that may  cross over the narrow and rigid boundaries of job classification standards  and make it difficult to fit the job appropriately into one of the over 400  occupations.  According to a recent OPM study, a key problem with  classification is that, under present rules, characteristics such as workload,  quality of work, and results are not classification factors.", "As reported in a January 2003 report of the National Commission on the  Public Service, OPM\u2019s director has noted that \u201ccontinued reliance on this  antiquated system is comparable to insisting that today\u2019s offices use carbon  paper and manual type writers.\u201d  Furthermore, NAPA in its July 2002  report for the National Commission on the Public Service concluded that  classification and compensation systems must be based on work and performance rather than position.  The NAPA panel recommendations  included abolishing the General Schedule and developing a modern system  for defining and valuing work, which could help to make the hiring process  more results-oriented and efficient.  The National Commission on the  Public Service recommended that operating agencies need more flexible  personnel management systems. The commission recommended  abolishing the General Schedule and as a default position, recommended a  broadband system under which the 15 pay grades and salary ranges would  be consolidated into six to eight broad bands with relatively wide salary  ranges.", "Some agencies have automated the complicated classification process to  reduce the time it takes to carry out this task.  For example, the Army  created a centralized database that gives Army HR managers access to  active position descriptions and position-related information to help with  the classification process.  In addition, OPM has revised the standards for  several job series, including health care professions and law enforcement,  to make them clearer and more applicable to the current duties and  responsibilities of the occupations.  But such steps are only partial  solutions to the classification issue.  OPM points out that the classification  standards and process need to be reformed.  Changes to the Classification  Act of 1949 are needed to make fundamental changes to how jobs are  defined and pay is set.  Specifically, OPM believes that the time may have  come for substantive reform that brings the era of the General Schedule  classification system to a close.

These HR directors noted that job announcements are frequently  incomprehensible and make it difficult for applicants to determine what  the jobs require, and therefore do not serve as effective recruiting tools.   A  February 2000 MSPB study stated that federal job announcements  generally appeared to be written for people already employed by the  government and that the use of jargon and acronyms is a common  problem.  The study noted that some announcements were lengthy,  difficult to read on-line, and only gave brief or vague descriptions of the  duties to be performed.  Vague job descriptions make it difficult for  applicants to describe how their knowledge, skills, and abilities are related  to the job.  MSPB also noted that almost no announcements included  information on retirement and other benefits, such as vacation time and  medical and health insurance, which might entice people to apply.   The  study recommended that OPM and agencies improve how vacancy  announcements are posted on the Internet. The report said making them  more visually appealing, informative, and easy to navigate could also make  announcements more effective as a recruiting tool.  In a December 2002  report on federal vacancy announcements, MSPB reported that its review  of the quality of 100 vacancy announcements posted on USAJOBS  indicated that 53 percent were poor, 2 percent were good, while 45 percent  were judged acceptable.  The problems in the vacancy announcements  included poor organization and readability, unclear job titles and duties,  vague or restrictive qualification standards, and the use of negative  language or tone that might deter many qualified candidates.", "Both agencies and OPM are taking some steps to address this problem.

Primary  responsibility for developing assessment tools rests with the agencies, but  frequently agencies do not have the expertise or resources to develop  them.  In addition to problems found with assessment tools, two hiring  authorities set forth in the Luevano Consent Decree \u2014Outstanding Scholar  and Bilingual/Bicultural\u2014may not be merit based.", "Several HR directors we met with and a NAPA study found that the  Administrative Careers with America (ACWA) self-rating schedule  examination procedure that is currently used to competitively fill most  positions covered by the Luevano decree was cumbersome, delayed hiring,  and often did not provide quality candidates.   The Luevano decree called  for eliminating the use of the Professional and Administrative Career Exam  (PACE) and required replacing it with alternative examination  procedures.  The ACWA exam, which was developed by OPM for Luevano  positions, was generally administered by OPM to applicants.  Agencies  entered into reimbursable contracts with OPM to receive lists of candidates  who passed the exam.  OPM has now delegated authority to administer the  ACWA exam to agencies\u2019 delegated examining units.  In addition, some  exams have been developed to replace ACWA for a few occupations.", "Agency managers criticized the ACWA examination because they said it is  not merit based, according to a NAPA study.  The ACWA rating-schedule  examination contains 157 multiple-choice questions that distinguish among  qualified applicants on the basis of their self-rated education and life  experience, rather than on their relative knowledge, skills, and abilities for  the vacant position. The study reported that agencies said the ACWA  examination is not relevant to specific jobs and occupations and therefore  does not result in lists of \u201cqualified individuals \u2026 solely on the basis of  relative ability, knowledge, and skill\u201d\u2014a key merit systems principle.", "Consequently, many agencies reported that the primary reason they did not  use the ACWA test was their past experience with the quality of the  candidates.  In a more recent study, NAPA recommended that the ACWA  examination system be terminated and agencies be permitted to hire for  professional and administrative occupations using techniques that are  proven more operationally efficient and effective in meeting diversity  shortfalls.  Also, MSPB recommended that OPM develop new assessment  tools for the occupations covered under the Luevano Consent Decree.", "HR directors and other officials illustrated numerous problems with the  ACWA exam.  For example, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Human  Resources at the Social Security Administration said that the ACWA  examination process used for its mainstream entry-level positions\u2014claims  representative, computer specialist, criminal investigator, and regional  support position\u2014covered by the Luevano Consent Decree is  cumbersome, bureaucratic, and labor intensive.  In another example,  officials of a major military installation said that recruiting accountants and  financial managers was hampered by the ACWA examination.  They noted  that managers believed the test was not an effective screen to identify  quality candidates\u2014a theme consistent with the NAPA study.  They also  pointed out that applicants were \u201cturned off\u201d to federal employment by the  lack of relevance of many of the exam questions to the specific jobs for  which they were applying.", "Agencies cited the Outstanding Scholar program as a quick way to hire  quality college graduates for positions covered by the Luevano decree.  The  Outstanding Scholar program and Bilingual/Bicultural program were  authorized by the Luevano Consent Decree as supplemental tools to  competitive examination.  These programs were aimed at addressing the  under representation of African-Americans and Hispanics in the  workplace.  Many HR directors and officials viewed the Outstanding  Scholar program as a way to hire quality candidates without getting  involved in the complexities of the OPM examination process.", "However, OPM and MSPB have commented that this is an inappropriate  use of the authority.  This hiring authority uses both baccalaureate grade  point average and class standing as eligibility criteria for appointment. This  authority allows candidates who meet the eligibility criteria to be directly  appointed without competition and operates without regard to veterans\u2019  preference or the rule of three (see discussion about the rule of three and  veterans\u2019 preference later is this report).  MSPB has noted, however, that  eligibility criteria based on grade point average and class rank are highly  questionable as valid predictors of future job performance and that they  unnecessarily deny employment consideration to a large segment of the  applicant pool who meet basic job qualification requirements.", "MSPB also has concerns about the Bilingual/Bicultural program because it  permits the hiring of individuals who need not be the best qualified and  avoids veterans\u2019 preference.  This hiring program permits an agency to  directly hire an applicant who obtained a passing examination score,  without further regard to rank, when the position should be filled by an  incumbent with bilingual or bicultural skills and the applicant has the  requisite skills.  MSPB has also recommended abolishing both the  Outstanding Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural programs because other  competitive hiring methods have been more effective in hiring minorities  and because they are not merit based.", "For positions that are not covered by the Luevano Consent Decree,  agencies typically examine candidates by rating and ranking them based on  their experience, training, and education, rather than testing them.  MSPB  noted that the government\u2019s interest is not well served if agencies do not  have the resources and expertise to make high quality case examining  determinations.  According to MSPB, agencies use of computer-based  assessments is increasing.  MSPB notes this has implications for OPM  because the validity of computer-based assessments and ranking is critical  to ensuring that hiring is based solely on merit.   Computer-based  assessments would also have implications for category rating systems that  are now permitted by the Homeland Security Act of 2002.", "In general, both OPM and MSPB are concerned about the validity of  assessment tools for all occupations and advocate that agencies improve  their assessment instruments. Under a largely decentralized approach,  agencies\u2019 delegated examining units make decisions on which assessment  tools or methods to use and on the development of new assessment tools.   However, experts have noted that that there has been a lack of specialized  experience in many agencies to develop and maintain valid, effective  applicant assessment methodologies.  OPM told us that because of budget  constraints, it has spent more of its resources on services for which  agencies are willing to pay rather than on providing tools that it might have  believed to be more valuable, like assessment instruments.  OPM also  noted that many agencies do not have the technical expertise, funding, or  time to develop valid assessment tools.  MSPB concluded in a recent report  that OPM is a logical organization to which agencies should be able to turn  for help in developing valid assessment tools and systems, but is not  funded to provide that assistance except on a reimbursable basis.", "OPM recognizes that it must do more to improve assessment tools.

According to one of the HR directors we met with, the logistics of setting  up an assessment panel meeting makes for long delays in the hiring  process, in some cases up to 1 month.  Some of the delay is due to  assembling the appropriate managers and subject matter experts,  coordinating their availability, and factoring in the exigencies of other  demands and travel time.  Once the panel is formed, the panel sorts through  all of the applicants\u2019 paperwork, assesses the applicants, and determines a  numerical score for each applicant by rating the education and experience  described by the applicant against the evaluation criteria in the crediting  plan for the position.  At this point, any applicable veterans\u2019 preference  points are added to the applicants\u2019 score.

An automated  system creates an easily assessable audit trail so that managers and HR  staffs could document their decisions.  In addition, an automated system  could electronically determine if an applicant met the basic qualifications  and electronically notify the applicant of his or her eligibility for the job for  which he or she applied.", "Nineteen of the 24 agency HR directors we met with said they had  automated or planned to automate at least a portion of their hiring  processes.  Some of these agencies have automated or planned to automate  the rating and ranking processes.  Agencies have used private vendors or  have contracted to use OPM\u2019s USA Staffing automated hiring package.", "USGS automated its hiring system and estimated that it cut hiring time  from the close of a job announcement to issuing a job certificate from 30 to  60 days to under 7 days.  USGS\u2019s automated system is a computerized  employment application processing system, which automates many of the  functions and tasks of the competitive examination process.  It  electronically prescreens applicants and rates and ranks applicants  according to specified job-related criteria.  This also eliminates the need to  convene rating and ranking panels and reduces the paperwork and  administrative burden associated with documenting manual rating and  ranking.  The system also electronically refers the job certificate to the  selecting official who has the rating and ranking data, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and other  information on his or her desktop, an improvement in efficiency.   Furthermore, it makes recruiting data available on-line to authorized staff  members.  Applicant benefits include user-friendly on-line application and  timely feedback on the status of applications.   NAPA chronicled the  success of USGS\u2019s automated system in a 2001 report.  The report notes  that 1 year after being implemented, \u201cit is clear that the program is a huge  success.\u201d  The report lays out the successes based on USGS information  to include a significant reduction of processing time a reduction of 1,800  staff days of work, and a nearly tenfold increase in the number of  applicants for many of its announcements.", "Census also automated its hiring process.  The impetus for Census to  change from its manual hiring system to the automated system for its  occupations covering the majority of its ongoing hiring needs\u2014information  technology specialist, statistician, and mathematical statistician\u2014was a  large number or positions (500 positions) and urgent hiring needed for the  2000 Census.  The agency put together a team of managers, human  resource staff, and programmers and worked with OPM to automate hiring  for these three occupations.  In 1998, Census automated their hiring system  through OPM for the three occupations.  Under this system, OPM posts  continuously open vacancy announcements for multiple grade levels.  As  part of a contract with Census, OPM receives the applications and  maintains an inventory of applicants on its system and can rate and rank  the applicants and generate a job certificate for Census within 3 days of the  request for a certificate.  Since there is no closing date for job  announcements, many phases of the typical federal hiring process have  been completed in advance of a Census request for a certificate.  Census  managers provide quality-ranking factors to OPM when they request a job  certificate.  In addition, Census managers have electronic access to  information on the applicants because OPM updates Census\u2019s database  daily.  Census officials told us that additional applicant information  collected by recruiters on college campuses provides managers pertinent  skill data, which could eliminate personal interviews.

Specifically, 15 of the 24  HR directors we met with raised concerns about the negative impact of the  rule of three on hiring.   Once the panel has rated and ranked the  candidates and applied applicable veterans\u2019 preference points, the panel  refers a sufficient number of candidates to permit the appointing officer to  consider three candidates that are available for appointment.

The result can be several candidates with  the exact same score.  When more than three candidates have the same  score, examining offices may need to break the tie, usually by electing  three of the candidates at random.", "Since current assessment tools cannot make fine distinctions between  applicants, encouraging selection from as many qualified candidates as is  reasonable enhances merit-based hiring.  The MSPB conducted an in-depth  study of the rule of three and its interaction with veterans\u2019 preference.   MSPB concluded that given the limits of the examining process to predict  future job performance, the curb on the number of candidates from which  managers may select does not represent good hiring policy.  It also noted  that the rule of three\u2019s original purpose was to provide choices.", "For several years, federal human capital experts said that categorical rating  or grouping could provide an alternative to the rule of three methods and  expand the number of candidates that a selecting official could choose  from while protecting veterans\u2019 preference.  Both NAPA and MSPB  supported abolishing numerical ranking and the rule of three and replacing  them with category rating that would allow officials to select among  candidates that were placed in a high-quality category.  However,  candidates with veterans\u2019 preference placed in the high-quality category  would be hired before candidates without veterans\u2019 preference.

The final 5-year evaluation of the project  showed that (1) the number of candidates per job announcement  increased, (2) more candidates were referred to managers for selection,   (3) hiring speed increased, and (4) there was greater satisfaction with the  hiring process among managers.  On average, there were from 60 percent  (ARS) to 70 percent (FS) more applicants available for consideration under  the demonstration project quality grouping procedure than under the  standard rule of three and numerical ranking.  A higher percentage of  veterans were hired in the ARS and about the same percentage of veterans  were hired by the FS compared with using the rule of three process.   Specifically, at ARS 16.3 percent of all hires were veterans using categorical  ranking, while just 9.5 percent were veterans using the rule of three.

OPM questioned our methodology of meeting with agency human  resources (HR) directors to assess how well OPM is assisting agencies  in improving their hiring processes.  OPM believes that chief operating  officers would provide a better perspective of agency recruiting and  retention issues.  While we agree these officials could provide  perspective about the results of the hiring process, agency HR directors  better understand and are responsible for their agency hiring process  and most directly interact with OPM.  Agency HR directors are  therefore in an excellent position to speak to federal hiring issues and  OPM\u2019s leadership. 2. OPM said it was unclear why we identified the five hiring problem areas  and also that the quality of hires was not identified as an issue.  We  identified these areas based on our discussions with human capital and  other officials across government and in our review of studies by the  Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Academy of Public  Administration.  Our assessment of these problems considered the  impact on the quality of hires.  For example, we note in our discussion  of the federal job classification process that it not only delays the hiring  process for those positions requiring the development of job  descriptions, but more important, the resulting job classification and  related pay might not match the actual duties of the job.  This mismatch  can hamper efforts to fill the position with the right employee.   We also  note that the automated process at the U.S. Geological Survey  increased the number of applicants\u2014which increases the likelihood of  filling a position with the right person.  Finally, in our discussion of the  use of the Administrative Careers with America (ACWA) test we note  managers\u2019 concerns with the quality of candidates who were referred  based on the test results.  The recommendation to address this issue  was primarily based on the fact that, according to managers, the test  was not referring quality candidates. 3. OPM said that our conclusions about the classification process could  be misleading.  For example, it believes the section on the classification  and position description process could be misleading because the  majority of jobs are filled without this step. We agree, but note that the  more important problem with the classification process is that the  existing inaccurate position description and related pay that resulted  from the job classification could hamper efforts to fill the position with  the right employee.  OPM also said that although it agreed that the  grade level definitions that underpin the entire classification system are  decades old, it has taken steps to revise position classification  standards.  We note in our report that OPM has and is continuing to  revise position standards, but point out that the basic system needs  revision.  This position is not inconsistent with OPM\u2019s and others\u2019 views  of classification.  OPM\u2019s white paper on pay notes a key problem with  classification is that, under present rules, characteristics such as  workload, quality of work, and results are not classification factors.  OPM and others conclude that the classification system needs basic  revision. 4. OPM points out in its comments that it has taken several steps to assist  agencies in improving their vacancy announcements.  We recognized  many of these actions in our actions under way section and have  augmented the section to further outline OPM\u2019s positive steps. 5. OPM had some concerns about our comments about the ACWA test.", "We noted that managers were critical of the ACWA exam because it was  not merit based and it measures life experiences rather than  knowledge, skills, and abilities.  OPM says the ACWA exam was  specifically developed to measure competencies critical to the success  of the relevant occupations.  We should point out that the ACWA exam  is used for more than 100 different occupations.  Agency managers we  met with and several studies have pointed out that the test does not  refer quality candidates.  Even though OPM in its comments defends  the ACWA exam, it agreed that the test needs to be reevaluated.  We  recommend that OPM help agencies improve all applicant assessment  tools. 6. OPM said that the report misses an opportunity to hold agencies more  accountable for the cumbersome hiring process.  Throughout the  report, we point out that agencies are primarily responsible for  improving their hiring processes and include several examples how the  agencies we studied in detail took steps to improve various aspects of  their hiring processes.

DOD says the classification system has been studied from every angle  without producing significant results and that more study is not  needed.  We believe that more analysis is needed to determine exactly  how to either revise the classification system or develop an entirely  new approach to determining job descriptions and pay determinations. 6. DOD asked that we explain why the number of new hires has increased  since the mid-1990s.  We have added text to the report that explains that  hiring in the mid-1990s declined because many agencies were  downsizing and did not need to fill positions.  We also added that with  the slowdown in downsizing and the increasing number of employees  retiring, agencies are increasingly hiring new employees. 7. Our draft report had noted that DOD did not respond to our fall 2002  survey of human resources (HR) directors.  DOD explained that it  responded to our survey of HR directors in November 2002.  However,  we did not receive itd response until April 2003.  We have now included  DOD\u2019s response in our analysis of the 2002 HR director responses. 8. DOD points out that OPM has not taken any significant action to  address problems related to the Luevano Consent Decree.  We agree  that the problems with the Luevano Consent Decree need to be  addressed and have made a recommendation to OPM to review the  effectiveness of the Outstanding Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural  Luevano Consent Decree hiring authorities. 9. DOD notes that examining for Administrative Careers with America  (ACWA) positions was not delegated to agencies until October 2002 and  that the authority cannot be redelegated to components.  We have  added this information to our report. 10. DOD noted that we did not analyze the planned actions in OPM\u2019s  strategic plan.  In several areas, we have outlined actions that OPM is  currently taking to address some of the hiring challenges, including  some areas specific to actions indicated in OPM\u2019s strategic plan. 11. DOD notes that our report credits OPM with developing new guidance  in several human capital areas with no indication of the involvement of  agencies.  OPM has explained that one of the vehicles it has used to  involve agencies is the Human Resources Management Council, an  interagency organization of federal HR directors.  It should be noted  that the recently enacted Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes an  Interagency Chief Human Capital Officer Council, which could replace  the Human Resources Management Council."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the persons named above, John Ripper, Tom Beall, Ridge  Bowman, Christopher Booms, Karin Fangman, Fig Gungor, Donna Miller,  Greg Wilmoth, and Kimberly Young made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
