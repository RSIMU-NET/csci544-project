The order, updated in 2007, outlines requirements and procedures for (1) vetting, or investigating a person or entity for links to terrorism; (2) obtaining an antiterrorism certification from awardees; and (3) including in awards two mandatory provisions that prohibit support for terrorism and restrict funding to facilities named after terrorists. In 2008, USAID West Bank and Gaza established a post-award compliance review process to identify weaknesses in compliance with applicable requirements in the order, which USAID works to resolve. This process is a key function that allows USAID to provide reasonable assurance that all prime awards and subawards are in compliance with the order. The compliance review process is described in notices issued by the mission from 2008 to 2012. For the purposes of this report, a prime awardee is an organization that directly receives USAID funding to implement projects, while a subawardee is an organization that receives funding from prime awardees.", "USAID's compliance reviews and GAO's examination of prime awards and subawards for fiscal years 2012-2014 found that USAID generally complied with requirements for vetting and inclusion of antiterrorism certification and mandatory provisions in awards.

According to USAID, the mission promptly  implemented a new policy to prevent such human error from recurring  and also promptly notified both GAO and USAID\u2019s Regional Inspector  General of the error."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to State and USAID for comment.

These  legal and other requirements are contained in U.S. federal laws and  executive orders. Mission Order 21 is the primary document that details  the procedures to comply with applicable laws and executive orders to  help ensure that assistance does not provide support to entities or  individuals associated with terrorism. The effective date of the most  recent version of Mission Order 21 is October 3, 2007, and it has not  been updated since then, according to USAID officials. We also reviewed  memorandums and notices issued by the USAID West Bank and Gaza  mission that pertain to USAID\u2019s antiterrorism compliance review process  and reminders about Mission Order 21 updates.", "To examine the extent to which USAID complied with its antiterrorism  policies and procedures for program assistance for the West Bank and  Gaza, we interviewed officials from USAID\u2019s Office of Inspector General  regarding its oversight requirements, and results of audits of West Bank  and Gaza assistance programs against Mission Order 21 requirements.  We examined documentation on USAID\u2019s policies and procedures for  monitoring prime awardees\u2019 compliance with Mission Order 21 when  making subawards and reviewed USAID\u2019s formal compliance review  process. We looked at 23 audit reports conducted under the direction of  USAID\u2019s Regional Inspector General and covering all prime awardees  that received fiscal year 2012, 2013, or 2014 Economic Support Fund  (ESF) assistance. We also reviewed and analyzed all 47 compliance  review reports provided to us that were conducted by USAID\u2019s  compliance specialist on 24 prime awardees during fiscal years 2012,  2013, and 2014. We analyzed these antiterrorism compliance review  reports to assess and compile all noncompliance weaknesses with  Mission Order 21 identified by USAID in four categories: (1) the proper  vetting of subawardees and beneficiaries, (2) the timely incorporation of  the antiterrorism certificate, (3) the timely incorporation of applicable  mandatory provisions, and (4) subaward reporting. We also followed up  with relevant USAID officials regarding these identified noncompliance  weaknesses and the policies and practices USAID had in place to ensure  that such weaknesses were addressed.", "To determine the extent to which the USAID West Bank and Gaza  mission complied\u2013at the prime and subaward levels\u2013with its vetting  requirements as well as inclusion of antiterrorism certification and  mandatory provisions for program assistance to provide reasonable  assurance that its programs do not provide support to entities or  individuals associated with terrorism, we reviewed key legal and other  requirements as well as USAID\u2019s policies and procedures for ensuring  compliance with Mission Order 21. We discussed the USAID mission\u2019s  implementation of Mission Order 21 with the USAID Deputy Mission  Director, senior staff, the regional legal advisor, program staff, and other  officials responsible for managing assistance projects and overseeing  contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements at the USAID mission in  Tel Aviv, Israel, and the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem. We also  interviewed several of USAID\u2019s implementing partners that had received  relatively large dollar contracts from USAID. In addition, we interviewed  State, USAID, and other officials involved in vetting USAID award  recipients.", "We focused our review on the mission\u2019s prime award contracts, grants,  and cooperative agreements that were made using Economic Support  Fund (ESF) programming for fiscal years 2012\u20132014 as well as  applicable subawards made by the prime awards during this time period.  We selected this time period because it covers the last fiscal year that we  reported on in our 2012 report and also represents the most recently  available data. The mission provided us with copies of all 48 prime  awards issued during this time frame and the relevant documentation to  support proof of vetting of key individuals and the presence of  antiterrorism certifications and mandatory provisions in awards.", "To determine whether subawards complied with relevant Mission Order  21 requirements, we examined a final random generalizable sample of 91  subawards made to non-U.S. organizations and 67 subawards made to  U.S. organizations for a total of 158 subawards. Initially, we selected a  random sample of 174 subawards. However, the random sample  decreased to 158 subawards because of various issues such as missing  data, duplicates of awards, and errors identified by the mission in  subaward reporting by the prime awardee. We selected these random  generalizable samples from a universe of 8,744 subawards for fiscal  years 2012 through 2014 identified by the mission based on subaward  activity reported to the mission by prime awardees. The universe  included 8,521 non-U.S. organizations and 223 U.S. organizations. The  mission developed the universe by taking the 48 prime awards that we  had received and reviewed and identifying the corresponding subaward  reports made by each prime award. Some of the prime awards did not  make any subawards during the time frame that we examined. In total,  the mission identified 37 of the 48 prime awards that had subawards  reported. According to the mission, the subaward reports track the  subaward awarded in a certain period of time and have no association  with the fiscal year funding it received. Further, according to the mission,  their main objective in developing the subaward universe for us was to  track the vetting threshold by including all the individual subawards as  well as their cost and time modifications that could trigger the vetting  requirement per Mission Order 21. As a result, our subaward sample  included several cost modifications and time extensions to awards.", "We reviewed vetting information provided by USAID for all 11 prime  awards made to non-U.S. organizations and a sample of 29 subawards  made to non-U.S. organizations. The remaining 37 prime awards and 129  subawards were made to U.S. organizations, and were therefore not  subject to vetting. We compared the vetting date to the award date to  determine if the mission vetted the appropriate non-U.S. organizations  prior to the date of award. We found that of the 91 subawards in our  sample, 29 subawards went to non-U.S. organizations that had a contract  value or a time and cost amendment value of more than $25,000 and  thus required vetting. Based on vetting information provided by USAID,  vetting was conducted and eligibility decisions were made prior to the  signing of the award in 28 out of the 29 instances, in compliance with  Mission Order 21. However, vetting was conducted in 1 instance after  the award was signed. To understand USAID\u2019s vetting process, we  interviewed various mission officials, including the head of the Program  Support Unit, which is the division responsible for the vetting process. We  also reviewed snapshots of the Partner Vetting System (PVS), the system  in which partner information is inputted, as well as training material  related to the PVS to understand the vetting process.", "To determine whether required antiterrorism certifications were obtained,  we reviewed applicable documentation provided by USAID for 16 prime  awards and 4 subawards that were grants or cooperative agreements to  determine if antiterrorism certifications were included in the award and  signed prior to the date of the award. We determined that the16 prime  awards and the 4 subawards contained a signed antiterrorism certification  that was signed in advance of the award.", "To determine whether the prime awards and subawards contained  mandatory provisions, specifically two mandatory clauses, we reviewed  applicable documentation for each award to determine if the clauses were  present. We reviewed 48 prime awards to determine if both the  antiterrorism and facility naming clauses were present in the award before  it was signed. We determined that all 48 prime awards had the mandatory  clauses in the award before it was signed. For the subawards, we  reviewed all 158 subawards to determine if mandatory clauses were  present in the awards before it was signed. We used electronic searches  to identify copies of the two clauses as efficiently as possible. We  obtained the award documents from USAID in the form of scanned PDF  files and used Adobe Acrobat Pro XI to convert them into machine- readable text. This conversion was generally reliable but sometimes  introduced misspellings or other anomalies. We wrote Python code that  performed keyword searches on each of the 260 PDF files for apparent  instances of the two clauses. Each time the program found a potential  match, it computed the edit distance between the clause the search  identified and the actual boilerplate clause. We then identified the  candidate match for each award with the shortest edit distance from each  clause and produced a document listing the best potential match for each  clause in each award and a link to the PDF page from which we extracted  each potential match. The search program treated all of the PDFs  associated with a single award as a group and identified candidate  matches, for example very likely matches, for both clauses in almost all of  the awards. A GAO analyst manually reviewed each potential match on  the original PDF and either confirmed that it was the required clause or  not. If the computer did not find a match, we reviewed the entire award  document to determine whether the required clause was present. Based  on our review, we found three instances where mandatory clauses were  missing from the award.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to April 2016, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) West Bank and Gaza Mission\u2019s Vetting Process for Awards", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides information on the vetting process for awards to  non-U.S. implementing partners (awardees) receiving U.S. government  funding, including contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and  training, based on USAID documents and information from officials.", "A typical vetting process starts with the implementing partner, or prime  awardee, submitting through an online portal, the Partner Vetting System  (PVS), a completed Partner Information Form that has the names and  identifying information of the organization\u2019s key individuals, according to  the USAID mission. The prime awardee has access to the online portal to  submit the Partner Information Form and also collects and submits the  needed vetting data from proposed recipients of subawards. Figure 3  provides details of the steps in the vetting process for awards. In a small  number of cases, the implementing partner, or prime awardee, does not  have access to the online portal, and hard copy forms are sent directly to  USAID\u2019s vetting team, known as the Programs Support Unit (PSU), which  inputs the information into the PVS. The information submitted online or  on hard copy is checked by vetting assistants at the USAID mission to  ensure that it is complete and is a valid request. The information is  compiled for a vetting package that is submitted through the portal to the  USAID Office of Security\u2019s Counterterrorism Branch (SEC/CT) at the  Terrorist Screening Center in the United States. Until August 2015 the  vetting package to be submitted to the SEC/CT was compiled by one  member of the PSU team. In response to a vetting error identified in July  2015, the USAID mission implemented a new policy that requires an  additional check of vetting packages submitted to the SEC/CT. The new  process requires that a separate member of the PSU team verify that  packages submitted to the SEC/CT include all key individuals listed in the  Partner Information Form.", "If the organization or individual submitted for vetting is found to have no  derogatory information by the SEC/CT, analysts at the SEC/CT enter an  eligible determination into PVS. If the proposed award is a contract or  training, the PVS generates an automatic notification to the  Contracting/Agreement Officer\u2019s Representative (C/AOR) and the vetting  is a one-step process. The C/AOR notifies the awardee of the results.", "If the proposed award is a cash grant or in-kind assistance, following an  eligible recommendation from the SEC/CT, the request is then sent to the  Consulate General for a second vetting step. If the organization vetted by  the Consulate General is also deemed eligible, results are entered into  PVS, and an automatic notification is sent to the C/AOR who notifies the  awardee of the results. If the SEC/CT finds derogatory information related  to an organization or individual submitted for vetting, the SEC/CT  analyzes the information to determine if an ineligible recommendation is  warranted. If an ineligible recommendation is warranted, the SEC/CT,  drafts an assessment of the derogatory information to the Supervisory  Program Support Specialist, according to the USAID mission. The  Consulate General follows a similar notification process if an organization  submitted for vetting results in an ineligible recommendation. In both  cases, the Supervisory Program Support Specialist reviews the  derogatory information and consults with key mission vetting officials who  have been granted the appropriate security clearance and have a need- to-know. The C/AOR may also be asked to provide an impact  assessment to evaluate the potential consequences for the  implementation of the program should a particular prospective  implementing partner be found ineligible.", "If the mission would like to consider an award notwithstanding an  ineligible finding by the SEC/CT, the mission refers the case to the  Vetting Working Group, located in the U.S. Consulate General in  Jerusalem. The Vetting Working Group is a multiagency group,  responsible for reconciling derogatory vetting information obtained by  U.S. agencies implementing programs in the West Bank and Gaza,  according to the mission. The group meets on an ad-hoc basis and  recommends eligibility or ineligibility based on consensus, with the final  decision made by the Consul General. For cases that are not referred to  the Vetting Working Group, the Deputy Mission Director has the authority  to make final ineligibility decisions, according to the mission. Once a final  determination is made by either the Consulate General or the Deputy  Mission Director, the Supervisory Program Support Specialist enters this  determination into PVS and an automatic notification is sent to the  C/AOR. The Contracting/Agreement Officer Representative notifies the  awardee of the results.", "If a program awardee has been approved through the vetting process, the  approval generally remains valid for that particular award for up to 3 years  from the date of the award. However, new vetting is required in several  circumstances. First, vetting is required if there is a change in the  awardee\u2019s key individuals. Key individuals include principal officers of the  organization\u2019s governing body, the principal officer and deputy principal  officer of the organization, the program manager or chief of party, and any  other persons with significant responsibility for administration of USAID- financed activities or resources. Second, new vetting is also required for  any new awards or extensions of existing awards if more than 12 months  have passed since the awardee was last approved. Third, new vetting is  required for cost extension of awards when the total cost of the subaward  including with the additional cost exceeds $25,000.
