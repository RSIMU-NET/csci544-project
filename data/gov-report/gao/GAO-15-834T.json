One of the main purposes of guidance is to explain and help regulated parties comply with agencies' regulations.

The four departments GAO reviewed\u2014Agriculture (USDA), Education (Education), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL)\u2014and the 25 components engaged in regulatory or grant making activities in these departments used guidance for multiple purposes, such as clarifying or interpreting regulations and providing grant administration information. Agencies used many terms for guidance and agency components issued varying amounts of guidance, ranging from about 10 to more than 100 guidance documents each year. Departments typically identified few of their guidance documents as \u201csignificant,\u201d generally defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as guidance with a broad and substantial impact on regulated entities.", "How do agencies determine whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking? According to officials, agencies considered a number of factors when deciding whether to issue a regulation or guidance. However, the key criterion in making the choice was whether they intended the document to be binding; in such cases agencies proceeded with regulation.", "How can agencies ensure more effective guidance processes that adhere to applicable criteria? All four departments we studied identified standard practices to follow when developing guidance but could also strengthen their internal controls for issuing guidance.", "Agencies addressed OMB's requirements for significant guidance to varying degrees. Education and USDA had written departmental procedures for approval as required by OMB. DOL's procedures were not available to staff and required updating. HHS had no written procedures.

The 25 components GAO reviewed addressed some control standards more regularly than others. For example, few components had written procedures to ensure consistent application of guidance processes. However, all components could describe standard review practices and most used tools to document management approval of guidance. Not all components conferred with external nonfederal stakeholders when developing guidance.

Regulatory  guidance is an important tool that agencies use to communicate timely  information about the implementation of regulatory and grant programs to  regulated parties, grantees, and the general public. Guidance can take a  variety of formats and names including directives, interpretive  memorandums, fact sheets, and Dear Colleague letters. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) defines the term \u201cguidance document\u201d  as an agency statement of general applicability and future effect, other  than a regulatory action, that sets forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory,  or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue.", "Guidance documents provide agencies valuable flexibility to clarify their  requirements and policies, and to address new issues and circumstances  more quickly than may be possible using rulemaking. Although not legally  binding, guidance documents can have far-reaching effects. Guidance  documents can vary\u2014by type, purpose, and amount\u2014among agencies  and subcomponents of the same agency, and have often been reported  to outnumber regulations in terms of the number of documents issued  annually.", "My remarks today highlight answers to four key questions addressed in  our April 2015 report on regulatory guidance processes:  1.  What is regulatory guidance?  2.  How do agencies use regulatory guidance?  3.  How do agencies determine whether to issue guidance or undertake  rulemaking?  4.  How can agencies ensure more effective guidance processes that  adhere to applicable criteria?", "To conduct that work, we reviewed guidance processes at 25  components that engaged in regulatory or grant-making activities in four  departments\u2014Agriculture (USDA), Education (Education), Health and  Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL). The scope of that review  focused on guidance issued to external parties that explained regulatory  and grant-related requirements and other policies. We reviewed agencies\u2019  written procedures, guidance documents, and websites. We also  interviewed department and component officials on guidance practices.  We selected and applied four government-wide internal control standards  to guidance processes. We identified both opportunities for improved  internal controls related to guidance and highlighted agency practices that  could be applied to guidance processes in other agencies. We conducted  the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. More details on our methodology can be found in our report.", "Mr. Chairman, agencies must exercise diligence when using guidance.  Although guidance documents are not legally binding, they can affect the  actions of stakeholders and other interested parties, as well as agencies\u2019  staffs, because guidance articulates agencies\u2019 interpretations and policy  choices. The potential effects of these documents\u2014and the risks of legal  challenges to agencies\u2014underscore the need for consistent and well- understood processes for the development, review, dissemination, and  evaluation of guidance.", "Our April 2015 report found that agencies and their components used  guidance for multiple purposes. Further, we also found that all four  departments identified standard practices to follow when developing  guidance. However, stronger application of internal controls would help  ensure that guidance processes achieve desired results and prevent  errors. Components primarily relied on websites to disseminate guidance,  but could do more to improve online access, such as making guidance  documents easier to find and ensuring that they are current. We  recommended that HHS and DOL ensure consistent application of OMB  requirements for guidance. We also recommended that USDA,  Education, HHS, and DOL strengthen the use of internal controls in  guidance production processes and improve online guidance  dissemination.

As shown in figure 1, guidance  may explain how agencies plan to interpret regulations. Agencies  sometimes include disclaimers in their guidance to note that the  documents have no legally binding effect on regulated parties or the  agencies. Even though not legally binding, guidance documents can have  a significant effect on regulated entities and the public, both because of  agencies\u2019 reliance on large volumes of guidance documents and because  the guidance can prompt changes in the behavior of regulated parties and  the general public. Nevertheless, defining guidance can be difficult. To  illustrate that difficulty, several of the components told us that they do not  consider many of the communication documents they issue to the public  to be guidance.", "Regulations and guidance documents serve different purposes. The  Administrative Procedure Act (APA) established broadly applicable  requirements for informal rulemaking, also known as notice and comment  rulemaking. Among other things, the APA generally requires that  agencies publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register.  After giving the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed  regulation by providing \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments,\u201d and after  considering the public comments received, the agency may then publish  the final regulation. To balance the need for public input with competing  societal interests favoring the efficient and expeditious conduct of certain  government affairs, the APA exempts certain types of rules from the  notice and comment process, including \u201cinterpretative rules\u201d (we will refer  to these as interpretive rules in this statement) and \u201cgeneral statements of  policy.\u201d Regulations affect regulated entities by creating binding legal  obligations. Regulations are generally subject to judicial review by the  courts if, for example, a party believes that an agency did not follow  required rulemaking procedures or went beyond its statutory authority.", "Despite the general distinctions between regulations and guidance  documents, legal scholars and federal courts have at times noted that it is  not always easy to determine whether an agency action should be issued  as a regulation subject to the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements, or  is guidance or a policy statement, and therefore exempt from these  requirements. Among the reasons agency guidance may be legally  challenged are procedural concerns that the agency inappropriately used  guidance rather than the rulemaking process or concerns that the agency  has issued guidance that goes beyond its authority. On March 9, 2015,  the Supreme Court held that an agency could make substantive changes  to an interpretive rule without going through notice and comment under  the APA. This decision overturned prior federal court rulings that had held  that an agency is precluded from substantively changing its interpretation  of a regulation through issuance of a new interpretive rule without notice  and comment. Other concerns raised about agency use of guidance  include consistency of the information being provided, currency of  guidance, and whether the documents are effectively communicated to  affected parties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Departments Considered Few of Their Guidance Documents as Significant under OMB\u2019s Definition", "paragraphs": ["An OMB Bulletin establishes policies and procedures for the  development, issuance, and use of \u201csignificant\u201d guidance documents.

Pursuant to a memorandum  issued by the Director of OMB in March 2009, OMB\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews some significant  guidance documents prior to issuance. All significant guidance  documents, whether reviewed by OIRA or not, are subject to the OMB  Bulletin. \u201cEconomically significant guidance documents\u201d are also  published in the Federal Register to invite public comment.

Officials from DOL\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) told us their agency,  as a non-regulatory component, rarely issues guidance. They said BLS  has issued about 10 routine administrative memorandums each year  related to the operation of two cooperative agreement statistical  programs. In contrast, DOL Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) officials told us they have regularly issued  guidance to assist with regulatory compliance, and could easily produce  100 new or updated products each year to provide guidance to  stakeholders.

Education officials  told us they often used guidance to help their field office staff understand  and apply new statutory requirements. While this may provide timely  information about new or upcoming requirements, it may also cause  confusion as details are revised during the rulemaking process. Officials  from USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) told us that when a new  statute becomes effective immediately and there is little ambiguity in how  the statute can be interpreted, they use a \u201cstaging process.\u201d In this  process, they issue informational guidance so their stakeholders are  aware of and consistently understand new requirements before the more  time-consuming rulemaking process can be completed.
