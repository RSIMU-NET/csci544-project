In 2014, about 59 percent of all W&I audits\u2014more than 516,000\u2014were selected with a specialized computer tool called the Dependent Database, while the remainder was selected through a combination of referrals and manual selection methods.", "W&I generally has established a positive environment for internal controls but could improve several areas in its audit selection procedures to support its mission. GAO found several procedures that establish a positive environment for promoting internal controls, such as ethics training. In addition, IRS has guidance to help ensure that decisions about updates to audit selection criteria are correctly implemented in its automated systems. However, W&I does not have established objectives for its audit selection process, and existing performance measures focus on audit results rather than audit selection. In addition, W&I has not defined key terms such as \u201cfairness and integrity,\u201d as required by internal control standards. Documented objectives and key terms would help W&I hone the measures it uses to assess its audit selection efforts and bring a consistent understanding of \u201cfairness and integrity\u201d to audit selection staff.", "GAO also found that not all elements of the selection process were appropriately documented. For example, W&I does not have clear documentation about how the three offices that select the majority of returns W&I audits interact with one another. Additionally, one guidance document notes that returns with the highest audit potential should be marked, but it does not describe how audit potential is determined or any related internal controls. Further, W&I also did not provide support showing that changes to automated audit selection processes and procedures were appropriately implemented in a timely manner. Moreover, the documentation indicates that W&I conducts an annual\u2014rather than continuous\u2014review of its audit selections and results as part of an annual 3-day working session. Strengthening controls in these areas would help provide greater assurance that W&I is fulfilling its mission to select tax returns with fairness and integrity.

Access rights are used to implement security policies that  determine what a user can do after being allowed into the system, such  as allowing the user to read or write to a certain file or directory.  Maintaining access rights is an important aspect of administering system  security.

Specifically, IRM sections on information technology (IT) security  documented access to data, files, and programs for modifying IT systems,  including those that cover W&I\u2019s audit selection criteria.

The lack of comprehensive  documentation to describe W&I\u2019s audit selection process results in less  assurance that these processes effectively address risks.

Further, W&I did not clearly document what corrective  actions, if any, were taken and how they were implemented in response  to the deficiencies it identified at the annual working session. W&I officials  provided documentation of issues identified with the Premium Tax Credit;  however, the deadlines for actions items were all at least 6 months past,  and W&I did not provide support that those changes were appropriately  implemented.

W&I\u2019s use of the no-change  rate could be viewed as a performance measure, but it is not sufficient to  assure that the audit selection criteria are fair. Having program-level  objectives, performance measures, indicators, and definitions that link to  its mission and goals would enhance W&I\u2019s ability assure that its audit  selection processes are fair and have integrity.", "Having program-level objectives for audit selection in place is a  precondition to developing a risk assessment strategy for audit selection,  which W&I has not adopted.

Such a strategy would increase the assurance that W&I is  appropriately selecting returns for audit, consistent with its mission.", "We also found opportunities for improvement in other areas. First, W&I  has not communicated internal control responsibilities to all staff tasked  with audit selection, including non-managers and classifiers who revise or  apply audit selection criteria, respectively. Second, W&I does not have  complete documentation its audit selection procedures; doing so would  improve the assurance that W&I staff have a common understanding of  how the selection process work and their role in the process. Third, while  W&I\u2019s policy is clear that internal control issues should be reported to the  next level of management, the mechanism to elevate potential internal  control issues to management is limited.

IRS can build on these  components to clarify how they relate to return selection, especially when  the components also cover what happens after return selection, such as  when pursuing noncompliance and interacting with taxpayers during the  audit. Documenting these clarifications in its definition, as well as the  examples of fair selections, would help staff involved in return selection to  know the specific actions that they should take to produce selections that  meet IRS\u2019s definition of fairness.", "We highlight this clarification because the letter discusses various  features of IRS\u2019s audit program\u2014such as existing objectives, measures,  and definitions of key concepts\u2014that IRS stated relate to fair selection.

These include our  recommendation on communicating the definition of terms such as  fairness as well as related objectives, measures, and indicators to all staff  involved in audit selection; incorporating any new selection objectives into  the risk assessment process that IRS would modify in fulfilling our  recommendation on defining fairness; communicating and documenting  internal control responsibilities to all staff involved in audit selection; and  developing a means for IRS staff to elevate internal control concerns  about audit selection.", "For our recommendation on defining and documenting \u201cfairness\u201d for  return selection activities, IRS\u2019s letter listed a number of ways in which it  believes the selection process is fair. For example, IRS said that its audit  selections are fair because IRS policies state that audit selections should  be fair and that taxpayer rights should be a prime focus.  IRS\u2019s letter also  cited its reliance on rules and automation rather than human intervention  and its desire to select the most noncompliant returns. While striving to be  fair and respectful of taxpayer rights as well as to weed out selection bias  or selections that focus on less noncompliant returns is important, IRS  has not provided a formal definition of what fairness entails. As a result,  individuals are left to define it for themselves.", "Similarly, this recommendation also focused on defining and documenting  related objectives, measures, and indicators for audit selection. IRS  stated that it will review these areas to further ensure that audit selection  meets its mission to apply the tax law with integrity and fairness. As  discussed in our report, existing IRS objectives and measures did not  allow IRS to evaluate whether its selection decisions were fair. We  believe IRS should develop at least one objective and measure that  reflects its definition of fairness.
