Guided weapons play an important role in implementing this doctrine.", "Guided weapons are more accurate than unguided weapons because they have the capability for in-flight guidance correction. They can be powered or unpowered. The range from which they can be launched varies from a few miles for the unpowered Guided Bomb Unit (GBU) series of weapons to several hundred miles for the Tomahawk cruise missile and the Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM). Most guided weapons are launched from aircraft or helicopters, but the Tomahawk is launched from Navy surface ships and submarines; and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is launched from the Multiple Launch Rocket System. They can be guided by the Global Positioning System (GPS), infrared sensors, electro-optical sensors, or lasers. Some weapons have single warheads, others carry many antipersonnel or antiarmor submunitions.", "The specific guided weapon used depends on the type of target, the defenses around the target, and whether areas adjacent to the target must be avoided. Deep attack guided weapons are used for operations carried out beyond the areas where friendly ground forces are operating.

However, Iraqi air defenses included large numbers of antiaircraft artillery that could put up a \u201cwall of iron\u201d against low-flying aircraft. After several aircraft losses, and to avoid the risk of losing a B-52H to antiaircraft artillery, pilots were ordered to drop weapons from higher altitudes than anticipated. At these altitudes, however, bombing with general purpose bombs was not accurate, and wind forces became a factor. While guided weapons achieved better results, a relatively small number of them were used, and their effectiveness was often limited by weather, target location uncertainty, and other factors. As a consequence, bombing accuracy was poor, and multiple weapons\u2014in some cases multiple attacks\u2014were used on each target. Incomplete and delayed bomb damage assessments were also a factor in the need for multiple attacks.", "Following the Gulf War, several DOD studies identified a number of changes that could improve the accuracy, standoff range, and lethality of its guided weapons as well as target identification and damage assessment capabilities. The aim of these improvements is to ensure target destruction with the minimum number of delivery sorties and weapons and to avoid unwanted collateral damage and minimize exposure of friendly aircraft to enemy defenses.", "In response, the services initiated a number of programs to upgrade existing guided weapons\u2014such as CALCM, the Tomahawk cruise missile, the Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM), and Air-to-Ground Guided Missile (AGM) 130\u2014and to acquire new guided weapons, including the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the Wind-Corrected Munition Dispenser (WCMD), the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).

As a result, the unit procurement cost is about $832,000 versus earlier projections of under $300,000. Reductions in planned procurement funding for the SFW have forced the program to reduce annual procurement rates and stretch out the schedule. As a result, SFW unit costs have increased from about $320,000 to over $358,000. The BAT program has also been unstable, and its schedule has been extended by 5 years.

The Board has broad review responsibility for decision milestones during critical acquisition phases. In addition to reviewing the mission need statements and operational requirements documents in the initial phases of development, the Board also reviews the detailed analyses of alternative solutions prepared by the services. These analyses provide the rationale for one alternative over another and should include a comparison of current and upgraded weapons with new proposed weapons.", "In 1996, Congress, in addition to asking DOD to conduct its Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study, requested a report on how DOD approves development of new guided weapons and avoids duplication and redundancy in guided weapon programs. It also sought information on the feasibility of carrying out joint development and procurement of guided weapons. In response, the Secretary of Defense issued a report to Congress in April 1996 on the process for approving and initiating development programs. The report noted that through reviews by JROC and the Defense Acquisition Board, several major guided weapon acquisition programs had been designated as joint programs.

For example, JROC and the Defense Acquisition Board have approved the acquisition of several guided weapon programs with very similar capabilities\u2014JASSM, SLAM-ER, the Tactical Tomahawk, and the Unitary version of the JSOW\u2014without adequate consideration of available aggregate capabilities or aggregate requirements for such weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Recognition of the Need to Improve Oversight and Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Some DOD officials have recognized a need for increased oversight of guided weapon programs.

As a result of understated cost estimates and overly optimistic funding assumptions, more programs have been approved than can be supported by available funds. Such imbalances have historically led to program stretch-outs, reduced annual procurement rates, higher unit costs, and delayed deliveries to operational units. Every effort needs to be made to avoid these \u201cpay more for less\u201d outcomes. Further, these imbalances may be long-term and may restrict DOD\u2019s flexibility to respond to unexpected requirements or to procure potentially innovative systems.", "The current inventory of deep attack weapons (guided and unguided) is both large and capable, and DOD is improving some weapons to make them even more effective. Although the existing inventory is considered sufficient to support the current objectives of defense guidance, DOD\u2019s plans for individual weapons will, in the aggregate, almost double the size of the guided weapon inventory at a time when worldwide threats are stable or declining. DOD expects the new, more modern weapons to enable warfighters to accomplish the same objectives with fewer weapons and casualties and less unintended collateral damage.", "DOD needs to establish an aggregate requirement for deep attack capabilities and assess the incremental contribution of its guided weapon acquisitions. Without such a requirement and analyses, it is difficult to understand DOD\u2019s rationale as to why, in the aggregate, it needs to almost double the size of its guided weapon inventory, particularly in today\u2019s budgetary and security environment. Further, the services\u2019 requirement processes are focused on individual systems and appear to inflate the quantity of each system needed. For example, the services use conservative assumptions concerning threats and target lists, appropriate weapon choices, the use of advanced tactics, and strategic reserves. The use of more realistic assumptions would lead to lower weapon requirements.", "The services have had numerous opportunities to develop and procure guided weapons in a more cost-effective and economical manner. However, when reviewing the services\u2019 currently planned programs in the aggregate, we found (1) widespread overlap and duplication of guided weapon types and capabilities, (2) questionable quantities being procured for each target class, and (3) a preference for longer standoff and more accurate weapons rather than for options that may be as effective and less costly.", "DOD\u2019s Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study was an opportunity for DOD to critically assess its weapons procurement programs and provide a basis for restructuring them. However, despite the significant effort that went into the study, it still does not, in our view, give DOD the assurance that it has the proper and cost-effective mix of deep attack weapon programs. Therefore, DOD cannot be confident that force structure and modernization decisions will result in the most cost-effective mix of forces to fulfill the national military strategy.", "Because DOD does not routinely develop information on joint mission needs and aggregate capabilities, it has little assurance that decisions to buy, modify, or retire deep attack weapons are sound. Broader assessments that tackle the more controversial deep attack issues would enable the Secretary of Defense to make the difficult trade-off decisions that will likely be required.
