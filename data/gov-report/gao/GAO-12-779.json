To explore the potential to reduce leasing by better utilizing owned properties, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the potential for collocation and the factors that can affect that potential, (2) the possible benefits of collocation, and (3) the challenges associated with collocation, and what solutions, if ny, can mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed property data and documents from eight of the largest propertyholding agencies; laws, regulations and guidance; and prior GAO reports.

In some cases, space within these government-owned properties could be occupied by other government agencies.

However, this potential for collocation of federal agencies is affected by such factors as the size, location, and condition of the available space.", "Officials from various agencies said that, in some cases, collocation could result in more efficient service delivery and cost savings or avoidance. For example, underutilized USPS floor and retail window space could be used by other federal agencies, generating space-use efficiencies for USPS and expanding citizen access to government services. Collocation could also help achieve agency synergies, such as shared technology infrastructure.", "Agency officials said that strategic partnerships among federal agencies targeted to meet specific needs and a formal local coordination mechanism could mitigate certain challenges to collocation, including administrative and data challenges. Agencies have varying authorities to share available space in their properties and differing capabilities to handle the administrative tasks associated with sharing space. The General Services Administration (GSA), as the federal government\u0092s property manager, possesses the capability and experience to market properties and manage leases on a large scale. Officials from other agencies suggested that partnerships with GSA or a private entity could address some administrative challenges and improve collocation efforts. However, the ability to identify collocation opportunities is hindered by the lack of a formal information-sharing mechanism. The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) is a national, policyoriented body and, as such, does not manage the local-level negotiations that collocation would require. The FRPC established a database describing all executive branch properties, but it was not designed to identify and manage collocation opportunities, nor does it include USPS data. In contrast, local federal officials indicated that they possess detailed knowledge of specific properties owned by their respective agencies and, with more structured local coordination, could share that knowledge to support collocation efforts.

A Senate bill, the Federal Real Property Asset  Management Reform Act of 2012, would 1) impose new duties on federal  agencies to maintain inventory controls and establish goals for reducing  inventories of underutilized properties, 2) establish and direct the Federal  Real Property Council (FRPC)\u2014chaired by the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB)\u2014to establish an asset management plan and submit  an asset disposal plan, and 3) require the Administrator of General  Services Administration (GSA) and the FRPC to establish and maintain a  database of agency real property. Additionally, postal reform legislation  includes a specific provision related to colocation between USPS and  other federal agencies, establishing and tasking the FRPC with identifying  federal agency field offices that could be colocated with USPS and other  civilian properties and permitting federal agencies to lease space for their  field offices from USPS. In May 2012, OMB also released a  memorandum directing agencies to offset any growth in new building  space with corresponding decreases through consolidations, colocations,  or disposal of space from the agency\u2019s inventory.", "To help inform the discussion, you asked us to examine issues  surrounding opportunities for colocating federal agencies by which the  federal government could reduce privately owned, leased space by  consolidating onto underutilized federally owned property.

For example, USPS has often faced resistance from affected  employees, communities, and elected officials when it has attempted to  consolidate its processing operations and networks or close mail- processing facilities because of concerns about possible effects on  service, employees, and communities. USPS recently announced that it  will maintain existing retail locations, with modified operating hours. As a  result of these issues, USPS has more space than it needs. Our recent  work has also shown that USPS faces a deteriorating financial condition.  For example, at the end of fiscal year 2011, the USPS had incurred a  $5.1-billion loss for the year, had $2 billion remaining on its $15-billion  borrowing limit, and projects it will be unable to make its $5.5 billion  scheduled retiree health benefits payment to the federal government.

This is particularly true  for USPS, as declining mail volume and changes in operations have freed  space in many owned facilities. While there are problems with using  governmentwide data to identify underutilized space, as will be discussed  later in this report, we observed underutilized space held by multiple  federal entities in the case study markets we visited for this report. For  example, in each case study market, we observed one or more cases of  vacant or underutilized space in post offices, including both offices and  space on the processing floor, that officials said could be re-configured  and physically separated from USPS operations (see fig. 2.)", "In some cases, spaces within these underutilized owned properties could  be used by other government agencies. According to a recent report by  the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) related to post office  utilization, excess floor and retail window space exists nationwide that  could be used by other government agencies or used to perform  transactions on behalf of other government agencies. The USPS OIG\u2019s  office also conducted several regional studies examining excess USPS  space and noted a correlation between space leased by GSA and the  ability of USPS to significantly accommodate federal space needs. For  example, one of those studies estimated that of the USPS districts  reviewed, USPS excess space may accommodate 147 of 175 (or 84  percent) of agencies\u2019 current federal leases, and noted that GSA paid  considerably more per square foot than the value assigned to USPS  space. However, the Inspector General (IG) did not determine whether  the excess space identified was usable for sharing with other agencies, in  part because USPS systems and policies do not identify usable areas,  and noted that more information would be necessary to determine  whether USPS\u2019s excess space would be suitable for another government  tenant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Space Size, Location, and Condition Affect Colocation Potential", "paragraphs": ["We observed several attributes that could affect using underutilized space  for colocation. These attributes included size, location, and condition,  which would likely render some spaces more appropriate for sharing than  others.

Both of these attributes  could limit those spaces\u2019 suitability for effective colocation. Furthermore,  underutilized space that we observed varied in terms of its location within  facilities. For example, GSA and VA officials described having some  space that is less desirable to potential tenants. Although we observed  generally high occupancy in GSA\u2019s multi-agency federal buildings, GSA  officials showed us some space they said is not easily leased because of  its location, such as a first floor interior office bordering the building\u2019s  maintenance hallways or windowless basement spaces, and noted that  these extra spaces can remain in GSA buildings when an agency does  not require the entirety of a vacant space. VA officials noted similar  issues, in that empty or available space at its campuses is often located  in buildings surrounded by other VA buildings, which can make it harder  for outside parties to access and use.", "Additionally, we observed underutilized space in a wide range of  conditions, from rundown to newly renovated, which could also affect  colocation options. GSA officials said that a variety of physical aspects of  the space may factor into the desirability of the space for colocation,  including ceiling height, support column size, lighting, and windows. For  example, Figure 3 shows interior office space in a GSA-held federal  building in downtown Dallas that GSA officials told us has been vacant for  years, a vacancy that they attributed to the lack of natural light and the  large support columns that make it difficult to place workstations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Colocation Could Yield Service-Delivery Efficiency and Cost- Avoidance Benefits in Some Cases", "paragraphs": ["Federal officials we spoke with indicated that colocation could result in  improved government operations through increased efficiencies for  service access or delivery to the public in some cases. For example, VA  officials stated that their incentive for colocation is to expand veterans\u2019  medical care efficiently, and that sharing space with other agencies with  similar missions, such as the U.S. Army, could help achieve that goal and  avoid duplicating medical capacity. Moreover, according to a recent report  by the USPS OIG, the Postal Service would benefit from sharing post  office space with other government entities while generating revenue and  increasing efficiency by expanding citizen access to government  operations. For example, USPS currently has interagency agreements to  provide non-postal government services, such as accepting passport  applications and Selective Service registration forms. DHS officials  discussed broadly how DHS is often colocated with USDA, the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) because those agencies have complementary  missions to certain DHS operations. These colocations take place in both  GSA-held and DHS-held space. While not inter-agency, Interior officials  described how the agency has tried to colocate its various bureaus for the  sake of agency synergies, especially since the public often does not  distinguish among the roles of the bureaus. They noted that integrating  services in space or function is a good practice that could occur across  agencies. USDA officials also said that the colocation of the Farm Service  Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)  provided synergies because they are able to share databases and pass  information more readily between the two entities.", "Federal officials also said that, under certain circumstances, colocation  could result in cost savings or avoidance for the federal government. For  example, DHS officials described the department\u2019s examination of  colocation opportunities within the department, and cited one case it  studied where cost savings could result from productivity gains, reduced  redundancy, and cost avoidance. USPS officials in multiple locations  noted USPS would benefit from revenue from a federal agency tenant.  For example, USPS could share underutilized floor and retail window  space with other government agencies, generating revenue to offset  some building costs. Additionally, GSA officials described the motivation  to accomplish savings from consolidation and colocation as responsible  asset stewardship.", "While federal officials seemed to agree that colocation can produce  efficiencies, data limitations, such as the lack of a national, multi-agency  asset-management tool as discussed in the next section, make it difficult  to estimate the financial and nonfinancial benefits from colocating federal  agencies, because the quality of any estimate is a direct function of the  input data. Moreover, colocation will not always be more cost-effective  than leasing in the short run, particularly if the costs to reconfigure owned  space are high. For example, DOD officials said that it cost $20 million to  renovate a vacant 70,000-square-foot warehouse within the Naval  Support Facility in suburban north Philadelphia and move the Navy  Human Resources Service Center there from leased commercial space.  They estimated that the payback period for the move would exceed 30  years. Information on cost and service delivery improvements from  colocations can help agencies decide whether to proceed with  colocations and aid agencies in evaluating completed colocations.  Generally, however, agencies lack the tools\u2014such as a standardized  approach for quantifying costs and benefits\u2014to determine whether, and  to what extent, colocations will generate or are generating intended  savings or financial benefits, metrics that are key to helping agencies  manage their resources. Moreover, some federal officials indicated that  quantitatively measuring the nonfinancial results of colocations, such as  intergovernmental collaboration, was difficult to do because these are  difficult concepts to monetize, as they can be subjective. We found that  agencies generally lacked the tools to measure the costs and benefits of  colocation efforts. Our work on capital decision making has shown that  establishing an analytical framework for review, approval, and selection of  projects; evaluating a project\u2019s results; and incorporating lessons learned  into the decision-making process are all key principles and practices of  such an effort. Establishing a framework with a mixture of financial and  nonfinancial benefits, such as service delivery improvements, allows  entities to better evaluate performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Inter-Agency Collaboration Could Mitigate Some Challenges to Colocation", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials said that greater collaboration\u2014through strategic  partnerships among federal agencies targeted to meet specific needs and  a formal local coordination mechanism\u2014could mitigate some  administrative, financial and data challenges to colocation.

Acquiring the needed up-front financing for repair  or renovation remains challenging for agencies, although some agencies  have secured up-front financing through partnerships with private entities.  Agencies face challenges identifying colocation opportunities because of  limitations with available data and the lack of a coordination mechanism.  Officials from a few agencies suggested that structured local or regional  coordination could best identify opportunities where the missions of  various agencies could be \u201cmatched\u201d to appropriate space because of  local and regional federal officials\u2019 more detailed knowledge of local  needs, conditions, and opportunities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administrative Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have varying real property management authorities related to  colocation, including the ability to share property and retain the proceeds,  and this variation can create administrative challenges for agencies  seeking to increase inter-agency colocation opportunities.

In addition, even  if an agency has the authority to share real property, it may not be well- prepared to handle tasks such as setting lease rates and managing the  financial arrangements for renovations. For example, GSA officials said  some agencies do not know what rates to charge for the space they would  share with other agencies. Moreover, Navy officials said agencies with the  authority to share properties can face administrative challenges managing  the many various sources of funds potentially needed should extensive  renovations be necessary to bring properties up to usable condition.", "Officials from six agencies as well as commercial real estate officials said  that to overcome some of these administrative challenges and improve  colocation efforts, agencies could address specific challenges through a  strategic partnership with GSA. They said GSA has administrative  structures and experiences that could benefit less-experienced agencies.  For example, GSA, as the federal government\u2019s property manager,  already possesses the capability to market and price properties and  manage leases on a large scale. Our previous work on the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA)  also supports the idea that  strategic partnerships could be beneficial to overcoming these  challenges. We have reported that cross-government agency  collaboration can produce more public value than can be produced when  agencies act alone. Specifically, agencies can enhance and sustain  their collaborative efforts by engaging in a variety of practicesestablishing policies and procedures to operate across agency  boundaries, by, for example, developing interagency handbooks that  define common standards, policies, and procedures. During our review,  officials from four agencies suggested that increased collaboration  through some of these practices could help mitigate some of the  administrative challenges of colocation. As a potential approach for these  types of strategic partnerships, OMB officials described GSA\u2019s effort to  work with selected agencies to develop strategic plans for future property  needs and identify potential areas for consolidation.", "USPS has some experience collaborating with other agencies on real  property issues, and as it explores further options to better utilize excess  space, strategic partnerships with other agencies, particularly GSA, could  help USPS overcome administrative challenges that may be impeding  colocation. A February 2012 USPS OIG report said USPS has experience  with intergovernmental collaboration because it already shares space in  federal buildings and conducts transactions for other federal entities. For example, the Mansfield, Ohio, federal building hosts a post office as  well as offices of SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S.  Department of Labor. The report noted that because many postal facilities  are near many GSA-leased properties, sharing space could potentially  lower overall federal lease costs. The report recognized USPS\u2019s need to  optimize its network through internal consolidations and closures, but said  USPS could use its underutilized resources better through external  collaboration.

For example, we saw  several USPS properties in which the available space required substantial  renovation to replace old carpet, peeling paint, and outdated fixtures, and  to repair water damage (see fig. 4). However, USPS\u2019s deteriorating  financial condition may limit the costs it can incur to renovate its facilities  prior to sharing them with other agencies.", "We also observed spaces that would need potentially costly specialized  repairs or renovations. For example, some of the U.S. Navy properties we  visited at the mixed-use Philadelphia Navy Yard (see fig. 5) would need  asbestos abatement and water damage repair. Navy officials told us that  the properties could be leased from the Navy by other government  agencies, and that some agencies have made inquiries to do so.  However, they said that the agencies were alarmed by the complexity and  costs of repairs, which effectively ended any further consideration of the  properties for colocation. Had any agencies pursued leasing the  properties, Navy officials said they likely would lack sufficient up-front  financing. In addition to general and specialized renovation costs, Navy  officials said DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) requirements prescribe  certain antiterrorism measures, such as blast-proof windows and security  gates, which can further elevate the costs of renovations to DOD-owned  buildings, both on and off-base.", "The up-front costs of renovations present a challenge to GSA that hinders  its colocation efforts. GSA regional officials said that financing  renovations is the most serious challenge they face in improving the  utilization of their assets. Regional officials said they have considered  acquiring vacant USPS facilities that could support colocation, but have  been reluctant to do so in part because of the up-front cost of the  extensive renovations needed to make the properties usable. As we have  previously reported, in recent years budgeting and appropriations  decisions, made by the executive branch and Congress, have limited the  amount of resources made available from the Federal Buildings Fund to  GSA to fund real property operations, acquisition, and maintenance.GSA headquarters officials told us that these limitations make it  challenging for the agency to effectively manage its portfolio and result in  delayed or cancelled projects.", "In downtown Philadelphia, GSA had considered purchasing USPS\u2019 large, underutilized  30th St. Mail Processing and Distribution Center Station, but was dissuaded by the  substantial cost of the renovation that would be needed for the building, which was  constructed in 1935. Instead, in April 2007, USPS signed a deal with a private developer  to renovate nearby facilities and, in August 2007, signed a memorandum of understanding  with GSA for private redevelopment of the building into IRS offices. In September 2008,  USPS moved its retail operations and distribution unit out of 30th St. into its new facilities.  When the 30th St. renovation was complete, IRS moved into the property (see fig. 6). In  exchange for financing the $184-million renovation, the developer received all interest and  rights from USPS for the 30th St. land, building, and a nearby 1,661-space parking  garage, and until August 25, 2030, will receive lease payments from GSA, who in turn will  receive rent from IRS. reported, renovations financed by the private sector will generally cost  more than those financed by Treasury borrowing.", "The only national-level, multi-agency real property database\u2014the  FRPP\u2014was not designed to be an active asset management system.As such, it does not possess the level of detail necessary to support the  identification of colocation opportunities. The FRPP can provide basic  descriptive information about the government\u2019s federal property holdings,  such as address, square footage and facility type; however, colocation  decisions would require more data elements than would be practical to  add to the FRPP. For example, the FRPP provides square footage  information, but it does not provide information on orientation or use of  space. We visited a DHS-held site where most of the facility was  underground and much of the unoccupied space was used by  environmental systems such as air filtration units and pumps that could  not be removed. (See fig. 7.) The FRPP does not reveal that the facility is  underground, nor does it convey the substantial challenges to  reconfiguring the space. Similarly, we found that one building under  renovation was characterized as \u201cunderutilized\u201d in the FRPP. While not  technically incorrect, characterizing this space as underutilized can be  misleading because the simple utilization designation does not  necessarily indicate if the space can be immediately occupied or used for  colocation.", "As a result, local and regional federal officials are generally better  positioned than headquarters officials to manage the colocation process  because of their more detailed knowledge of local needs, conditions, and  opportunities. We found that detailed property knowledge necessary to  facilitate colocations was concentrated at the regional and local levels,  rather than at headquarters. When we asked for detailed information  about specific properties, we were referred to local and regional federal  officials, who were knowledgeable about specific sites and facilities.  Some headquarters officials were familiar with attempts at colocation and  could describe overall situations, but they were not the primary contacts  for these efforts, nor could they readily describe the properties\u2019 attributes  or local office needs. In general, local and regional federal officials said  that they knew property details\u2014such as space configuration, access  routes, and parking availability\u2014that would be important for facilitating  colocations. In addition, FRPC, which created the FRPP database, is a  national, policy-oriented body. As such, the scope of FRPC\u2019s mission  does not include managing the local-level negotiations that colocation  would require.", "The detailed property knowledge held by local federal officials is  important for ensuring an appropriate match between the agency that  owns the property and the agency that would lease space. Officials from  many agencies reported that matching the location of available property  to the mission and security needs of the agency searching for space is an  important consideration; for example, DOE\u2019s need for isolated, remote  sites as compared to VA\u2019s interest in sites readily accessible to veterans.  However, officials noted that that there are no universal requirements  regarding their respective agencies\u2019 property needs\u2014rather, the property  needs vary across the country in response to mission needs. In some  cases, agencies have operational requirements that would make  colocation inappropriate if the potential tenant and potential lessor did not  share the same mission needs. For example, USPS officials noted the  Postal Service\u2019s need to keep mail secure and separate from potential  tenant agencies or members of the public who may need to access the  facility. Additionally, officials from DOD told us that in some  circumstances their security requirements would make them ill-suited to  share space with other agencies, such as when public access would be  required. However, in instances where mission needs were similar,  potential tenants might see enhanced security as desirable.", "In other cases, an agency\u2019s mission may dictate the need for a  specialized facility that could make colocation inappropriate. For example,  USDA officials in a few regions told us that farmers often drove farm  vehicles, including tractors, to Service Center locations and that in these  cases, underground parking in a federal building would be problematic. In  addition, we visited a leased Interior site that required a blacksmith and  carpentry shop, cold storage for artifacts, and parking for large  maintenance vehicles, such as wood-chippers and industrial mowers (see  photos in fig. 8 below). An Interior official said that these needs would  have to be taken into account to share space. None of these details are  included in the FRPP, but local and regional officials from several  agencies noted that they can speak readily on how mission needs and  facility details may impact colocation.", "Officials from several agencies acknowledged that property knowledge is  sometimes communicated informally. However, various officials noted  that the lack of a systematic mechanism to share information hinders any  efforts to colocate. Officials from a few agencies suggested that  structured local or regional coordination could best identify opportunities  where the missions of various agencies could be \u201cmatched\u201d to  appropriate space. Several local officials who showed us vacant federal  spaces said there is currently no online or formal mechanism they can  use to share vacancy details with officials from other agencies who might  need space. A previous effort at local coordination\u2014the Governmentwide  Real Property Information Sharing program (GRPIS)\u2014experienced some  success, according to GSA officials, which they attributed to connections  made at the local level. The program was tasked with encouraging and  facilitating the sharing of real property information among federal  agencies, and it revolved around the formation of real property councils  within major federal communities nationwide. GSA officials said that local  councils were an effective method for sharing information. However,  officials said the program became essentially inactive after responsibility  for the program was transferred within GSA and local connections were  lost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Colocating federal agencies into government-owned space represents an  opportunity to improve government operations while simultaneously  addressing two of the federal government\u2019s long-standing real-property  management challenges: reducing over-reliance on costly leasing and the  presence of underutilized owned property. Our analysis of eight markets  shows that there are underutilized owned properties near areas where the  government also leases space for other purposes. However, colocations  are far more complicated than just matching the square feet needed with  the square feet available. Agencies\u2019 mission needs and building-specific  issues that include security, condition, configuration, and use must align  for the colocation to fully succeed. FRPC has coordinated federal real  property actions for almost a decade at the national level, but detailed  local knowledge of agency missions and facility needs combined with  systematic communication channels are needed to match owners with  compatible tenants.", "Once matched, numerous capacity and administrative hurdles remain as  challenges to successful colocation. GSA is the only agency that has a  core mission of managing real property. Several landholding agencies  lack the experience and administrative tools necessary to effectively  market and manage their property as a landlord. Creating cross-agency  relationships with GSA to assist in tasks such as setting rental rates,  crafting lease documents, renovating space, and otherwise managing the  property would improve consistency of approach and allow each agency  to remain focused on its core mission.", "Colocation is not always the right answer. We found that agencies can  force relocations into ill-suited locations, pushing the financial breakeven  point out decades into the future. Without the tools to measure the  benefits and costs of colocation efforts or proposals, policy makers are  unable to effectively weigh colocation as an option. Understanding the  financial costs and savings associated with colocation efforts, as well as  the nature and extent of synergies and improved services, will allow  agencies to better demonstrate that the benefits can be worth the costs of  renovating and moving an agency out of privately leased space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To promote colocation across agencies, the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) should work with the Federal Real  Property Council (FRPC) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to  implement GAO\u2019s three recommendations:  \uf0b7  Establish a mechanism, which includes USPS, for local coordination  in markets with large concentrations of federal agencies to identify, on  a case by case basis, specific opportunities to share space and  improve coordination of real property use across agencies.  \uf0b7  Develop strategic partnerships and a coordinated strategy with  assigned roles and tasks between the General Services  Administration (GSA) and other federal landholding agencies (USPS  specifically) with less experience sharing real property.  \uf0b7  Develop and implement tools, along with supporting guidance, to  measure, evaluate, and disseminate information on financial and  nonfinancial benefits, such as service delivery improvements, from  colocating federal agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB, GSA, USPS, VA, USDA, DOE,  Interior, DHS, DOD, and IRS for review and comment.

To accomplish this, we addressed  (1) if the potential for cross-agency colocation exists, what factors can  affect that potential; (2) the potential benefits of colocation; and (3) the  challenges associated with colocation, and what solutions, if any, can  mitigate these challenges. During the course of our work we used the  Federal Real Property Portfolio (FRPP), a government-wide database of  owned and leased space, maintained by GSA on behalf of the Federal  Real Property Council (FRPC). We recently reported that the FRPC has  not followed sound data collection practices\u2014related to data consistency,  performance measures, collaboration, and data reporting\u2014when  collecting FRPP data, that would help them collect these data in a way  that is sufficiently consistent and accurate to be useful making property  management decisions. We recommended that GSA develop a plan to  improve the FRPP consistent with sound data collection practices.  Nonetheless, we also reported that the FRPP can be used in a general  sense to track assets. As such, for this report, we used FRPP data for the  limited purposes of identifying agencies within our scope, selecting case  study markets and summarizing agency-level statistics on owned and  leased property.", "We used the 2010 Federal Real Property Portfolio (FRPP) summary  report and U.S. Postal Service property data to identify the agencies  which hold the largest amounts of property. We then limited our scope to  8 of the top 10 agencies, which include the Departments of Agriculture  (USDA), Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), the  Interior (Interior), Veterans Affairs (VA), the General Services  Administration (GSA), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).", "To determine the factors that can affect cross-agency consolidation, we  analyzed detailed data and interviewed agency officials about the  property holdings in 8 specific U.S. markets: Allentown PA, Cleveland  OH, Dallas TX, Kansas City KS, Kerrville TX, Philadelphia PA, San  Antonio TX, and Waco TX. To select these areas and provide nationwide  statistics on owned and leased facilities, we analyzed basic inventory  data, including location, occupant, size, owned/leased data from the  FRPP for the 7 agencies in our scope that are represented in the FRPP.  USPS, which is not represented in the FRPP, provided data from its  internal systems. While case studies are not generalizable, we selected  diverse markets in terms of market size, geographic region, owned and  leased federal properties, and agencies present. Although we used GSA- defined markets as a guideline, to better reflect the interests of this review  we delineated markets by using an estimated 60-minute commute radius,  and selected the borders based on professional judgment (for example, in  more rural areas, following the direction of development.) We identified  the primary cities of large and medium markets using GSA data, and then  selected small markets within driving distance of a large or medium-sized  market in order to facilitate travel.", "Because there are no reliable real property cost and benefit data, we  primarily relied on interviews with federal agency officials at the national,  regional, and local levels to determine the potential benefits of colocation.  We focused on benefits that were mentioned by officials from more than  one agency and more than one market. We also reviewed relevant GAO  and other reports and documents, including USPS Office of Inspector  General reports, and laws, regulations, and guidance.", "To determine the challenges associated with colocation and what  solutions, if any, could mitigate these challenges, we visited facilities that  were both owned and leased, with a particular emphasis on owned offices  and warehouses that were categorized as underutilized.

Using this information, we conducted  an analysis to identify key challenges that agencies face when making  property decisions and the options, if any, for mitigating those challenges.", "We also interviewed agency officials at the national, regional, and local  level, and reviewed documentation provided to us regarding specific  properties.
