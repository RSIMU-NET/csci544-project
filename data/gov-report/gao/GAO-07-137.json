To award competitive grants, HRSA used independent reviewers who assessed applications against published criteria, scored applications that met minimum criteria, and determined if they qualified for the funding preference. HRSA ranked the applications from highest to lowest score--putting those with the funding preference first--and awarded grants in decreasing rank order until the available funds were exhausted. Although HRSA had discretion to award grants out of rank order, the agency did not do so for fiscal years 2002-05. For fiscal years 2002-05, HRSA awarded a total of 99 competitive HCOP grants from 439 grant applications reviewed. Overall, minority-serving institutions submitted about 25 percent of the applications reviewed and received about 30 percent of the competitive grants; historically black colleges and universities were the most numerous grantees among minority-serving institutions, followed by Hispanic-serving institutions.

HCOP grants are generally approved  for a period of 3 years and support activities such as training to help  students prepare for health professions education as well as counseling  and mentoring for those already enrolled.

For fiscal year 2006, in response to direction received during the  appropriations process, funding made available for HCOP by HRSA from  its appropriations was reduced significantly. As a result, HRSA cancelled  the competition for grants and distributed all funds available for HCOP for  fiscal year 2006\u2014about $4 million\u2014on a noncompetitive basis to continue  funding 4 of 58 existing HCOP grant projects within their approved project  periods. In response to guidance in an appropriations committee report,  which strongly urged HRSA to give priority to those institutions with a  historic mission of training minorities in the health professions, the  agency distributed the $4 million for fiscal year 2006 to continue funding  existing HCOP grant projects at four institutions that met that criterion.", "All projects supported by HCOP grants focus on individuals who are either  educationally or economically disadvantaged.

In this  report, the conference committee also directed us to study the HCOP grant  award process. As discussed with the appropriations subcommittees with  responsibility for HHS programs, this report addresses, for fiscal years  2002 through 2005, (1) HRSA\u2019s process for awarding HCOP grants and   (2) the number and characteristics of HCOP applicants and grantees.", "To conduct our work, we analyzed HRSA\u2019s data on HCOP applications,  including the scores and funding preference determinations made during  the application review process, and HCOP grant award decisions for fiscal  years 2002 through 2005.

We determined that the HCOP data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. In addition, we interviewed HRSA officials and reviewed  relevant federal laws, congressional committee reports, and agency  documents. In reviewing the characteristics of entities submitting HCOP  applications and of HCOP grantees, we included only those applications  that HRSA officials determined met the initial screening requirements to  be considered for awards. To determine whether applicants and grantees  that were institutions of higher education met criteria for designation as  minority-serving institutions, we used Department of Education  documents and other sources.

HCOP grant funds may be used  for a variety of activities, such as recruiting individuals from  disadvantaged backgrounds interested in health careers; facilitating their  entry into health professions schools; providing counseling, mentoring,  and other support activities designed to assist them to complete this  education; providing information on financial aid; and providing  experience in primary health care settings.", "The 1998 reauthorization of HCOP emphasized the importance of outreach  activities by adding a funding preference for HCOP applications for  projects that \u201cinvolve a comprehensive approach by several public or  private nonprofit health or educational entities to establish, enhance and  expand educational programs that will result in the development of a  competitive applicant pool of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds  who desire to pursue health professions careers.\u201d Applications qualifying  for this funding preference have an advantage because they must be  considered for funding ahead of applications that do not.", "Projects supported by HCOP grants focus on individuals from  disadvantaged backgrounds, and Congress has recognized that such  individuals may be members of minority groups.

To assess HCOP applications, the division selected reviewers with health- related educational, counseling, academic, or project management  experience who were not employed by HRSA and who were free from  conflicts of interest, including employment or consulting arrangements  with any entity that was applying for an HCOP grant for that fiscal year.  The division sent each reviewer about eight applications to read in  advance, then convened multiple panels in which reviewers met to discuss  the merits of those applications. The reviewers were instructed to apply  the published HCOP review criteria and reach consensus within each  panel on their funding recommendations.

HRSA officials used this rank- order list as their basis for recommending which applications should  receive grants for a given fiscal year and the amount of each award.

For our review, we defined Hispanic-serving institutions as  those that received grants through the Developing Hispanic-Serving  Institutions Program under title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for  fiscal years 2002 through 2005. That is, we determined an institution\u2019s  status as a Hispanic-serving institution for a particular fiscal year on the  basis of whether the institution had a title V grant that year. To identify  HCOP applicants and grantees that were Hispanic-serving institutions at  the time of our review, we obtained lists of title V grantees for the  Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program from the Department of  Education\u2019s Web site for fiscal years 1999 through 2005.
