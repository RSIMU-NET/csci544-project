GAO's analysis of U.S. Cyber Command's November 2010 Concept of Operations showed that it generally meets joint guidance and maps out U.S. Cyber Command's organizational and operational relationships in general terms. However, greater specificity is needed as to the categories of personnel that can conduct various types of cyberspace operations in order for the military services to organize, train, and equip cyber forces. The services may use military, civilian government, and contractor personnel to conduct cyberspace operations, and U.S. Cyber Command's Concept of Operations describes general roles and responsibilities for cyberspace operations performed by U.S. Cyber Command's directorates, the military services, and the respective service components. However, service officials indicated that DOD guidance was insufficient to determine precisely what civilian activities are permissible for certain cyber activities, that DOD is still reviewing the appropriate roles for government civilians in this domain, and that the military services may be constrained by limits on their total number of uniformed personnel, among other things. Without the specific guidance, the services may in the future have difficulty in meeting personnel needs for certain types of cyber forces. U.S. Cyber Command's Concept of Operations generally describes the command and control relationships between U.S. Cyber Command and the geographic combatant commands, but additional specificity would enable the military services to better plan their support for DOD cyberspace operations. DOD guidance calls for command and control relationships to be identified in the planning process. The Concept of Operations recognizes that a majority of cyberspace operations will originate at the theater and local levels, placing them under the immediate control of the geographic combatant commanders and requiring U.S. Cyber Command to provide cyberspace operations support. However, officials from the four military services cited a need for additional specificity as to command and control relationships for cyberspace operations between U.S. Cyber Command and the geographic combatant commands, to enable them to provide forces to the appropriate command. DOD recognizes this challenge in command and control and is conducting exercises and studies to work toward its resolution. U.S. Cyber Command has made progress in operational planning for its missions but has not fully defined long-term mission requirements and desired capabilities to guide the services' efforts to recruit, train, and provide forces with appropriate skill sets. DOD guidance requires that combatant commanders provide mission requirements the services can use in plans to organize, train, and equip their forces. However, GAO determined that in the absence of detailed direction from U.S. Strategic Command, the services are using disparate, service-specific approaches to organize, train, and equip forces for cyberspace operations, and these approaches may not enable them to meet U.S. Cyber Command's mission needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD set a timeline to develop and publish specific guidance regarding U.S. Cyber Command and its service components' cyberspace operations, including: (1) categories of personnel that can conduct various cyberspace operations; (2) command and control relationships between U.S. Cyber Command and the geographic combatant commands; and (3) mission requirements and capabilities, including skill sets, the services must meet to provide longterm operational support to the command.

As we have stated  in prior work, the threat to Department of Defense (DOD) computer  networks is substantial and the potential for sabotage and destruction is  present. Potential adversaries recognize that cyberspace is an asymmetric  means to counter U.S. military power, particularly since cyberwarfare  poses a significant threat at a low cost\u2014that is, a handful of programmers  could cripple an entire information system. In February 2011, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense said that more than 100 foreign intelligence agencies  have tried to breach DOD computer networks and that one was successful  in breaching networks containing classified information.

To  assist in its efforts to counter cyberspace threats, DOD directed the  establishment of U.S. Cyber Command in 2009 as a subunified command  under U.S. Strategic Command. Further, each of the military services was  required to identify appropriate component support for U.S. Cyber  Command, and to have that support in place and functioning before U.S.  Cyber Command reached full operating capability, which occurred in  October 2010. Much like its parent command, U.S. Cyber Command is  attempting to better meet the security challenges of the new century and  effectively anticipate, counter, and eliminate the emergence of cyber  threats at home and overseas, just as its counterparts strive to do in the  air, land, sea, and space domains.", "Since 2008, at the request of this subcommittee, we have conducted two  reviews, the first focused on the federal government\u2019s Comprehensive  National Cybersecurity Initiative and the second on DOD\u2019s cyberspace  capabilities.

Specifically, this report focuses on the extent to which  DOD and U.S. Cyber Command have identified for the military services   (1) roles and responsibilities including categories of personnel that can  conduct various cyberspace operations; (2) command and control  relationships, to include the geographic combatant commands; and   (3) mission requirements and capabilities in support of U.S. Cyber  Command to enable them to organize, train, and equip for cyberspace  operations.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed and analyzed DOD, U.S. Strategic  Command, U.S. Cyber Command, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air  Force plans, policies, and guidance regarding military operations in  cyberspace. We met with cognizant officials in the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, the Joint Staff, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Cyber Command  and its service components, and the National Security Agency to discuss  the progress made in establishing U.S. Cyber Command and providing  guidance to the military services for their cyberspace activities.  Additionally, we met with officials from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  and Air Force, both from headquarters and from various service training  commands, to discuss the steps they have taken to establish support to  U.S. Cyber Command and to identify how they have incorporated any  DOD-wide or U.S. Cyber Command guidance into the development of their  respective cyberspace capabilities, specifically with regard to staffing and  training cyberspace personnel.

DOD\u2019s Joint  Publication 1 states that a subunified command, such as U.S. Cyber  Command, has functions and responsibilities similar to those of the  commanders of unified commands, and exercises operational control of  assigned commands and forces and, normally, over attached forces within  the assigned joint operations area or functional area. Within this  command structure, subunified commands are responsible for operational  planning for their missions. Guidance for developing such plans is  provided by DOD\u2019s joint operation planning process. This process  establishes objectives, assesses threats, identifies capabilities needed to  achieve the objectives in a given environment, and ensures that  capabilities (and the military forces needed to deliver those capabilities)  are allocated to achieve mission success. Joint operation planning and  execution procedures also include assessing and monitoring the readiness  of those units providing the capabilities for the missions they are assigned.  Overall, the purpose of joint operation planning is to reduce the risks  inherent in military operations. The commanders of military service  components of subunified commands also have responsibilities that derive  from their roles in fulfilling the services\u2019 support function, such as the  development of program and budget requests, and the provision of  supporting plans and data on service forces to the subunified command.  Additionally, they are responsible for maintaining internal administration  and discipline and communications with both their subunified commander  and their service chief.", "In June 2009, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum directing the  creation of U.S. Cyber Command as a subunified command to U.S.  Strategic Command, and requiring the military departments to identify and  provide appropriate component support to U.S. Cyber Command, and to  have this support in place and functioning prior to the new subunified  command\u2019s reaching full operating capability. The memo required U.S.  Cyber Command to focus on integration of cyberspace operations and  possess the technical capability to address the risk of cyber threats and  vulnerabilities and secure freedom of action in cyberspace. The memo  further called for U.S. Cyber Command to \u201csynchroniz warfighting  effects across the global security environment,\u201d as well as support civil  authorities and international partners. The Director of the National  Security Agency was also subsequently designated to hold the position of  Commander of U.S. Cyber Command.", "Following its authorization in June 2009, U.S. Cyber Command reached its  initial operating capability on May 21, 2010, and was declared to be at full  operating capability on October 31, 2010. U.S. Cyber Command is  organized with various joint staff directorates corresponding to the major  functions of command, such as personnel, intelligence, operations,  logistics, plans, and communications systems. It is supported by the  Defense Information Systems Agency which, among other things, is  responsible for designing, provisioning, operating, and maintaining certain  DOD classified and unclassified networks. Additionally, U.S. Cyber  Command receives infrastructure, security, information assurance, and  various other forms of support from the National Security Agency. See  figure 1 for a diagram of U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s organizational structure.  This new command has identified three lines of operation: DOD Global   Information Grid operations, defensive cyberspace operations, and  offensive cyberspace operations. DOD Global Information Grid  operations consists of network operations to preserve availability,  integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation of  information on DOD networks, a mission that the services have been  conducting since the 1990s. Defensive cyberspace operations builds upon  the concept of computer network defense, while adding an operational  aspect for U.S. Cyber Command, referred to as Dynamic Network Defense  Operations. Offensive cyberspace operations is a newly defined line of  operation for U.S. Cyber Command which is focused on taking actions and  achieving outcomes in cyberspace to meet national or DOD objectives.", "As directed by the Secretary of Defense in June 2009, each of the military  departments provides service components for cyberspace operations to  U.S. Cyber Command: Army Cyber Command; Fleet Cyber Command;  Marine Forces Cyber Command; and Air Force Cyber Command. Three of  the four service components\u2014Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014all declared  full operational capability in October 2010. However, officials with Marine  Forces Cyber Command have stated that while they are currently capable  of conducting missions, they are still in the process of establishing the  command and will not reach full operational capability until the latter half  of 2013. Officials and documentation from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  and Air Force showed us that they have all retained administrative control  over their cyber service components. The Secretary of Defense assigned  combatant command authority over the cyber service components to U.S.  Strategic Command, which then delegated operational control over the  cyber service component commands to U.S. Cyber Command.", "The military services developed their service component commands in  response to direction from the Secretary of Defense\u2019s June 2009 memo,  but DOD had already recognized the importance of the cyberspace  domain. For example, beginning in late 2007, the Air Force attempted to  develop its own service-specific cyber command, though the Air Force  later gave the cyberspace operations mission to Air Force Space  Command and Air Force Cyber Command. Also, in November 2008, the  Secretary of Defense directed the military services to leverage the Navy\u2019s  existing computer network operations training facilities in order to fulfill  the anticipated need for more cyberspace operators.

As  we previously reported, DOD needs more comprehensive doctrine and  common definitions for cyberspace operations, and we recommended that  DOD revise its existing body of joint doctrine to include complete and up- to-date cyberspace-related definitions while it is deciding whether to add a  dedicated joint doctrine for cyberspace operations. As of February 2011,  DOD has defined numerous key cyber-related terms (see table 1 for a list  of some of those definitions), however, other and newer terms\u2014such as  DOD Global Information Grid operations, defensive cyberspace  operations, and offensive cyberspace operations discussed above\u2014have  not yet been added to DOD\u2019s joint dictionary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and U.S. Cyber Command Have Broadly Identified Roles and Responsibilities for Cyberspace Operations, but Additional Clarity Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["DOD and U.S. Cyber Command have made progress in identifying the roles  and responsibilities of the various organizations that support DOD  cyberspace operations. Our analysis showed that U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s  Concept of Operations generally meets joint guidance, but a greater level  of detail is needed with regard to the categories of personnel\u2014military,  government civilian, or civilian contractor\u2014that may conduct cyberspace  operations in order for the military services to organize, train, and equip  operations forces. Title 10 of the U.S. Code and DOD directives and  guidance implementing this authority identify overall roles and  responsibilities for the military services and combatant commands. These  documents delineate the functions of the military services, including  organizing, training, equipping, and providing cyberspace forces, as well as  meeting the operational requirements of the combatant commands. They  also delineate the functions of a combatant command, including giving  authoritative direction to subordinate commands and forces necessary to  carry out missions assigned to the command, organizing and employing  forces to carry out missions assigned to the command, and assigning  command functions to subordinate commanders. These documents also  define the relationships between combatant commanders, including  \u201csupporting\u201d and \u201csupported\u201d relationships, and the authority for a  combatant commander to establish and delegate certain responsibilities to  a subunified commander. Additionally, the 2008 Unified Command Plan  assigns to U.S. Strategic Command the responsibility for synchronizing the  planning of cyberspace operations. This responsibility was delegated to  U.S. Cyber Command upon its establishment by the Secretary of Defense  in June 2009.", "U.S. Cyber Command has developed a Concept of Operations. The  document, signed by the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command in  September 2010 and released in November 2010, lays out broad roles and  responsibilities for cyberspace operations and our evaluation showed that  it generally meets joint guidance. Joint guidance calls for a concept of  operations to include, among other things, the following actions: state the  commander\u2019s intent; describe the central approach the joint force  commander intends to take to accomplish the mission; provide for the  application, synchronization, and integration of forces and capabilities in  time, space, and purpose; focus on friendly and adversary Centers of  Gravity, and their associated critical vulnerabilities; and relate the joint  force\u2019s objectives and desired effects to those of the next higher command  and other organizations as necessary. The Concept of Operations states  in its commander\u2019s intent section that the Commander of U.S. Cyber  Command\u2019s top priorities include the following: improving the security  and defense of U.S. military networks, maturing U.S. Cyber Command,  working with the services to build the cyber force, and collaborating with  partners. Additionally, the Concept of Operations states that U.S. Cyber  Command will exercise control of assigned and attached forces to operate  and defend DOD networks as well as conduct offensive cyberspace  operations, as directed. It further states that the services retain primary  responsibility to man, train, and equip for mission readiness,  administration, and management of those forces under the command and  control of U.S. Cyber Command. The Concept of Operations directs the  service components assigned to U.S. Cyber Command to develop  capabilities in support of operational requirements from U.S. Cyber  Command, and also to provide shared situational awareness of their  portions of DOD networks. Further, the Concept of Operations identifies  and delegates areas of authority and responsibility throughout the U.S.  Cyber Command organizational structure. Accompanying annexes are  expected to provide greater detail about the command\u2019s plans to conduct  cyberspace operations. Service component officials said their components  have seen drafts of the annexes and are providing U.S. Cyber Command  with input for their development, but the annexes had not been issued as  of March 2011.", "The Concept of Operations is a U.S. Cyber Command document, but DOD  guidance is needed as well, since the Joint Staff is responsible for  promulgating Joint Chiefs of Staff publications to provide military  guidance for the joint activities of the armed forces. Accordingly, the Joint  Staff has released Joint Test Publication 3-12, its guidance for cyberspace  operations that, if finalized, could provide additional guidelines for the  military services and joint force commanders and supporting and  supported commanders. This document has been under development  since September 2009, but is still in draft. According to officials with the  Joint Staff and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Policy), this  publication will be revised again in the spring of 2011 and may not be  finalized and approved for some time after that. We previously reported on  the need for DOD to update its joint doctrine that discussed cyber-related  issues and definitions, in part because of the challenges that the absence  of such doctrine created for the military services and the combatant  commands. We recommended that DOD establish a time frame for   (1) deciding whether or not to proceed with a dedicated joint doctrine  publication on cyberspace operations, and (2) updating the existing body  of joint doctrine to include complete cyberspace-related definitions. DOD  concurred with our recommendations, and the development of Joint Test  Publication 3-12 represents another positive step toward providing  direction to the military services, but as it is still in draft form and it could  be further revised, we could not determine whether it will provide  comprehensive guidance to the service component commands.", "As part of their responsibility for organizing, training, and equipping cyber  forces to support U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s missions, the military services  are taking a total force approach\u2014including active duty and reserve  military personnel, government civilians, and civilian contractors\u2014to  staffing cyberspace operations. According to service officials, in  traditional support areas such as information assurance and information  technology, the services have been using civilians, as well as military  personnel, because these activities take place within DOD\u2019s own  networks. At the time of our review, three of the services said they may  only use active duty and reserve military personnel to conduct offensive  cyberspace operations, which constitutes a small percentage of  cyberspace operations. However, service officials expressed concern that  if offensive cyberspace operations require greater personnel resources,  competing demands from other mission areas may make it difficult for the  services to provide additional military personnel in support of U.S. Cyber  Command\u2019s activities. These concerns may be founded particularly in light  of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s plan to reduce the military end strength of  the Army and Marine Corps by 2015 and to reduce Navy personnel on  shore. Additionally, officials at Air Force headquarters noted that there are  some reductions in military force under way in the Air Force, including in  the communications field, and that there may be some civilian reductions  in the future as well. Officials with the Navy\u2019s cyber component command  noted that they are expected to increase the number of cyber personnel  without increasing Navy end strength, as the Navy will take personnel  from other areas and move them to cyber specialties.", "DOD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining  Workforce Mix (April 12, 2010), provides guidance to the military services  regarding the appropriate mix of personnel (military and DOD civilian)  and private sector support for DOD activities. Specifically, it provides  personnel mix criteria and guidance for risk assessments to be used to  identify and justify activities that are inherently governmental or  commercial. However, DOD and service officials told us that DOD is still  reviewing the appropriate roles for government civilians in the cyberspace  domain and service officials indicated that DOD policy guidance was  insufficient to determine precisely what civilian activities or duties are  permissible or prohibited in the cyberspace domain as direct participation  in hostilities. The need for clarity regarding the roles government civilians  may fill within the services\u2019 new cyber components creates additional  challenges for the services as they develop their cyber components in  support of U.S. Cyber Command.", "For example, a July 2010 memorandum from the Air Force\u2019s Judge  Advocate General to DOD\u2019s General Counsel raised concerns about the  insufficiency of DOD\u2019s policies to determine precisely what DOD civilian  activities or duties were permissible in relation to computer network  attack operations and, in the absence of clarification on these matters,  recommended that Air Force leadership limit DOD civilian roles in such  cyberspace operations. Air Force cyber officials told us that there is  uncertainty about whether they can use government civilians for DOD  cyberspace missions or if only uniformed military personnel may conduct  such operations. Navy officials noted that, to date, their civilian employees  have focused on cyber support issues, though this may change in the  future as they work to grow their civilian cyber force into other areas of  cyberspace operations. Currently, some of the services are leveraging  reserve component resources and are using personnel from existing career  fields, such as communications and intelligence, because of limits on the  total number of military personnel in each service. As a result, without  greater clarity regarding the personnel options at their disposal, the  military services may have difficulty in meeting their personnel  requirements in organizing, training, equipping, and providing cyber forces  if the requirements for offensive cyberspace missions and personnel  increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Specific Command and Control Relationships for Cyberspace Operations Remain Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Concept of Operations generally describes the  command and control relationships between U.S. Cyber Command and the  other combatant commands; however, more detailed guidance is needed  to clarify these relationships between U.S. Cyber Command and the  geographic combatant commands. According to DOD guidance, command  and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly  designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the  accomplishment of the mission. Further, command and control functions  are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,  communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in  planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in  the accomplishment of the mission. The Joint Chiefs of Staff joint  operational planning guidance indicates that command and control  relationships are to be identified in the plan. U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s  Concept of Operations recognizes that a majority of cyber operations will  originate at the theater and local levels, thereby placing them under the  immediate control of the geographic combatant commanders and their  components, and recognizes that nearly all cyberspace operations can  simultaneously affect the global, theater, and local levels because  cyberspace operations can be virtually unconstrained by geography.  According to its Concept of Operations, when a cyberspace operation is  confined to the area of responsibility of one geographic combatant  command, U.S. Cyber Command will act as a supporting commander to  the geographic combatant commander. When the cyberspace operations  impact global functions or create effects across the borders of more than  one geographic combatant command\u2019s area of responsibility, the  geographic combatant commanders may support U.S. Cyber Command, as  directed.", "However, officials from all four of the military services told us they require  further specificity regarding command and control relationships for  cyberspace operations, and officials from U.S. Cyber Command agreed. Of  particular concern to the services is how the support relationships  between U.S. Cyber Command and the geographic combatant commands  discussed above will be implemented. There are several different  command and control models for establishing such support relationships,  but U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Concept of Operations does not identify a  specific model for U.S. Cyber Command and the geographic combatant  commands to follow. For example, the Joint Task Force model may be  established on a geographical area or functional basis when the mission  has a specific limited objective and does not require overall centralized  control of logistics. The commander of a joint task force exercises  operational control over assigned (and normally over attached) forces and  also may exercise tactical control over forces or be a supported or  supporting commander. Another option, which is based on the U.S.  Special Operations Command model, would have U.S. Cyber Command  conduct its own operations, but also give it functions similar to the  military services to organize, train, equip, and provide forces to the other  combatant commands.  Another command and control model, based on  U.S. Transportation Command, would have cyber forces deployed in a  geographic combatant command\u2019s area of responsibility remain assigned  to and under the control of U.S. Cyber Command, unless otherwise  directed.", "DOD is aware of this particular challenge, and is working toward resolving  it. Officials from three of the four services told us DOD and U.S. Cyber  Command are beginning to address the issue, for example, by conducting  a series of cyberspace command and control exercises. According to  military service officials, in January 2011, DOD conducted a tabletop  exercise as part of U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s larger Terminal Fury exercise  to test some cyber-related command and control models. Additionally, a  U.S. Cyber Command official told us that U.S. European Command will  test an alternative cyberspace operations command and control model in a  tabletop exercise at the end of March 2011 and during its Austere  Challenge exercise in spring 2011. Further, in September 2010, the Joint  Chiefs of Staff requested that U.S. Pacific Command, in coordination with  U.S. Strategic Command, develop a concept of operations and initiate an  Initial Capabilities Document supporting combatant commander  requirements for cyberspace operations. Without a clear and specific  command and control relationship model, however, the services are  unclear as to how, to whom, and in what form they will be required to  present forces for cyberspace operations. The military services do not  know whether they will be required to present trained individuals or  complete mission-capable units, and they do not know if those individuals  or units will be presented to U.S. Cyber Command or to regional  organizations under the control of the geographic combatant commands.  Until they are provided with clearer and more specific command and  control relationships, it will be difficult for the services to plan the  personnel, training, and budgets needed to support emerging and future  cyberspace operational needs.", "In our prior work, we highlighted the command and control challenges for  cyberspace operations caused by conflicting guidance and unclear  responsibilities. This situation continues and until DOD updates its  policies and guidance to clarify command and control relationships for  cyberspace operations and clearly communicates those to all DOD  entities, its efforts to conduct coordinated and timely cyberspace  operations could be degraded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Services Are Pursuing Diverse Service-Specific Approaches in the Absence of Information on Long- Term Mission Requirements and Capabilities Needs", "paragraphs": ["The military services are pursuing diverse service-specific approaches to  establishing cyberspace capabilities because, although U.S. Cyber  Command has made progress in operational planning for its missions, it  has not fully defined long-term mission requirements and capabilities for  the military services to fulfill.

However, other levels and  types of guidance will be needed to provide a greater level of detail for the  services and other DOD entities regarding specific issues such as, but not  limited to operations, force planning, capability needs, and mission  requirements. Officials from three of the four service components told us  that U.S. Cyber Command has been providing them with operational  guidance on an almost daily basis that is sufficient for them to conduct  their current operations, but officials from the fourth service said that the  guidance received to date is not enough to enable them to formalize their  long-term personnel and training requirements.", "To guide the services\u2019 efforts to organize, train, and equip forces for  assignment to combatant commands, DOD\u2019s guidance requires that  combatant commanders provide mission requirements that the services  should meet.

U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Concept of  Operations defines its mission to include defending DOD information  networks and conducting full-spectrum military cyberspace operations  when directed. It also defines three specific mission areas within this  broader mission: DOD Global Information Grid operations, defensive  cyberspace operations (including Dynamic Network Defense Operations),  and offensive cyberspace operations. Our analysis showed that the U.S.  Cyber Command Concept of Operations generally meets the joint  guidance for such documents. However, U.S. Cyber Command has not yet  developed the next level of planning guidance, which would identify  mission requirements and desired capabilities to guide the services\u2019 efforts  to recruit, train, and provide forces with appropriate skill sets. For  example, planning guidance could be provided in the form of products of  the joint operational planning processes that address specific threats or  contingencies, such as operational plans or concept plans.", "According to officials from the four military services, the services have not  yet received formalized U.S. Cyber Command guidance regarding long- term personnel requirements and capabilities, and therefore have  respectively worked to develop internal guidance based on service- specific needs and missions as well as, in some cases, anticipated U.S.", "Cyber Command requirements. Consequently, the services are moving  forward using disparate, service-specific approaches to operationalizing  cyberspace without knowing exactly what mission requirements they will  be required to meet for U.S. Cyber Command. For example, Navy and Air  Force officials told us that they are leveraging reserve component  resources and taking personnel from existing career fields to avoid having  to increase service end strength. Further, the two services are taking very  different approaches to rearranging their career fields to varying degrees  in order to further improve their efforts to recruit and retain cyber  personnel, and they are doing this in different ways as they define new  service-level personnel needs, maintain old ones, anticipate future U.S.  Cyber Command personnel needs, and attempt to recruit, retain, and train  for all three needs. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officials told us that  they are largely rearranging existing specialty codes in communications  and cryptologic fields and giving their personnel new tasks and some new  training, while the Air Force has created entirely new career specialties for  cyberspace operations.", "Cyber personnel training is another area in which the services are  challenged by their need for mission requirements and capabilities from  U.S. Cyber Command. In the absence of requirements from U.S. Cyber  Command, the services have started to develop their own cyber training  programs geared toward service-specific cyberspace requirements and  attempts to anticipate the future needs of U.S. Cyber Command. For  example, officials from all four of the services told us that they have  preexisting training programs to address well-established information  assurance and computer network defense training needs. For the  emerging area of offensive cyberspace operations, the Navy and Marine  Corps rely heavily on the Joint Cyber Analysis Course, run by the Navy as  the executive agent under the National Security Agency\u2019s Cryptologic  Training System. Army officials told us that the service makes some use of  this National Security Agency\u2013sponsored course, but also has service- specific training of its own. Both the Army and the Navy see their separate  training courses as candidates for future joint cyber training, though no  decision has been made yet in this regard. Air Force cyber officials told us  that the service utilizes the Joint Cyber Analysis Course to provide  personnel to fill National Security Agency positions, but also established  two training courses in 2010\u2014one for officers and one for enlisted\u2014to  meet its own cyberspace operations needs. Requirements for both courses  are set by the Air Force\u2019s Air Education and Training Command and Air  Force Space Command, though the Air Force has received some informal  input from U.S. Cyber Command. However, U.S. Cyber Command has not  specified whether it will be requesting personnel from the services  according to (1) the knowledge, skills, and abilities required;   (2) occupational specialties; (3) grade structures; or (4) another category.  Without specific mission and capabilities requirements, the military  services cannot determine the requirements based on which they are to  provide and train personnel for the long term, or the capabilities they will  be expected to provide to U.S. Cyber Command. Therefore, the cyber  personnel and capabilities may vary from service to service. Differences  between the services can be good and may be expected, but whether these  differences are beneficial in the case of cyberspace operations, and  whether the services will be able to meet U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s long-term  mission requirements once they are established, remain unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Establishing a new command and the service components needed to  support it constitutes a large undertaking within DOD, requiring much  planning and coordination. DOD and the military services have already  laid the foundation and built a framework for the new U.S. Cyber  Command and its service components in little more than a year, a  significant achievement in an emerging domain. However, much work still  needs to be done in a timely manner to mature the operational capabilities  of U.S. Cyber Command and the service cyber components to a level  comparable to those of their peers in the air, land, sea, and space domains.  Joint test documents, broad definitions, and general outlines of roles,  responsibilities, and organizational structures are an important starting  point in building an effective organization, but detailed and formalized  guidance is needed to clarify roles, responsibilities, command structures,  and mission requirements. Until such detailed guidance is articulated, the  military services will continue to move forward in planning, budgeting,  recruiting, and training personnel to conduct cyberspace operations  without knowing whether their efforts will meet U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s  mission needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three  actions regarding U.S. Cyber Command and its service components\u2019  cyberspace operations.", "To assist the military services in fulfilling their responsibilities to organize,  train, and equip cyber forces, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  set a timeline and direct the:    Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in consultation with the DOD  Office of General Counsel, to develop and publish detailed policies and  guidance pertaining to categories of personnel that can conduct the  various forms of cyberspace operations;    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop and publish  authoritative and specific guidance regarding the supporting and  supported command and control relationships between U.S. Cyber  Command and the geographic combatant commands for cyberspace  operations; and    Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, in conjunction with U.S. Cyber  Command, to develop and publish authoritative and specific guidance  regarding the mission requirements and capabilities, including skill  sets, that the services should meet to provide long-term operational  support to U.S. Cyber Command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with all of our  recommendations and stated that they are taking actions to address these  issues internally.
