As agencies have struggled with issues involving intelligence gathering, information sharing and dissemination, security, and information technology (IT), it has become increasingly apparent that our government needs to better assess\u2014from a strategic standpoint\u2014all aspects of how it handles information.", "In recognition of the importance of government information, the Congress in 1980, as you know, passed the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to establish a single, overarching policy framework for the management of information resources. The act, amended in 1986 and 1995, established information resources management (IRM) as an approach governing virtually all aspects of government information activities, including collection, dissemination, security and privacy, and management of information technology. The act also created the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to provide leadership, policy direction, and oversight of governmentwide IRM. It further required OIRA to develop and maintain a governmentwide strategic IRM  plan, and charged OIRA with responsibilities for general IRM policy and specific  IRM functions: information collection, dissemination, statistical policy and  coordination, records management, privacy and security, and information  technology.", "Since 1998, OIRA has designated the Chief Information Officers Council\u2019s  strategic plan as the principal means of meeting the requirement for a  governmentwide strategic IRM plan. The most recent plan is for fiscal  years 2001\u20132002 and was published jointly by OMB and the CIO Council in  October 2000. According to this plan, its goal is to enhance the strategic  focus of the Council, establish roadmaps for achieving the strategic vision,  define measures to assist the Council in evaluating its progress toward  meeting its challenges, and provide a basis for budget planning.", "This report responds to your request that we review OIRA\u2019s actions to  fulfill its responsibilities under PRA. Specifically, our objectives were to  (1) assess the adequacy of the governmentwide strategic IRM plan  developed in response to the act\u2019s requirements and (2) provide status  information on OIRA\u2019s actions to address its IRM policymaking, oversight,  and functional responsibilities under the act. Our review was conducted at  OMB headquarters in Washington, D.C., from June through December  2001, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Appendix I contains details of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The need for strong leadership and a governmentwide strategic view of  information management has long been recognized as critical. Along with  establishing a single policy framework for federal management of  information resources and formalizing the institutionalization of IRM as  the approach governing information activities, the Paperwork Reduction  Act (PRA) in 1980 created OIRA to develop IRM policy and oversee its  implementation, at the same time giving it oversight responsibilities in  specific IRM functional areas. The OIRA administrator is also to serve as  the principal adviser to the director of OMB on IRM policy. The Clinger- Cohen Act of 1996 amended PRA to also give OIRA, through the director,  significant leadership responsibilities in supporting agencies\u2019 actions to  improve their IT management practices.", "In addition to these statutory responsibilities, OIRA is responsible for  providing overall leadership of executive branch regulatory activities.  OIRA also reviews significant new regulations issued by executive  departments and agencies (other than independent regulatory agencies)  before they are published in the Federal Register. In calendar year 2000,  OIRA staff reviewed approximately 2,900 proposed and 4,500 final rules.", "OIRA is organized into five branches: Information Policy and Technology  Management, Statistical Policy, Commerce and Lands, Human Resources  and Housing, and Natural Resources. Information Policy and Technology  is responsible for information dissemination, records management,  privacy and security, and IT. Statistical Policy, headed by the chief  statistician, is responsible for the statistical policy and coordination  requirements contained in the act. Desk officers in Commerce and Lands,  Human Resources and Housing, and Natural Resources are responsible for  information collection and regulatory review and related issues for  specific agencies in a matrixed fashion, in consultation with relevant OIRA  branches as well as the budget side of OMB. As of December 31, 2001,  OIRA had a total of 51 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff assigned to the five  branches: Information Policy and Technology Management (12 FTEs),  Statistical Policy (6), Commerce and Lands (8), Human Resources and  Housing (9), and Natural Resources (9). The OIRA Records Management  Center accounted for one additional position; the Office of the OIRA  Administrator accounted for the remaining six positions. OIRA has been  allotted and is in the process of filling 5 additional slots.", "Two other entities perform PRA-related activities. First, the Chief  Information Officers (CIO) Council was established by executive order in  July 1996 as the principal interagency forum for improving agency IRM  practices. For example, the Council is to make recommendations for  overall IT management policy, procedures, and standards, and to provide  advice to OMB on the development of the governmentwide strategic IRM  plan required by PRA. The Council is composed of the CIOs and deputy  CIOs from 28 federal agencies, plus senior officials from OMB. Second,  last June OMB established the position of associate director for  information technology and e-government. This individual is responsible  for (1) working to further the administration\u2019s goal of using the Internet to  create a citizen-centric government; (2) ensuring that the federal  government takes maximum advantage of technology and best practices to  improve quality, effectiveness, and efficiency; and (3) leading the  development and implementation of federal IT policy. In addition, the  associate director is responsible for (1) overseeing implementation of IT  throughout the federal government, (2) working with the deputy director  for management\u2014also described by OMB as the federal CIO\u2014to perform  a variety of oversight functions statutorily assigned to OMB, and (3)  directing the activities of the CIO Council.", "We have previously reported on OIRA\u2019s efforts to respond to the PRA  requirements for a governmentwide strategic plan. In 1998, we reported  that none of the various reports OIRA had designated since 1995 as being  the strategic IRM plan clearly discussed the objectives and means by  which the federal government would use all types of information  resources to improve agency and program performance\u2014a key PRA  requirement.", "A Broad, Governmentwide  Recent events have highlighted information as not only an asset but a  Perspective: More  Imperative Than Ever  critical tool, essential to achieving the fundamental purposes of  government. In the aftermath of the attacks of the past few months,  agencies have clearly struggled with issues concerning intelligence  gathering, information sharing and dissemination, security, and critical  information technology infrastructure. For example:", "Our September 2001 combating terrorism report highlighted that the  growing threat of terrorism presented evolving challenges to the existing  framework for leadership and coordination. We reported that the  interagency and intergovernmental nature of programs to combat  terrorism make it important that certain overall leadership and  coordination functions be performed above the level of individual  agencies. Accordingly, we recommended that the President appoint a  single focal point with responsibility for overall leadership and  coordination, including the development of a national strategy. The  president subsequently appointed former governor Tom Ridge as the new  director of homeland security, responsible for coordinating federal, state,  and local actions and for leading and overseeing such a comprehensive  approach to safeguarding the nation against terrorism. The successful  formulation of such a comprehensive strategy will require development of  one overall plan for the collection and analysis of information relating to  terrorist activities or threats across the United States, and the securing of  IT systems to facilitate the sharing of this information among the many  entities involved.", "That same report also addressed the need to protect critical federal  systems from computer-based attacks. As we reported, while an array of  activities had been undertaken to implement a national strategy to mitigate  risks to computer systems and the critical operations and infrastructures  they support, progress in certain key areas had been slow. Specifically,  agencies had taken steps to develop critical infrastructure protection  plans, but independent audits continue to identify persistent, significant  information security weaknesses that place federal operations at risk.  Further, while outreach efforts by numerous federal entities to establish  cooperative relationships with and among private and other nonfederal  organizations had raised awareness and prompted information sharing,  substantive analysis of sector-wide and cross-sector interdependencies  and vulnerabilities had been limited. We recommended that the federal  government\u2019s critical infrastructure protection strategy, which was under  review at the time of our report, define (1) specific roles and  responsibilities, (2) objectives, milestones, and an action plan, and (3)  performance measures.", "The recent attacks have also highlighted the need for immigration, law  enforcement, intelligence, and defense and foreign policy agencies to  better share information on domestic and international terrorists and  criminals. Concerns have been raised that the various databases and  information systems containing this information may not be sufficiently  linked to ensure that all levels of government have complete and accurate  information.", "Recent events have also reemphasized the importance of ongoing efforts  to improve the public health infrastructure that detects disease outbreaks,  identifies sources and modes of transmission, and performs laboratory  identification. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), the ability to share information on potential threats and  remedial actions, and exchange data on newly identified disease  outbreaks, is critical to our defense against bioterrorism. However, we,  CDC, and others have identified deficiencies in the information systems  and telecommunications capabilities at the local, state, and national levels  that hinder effective bioterrorism identification and response. For  example, in March 2001, CDC recommended that all health departments  have continuous, high-speed access to the Internet and standards for data  collection, transport, electronic reporting, and information exchange that  protect privacy and seamlessly connect local, state, and federal data  systems. In recent testimony, CDC emphasized that since September 11 it  has accelerated its efforts to work with state and local health agencies,  share critical lessons learned, and identify priority areas for immediate  strengthening.", "Beyond the recent terrorist acts, emerging trends also make clear the  importance of information resources to government, and the need for a  strategic approach. One such trend is the continuing shift from an  industrial to a knowledge-based and global economy in which knowledge  becomes the main driver of value and creation of wealth. One  characteristic of a knowledge-based economy is a higher set of public  expectations about government performance and accountability. In  addition, the knowledge-based economy presents complex issues that  require input from multiple institutions at different levels of government  and within the private and nonprofit sectors. To address these challenges,  government needs processes and structures that embrace long-term,  cross-issue, strategic thinking. Understanding and developing these new  processes will require active use and exchange of knowledge and  information that are relevant, timely, accurate, valid, reliable, and  accessible.", "The administration has also recognized the need to improve government  performance and, as a result, has established an ambitious agenda that is  dependent on effective management of information resources. One of the  governmentwide goals in The President\u2019s Management Agenda for Fiscal  Year 2002 is to expand e-government to provide high-quality service to  citizens at reduced cost, make government services more accessible, and  increase government transparency and accountability. To accomplish this,  the administration plans to support projects that offer performance gains  across agency boundaries, such as the development of a Web-based portal  that will allow citizens to apply for federal grants on-line. Making this  strategy successful will require the government to address such challenges  as implementing appropriate security controls, protecting personal  privacy, and maintaining electronic records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Coordinated Federal IRM Plan Is Essential to Achieving Results; OIRA\u2019s Plan Falls Short", "paragraphs": ["Given the changing environment in which the need for a performance- based federal approach to managing the government\u2019s information  resources is of paramount importance, strategic planning provides an  essential foundation.

In addition,  strategies for reaching the goals are incomplete. Additional documents  that OIRA cited as supplementing the CIO plan do not address the  weaknesses we identified.

It is this collection of documents, as a whole, that  constitutes the governmentwide strategic IRM plan under PRA. According  to OMB officials, these additional documents are as follows:", "Government Information Security Reform Act. Under this act,  agencies are required to report to OMB annually on independent  evaluations of their information security programs. OMB is then required  to summarize these reports; OMB officials said that this summary provides  strategic direction for the security area. Agencies reported to OMB in  September 2001; OMB issued the governmentwide summary on February  13, 2002.", "Budget Information. OMB officials cited two budget documents that  provide governmentwide strategic direction.

In addition, these officials stated that  the exhibit 53s, submitted by agencies as part of the budget process,  provide specific performance information on planned spending for major  and significant information systems. In addition, the chief statistician cited  the annual OMB report, Statistical Programs of the United States  Government, which describes proposed funding and priority activities for  federal statistics.", "Plans Under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. Under this  act, agencies are required to report to OMB on their plans for providing  the public with the option of submitting, maintaining, and disclosing  required information electronically, instead of on paper. OIRA has  summarized these plans in a database which, according to OIRA, provides  part of the strategic direction for IRM. In September 2001, we reported on  the status of agency implementation of the act. We found that although  agency implementation plans submitted in October 2000 included much  potentially useful information, many omissions and inconsistencies were  evident. In addition, we noted that the plans did not provide sufficient  information regarding agencies\u2019 strategic actions that could minimize the  risk of not meeting the deadline for providing electronic options. We  concluded that given these shortcomings, OMB would be challenged in its  oversight role of ensuring that agencies comply with the act.

Although this  agenda adds additional perspective on the administration\u2019s strategic  direction for certain aspects of IRM, it is not broad enough to compensate  for the weaknesses in the CIO Council plan. In addition, the current NARA  strategic plan for fiscal years 1997\u20132007 includes no governmentwide  goals and strategies for records management. Rather, NARA\u2019s articulated  goals and strategies focus on the mission of the agency: providing ready  access to information that documents citizens\u2019 rights, officials\u2019 actions,  and the national experience.

Additionally, they  noted that they work with agency CIOs through the budget process,  Government Performance and Results Act reporting, and information- collection reviews to further policy oversight. OIRA officials also  emphasized their work with the CIO Council and other interagency groups  as a means of overseeing agency activities. They stressed that OMB is not  an audit organization, and that A-130 requires agencies to monitor their  own compliance with IRM policies, procedures, and guidance.", "OIRA has also taken action to respond to the specific IRM functional  responsibilities in PRA: information collection, dissemination, statistical  policy and coordination, records management, privacy and security, and  IT. Since 1995, OMB has issued guidance in each of these areas including  on such topics as Internet privacy, dissemination, and information  technology. In addition, it has responded to specific requirements by  reviewing and approving proposed agency information collections,  appointing a chief statistician to coordinate statistical activities, seeking  statutory authority to expand data sharing among statistical agencies, and  working with the CIO Council to improve IT management. The full range  of these actions are recounted in appendix II.", "Our past work demonstrates, however, that OIRA faces continuing and  new challenges in each of these areas.

For  example, in April 2001, we reported that paperwork had increased by  nearly 180 million burden hours during fiscal year 2000\u2014the second  largest 1-year increase since the act was passed. This increase was largely  attributable to the Internal Revenue Service, which raised its paperwork  estimate by about 240 million burden hours. We also reported that PRA  violations\u2014in which information-collection authorizations from OMB had  expired or were otherwise inconsistent with the act\u2019s provisions\u2014had  declined from 710 to 487, but were still a serious problem. We concluded  that while OIRA had taken some steps to limit violations, more needed to  be done, including taking steps to work with the budget side of OMB to  bring agencies into compliance. In commenting on this report, OMB  officials noted that in November 2001, the OIRA administrator and OMB  general counsel sent a memorandum to agencies stressing the importance  of having agencies eliminate existing violations and prevent new ones.", "Information Dissemination. Two recent reports underscored the  evolving nature of information dissemination issues and the challenges  that the government faces in moving toward increased electronic  dissemination of information. One on the National Technical Information  Service (NTIS)\u2014a repository for scientific and technical information\u2014  stated that rising demand for electronic products, coupled with increasing  availability of this information on the Internet, raised fundamental issues  about how the information should be collected, stored, and  disseminated\u2014and specifically, about the future of NTIS itself.Specifically, we raised policy questions concerning whether a central  repository was still needed and if so, how it should be structured. In  addition, our report on the Government Printing Office\u2014which prints and  disseminates publications for all three branches of government\u2014  concluded that while electronic dissemination of government publications  provided an attractive alternative to paper, a number of challenges would  need to be overcome if the government were to increase electronic  dissemination. These challenges included ensuring permanence, equitable  access, and authenticity of documents in an electronic environment.", "Statistical Policy. In March 1998, in testimony on a reorganization  proposal involving part of the federal statistical system, we summarized  our past work in this area.

Last July we testified that the management of  electronic records was a substantial challenge facing the government and  the National Archives and Records Administration in implementing the  Government Paperwork Elimination Act and in moving toward e- government. We underscored the need for strong, central leadership to  overcome this challenge.", "Privacy. In September 2000, we reported that most Web sites we reviewed  had posted privacy policies but had not consistently posted policies on  pages we identified as collecting substantial amounts of personal  information.

We pointed out that the  momentum generated by the government\u2019s response to the Year 2000  change should not be lost, and that the lessons learned should be  considered in addressing other pressing challenges. The report further  reemphasized the need for sustained and focused central leadership, and  particularly for a federal chief information officer to provide strong focus  and attention to the full range of IRM and IT issues.", "Information Security. Since 1997, we have designated information  security as a high-risk area because growing evidence indicated that  controls over computerized federal operations were not effective and  related risks were escalating, in part due to increasing reliance on the  Internet.  While many actions have been taken, current activity is not  keeping pace with the growing threat. In recent testimony,  we reported  that our most recent analyses of audit reports published from July 2000  through September 2001, continued to show significant weaknesses at  each of the 24 agencies included in our review. Consequently, critical  operations, assets, and sensitive information gathered from the public and  other sources continued to be vulnerable to disruption, data tampering,  fraud, and inappropriate disclosure. While recognizing that the  administration had taken a number of positive steps to protect critical  public and private information systems, we concluded that the  government still faced a challenge in ensuring that risks from cyber threats  are appropriately addressed in the context of the broader array of risks to  the nation\u2019s welfare. Further, we recommended that the federal  government\u2019s strategy for protecting these systems define (1) specific  roles and responsibilities, (2) objectives, milestones, and an action plan,  and (3) performance measures.", "Over the years, we have made numerous recommendations to both OMB  and the agencies on IRM matters. While actions have been taken to  respond to our recommendations, more needs to be done. Some of the  more significant recommendations involving OIRA that have not yet been  implemented include the following:  In 1996, in reporting on Clinger-Cohen Act implementation, we  recommended that OMB identify the type and amount of skills required for  OMB to execute IT portfolio analyses; determine the degree to which these  needs are currently satisfied; specify the gap; and design and implement a  plan to close the gap. Although OIRA officials said they are examining  their staffing needs, no systematic review has been conducted to date.  In the same 1996 report, we recommended that OMB evaluate information  system project cost, benefit, and risk data when analyzing the results of  agency IT investments. Such analyses should produce agency track  records that clearly and definitively show what improvements in mission  performance have been achieved for the IT dollars expended. Although  OMB has provided anecdotal evidence of expected and actual mission  performance improvements for some major systems projects, it is not  clear that OMB has constructed or plans to construct systematic agency  track records.  In 1998, in a report on OIRA\u2019s implementation of PRA, we recommended  that OMB ensure that its annual performance plan and program reports to  the Congress under the Government Performance and Results Act identify  specific strategies, resources, and performance measures that it will use to  address OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities. OMB has not acted on this  recommendation.  In 2000, in a report on Internet privacy, we recommended that OMB (1)  consider how best to help agencies better ensure that individuals are  provided clear and adequate notice about how their personal information  is treated when they visit federal Web sites, and (2) determine whether  current oversight strategies are adequate. In addition, in reporting on  federal agency use of Internet cookies, we recommended that OMB unify  its guidance on Web site privacy policies and clarify the resulting guidance  to provide comprehensive direction on the use of cookies by federal  agencies on their Web sites. Although OIRA officials said that they plan to  launch a privacy initiative to address these recommendations, no action  has been taken to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Current and emerging challenges\u2014including the events of September 11  and the subsequent anthrax attacks\u2014emphasize the importance of the  integrated approach that IRM embodies and the need for a strategic plan  to guide the government\u2019s management of its increasingly valuable  information resources. However, OIRA has not established an effective  governmentwide strategic IRM plan to accomplish this. Given the  magnitude of the changes that have occurred since the CIO Council plan  was published in October 2000, OIRA has both an obligation and an  opportunity to lead the development of a unified governmentwide plan  that communicates a clear and comprehensive vision for how the government  will use information resources to improve agency performance,  is responsive to the current external environment including the impact of  recent terrorist attacks and other trends,  recognizes the resources including human capital needed to achieve  governmentwide IRM goals, and  reflects consultation with all stakeholders\u2014including the Office of  Homeland Security, entities involved in information security and critical  infrastructure protection, and the officials identified in the act\u2014who are  critical to meeting IRM challenges and the goals the administration has  established in its management agenda.", "The shortcomings we identified in the CIO Council plan call into question  the degree of management attention that OIRA has devoted thus far to  producing the governmentwide plan. Without such a plan, OIRA and the  agencies lack a unifying governmentwide vision for how investments in  and use of information resources will facilitate the current and emerging  agenda of the federal government. Further, the risk is increased that  investments in IT will not be leveraged across the government; that  duplicative initiatives will be undertaken; that opportunities for data  sharing and public access will be missed; that privacy will be  compromised; and that the security of information, information systems,  and critical infrastructure will be jeopardized. Without OIRA leadership,  top-level management commitment, and the application of appropriate  resources to ensure the development of a comprehensive and meaningful  plan, the mounting challenges that the government faces in managing  information may not be met.", "While OIRA has not yet established an effective governmentwide IRM  plan, it has taken action to respond to other PRA policymaking, oversight,  and functional requirements.

In addition, recognizing the new emphasis that  OMB has placed on e-government, it will be important that the  administrator work in conjunction with the associate director for  technology and e-government in developing this plan. In particular, the  following actions should be taken:", "Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act, establish governmentwide  goals for IRM that are linked to improvements in agency and program  performance, identify strategies for achieving the goals that clearly define  the roles of OIRA and agencies, and develop performance measures to  assess progress in using IRM to improve agency and program  performance.", "Assess the external environment and emerging future challenges and  trends, including the recent terrorist attacks, and their impact on the  government\u2019s collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of  information.", "As part of an assessment of the government\u2019s internal environment,  determine the resources, including human capital, needed to meet  governmentwide IRM goals.

He reiterated OMB\u2019s position that the documents  they cited during our review\u2014the CIO Council Strategic Plan, the  information collection budget, the president\u2019s management agenda, and  others\u2014and the president\u2019s budget for 2003, which was released after our  draft report was sent for comment\u2014in total meet the requirements for a  governmentwide strategic IRM plan and provide adequate strategic  direction to agencies. Second, the director expressed concern that the  report does not incorporate the role of the associate director for  information technology and e-government into its findings or analysis.", "The director stated that, in leading implementation of the e-government  strategy outlined in the president\u2019s management agenda, the associate  director provides strategic direction to agencies for many of the functions  in PRA, including information security, privacy, e-government, IT  spending, enterprise architecture, and capital planning, and leads the work  of OIRA and other OMB offices to improve agency performance on these  issues. Lastly, the director stated that the report does not analyze the  impact of OMB\u2019s policies and practices\u2014established in response to the  requirements of PRA and other IRM statutes\u2014on agency performance. He  further stated that such an analysis would demonstrate that the president\u2019s  e-government initiative and other actions are highly effective in carrying  out the purposes of PRA.", "We disagree with the director\u2019s statement that our report narrowly focuses  on the requirement for a strategic plan to be a single document. We  performed a rigorous analysis of the documents cited by OMB during our  review and compared their contents against the requirements of the PRA.  Our primary finding was that these documents do not, separately or  collectively, meet the requirements for a governmentwide plan. As  discussed in our report, we acknowledge the strategic elements of the CIO  Council plan and the president\u2019s management agenda but found that these  documents do not comprehensively cover IRM issues and are missing  other key elements of a strategic IRM plan. The remaining documents  cited by OMB are not strategic or focused on the future, and do not  provide goals, strategies, and performance measures. Further, we think  there is value in crafting a single plan\u2014not only because it is required by  PRA but also because it would provide a vehicle for clearly  communicating an integrated strategic IRM vision to agencies, the  Congress, and the public. However, contrary to what OMB\u2019s letter implies,  we do not believe that OMB must necessarily produce an entirely new  document to accomplish this. OMB has options for building on past  efforts\u2014including the CIO council strategic plan, the president\u2019s  management agenda, and the president\u2019s budget for 2003\u2014to develop a  plan that contains a comprehensive strategic statement of goals and  resources.", "Regarding the budget for 2003\u2014released after our draft report was sent  for comment\u2014this document identifies e-government and IT management  reform as administration priorities. Specifically, it contains (1) a  description of IT management issues including duplicative IT investments  and the failure of IT investments to significantly improve agency  performance, (2) additional information on the administration\u2019s e- government goals and strategies and high-level descriptions of specific e- government initiatives, (3) descriptions of agency progress in developing  capital planning and investment control processes, enterprise  architectures, and business cases for IT projects, and in implementing e- government, and (4) identifies process improvement milestones for  calendar year 2002.", "The budget also contains a scorecard used to grade agency progress in the  five governmentwide initiatives\u2014including e-government\u2014described in  the president\u2019s management agenda. In addition, for major IT investments,  the budget identifies total investments for 2001 through 2003, links each  investment to the agency\u2019s strategic goals, and provides performance goals  and measures for these projects. The budget also contains a discussion on  strengthening federal statistics and identifies four programs supported by  the budget that are intended to address shortcomings in the statistical  infrastructure.", "Our preliminary analysis indicates that this budget contains many of the  elements required in a strategic plan that were not present in previous  documents cited by OMB and, when viewed in conjunction with the  president\u2019s management agenda, represents credible progress toward  developing a governmentwide plan. Specifically, it includes a discussion\u2014  within the context of e-government\u2014of how the government will use  information resources to improve agency performance, and identifies  goals and strategies. It also discusses other required elements, including  (1) enhancing public access to and dissemination of information and (2)  meeting the IT needs of the government, and cites the need to reduce  reporting burden on businesses and share data among federal agencies.  Further, it provides the status of agency-by-agency progress in establishing  IT management processes and implementing e-government and the  scorecard provides a means of measuring agency progress. The discussion  also links improving information sharing among levels of government to  providing for homeland security.", "However, some of the areas that the budget does not appear to address  include (1) the role of OIRA and the CIO Council in implementing the  government\u2019s strategies, (2) an assessment of the long-term resources  (beyond fiscal year 2003)\u2014including human capital\u2014needed to meet the  goals, and (3) how key stakeholders were involved in developing these  plans. Nevertheless, based on a preliminary review of this document, it  appears to address, in part, the recommendations in this report. We intend  to follow up on this and other documents that OMB has indicated are  forthcoming to determine the extent to which our recommendations are  fully addressed.", "We acknowledge the role that OMB has given to the associate director to  provide strategic direction to agencies and we support additional efforts to  focus attention on IRM matters, especially given the magnitude of the  government\u2019s challenges. However, we believe that a governmentwide  strategic IRM plan is nonetheless needed to communicate an integrated  IRM vision to the Congress and other key stakeholders, as well as federal  agencies. As a result, we have modified our recommendations to recognize  the importance of the administrator\u2019s working in conjunction with the  associate director to articulate a comprehensive IRM vision and develop a  governmentwide plan that meets PRA requirements.", "Finally, we acknowledge that we did not assess the impact of OIRA\u2019s  policymaking and oversight efforts\u2014performed in response to the  requirements of the PRA and other IRM legislation\u2014on agency  performance. However, our past work, referenced in this report, provides  ample evidence of agency performance problems in such areas as IT  management, security, privacy, and data sharing and confirms that OMB  faces significant and continuing challenges in these area. Further, as  discussed in our report, our past work led to our identifying information  security as a governmentwide high-risk area and IT management as a  major management challenge. In fact, OMB identifies some of these same  performance problems in its budget for 2003 and in its related assessments  of agency progress in expanding e-government. In addition, we note that  the president\u2019s e-government initiative is clearly in its early stages; any  efforts to evaluate its impact on agency performance at this time would be  premature.", "The deputy administrator, OIRA, and other officials also separately  provided oral technical comments, which we have incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  date of this letter.
