Since the mid-1980s, PBGC has had contracts covering a wide range of services, including the administration of terminated plans, payment of benefits, customer communication, legal assistance, document management, and information technology. PBGC's workforce currently consists of about 800 federal employees and utilizes the services of about 1,500 contract employees. From fiscal year 2000 through 2007, PBGC's contract spending increased steadily along with its overall budget and workload, and its use of contract employees has outpaced its hiring of federal employees. As its workloads have grown due to a significant number of large pension plan terminations, PBGC has relied on contractors to supplement its workforce, acknowledging that it has difficulty anticipating its workloads due to unpredictable economic conditions. PBGC is taking steps to improve its acquisition infrastructure, but the Procurement Department is not yet part of PBGC's strategic decision-making process. In 2007, PBGC began to take steps to realign its Procurement Department, update contracting policies and processes, upgrade the skills of Procurement Department staff, and better track contracting data. PBGC's efforts begin to provide an improved foundation for the contracting function; however, these efforts are early steps and more remains to be done. PBGC has not fully integrated its contracting function at the corporate level; the Procurement Department is not included in corporate-level strategic planning and does not have a presence on PBGC's relevant strategic teams. PBGC has made improvements to contractor oversight and has begun to implement performance-based contracting that offers the potential for better contract outcomes, but also creates new challenges for contract oversight and monitoring efforts. PBGC has implemented new contract monitoring activities, improved oversight activities for some of its major contracts, and developed comprehensive procedures to direct contracting activities. For its field benefit administration office contracts, PBGC developed performance measures and scorecards, providing feedback about contractor performance in terms of timeliness and accuracy of benefit payments. Despite these improvements, most of PBGC's current contracts still lack performance incentives and methods to hold contractors accountable. PBGC recently began awarding more performance-based contracts, as a means to achieve better outcomes. Although performance-based contracting is recognized as a viable way toward getting better results from contractors, GAO and others have identified common challenges agencies face when implementing this approach--from deciding which contracts are appropriate for a performance-based approach to deciding which outcomes to measure and emphasize. PBGC procurement officials recognize the benefits and challenges of performance-based contracting, and that they must provide additional oversight of contracts and a different approach to contract monitoring that focuses on outcomes rather than processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures pensions for  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures pensions for  more than 44 million workers in over 30,000 employer-sponsored defined  more than 44 million workers in over 30,000 employer-sponsored defined  benefit plans\u2014private sector pension plans where an employer guarantees  benefit plans\u2014private sector pension plans where an employer guarantees  a benefit.

PBGC also  has drafted a strategic human capital plan that acknowledges the need for  contract support, but does not provide detailed plans for how the contract  support will be obtained.", "As stated earlier, NAPA provided a six-step model for PBGC to follow for  its strategic human capital planning. In response, PBGC convened a  workforce planning team that implemented some of NAPA\u2019s suggested  steps. Although the workforce planning team acknowledged the  importance of contract staff for meeting PBGC\u2019s unpredictable workloads,  the team\u2019s analysis of PBGC\u2019s future workforce focused almost entirely on  PBGC\u2019s federal employees and not its contractor workforce. The team  recognized PBGC\u2019s need for improvement in the area of contracting, such  as better defining where to use contractors versus federal employees,  structuring the work to ensure that federal staff retain core competencies,  and developing stronger COTR and contract monitoring competencies.  While the team\u2019s 2002 report included an analysis of the current  competencies of PBGC\u2019s federal workforce and PBGC\u2019s future needs, it  did not similarly analyze the contractor workforce, which, at the time,  made up almost half of PBGC\u2019s total workforce and now makes up almost  two-thirds. The report did not address how the contractor workforce  should change to meet future needs or how contractors should be utilized.  Although the report included a discussion of recruitment and hiring  strategies, it did not include an analysis of strategies for adding to or  subtracting from the contractor workforce in case of increased or  decreased workloads.", "Further, PBGC does not use its strategic annual performance plans to  document how the acquisition function supports the agency\u2019s missions  and goals. It is not clear how acquisition serves PBGC\u2019s mission, because  metrics are not linked to PBGC\u2019s overall performance plan. While the  procurement director has developed some metrics to measure the  Procurement Department\u2019s workload, PBGC\u2019s strategic plan only has one  broad metric related to measuring call center customer or participant  satisfaction, but there is no specific metric that enumerates the level of  customer service to be reached. Additionally, the strategic plan only has  one broad metric related to performance-based contracting, but there are  no specific metrics that relate to acquisition efficiency, effectiveness, and  results, such as measures to track the number of contracts awarded that  include incentives for performance. Performance measurements can be  used to gain insight into the Procurement Department\u2019s current  performance level and performance over time and set realistic goals for  improvements to the acquisition process.", "Finally, PBGC has taken some limited steps toward making more strategic  contracting decisions in certain specific areas. These steps generally were  taken in reaction to concerns raised about existing contracts in an internal  report and reports by us and the Office of the Inspector General. For  example, the Inspector General and PBGC each studied the contracts for  the field benefit administration offices and concluded that there were  opportunities to increase efficiency and decrease costs. As a result, PBGC  is recompeting the contracts in an effort to consolidate the number of field  benefit administration offices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PBGC Has Made Improvements to Contractor Oversight, but Implementation of Performance-Based Contracting May Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["PBGC has made improvements to contractor oversight by implementing  new contract monitoring activities, improving oversight activities for some  of its major contracts, and developing comprehensive procedures to direct  contracting activities.

PBGC recently began awarding more performance-based contracts, as a  means to achieve better contract outcomes, but there are common  challenges that arise\u2014from deciding which contracts are appropriate for a  performance-based approach to deciding which outcomes to measure and  emphasize. PBGC procurement officials acknowledge the benefits and  challenges of performance-based contracting, and must provide additional  oversight of contracts and a different approach to contract monitoring that  focuses on outcomes rather than processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PBGC Has Made Some Improvements to Contractor Oversight", "paragraphs": ["PBGC has improved upon existing contract monitoring activities and  implemented new activities to strengthen contract oversight. In our 2000  report, we recommended that PBGC develop the capacity to centrally  monitor field benefit administration office contractor performance  including product quality and timeliness. In response, PBGC shifted the  responsibility for contract oversight of Benefits Administration and  Payment Department (BAPD) contracts to its Management Coordination  Unit (MCU), to consolidate its monitoring of field benefit administration  office performance. The MCU uses several different methods to monitor  contracts.", "The MCU reviews the 10 field benefit administration office contractors  annually to assess the accuracy of benefit determination letters and the  security procedures in place and trains analysts in contract oversight to  conduct field benefit administration office reviews. Following each  review, the office receives a report that highlights findings and requires a  corrective action plan to address deficiencies.", "The MCU conducts quarterly COTR visits to the field benefit  administration offices. During these visits, COTRs conduct interviews with  key office staff and review the office\u2019s workplans and records. The MCU  developed the COTR site visit program and a corresponding standard  protocol to be used in conducting site visits. PBGC officials told us that,  due to COTR work activities, not all site visits are being conducted as  anticipated; only one to two are being conducted per office each year.", "The MCU conducts monthly compliance and data integrity reviews of field  benefit administration case processing activities. Results of these reviews  are compiled into a scorecard that is reported quarterly to the office and  the COTR. The scorecard measures BAPD processing goals for timeliness  and quality. Noncompliant items are communicated to the offices monthly  for resolution. Field benefit administration office contractors receive  feedback on the timeliness and accuracy of benefit payments based on the  MCU\u2019s monitoring efforts.", "To improve contract oversight, the Procurement Department also has  implemented refresher training requirements for COTRs. PBGC provides  guidance and training to COTRs regarding their duties and to ensure their  compliance with Procurement Department policy, federal law, regulations  and guidance, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation. PBGC is  planning to comply with a November 2007, OMB Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) memorandum for training directed mainly at  COTRs. The memorandum establishes a structured training program for  COTRs and calls for standardization of competencies and training across  civilian agencies. The mandate requires a minimum of 40 hours of training  to be certified as a COTR. According to the requirements, new COTRs  must be certified within 6 months of appointment and existing COTRs  within a year. The Procurement Department will ensure that all COTRs  have evidence of their certification, as required by the memorandum.", "PBGC recently improved its procedural guidance. In 2000, we found that  PBGC lacked such guidance on contract oversight and a central location  for guidance and procurement policies on contract oversight. Our report  noted that due to the absence of specific procedures, staff spent  significant time seeking guidance on issues, may have received conflicting  directions, and contributed to inconsistent administration practices.  Procurement Department officials recently completed a comprehensive  procedural guidance manual for staff responsible for awarding contracts  and monitoring contractor performance. According to Procurement  Department officials, the new manual should eliminate the ad-hoc  directives, e-mail, and stand-alone memorandums previously used to  address concerns. The Procurement Department\u2019s new procedures manual  provides uniform procedures for the internal operation of acquiring  supplies and services within PBGC. The document represents a central  repository for guidance and policies. The manual has been prepared in an  electronic format, and includes relevant Internet links wherever external  references are made, such as to OMB Circulars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Move toward Performance-Based Contracting Can Add Accountability but May Present Challenges During Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Performance-based contracting offers the government the potential for  achieving better contract outcomes by requiring that all aspects of an  acquisition be structured around the purpose of the work as opposed to  the manner in which the work is to be performed. Contracts should  include descriptions of the outcomes the agency is looking for rather than  descriptions of how services should be performed, measurable  performance standards, quality assurance plans that describe how the  contractor\u2019s performance will be evaluated, and positive and negative  incentives, when appropriate.  However, our work has shown that the  transition to and use of performance-based contracts has proven a  challenge for government agencies deeply rooted in traditional methods of  contracting.", "PBGC agreed with our 2000 recommendation that it utilize contracts and  payment arrangements consistent with best practices in performance- based contracting. In 2001, OFPP directed government agencies to award  contracts using performance-based techniques for at least 20 percent of  service contracting dollars greater than $25,000 by fiscal year 2002. In  2003, OFPP recommended that executive agencies apply performance- based techniques to at least 40 percent of service contracting dollars  greater than $25,000 by 2005. PBGC began altering its acquisition strategy  to be in line with the government-wide move toward performance-based  contracting in 2003. However, PBGC to date has awarded less than $150  million in service contract dollars in fiscal year 2008 and remains short of  OFPP\u2019s performance-based contracting goals. According to PBGC  officials, only six of its contracts currently are performance based,  representing a yearly cost of approximately $30 million for  communication, administrative, and critical function services. PBGC is in  the process of awarding an additional $20 million in performance-based  contracts for the administration of the field benefit administration offices.  Prior to the solicitation, these offices were contracted using individual  labor-hour contracts.", "According to PBGC officials, most of PBGC\u2019s current contracts lack the  methods to hold contractors accountable for their performance. One  PBGC official said existing contracts neither include the incentives needed  to encourage contractors to achieve desired results, nor do they include  performance measures and targets. Instead, PBGC staff work directly with  the contractor to communicate necessary targets. In the event that  deliverables do not match contract descriptions or there is a problem with  contractor performance, PBGC will work with the contractor to correct  that problem. By not incorporating performance targets and other  measures, PBGC depends on contractors who have limited incentive to  provide optimal service. PBGC has the option not to renew a contract with  a poorly performing contractor, but officials acknowledge the  disadvantage it faces by not providing performance incentives to help hold  contractors accountable. PBGC also has attempted to motivate  contractors by considering assessments of the contractor\u2019s customer  service as a part of future contract renewal and is planning to incorporate  customer service measures into its contracts through the use of the  American Customer Service Index. However, the index is not completely  effective as an incentive mechanism because it does not report results for  individual contractors and instead reports on contracts collectively.", "While it is important that PBGC incorporate strong performance  incentives into its contracts, the transition to and use of performance- based contracts has proven a challenge for agencies deeply-rooted in  traditional methods of contracting. In a 2002 report, we highlighted  challenges faced by agencies during their transition to performance-based  contracting. These challenges included the lack of understanding of  performance-based contracting, lack of specific agency guidance, and  inadequate oversight of contracts with performance-based methods. In  addition, while PBGC has increased the amount of training provided to  COTRs and others, the transition to performance-based contracting will  require additional training, specific to the new contracting method. In 1998  guidance, OFPP called attention to the problems agencies face in  converting from a traditional contract\u2019s statement of work to a  performance-based work statement. Agencies reported to OFPP that  performance work statements required an increased initial investment of  time and resources. However, according to the OFPP guidance, the  savings expected by performance-based contracting will offset such costs  and correct problems commonly associated with service contracts\u2014cost  overruns, schedule delays, and technical challenges.", "Our prior work, and the work of others, also explains that both agencies  and contractors typically find it difficult to move away from traditional  contracting methods to a method of linking payments to performance,  based on specific requirements that describe results and measurable  standards of performance. Our prior work concluded that additional  government guidance on performance-based contracting was needed to  ensure its proper and effective use. PBGC officials recognize that PBGC  may face challenges similar to those faced by other government agencies  during implementation of performance-based contracting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With three-quarters of its operational budget currently being spent on  contracting, it is clear that acquisition plays a central role in achieving  PBGC\u2019s strategic goals. While PBGC has made efforts to improve its  acquisition infrastructure, it has not developed a strategic approach to its  contracting process as envisioned in our 2000 report. In its role as a  support function, rather than a business partner, PBGC\u2019s Procurement  Department is not involved in helping PBGC make strategic decisions  about contracting early in the process or in developing long-term strategic  approaches. PBGC developed its most recent strategic plan and strategic  human capital plan, the latter still in draft, without a thorough examination  of the role contracting plays at PBGC. By assessing the existing  organizational alignment of the Procurement Department against a  framework of best practices, PBGC may find that its Procurement  Department is unable to effectively identify, analyze, prioritize, and  coordinate agency-wide acquisition needs. Further, PBGC\u2019s workload  depends on future economic conditions that are difficult to predict.  Without a strategic acquisition approach, PBGC risks being unprepared for  future workload changes and cannot be assured that it has the optimal mix  of contractor staff and federal employees.", "Since our last report, PBGC also has made meaningful improvements to its  contract oversight. To continue contracting improvements, PBGC\u2019s focus  on performance-based contracting is growing\u2014providing additional tools  to hold contractors accountable for performance and to encourage the  achievement of desired outcomes. However, this contracting method  requires a new approach to contract oversight and has demonstrated the  need for comprehensive training and organizational culture changes.  PBGC will likely face challenges similar to those we have seen faced by  other agencies that have moved toward performance-based contracting.
