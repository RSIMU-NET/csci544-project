For example, because the information is not currently readily available, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed the 49 agencies that were required to submit inventories to defer the collection of three statutorily required data elements for each contract--the role the services played in achieving agency objectives, the total dollar amount invoiced for services under the contracts, and the number and work locations of contractor and subcontractor personnel. Progress, however, is being made to collect this information for future inventories. OMB directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after March 1, 2012. A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation rule was published in April 2011 to start collecting the remaining two data elements directly from contractors. We also found several instances where agencies significantly underreported obligations in their inventories, either because they misinterpreted or did not follow OMB guidance. For example, the General Services Administration underreported obligations by approximately $6.4 billion. Without complete and accurate service contract inventories, OMB and Congress cannot meaningfully compare service contract obligations among agencies, or develop spending trends for agencies, thus limiting the overall utility of the inventories.", "Nine of the 49 civilian agencies did not submit a report on their fiscal year 2010 inventory review to OMB, as required. Of the 40 agencies that submitted reports on their inventory reviews, 5 agencies identified 3 contracts where contractors could be performing inherently governmental functions and 104 instances where contractors were performing closely associated with inherently governmental functions. It is unclear, however, based on the 40 agency reports, whether these results were a real indication of the agencies' effective and appropriate use of contractors or due to the different approaches agencies used to conduct the reviews. Agencies did not include important context in their reports, such as the number of contracts or the percentage of their inventories reviewed. Of the 25 agencies that reported the number of contracts they reviewed, most reviewed 50 or fewer contracts.

Determining whether services should be performed by federal employees,  contractor personnel, or a mixture of each is an important economic and  strategic decision essential to the federal government\u2019s effective and  efficient use of taxpayers\u2019 dollars.

In some cases, contractors may be performing services that are  considered to be \u201cclosely associated with inherently governmental\u201d  functions, such as services to support policy makers or procurement  officials.

In addition, the act requires that  after reviewing the annual inventory, each agency must report to OMB on  the actions taken to consider and convert functions from contractor to  federal employee performance.

OMB issued the guidance in November 2010. We  previously reported on differences between the act and OMB guidance.  For example, although the act did not set a minimum dollar threshold for  the contracts included in the inventories, OMB directed agencies to report  only on contract actions over $25,000. Additionally, OMB directed  agencies to only report the data elements included in FPDS-NG. As a  result, agencies did not report three data elements required by the statute  in their fiscal year 2010 inventories\u2014(1) the role the services played in  achieving agency objectives, (2) the total dollar amount invoiced for  services under the contract, and (3) the number and work location of  contractor and subcontractor personnel.

While this information may be helpful in identifying which  service contracts may require additional oversight or be appropriate  candidates for insourcing, it is not clear that this information will provide a  full description of the role contractors played in achieving agency  objectives.

OMB staff told us that they intended for civilian agencies to include all  changes in obligations over $25,000 occurring in fiscal year 2011,  regardless of when the contract award occurred. The fifth agency\u2014 GSA\u2014did not follow OMB\u2019s guidance to include all contract actions  over $25,000 awarded in fiscal year 2011.

In  response to these findings, GSA officials noted that they are in the  process of creating a new report with the correct information, which  will be submitted to OMB. We used GSA as an example in figure 1 to  illustrate the potential differences in obligations that would be reported  based on the three different methodologies we identified.

OMB staff stated that  differences in agency methodologies were not readily apparent when they  initially reviewed the inventories because data is organized differently  than how it would otherwise appear in FPDS-NG.

For  example, the DHS cross-functional teams included representatives  from acquisition, budget and finance, general counsel, and human  resources at both the department and component levels. DHS officials  stated that the department-level team is equipped to resolve issues  involving costly or high-visibility contracts and has enabled DHS to  determine if workforce balance issues were widespread or only  affected certain components. HHS also used cross-functional teams,  which allowed the agency to identify and expeditiously resolve  workforce imbalance issues. For instance, HHS identified two  functions in the areas of acquisition assistance and human resource  classification specialists that the agency felt were more appropriately  suited for execution by federal employees.

For example, NASA incorporated the findings of an ongoing  information technology program and a workforce pilot into their  service contract inventory review. NASA reported it selected the  workforce pilot because portions of the work being studied were  perceived to be either critical or inherently governmental functions.  Further, leveraging knowledge gained from the information technology  program allowed NASA to include several high visibility information  technology acquisitions in their reviews without having to  independently review all the contracts associated with them.", "DHS relied on its existing Balanced Workforce Strategy to conduct the  required inventory reviews and used its standardized Balanced  Workforce Strategy Tool to review 212 service contracts. The tool is  an automated decision support survey that enables components to  categorize work as inherently governmental, personal services,  closely associated with an inherently governmental function, or a  critical function. The tool is also intended to facilitate an assessment  of mission risk, level of contractor oversight needed, mitigation  strategies, and cost analysis. Based on component responses, the  tool is to provide a recommended sourcing decision on whether the  work is appropriate for federal or contractor performance, or both.", "Obtaining Management Support: Officials at four of the five  agencies we reviewed had significant and visible management  support and involvement, which helped facilitate inventory review  efforts and department-level decision making. For example, the  Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources at HHS, who also serves  as the agency\u2019s Chief Acquisition Officer, issued a memorandum to  division heads outlining the requirements of the inventory review  process. According to HHS\u2019 senior procurement executive, this helped  ensure participation from all divisions, and the agency was able to  address redundancies and duplications from an enterprisewide  perspective because of management involvement in the review. In  contrast, GSA officials stated that management was kept up to date  on, but did not actively participate in, the effort. Additionally, the GSA  official responsible for overseeing the inventory review said that, to his  knowledge, the inventory had not been used for any department-level  decision making.", "Strategic Sourcing: Some agencies reported that they used the  inventories to identify redundancies and duplications, which led to  strategic sourcing decisions. For example, HHS officials stated that  the agency used its inventory to obtain visibility into redundant  contracts across the department. As a result, it consolidated               15 service contracts into 4 contracts, resulting in an estimated savings  of $20 million. DOT reported that it concentrated its analysis efforts on  management support services contracts to identify ways to reduce  spending in these areas by 15 percent by the end of fiscal year 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 required agencies to collect  information and compile an inventory of their service contracts and review  the inventories to help agency officials determine, among other things,  whether they have the right balance of contractor and in-house resources  needed to accomplish their missions. If the service contract inventories  are to be a valuable management tool, it is essential that civilian  agencies\u2019 inventories contain comprehensive, accurate, and actionable  data. OMB plays an important role in ensuring that agencies are meeting  statutory requirements and providing useful information. OMB efforts to  date have been focused on issuing guidance to agencies on how to  compile, review, and report on their service contract inventories.  However, civilian agency efforts are in the early stages and agencies  have not been able to meet all the requirements for compiling and  reviewing the service contract inventories. In some cases this is due to  the fact that some of the statutorily required data elements to be  contained in the inventories are not available. Under the proposed FAR  rule, if finalized, agencies would start collecting unavailable, but required  data elements directly from contractors. In other cases, agencies  misinterpreted or did not follow OMB\u2019s guidance, which caused them to  significantly underestimate the scope of their inventories.", "Although most agencies followed OMB guidance for reporting on their  inventory reviews, it is unclear based on the information provided in their  reports whether the results of the reviews were a real indication of the  agencies\u2019 effective and appropriate use of contractors or due to the  different approaches used to conduct the inventory reviews. When  workforce issues were identified, such as contractors performing  potentially inherently governmental functions, agencies did not  consistently report on the number of contractor personnel and functions  involved. Further, three of the five agencies that we reviewed identified  workforce issues and took corrective action. However, the agencies did  not report if the issues had been fully resolved. Agencies were not  required to report on either the number of contracts or the percentage of  their inventories they reviewed. As a result, many of the reports did not  have important context on the scope of the analyses performed. Without  OMB\u2019s continued guidance and agency commitment to improve the  compliance, consistency, and context for the inventory and inventory  reviews, the utility of the inventories for agency decision making and OMB  and congressional oversight will be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve civilian agency compliance for compiling, reviewing, and  reporting on inventories, we recommend that the Administrator of OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy work with agencies to improve how  compliance with statutory and OMB requirements is monitored, which  might include agencies designating accountable officials to ensure  appropriate internal management attention and responsiveness.", "To help ensure that the service contract inventories contain consistent  and reliable information and that the service contract inventory analysis  reports have sufficient information to provide greater context and value,  we recommend that the Administrator of OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Procurement Policy clarify guidance to:", "Require agencies to fully describe in their inventory review reports the  scope of the inventory reviews, including information such as the  number of contracts and the percentage of contracts reviewed for  each product and service code selected and the total universe of  contracts;", "Require agencies to consistently report on the number of contractor  personnel and functions that were involved with the workforce issues  identified during their inventory reviews; and", "Require agencies to include, as part of their inventory review reports,  the status of agency efforts to resolve findings identified in previous  reviews until they are resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from DHS, DOT, HHS,  GSA, NASA, and OMB.

OMB stated that OFPP is a policy- making organization, not an enforcement agency, and greater progress  can be achieved if OFPP works collaboratively with agencies by  continually refining the guidance to make it a more useful management  tool and ensuring agencies are doing effective self-governance, such as  with the help of an accountable official that can liaison with OFPP to  ensure appropriate management attention is being given to this initiative.

To satisfy the mandate, we  assessed civilian agencies\u2019 efforts to (1) compile their fiscal year 2011  inventories and (2) review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories.", "To assess civilian agencies\u2019 efforts to compile their fiscal year 2011  inventories, we reviewed the act and OMB guidance to determine what  data elements were required to be included in the service contract  inventories. In addition, we obtained and reviewed available civilian  agency inventories to determine whether they contained data elements  required by OMB guidance. We also reviewed the proposed Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rule on service contract inventories and  interviewed staff from OMB to determine the status of efforts to collect all  required inventory data elements. In addition, we used OMB guidance  and conducted a logic check for five selected agencies\u2014the Department  of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security,  the Department of Transportation, the General Services Administration,  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2014to ensure that  the obligations reported by these agencies were close to our own analysis  of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  data. These agencies were selected because they represent  approximately 42 percent of total fiscal year 2011 service contract  obligations for civilian agencies. In addition, they are also among the  agencies with the largest obligations for the special interest functions  identified by OMB for heightened management consideration because  they present an increased risk of losing control of mission and operations.", "During our logic check, we identified differences between obligations the  agencies reported in their inventories and what we obtained by applying  OMB guidance. To determine if these differences were more widespread,  we expanded our logic check to all available agency inventories. To  determine possible reasons for these differences, we pulled data from  FPDS-NG by funding agency using eight different methodologies for fiscal  year 2011\u2014all obligations for service contract actions; obligations for  service contract actions over $25,000; obligations for new awards;  obligations for new awards over $25,000; all obligations for special  interest product and service code contract actions; obligations for special  interest product and service code contract actions over $25,000;  obligations for new awards on special interest product and service code  contract actions; and all obligations for new awards on special interest  product and service code contract actions over $25,000. After our initial  comparison, we determined that the difference between the obligations in  all categories and those above $25,000 was small. In addition, we  determined that only one agency had reported its inventory using the  special interest function methodology. Therefore, we reported only three  main methodologies\u2014all obligations, new awards, and special interest  functions. While our prior work identified data reliability issues with FPDS- NG, for the purposes of this report, we found FPDS-NG data to be  sufficiently reliable for determining how agencies compiled their  inventories. We also identified agencies with missing elements to  determine what data elements were missing from their inventories.", "To assess the result of agencies\u2019 efforts to review and report on their  fiscal year 2010 inventories, we reviewed civilian agencies\u2019 reports on the  fiscal year 2010 inventory review submitted to OMB to determine the  number of contracts that were analyzed, the methodologies used, and the  workforce issues identified. While we reported the workforce issues  identified, we did not independently assess whether the functions the  civilian agencies identified were in fact inherently governmental or closely  associated with inherently governmental functions. In addition, for the five  selected agencies, we interviewed officials to identify the resources used  and methodologies they applied to conduct the reviews, as well as  challenges they encountered, lessons learned, and practices they  identified that can be applied to future reviews. We also met with agency  officials to determine the extent to which agencies have used their  reviews for decision making, including workforce planning and strategic  sourcing efforts, and to determine how agencies identified instances in  which contractors were performing inherently governmental functions or  functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "We conducted this performance audit between April 2012 and September  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
