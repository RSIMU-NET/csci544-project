In particular, HHS has acknowledged Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service's (CMS) oversight of suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) is inadequate to prevent fraud and abuse. Specifically, weaknesses in the DMEPOS enrollment and inspection process have allowed sham companies to fraudulently bill Medicare for unnecessary or nonexistent supplies. From April 2006 through March 2007, CMS estimated that Medicare improperly paid $1 billion for DMEPOS supplies--in part due to fraud by suppliers. Due to the committee's concern about vulnerabilities in the enrollment process, GAO used publicly available guidance to attempt to create DMEPOS suppliers, obtain Medicare billing numbers, and complete electronic test billing. GAO also reported on closed cases provided by the HHS Inspector General (IG) to illustrate the techniques used by criminals to fraudulently bill Medicare. On June 18, 2008, we briefed CMS representatives on the results of our investigation. In response, they acknowledged that our covert tests illustrate gaps in oversight that still require improvement and stated that they would continue to work to strengthen the entire DMEPOS enrollment process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Investigators easily set up two fictitious DMEPOS companies using undercover names and bank accounts. GAO's fictitious companies were approved for Medicare billing privileges despite having no clients and no inventory. CMS initially denied GAO's applications in part because of this lack of inventory, but undercover GAO investigators fabricated contracts with nonexistent wholesale suppliers to convince CMS and its contractor, the National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC), that the companies had access to DMEPOS items. The contact number GAO gave for these phony contracts rang on an unmanned undercover telephone in the GAO building. When NSC left a message looking for further information related to the contracts, a GAO investigator left a vague message in return pretending to be the wholesale supplier. As a result of such simple methods of deception, both fictitious DMEPOS companies obtained Medicare billing numbers. After requesting an electronic billing enrollment package and obtaining passwords from CMS, GAO investigators were then able to successfully complete Medicare's test billing process for the Virginia office. GAO could not complete test billing for the Maryland office because CMS has not sent the necessary passwords. However, if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies, they would have been clear to bill Medicare from the Virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies. Once criminals have similarly created fictitious DMEPOS companies, they typically steal or illegally buy Medicare beneficiary numbers and physician identification numbers and use them to repeatedly submit claims. In one case from HHS IG, a company received $2.2 million in payments from Medicare for supplies and services that were never delivered. The owner submitted these fraudulent claims from March 2006 through July 2006 using real beneficiary numbers and physician identification numbers that he had purchased illegally. The only employee not involved in the scheme was a secretary, who told HHS IG that there was no business activity in the office and that the owner was rarely there. Another case related to an individual who stole beneficiary numbers and physician identification numbers and submitted $5.5 million in claims for three fraudulent offices from October 2006 through March 2007. He operated one of these offices out of a utility closet containing buckets of sand mix, road tar, and a large wrench, but no medical files, office equipment, or telephone."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), helps  pay for a variety of health care services and items on behalf of almost 42  million elderly and certain disabled beneficiaries. According to HHS,  schemes to defraud the Medicare program have grown more elaborate in  recent years, resulting in the misuse of taxpayer dollars and the  misdirection of funds intended to help beneficiaries. In particular, HHS  has acknowledged that there are significant vulnerabilities in CMS\u2019s  oversight of suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics,  orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS). Specifically, weaknesses in the  DMEPOS enrollment and inspection process have allowed sham  companies to fraudulently bill Medicare for unnecessary or nonexistent  supplies. For example, in December 2006, the HHS Inspector General (IG)  randomly visited 1,581 DMEPOS suppliers in South Florida and found that  almost one-third of them did not even have an office at the business  address they provided Medicare, although they had collectively submitted  claims for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of supplies. In part due to  fraud by suppliers, CMS estimated that, from April 2006 through March  2007, $1 billion of the $10 billion in payments Medicare made for DMEPOS  supplies were improper.", "To prevent fraudulent DMEPOS suppliers from entering the Medicare  program, CMS developed 25 standards that suppliers must meet to be  authorized to bill Medicare for health care services and items that they  provide to beneficiaries. These standards are intended to help ensure that  suppliers are legitimate businesses and properly licensed within the states  they operate. CMS contracts with the National Supplier Clearinghouse  (NSC) to screen potential suppliers and enroll into the Medicare program  only those that comply with all 25 standards. NSC and its contractors are  required to verify suppliers\u2019 compliance through on-site inspections and  conduct other reviews, such as confirming that the supplier either has  access to its own DMEPOS inventory or has a contract with a wholesaler.  Once a DMEPOS supplier successfully completes this verification process,  CMS sends the supplier an approval letter containing a Medicare billing  number. To be able to submit claims to Medicare electronically, DMEPOS  suppliers that opt to do their own billing also have to complete Medicare\u2019s  test billing process using their billing number, Medicare beneficiary  numbers, and ordering physician identification numbers.", "In 2005, we reported that NSC\u2019s efforts to verify compliance with the  standards were insufficient because of weaknesses in procedures for  checking state licensure and conducting on-site inspections. As a result,  CMS agreed to take a number of actions to strengthen NSC\u2019s verification  procedures, including requiring NSC to conduct site inspections of  DMEPOS suppliers\u2019 off-site inventory storage locations and of the  wholesaler businesses that provide them with inventory through  contracts. Despite these reported actions, you continue to be concerned  that vulnerabilities in the DMEPOS enrollment process allow fraudulent  suppliers to enroll in and ultimately bill Medicare. Therefore, we agreed to  test CMS\u2019s processes by attempting to create fictitious DMEPOS suppliers,  obtain Medicare billing numbers, and successfully complete electronic test  billing. We also agreed to develop case studies to illustrate the techniques  used by criminals in recent years to fraudulently bill Medicare for  DMEPOS supplies.", "To complete our testing, we used publicly available guidance and software  to open two DMEPOS suppliers. Because CMS has divided the country  into four regions\u2014or zones\u2014we set up one company in Maryland (Zone  A) and one in Virginia (Zone C) so that we could determine whether the  contractors conducting the Medicare application review, including visits to  the companies, followed consistent review steps in each zone. To appear  legitimate, we also created a series of phony documents and company  policies. We then submitted applications to CMS to obtain a Medicare  billing number. To complete the test billing process, we used undercover,  fictitious Medicare beneficiaries, as well as physician identification  numbers that we found on the Internet. It is important to note that we only  used this information to complete test billing; we did not compromise the  provider status of any legitimate physicians or the status of actual  beneficiaries by submitting actual claims using their identification  information. To demonstrate how criminals use similar techniques, we  worked with the HHS IG to identify recently closed DMEPOS supplier  fraud cases. We performed our undercover operation from February 2007  through June 2008 in accordance with guidelines established by the  President\u2019s Council for Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s 25 supplier standards were introduced to deter individuals  intent on committing fraud from entering the program and to safeguard  Medicare beneficiaries by ensuring that suppliers were qualified. The 25  standards apply to a variety of business practices and establish certain  requirements and prohibitions (see app. I for a list of the standards). For  example, the standards require suppliers to have a physical facility on an  appropriate site that is accessible to beneficiaries and to CMS, with stated  business hours clearly posted. The following are the most pertinent  standards for the purposes of this report:    Standard 1: Operate business and furnish Medicare-covered items in  compliance with all applicable federal and state licensure and  regulatory requirements.", "Standard 4: Fill orders for equipment or supplies using its own  inventory or by contracting with other companies. If the supplier  contracts with other companies, it must provide copies of the contracts  upon request.", "Standard 7: Maintain a physical facility that contains space for storing  business records including the supplier\u2019s delivery, maintenance, and  beneficiary communication records.", "Standard 8: Permit CMS to conduct on-site inspections. In addition,  the supplier\u2019s location must be accessible during reasonable business  hours to beneficiaries and to CMS, and must maintain a visible sign and  posted hours of operation.", "Standard 9: Maintain a primary business telephone listed under the  name of the business locally or toll-free for beneficiaries.", "Standard 10: Have a comprehensive liability insurance policy in the  amount of at least $300,000 that covers both the supplier\u2019s place of  business and all customers and employees of the supplier. Failure to  maintain required insurance at all times will result in revocation of the  supplier\u2019s billing privileges retroactive to the date the insurance lapsed.", "Standard 14: Must maintain and replace at no charge or repair  directly, or through a service contract with another company,  Medicare-covered items it has rented to beneficiaries. The item must  function as required and intended after being repaired or replaced.", "NSC verifies compliance with the 25 standards, primarily during  enrollment and reenrollment, through on-site inspections conducted by  subcontractors, and desk reviews conducted by NSC analysts. NSC  requires that site inspectors arrive unannounced for any inspection.  Before the inspection, NSC provides the inspectors with briefing  information on the supplier, including information on whether the supplier  is enrolling or reenrolling and the type of state licenses to verify. While on  site, inspectors are expected to take photographs of the supplier\u2019s sign  with its business name, posted hours of operation, complete inventory in  stock, and facility. NSC also expects site inspectors to obtain copies of  relevant documents, such as state licenses, comprehensive liability  insurance policies, contracts with companies for inventory, and contracts  for the service and maintenance of DMEPOS supplies. NSC analysts are  expected to check that the supplier has all the state licenses that it would  need to provide the items it disclosed in its application. The NSC analyst is  also expected to contact the insurance underwriter to ensure that the  supplier\u2019s policy is valid and the post office to make sure the supplier\u2019s  address is listed. NSC also has a procedure to match data from its supplier  database with computerized lists maintained by the federal government to  ensure that supply company owners are not prohibited from participating  in federal health care programs or debarred from federal contracting.", "In addition, suppliers submitting an enrollment application to NSC on or  after March 1, 2008, must also be accredited by an approved organization  prior to submitting the application. These accrediting organizations are  supposed to ensure that prospective DMEPOS suppliers meet quality  standards related to financial and human resource management, consumer  management, product safety, product delivery, and beneficiary training,  among others. DMEPOS suppliers that enrolled for the first time between  January 1, 2008, and February 29, 2008, must obtain accreditation by  January 1, 2009. Suppliers that enrolled with Medicare before January 1.  2008, must obtain accreditation by September 30, 2009. Further, CMS is  beginning to implement competitive bidding, which will change how  suppliers obtain the right to participate in the program. Competitive  bidding is a process in which suppliers of medical equipment and supplies  compete for the right to provide their products on the basis of established  criteria, such as quality and price. Competitive bidding provides CMS with  the authority to select suppliers by screening their financial documents  such as income statements and credit reports and other application  materials. CMS has chosen suppliers to serve beneficiaries in 10  Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the program is scheduled to begin July  1, 2008.", "Apart from the competitive bidding program, as long as suppliers can  demonstrate that they comply with all the standards and have not been  excluded from participating in any federal health care program, NSC must  enroll or reenroll them in Medicare. Enrolled suppliers are issued a  Medicare billing number. If NSC discovers that a new applicant or enrolled  supplier is not in compliance with any of the 25 standards, NSC can deny  the application or, with CMS\u2019s approval, revoke the supplier\u2019s billing  number. Suppliers whose applications have been denied or whose  numbers have been revoked can submit a plan to NSC to correct the  noncompliance, appeal the denial or revocation by requesting a hearing or  both.", "In January 2008, CMS proposed creating five new standards and  strengthening several of the existing standards. The new standards  require most suppliers to be open to the public for at least 30 hours per  week and prohibit them from sharing an office with another supplier. They  will also be required to maintain ordering and referring documentation  received from physicians for 7 years. Finally, suppliers that have a federal  or state tax delinquency will be prohibited from obtaining or retaining  billing privileges. With regard to strengthening the existing standards, CMS  will, among other things, require that suppliers maintain an office to store  business records and will limit the use of cell phones, beeper numbers,  pagers, and answering services as the primary DMEPOS business  telephone number during posted hours of operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing the Medicare Enrollment Process", "paragraphs": ["After establishing two fictitious DMEPOS storefronts with no inventory  and no clients, our undercover investigators were able to successfully  complete the Medicare enrollment process.

To appear legitimate, we rented 100 square foot commercial  offices in both Maryland and Virginia. Both rentals cost approximately  $1,000 per month and came complete with Internet, phone and fax service,  and a shared secretary.

First,  they paid online registration companies about $400 per supplier to obtain  required state business licenses, such as sales tax licenses. In addition, for  each company, investigators obtained employer identification numbers  (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and National Provider  Identification (NPI) numbers from CMS.

The representative explained to our  undercover investigator, who was posing as a salesperson, that the visit  would be used to gather information needed to verify compliance with  CMS\u2019s standards. Using a checklist, the representative asked questions  about the company\u2019s return policy, how the items were going to be  delivered, and whether we had a warehouse or if we would have items  drop-shipped from a supplier. He also asked if any member of our  fictitious owner\u2019s family was in the medical supply business, if the owner  had any business partners, and if there were any investors. The  representative also asked for copies of our state licenses, insurance policy,  and other documentation. Our investigator was deliberately vague in his  responses to the representative and did not provide the inspector with any  of the requested documentation, telling the representative that the \u201cowner\u201d  had all that information.", "The representative also took pictures of the office to make sure that the  building was accessible to persons with disabilities. He asked for our  insurance documentation and noted that it was missing the company\u2019s  physical address. Finally, he mentioned that the business needed a sign in  the office window identifying its location and hours. We did not have the  hours posted because the building where our office was located had a  policy prohibiting postings on office windows; however, the investigator  told the representative that he would speak to the building managers and  ensure that the hours were posted. The representative then presented our  investigator with a site visit acknowledgement form and checked off the  following eight documents that needed to be provided to NSC as required  by the standards:  required licenses, including zoning,    complaint log,    complaint resolution protocol,  rental/purchase option agreement,    comprehensive liability insurance,    credit agreements or invoices,    proof of warranty coverage, and    written instructions on beneficiary use.", "One day later, we sent NSC the information requested on the checklist. On  July 17, 2007, NSC requested a full copy of the over 100 page insurance  policy; we had sent an abbreviated version provided by our carrier after  the site visit, but NSC wanted a complete copy. We immediately contacted  the carrier and they agreed to send a complete copy directly to NSC. On  August 15, 2007, NSC requested that we provide it with warranty  information for DMEPOS rentals and we faxed the information on August  17.

She also purchased fake invoices for DMEPOS  equipment from another company to make it seem as though she was  obtaining legitimate supplies from a wholesaler.

She  also stated that Medicare beneficiaries often called her to complain that  they had received an explanation of benefits letter in the mail even though  they did not receive any supplies or services. The Bank of America  eventually filed a suspicious activity report as a result of the company\u2019s  billing practices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and HHS IG  subsequently determined that the owner stole the identities and physician  identification numbers of practicing physicians to legitimize his fraudulent  claims. The owner plead guilty to one count of health care fraud and on  March 16, 2007, was sentenced to 4 years in prison and 3 years of  probation, assessed a $100 fee, and ordered to pay $2.2 million in  restitution.", "Case Study 4: The owner of this DMEPOS company operated a fictitious  supply business out of an office connected to a real estate company and  purchased real Medicare beneficiary numbers illegally for $45 each in  order to submit claims. Through data mining, the HHS IG determined that  the company displayed billing patterns that were highly consistent with  known fraudulent practices. Specifically, the company owner used a small  number of stolen physician identification numbers to submit numerous  claims for expensive DMEPOS items that are typically used in fraudulent  schemes, including motorized wheelchairs, wound therapy pumps, and  infusion equipment. From July 2005 through October 2006, the DMEPOS  company billed the Medicare program over $1 million and received over  $500,000 in payments. On August 7, 2007, the owner was ordered to pay  $702,186 in restitution to Medicare and was sentenced to 2 years in federal  prison and 3 years of probation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrective Action Briefing", "paragraphs": ["On June 18, 2008, we informed representatives from CMS about the results  of our investigation.

As indicated, CMS is currently taking additional actions to strengthen both  the 25 standards and its oversight of the DMEPOS supplier enrollment  process; however, these actions will only be successful if those tasked  with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting  screenings and inspections. Our covert tests clearly demonstrate that a  simple paperwork review is not sufficient. Unless CMS and its contractors  scrutinize suppliers to ensure that they are responsible, legitimate  businesses, DMEPOS fraud will continue to cost taxpayers billions of  dollars each year.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce the contents of this  report earlier, we will not distribute it until 30 days from its date.
