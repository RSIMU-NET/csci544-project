The agreement stipulated that NTIS would develop and operate Cyberfile, a tax systems modernization (TSM) project that would allow taxpayers to prepare and electronically submit their tax returns using their personal computers. Electronic returns would be submitted via the public switch telephone network or the Internet, accepted at a new NTIS data center, and then forwarded to designated IRS Service Centers. Taxpayers would not be charged a fee to file their returns using Cyberfile.", "To obtain contractor support to develop Cyberfile, NTIS modified an existing technical services contract awarded on a sole source basis through SBA\u2019s Section 8(a) program for small and disadvantaged businesses. This program permits the award of a contract to the SBA, which then subcontracts with a firm owned by economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. After award, SBA requires the agency to manage the contract and ensure goods and services are received for dollars expended. Further, SBA officials told us that the procuring agency is supposed to obtain SBA approval before modifying the contract.", "NTIS also acquired systems hardware and services via existing Department of the Navy, Treasury, and General Services Administration (GSA) contracts and other sources. Because NTIS did not have a contracting activity with the authority to make purchases over $50,000, the agency used contracting officers from two other Commerce Department activities to support the Cyberfile procurement. Initially, the Office of Acquisition Management provided a contracting officer. In late November 1995, the Cyberfile procurement was transferred to a contracting officer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.", "In December 1995, we briefed the IRS Commissioner on the risks associated with proceeding with Cyberfile as planned. We explained that Cyberfile was not being developed using disciplined systems development processes and that adequate steps were not being taken to protect taxpayer data on the Internet. At that time, Cyberfile development was scheduled for limited operational use by a selected population of taxpayers in February 1996.", "In March 1996 testimony, we noted that Cyberfile development reflected many of the same management and technical weaknesses we found in TSM systems and delineated in our July 1995 report. We also reported that Cyberfile contractual issues warranted further review. IRS\u2019 Chief Inspector reviewed the Cyberfile acquisition and in an April 1996 briefing to management concluded that IRS did not follow internal procurement procedures, failed to sufficiently oversee the project, and was vulnerable to outside criticism. The Chief Inspector is also performing a physical inventory of equipment purchased by NTIS, which is scheduled to be completed in late August 1996. The Commerce Department\u2019s Inspector General is reviewing NTIS\u2019 operations, including its contracting efforts. Inspector General officials told us they have serious concerns about how NTIS and the department contracted for Cyberfile as well as other projects. These officials said they expect to issue a report in late August 1996.", "In March 1996, IRS decided to delay Cyberfile operations until after April 15, 1996. Because milestones for delivering Cyberfile kept slipping, IRS contracted with its Federally Funded Research and Development Center on April 16, 1996, to provide options available to IRS for delivering the system for the 1997 or 1998 tax filing seasons. NTIS continued to work on Cyberfile until the $17.1 million advanced from IRS had been obligated. NTIS then requested an additional advance from IRS to fund the $22 million obligation incurred by IRS. IRS did not provide the advance. Instead, it directed NTIS on May 10, 1996, to stop work on Cyberfile. The contractor reported to IRS in July 1996 with options for proceeding with Cyberfile.

Further, IRS selected NTIS without evaluating its (1) capabilities to build such a system, (2) experience in building similar systems, or (3) ability to deliver cost-effectively as compared with private-sector and other government sources.", "Federal information management and acquisition regulations and IRS\u2019 own policies and procedures require the use of disciplined, decision-making processes for planning, managing, and controlling the acquisition of information systems and services. These regulations and policies direct that prior to initiating system procurements, such as Cyberfile, IRS (1) identify its information needs, (2) perform a requirements analysis to determine how to support agency needs, (3) identify alternative ways to meet requirements, including the costs and benefits of each alternative, and (4) prepare an acquisition strategy that demonstrates how the agency plans to acquire the most cost-beneficial alternative. These processes would have mitigated the risks of acquiring a system that has yet to be delivered, is over budget, and failed to meet IRS\u2019 objectives.", "IRS dispensed with disciplined analyses because IRS officials believed that NTIS had the capabilities to deliver Cyberfile by February 1996. They said this belief was based on (1) the fact that NTIS had provided taxpayers access to tax forms via NTIS\u2019 FedWorld Network and (2) briefings by NTIS officials in which they claimed that NTIS could complete Cyberfile by February 1996, in time for the 1996 tax filing season. However, the technical challenge of providing tax forms is not comparable to the much more complex Cyberfile system. Further, NTIS offered no convincing analytical support for its claim that it could deliver Cyberfile by February 1996. For example, it provided no detailed task definitions, work breakdown structures, or interim schedules.", "IRS top management did not heed warnings, dating back to July 1995, from its acquisitions support staff that IRS\u2019 Cyberfile procurement approach would lead to failure and jeopardize TSM. Our December 1995 briefing to the IRS Commissioner and Deputy Secretary of Commerce, on the risks of continuing with Cyberfile as planned, also did not dissuade IRS from its goal to field Cyberfile for the 1996 tax filing season. Only after NTIS informed IRS in April 1996 that the $17.1 million had been obligated and that the system still was not finished, did IRS stop to reconsider the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Did Not Fully Comply With Procurement Regulations for Its Cyberfile Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["In procuring Cyberfile, IRS did not fully comply with federal acquisition regulations which are designed to help agencies develop and acquire automated systems that meet agency needs and are delivered on time and within budget.

In this regard, IRS concluded that the Economy Act was not applicable to its agreement with NTIS and, therefore, IRS did not attempt to comply with the requirements of that act. IRS\u2019 position is supported by a recent amendment to the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation, which formalizes GSA\u2019s position that the Economy Act is not applicable to information technology procurements subject to the Brooks ADP Act. Congress may not have contemplated the exemption of such a large portion of federal procurements from the requirements of the Economy Act. Nonetheless, the amendment was not unreasonable and was issued pursuant to GSA\u2019s authority to implement the Brooks ADP Act. Accordingly, we have no basis to object to it. Because section 5101 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law No. 104-106, (1996), repealed the Brooks ADP Act, effective August 8, 1996, any authority to initiate interagency agreements under the Brooks ADP Act has expired. However, the Brooks ADP Act was in effect when IRS initiated the interagency agreement with NTIS.", "Although it cited the Brooks ADP Act as its authority in acquiring Cyberfile, IRS did not follow the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation that implements this law. Specifically, the regulations require agencies to conduct requirements and alternatives analyses prior to procuring information technology. IRS did not conduct either analysis. Without these analyses, IRS could neither define the software capabilities and features needed for Cyberfile nor determine which acquisition and technical options were most advantageous to the government.", "Further, the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation also requires agencies acquiring information systems and services to obtain a delegation of procurement authority from GSA. Treasury had a delegation from GSA, and in turn required IRS to obtain a delegation of procurement authority from the department for information system initiatives over $15 million.

We found, however, that NTIS did not have a reasonable basis for its cost estimate prior to awarding this sole source contract. NTIS officials said that at the time of contract award, they estimated that the FedWorld work would cost $1.0 million, but had no idea what Cyberfile tasks would ultimately cost. Rather than developing a cost estimate analytically, NTIS officials said they \u201cplugged in a cost\u201d of $1.3 million for Cyberfile, for a total contract value of $2.3 million. After contract award, the contractor estimated the cost to develop Cyberfile at $3.3 million, which resulted in a $2.0 million contract modification on November 7, 1995, a month and a half after contract award.

Third, the contractor was not eligible under the 8(a) program for this type of work.

The IRS contracting officer also stated that she told NTIS in their May 10, 1996, conversation that IRS had no more funding and all contracts were to stop. The IRS contracting officer further stated that she believed the letter meant that NTIS would terminate any existing contracts where possible. However, IRS did not follow up with a letter ensuring that the parties clearly understood the specific actions NTIS would take to control obligations and costs. NTIS officials stated that the May 13, 1996, letter to IRS did not require them to terminate existing contracts where possible.", "Our review disclosed since the suspension period began, costs have continued to be incurred for goods and services through ongoing rental agreements (e.g., equipment leases). Although these avoidable costs were not detailed in NTIS\u2019 June 28, 1996, letter to IRS, on July 17, 1996, NTIS provided IRS a list of these recurring costs that could have been avoided if the underlying agreements were terminated. A review of this list shows that the monthly costs for these items are about $30,000 and the underlying contracts can be terminated with 30 days notice. Only one of these contracts required a cancellation fee. Examples of these recurring costs follow. $10,404 per month for Internet service, $7,954 per month for a mail sorting machine, and $5,172 per month for rental and maintenance of a high speed printing machine.", "NTIS officials stated that they prepared this list to notify IRS that costs were still being incurred and were awaiting direction from IRS on whether the agreements should be terminated. According to the IRS contracting officer, when this letter was received, IRS called the NTIS program manager and instructed him to cancel the contracts. The IRS contracting officer said that she did not believe IRS had to formally document this decision. However, in another case, IRS did document its decision to cancel a contract relating to Cyberfile. Specifically, in a May 21, 1996, letter to NTIS from the Acting Executive for Electronic Filing, IRS formally notified NTIS to cancel a contract relating to support services. This contract was canceled.", "As of August 2, 1996, NTIS officials stated they still had not received formal notification to terminate the contracts identified in the July 17, 1996, letter. Since these contracts were not canceled shortly after the May 13, 1996, letter from NTIS to IRS, unnecessary rental costs for July and August of about $60,000 have been incurred. If it is determined that these costs are appropriate charges for the Cyberfile project, then these costs would also appear subject to NTIS\u2019 10 percent management fee.", "Either IRS or NTIS could have prevented these costs. For example, IRS could have clearly documented its understanding of the actions that NTIS would take to avoid additional costs. As discussed above, IRS clearly instructed NTIS to cancel a support services contract and the contract was promptly terminated.

However, it disagreed that NTIS should (1) rescind management fees associated with ordering equipment from existing government contracts and (2) refrain from accepting new projects from other agencies until the reported weaknesses are corrected.", "First, in refusing to rescind the management fees, Commerce stated that IRS agreed to pay these fees on equipment ordered from existing government contracts \u201cfor its own convenience,\u201d and that NTIS was entitled by the interagency agreement to collect them. This position misses the point of the recommendation. The issue is not whether Commerce is entitled to assess these charges under the interagency agreement (the report explicitly states that it is), but rather whether these charges represent judicious management of federal funds. In executing an interagency agreement, all parties are required to ensure that the best interests of the government are served, and that federal funds are prudently expended. Charging IRS an $89,000 management fee for purchasing equipment from an existing contract administered by the IRS itself, and, in addition, hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessry fees for placing orders with other federal agencies that IRS could have placed itself, is not judicious management of federal funds and is not in the best interest of the federal government.", "Second, Commerce said that it would not refrain from accepting new projects from other agencies before the causes of Cyberfile mismanagement had been identified, corrected, and reported to the Congress, because most NTIS projects involve routine information dissemination. This recommendation was not intended to address NTIS projects involving only routine information dissemination. Our intent was to ensure that NTIS accepted no new systems analysis, development, or management projects, such as those solicited on NTIS\u2019 Internet site (i.e., providing other agencies with information management solutions, performing program management and software development, and building state-of-the-art customized programs) while weaknesses in NTIS acquisition and financial management processes persist. We have modified the recommendation to state our intention more precisely.", "In its response, Commerce also took the position that (1) the project took longer than the scheduled 6 months because IRS increased systems requirements after major milestones were met and (2) when IRS suspended the Cyberfile project in May 1996, the system was near completion. However, as we testified in March 1996, there was no formal process in place to define, manage, and control Cyberfile systems requirements. For example, there were no established security requirements or requirements baseline. Further, since Cyberfile was developed using undisciplined and ad hoc software development processes, NTIS has no analytical basis to determine whether the system was \u201cnear completion,\u201d when it would be complete, or how much it would cost.", "Finally, Commerce claimed that it did not have enough time to review the facts in the draft report.
