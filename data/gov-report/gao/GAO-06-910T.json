According to FTA, a potential challenge in moving forward is  incorporating both land use and economic development criteria into the  evaluation process, including developing appropriate measures for the  criteria and avoiding duplication in counting benefits. To address this  issue, FTA suggested combining land use and economic development into  a single measure. However, in the comments submitted to FTA, members  of the transit community repeatedly stated that land use and economic  development should not be combined into a single measure and that they  should receive the same weight as cost-effectiveness in the evaluation and  rating process.", "SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to the JARC program. One key  change was to change JARC from a discretionary to a formula-based  program. Whereas funds for JARC projects were congressionally  designated in recent years, SAFETEA-LU\u2019s formula distributes funds to  states and large urbanized areas. This will significantly change the  allocation of JARC funds as some states and urbanized areas receive more  funds than under the discretionary program, others receive less, and some  areas will receive funds that had not received JARC funds in the past.  Other key changes resulting from SAFETEA-LU include allowing JARC  recipients to use a portion of funds for planning activities and removing a  limit on the amount of funds available for reverse commute projects. To  implement these changes, FTA began soliciting comments and input  through public listening sessions and program notices in November 2005.

Both of these  programs are managed by FTA.", "The New Starts program is a discretionary grant program for investments  in new fixed-guideway projects. Under the statutorily-defined evaluation  process for the New Starts program, FTA identifies and selects fixed- guideway transit projects\u2014including heavy, light, and commuter rail;  ferry; and busway projects\u2014for funding. FTA generally funds New Starts  projects through full funding grant agreements (FFGA), which establish  the terms and conditions for federal participation in a New Starts project  and also define a project\u2019s scope, including the length of the system and  the number of stations; the project\u2019s schedule, including the date when the  system is expected to open for service; and the project\u2019s cost. To obtain an  FFGA, a project must progress through a local or regional review of  alternatives and meet a number of federal requirements, including  providing information for the New Starts evaluation and rating process. As  required by SAFETEA-LU, New Starts projects must emerge from a  regional, multimodal transportation planning process. The first two phases  of the New Starts process\u2014systems planning and alternatives analysis\u2014 address this requirement. The systems planning phase identifies the  transportation needs of a region, while the alternatives analysis phase  provides information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of different  corridor-level options, such as rail lines or bus routes. The alternatives  analysis phase results in the selection of a locally preferred alternative\u2014 which is intended to be the New Starts project that FTA evaluates, as  required by statute. After a locally preferred alternative is selected, project  sponsors seek FTA\u2019s approval for entry into the preliminary engineering  phase. Following completion of preliminary engineering and federal  environmental requirements\u2014and assuming New Starts requirements  continue to be met\u2014FTA may approve the project\u2019s advancement into  final design, after which FTA may approve the project for an FFGA and  proceed to construction, as provided for in statute. FTA oversees grantees\u2019  management of projects from the preliminary engineering phase through  construction and evaluates the projects for advancement into each phase  of the process, as well as annually for the New Starts report to Congress.", "To help inform administration and congressional decisions about which  projects should receive federal funds, FTA assigns ratings based on a  variety of financial and project justification criteria, and then assigns an  overall rating. For the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle, FTA used the  financial and project justification criteria identified in TEA-21. These  criteria reflect a broad range of benefits and effects of the proposed  project, such as cost-effectiveness, as well as the ability of the project  sponsor to fund the project and finance the continued operation of its  transit system (see fig. 1). FTA assigns the proposed project a rating for  each criterion, then assigns a summary rating for local financial  commitment and project justification. Finally, FTA develops an overall  project rating. Projects are rated at several points during the New Starts  process\u2014as part of the evaluation for entry into preliminary engineering  and final design, and yearly for inclusion in the New Starts annual report  that is submitted to Congress.", "More recent than New Starts, the JARC program was created in 1998 in  order to support the nation\u2019s welfare reform goals.

These changes range from the creation of the Small Starts program to  introducing new evaluation criteria.

In addition, SAFETEA-LU codified FTA\u2019s  requirement that project sponsors conduct before and after studies for all  completed projects. SAFETEA-LU also clarified the federal share  requirements for New Starts projects. In particular, SAFETEA-LU states  that the federal share for a New Starts project may be up to 80 percent of  the project\u2019s net capital project cost, unless the project sponsor requests a  lower amount. SAFETEA-LU also prohibits the Secretary of  Transportation from requiring a nonfederal share of more than 20 percent  of the project\u2019s total net capital cost. This language addresses FTA\u2019s policy  of favoring projects that seek a federal New Starts share of no more than  60 percent of the total cost.

The Small Starts program  is a component of the existing New Starts program, but, according to the  conference reports accompanying SAFETEA-LU, is intended to provide  project sponsors with an expedited and streamlined evaluation and rating  process. Table 2 compares New Starts and Small Starts program  requirements.", "In January 2006, FTA published an ANPRM to give interested parties an  opportunity to comment on the characteristics of and requirements for the  Small Starts program. In its ANPRM, FTA suggests that the planning and  project development process for proposed Small Starts projects could be  simplified by allowing analyses of fewer alternatives for small projects,  allowing the development of evaluation measures for mobility and cost- effectiveness without the use of complicated travel demand modeling  procedures in some cases, and possibly defining some classes of pre- approved low-cost improvements as effective and cost-effective in certain  contexts. FTA also sought the transit community\u2019s input on three key  issues in its ANPRM, including eligibility, the rating and evaluation  process, and the project development process. For each of these issues,  FTA outlined different options for how to proceed, and then posed a series  of questions for public comment, including the following questions on the  rating and evaluation process:    How should the evaluation framework for New Starts be changed or  adapted for Small Starts projects?", "How might FTA evaluate economic development and land use as distinct  and separate measures?", "How might FTA incorporate risk and uncertainty into project evaluations  for Small Starts?", "What weights should FTA apply to each measure?", "FTA\u2019s ANPRM for Small Starts generated a significant volume of public  comment. While members of the transit community were supportive of  some proposals for the Small Starts program, they also had a number of  concerns. In particular, the transit community questioned whether FTA\u2019s  proposals would, as intended, provide smaller projects with a more  streamlined evaluation and rating process. As a result, some commenters  recommended that FTA simplify some of its original proposals in the final  NPRM to reflect the smaller scope of these projects. For example, several  project sponsors and industry representatives thought that FTA should  redefine the baseline alternative as the \u201cno-build\u201d option and make the  before and after study optional for Small Starts projects to limit the time  and cost of project development. In addition, others were concerned that  FTA\u2019s proposals minimized the importance of the new land use and  economic development evaluation criteria introduced by SAFETEA-LU,  and they recommended that the measures for land use and economic  development be revised.", "Since FTA does not plan to issue its final rule for the New Starts and Small  Starts programs until early 2008, FTA issued proposed interim guidance  for the Small Starts program in June 2006 to ensure that project sponsors  would have an opportunity to apply for Small Starts funding and be  evaluated in the upcoming cycle (i.e., the fiscal year 2008 evaluation cycle,  which begins in August 2006). The proposed interim guidance describes  the process that FTA will use to evaluate proposed Small Starts projects to  support the decision to approve or disapprove their advancement to  project development and the decision to recommend projects for funding,  including whether proposed projects are part of a broader strategy to  reduce congestion in particular regions. In addition, although not required  by SAFETEA-LU, FTA introduced a separate eligibility category within the  Small Starts program for \u201cVery Small Starts\u201d projects in the proposed  interim guidance. Small Starts projects that qualify as Very Small Starts are  projects that    do not include the construction of a new fixed guideway,    are in corridors with existing riders who will benefit from the proposed  project and number more than 3,000 on an average weekday, including at  least 1,000 riders who board at the terminal stations, and   have a total capital cost of less than $50 million and less than $3 million  per mile (excluding rolling stock).", "According to the proposed interim guidance on the Small Starts program,  FTA intends to scale the planning and project development process to the  size and complexity of the proposed projects. Therefore, Very Small Starts  projects will undergo a very simple and streamlined evaluation and rating  process. Small Starts projects that do not meet all three criteria for Very  Small Starts projects will be evaluated and rated using a framework  similar to that used for traditional, or large starts, New Starts projects.  However, FTA officials have indicated that this evaluation and rating  framework would be modified, for example, to include only those criteria  listed in the statute. FTA is seeking public input on the Small Starts  proposals contained in the proposed interim guidance through July 9,  2006. FTA plans to review the comments received and issue its final  interim guidance for the Small Starts program by August 2006. This  guidance will govern the program until the final rule is issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Also Identified Possible Changes to the New Starts Program in Response to SAFETEA-LU as well as Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In response to SAFETEA-LU, FTA identified possible changes to the New  Starts program that would affect traditional New Starts projects, or large  starts, in its January 2006 guidance. According to FTA, some of SAFETEA- LU provisions could lead to changes in the definition of eligibility, the  evaluation and rating process, and the project development process. In the  guidance, FTA outlines changes it is considering and solicits public input,  through a series of questions, on the potential changes. For example, FTA  identified two options for revising the evaluation and rating process to  reflect SAFETEA-LU\u2019s changes to the evaluation criteria. The first option  would extend the current process to include economic development  impacts and the reliability of cost and ridership forecasts. Specifically,  FTA suggested that economic development impacts and the reliability of  forecasts simply be added to the list of criteria considered in developing  the project justification rating. The second option would be to develop a  broader process to include the evaluation criteria identified by SAFETEA- LU and to organize the measures to support a more analytical discussion  of the project and its merits. According to FTA, the second option would  broaden the evaluation process beyond a computation of overall ratings  based on individual evaluation measures and develop better insights into  the merit of a project than are possible from using the quantified  evaluation measures alone. (See app. I for a description of the different  changes FTA is considering.)", "FTA also identified potential challenges in implementing some of  SAFETEA-LU changes in its guidance. In particular, FTA described the  challenges of incorporating and distinguishing between two measures of  indirect benefits in the New Starts evaluation process\u2014land use and  economic development impacts. For example, FTA noted that its current  land use measures (e.g., land use plans and policies) indicate the transit- friendliness of a project corridor both now and in the future, but they do  not measure the benefits generated by the proposed project. Rather, they  describe the degree to which the project corridor provides an environment  in which the proposed project can succeed. According to FTA\u2019s guidance,  FTA\u2019s evaluation of land use does not include economic development  benefits because FTA has not been able to find reliable methods of  predicting these benefits. FTA further stated that because SAFETEA-LU  introduces a separate economic development criterion, the potential role  for land use as a measure of development benefits becomes even less clear  given its potential overlap with the economic development criterion. In  addition, FTA noted that many economic development benefits result from  direct benefits (e.g., travel time savings), and therefore, including them in  the evaluation could lead to double counting the benefits FTA already  measures and uses to evaluate projects. Furthermore, FTA noted that  some economic development impacts may represent transfers between  regions rather than a net benefit for the nation, raising questions as to  whether these impacts are useful for a national comparison of projects. To  address some of the challenges, FTA suggested that an appropriate  strategy might be to combine land use and economic development into a  single measure.", "We have also reported on many of the same challenges of measuring and  forecasting indirect benefits, such as economic development and land use  impacts. For example, we noted that it is challenging to predict changes  in land use because current transportation demand models are unable to  predict the effect of a transportation investment on land-use patterns and  development, since these models use land-use-forecasts as inputs into the  model. In addition, we noted that certain benefits are often double  counted when evaluating transportation projects. In particular, indirect  benefits, such as economic development, may be more correctly  considered transfers of direct user benefits or economic activity from one  area to another. Therefore, estimating and adding such benefits to direct  benefits could constitute double counting and lead to overestimating a  project\u2019s benefits. Despite these challenges, experts told us that evaluating  land use and economic development impacts is important, since they often  drive local transportation investment choices.", "FTA received a large number of written comments on its online docket in  response to its proposed changes. (See app. I for common comments  submitted for each proposed change.) While members of the transit  community were supportive of some proposals, they expressed concerns  about a number of FTA\u2019s proposed changes. For example, a number of  commenters expressed concerns about FTA\u2019s options for revising the  evaluation process, noting that both proposals deemphasized the  importance of economic development and land use. Some commenters  also noted that land use and economic development should not be  combined into a single measure and that they should receive the same  weight as cost-effectiveness in the evaluation and rating process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SAFETEA-LU Transformed the JARC Program from a Discretionary to a Formula-based Program", "paragraphs": ["SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to the JARC program, the most  notable of which was the creation of a formula to distribute JARC funds.

Under TEA-21, JARC was a  discretionary grant program for which FTA competitively selected JARC  projects and, more recently, awarded funds for congressionally designated  projects. Under SAFETEA-LU, states and large urbanized areas have been  apportioned funding for JARC projects through a formula based on the  number of low-income individuals and welfare recipients in each area.  This is a significant change because some states and urbanized areas will  receive substantially more funds than under the discretionary program,  while others will receive substantially less. In addition, the formula  program will result in some areas receiving JARC funds that had not  received them in the past. Forty percent of JARC funds each year are  required to be apportioned among states for projects in small urbanized  and other than urbanized areas, and the remaining 60 percent are required  to be apportioned among urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or  more. The governor of each state must designate a recipient for JARC  funds at the state level to competitively select and award funds for  projects in small urbanized and other than urbanized areas within the  state. In large urbanized areas, the recipient must be designated by the  governor, local officials, and publicly owned operators of public  transportation.", "In addition to creating a formula for distributing JARC funds, SAFETEA- LU also extended a JARC requirement related to coordinated planning to  additional FTA programs and made a number of other changes to key  aspects of the JARC program. In the past, JARC projects were required to  be part of a coordinated public transit-human services transportation plan;  a similar requirement is included in SAFETEA-LU. However, this  requirement will apply in fiscal year 2007 to two other FTA programs that  provide funding for transportation-disadvantaged populations. In  addition, recipients in states and urbanized areas that select JARC projects  must now certify that their selections were based on this plan. Another  change resulting from SAFETEA-LU is the ability of a recipient to use up  to 10 percent of its JARC allocation for administration, planning, and  technical assistance, and the expansion of the definition of eligible  activities to include planning as well as capital and operating activities.  SAFETEA-LU also removed a restriction on the amount of funding  available for reverse commute projects to help individuals in urban areas  gain access to suburban employment opportunities. Table 3 compares key  JARC provisions under SAFETEA-LU and TEA-21.", "Some of these changes address issues that we have raised in past reports  on JARC and the coordination of transportation services for  transportation-disadvantaged populations. For example, in 2004 we  reported that a majority of the JARC grantees we spoke with supported a  proposal to use grant funds for administrative, planning, and technical  assistance activities, because these activities could increase coordination  with potential partners. In 2003, we also reported that some federal and  state officials believed that providing financial incentives or mandates for  coordination was one way to improve the coordination of transportation  services among federal programs. In addition, officials of one metropolitan  planning organization that we spoke to about changes to the JARC  program also note that the change to a formula program may better  facilitate cooperation between organizations.

FTA received more than 200  comments on this notice, and the comments addressed a variety of issues,  including the coordinated planning requirement for JARC and other  programs and the selection of designated recipients. For example, several  private operators of transportation services have requested that FTA  include language that private transportation operators be involved in the  coordinated planning process. A number of comments have also  addressed whether there would be a potential conflict of interest in having  a provider of transportation services also serve as the designated recipient  that will select JARC projects for funding. FTA officials have indicated that  they plan to address many of the issues raised in the comments in draft  final guidance for JARC that they plan to release later this summer. FTA  plans to solicit comments on the draft final guidance and issue final  guidance for JARC later this year. Figure 3 presents a time line for FTA\u2019s  implementation of changes to the JARC program.", "Through our preliminary work, we have identified two challenges that FTA  may encounter as it moves forward in its implementation of changes to  JARC. One potential challenge for FTA will be to ensure that it develops  JARC guidance in a timely manner so that JARC recipients can implement  the program. Officials from one metropolitan planning organization we  spoke with about JARC changes noted that the guidance will be important  because it will address questions that JARC recipients have raised about  the program\u2019s implementation and to which they have received conflicting  answers from FTA headquarters and regional staff. A publicly available  schedule of FTA deliverables related to SAFETEA-LU\u2019s implementation  stated that draft final guidance for JARC was anticipated between May and  July 2006. However, FTA officials told us that they now expect to issue the  draft final guidance in late July or early August. This change reflects FTA\u2019s  extension of the comment period for the March 2006 notice by 1 month to  receive additional comments, and the submission of more than 100  comments on or after the last day of the comment period. The additional  comments raised a number of issues for FTA to consider, according to  FTA officials. While FTA has stated that criteria in the final guidance will  not apply retroactively to issued grants so that areas can proceed with  JARC projects, FTA officials as well as officials from an association that  represents metropolitan planning organizations have told us that some  recipients of JARC funds will likely wait for final program guidance before  proceeding. In addition, few states and urbanized areas have taken formal  steps to apply for fiscal year 2006 funds. As of late May, 5 states had  notified FTA of their designated recipient for JARC funding, and 1 of the  152 urbanized areas that receive a JARC apportionment had obligated  fiscal year 2006 JARC funds, according to FTA officials.", "Another potential challenge for FTA in moving forward will be to  determine its plan for overseeing the JARC program. FTA officials have  told us that they are still developing this plan, and that at a minimum they  expect to use routine grant management tools\u2014such as progress reports  and site visits\u2014to oversee JARC recipients. In its interim guidance, FTA  also indicates that it intends to use existing oversight mechanisms from  the federal urbanized area and nonurbanized area formula programs, such  as triennial reviews and state management reviews. However, FTA  officials acknowledge they need to determine how to incorporate JARC  grant recipients into these oversight processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transparency, Communication, and Accountability Issues Will Continue to Be Important", "paragraphs": ["Our past work suggests that transparency, communication, and  accountability issues will be important as FTA moves forward in  implementing SAFETEA-LU changes to the New Starts and JARC  programs. Like SAFETEA-LU, TEA-21 required GAO to regularly review  the New Starts and JARC programs. Since 1998, we have issued numerous  reports on these programs, and many of the reports contained  recommendations to FTA on ways to improve the implementation of these  programs. SAFETEA-LU addressed some of these issues, and FTA has also  taken steps to resolve some of them. Nevertheless, given the number of  changes that are being made to both programs, continued focus on  improving transparency, communication, and accountability will be  important.", "In our recent reports on the New Starts program, we noted several cases in  which FTA could have improved the program\u2019s transparency. Typically,  these cases dealt with FTA\u2019s decisions not to seek public input on  proposed policy changes before they were implemented. In our 2005  report, we found that FTA had made 16 changes to the New Starts process  since fiscal year 2001, but had not published information about the  changes in the Federal Register or instituted a rulemaking process for 9 of  the changes; moreover, for 6 of the 9 changes, FTA did not provide any  avenues for public review and comment. For example, during the fiscal  year 2004 cycle, FTA instituted a preference policy in its ratings process  favoring current and future projects that do not request more than a 60  percent federal funding share. However, FTA did not amend its regulations  to reflect this change in policy or its existing procedures, and the public  did not have an opportunity to comment on the impact of the change prior  to its adoption.", "SAFETEA-LU addressed our past concerns about the transparency of the  New Starts program by requiring FTA to publish for notice and comment  any proposals that make significant changes to the New Starts program.  FTA has already implemented this requirement. For instance, earlier this  year, FTA gave the transit community an opportunity to review and  comment on proposed procedural changes (i.e., nonregulatory changes) to  the New Starts process as well as possible changes FTA was considering  for the New Starts program in the future. Although members of the transit  community expressed concerns about some of FTA\u2019s proposed changes in  their comments, project sponsors and industry representatives repeatedly  told us that they appreciated the opportunity to review and comment on  the proposals. FTA officials have also stated that they have been pleased  with the review and comment process, noting that it helps to ensure that  FTA\u2019s guidance is more complete, more responsive to stakeholders\u2019 needs,  and more likely to take into account on-the-ground realities.", "We have also previously reported shortfalls in FTA\u2019s communication of  New Starts program changes to project sponsors that in several cases,  have resulted in implementation problems. For example, in our 2003  report, we noted that a number of project sponsors were unable to  calculate a valid Transportation System User Benefits (TSUB) value, and  as a result, their projects received a \u201cnot rated\u201d rating for the cost- effectiveness criterion. Project sponsors commented that they would  have benefited from additional guidance and technical support on how to  generate the required data for the TSUB measure. Similarly, during the  fiscal year 2005 evaluation cycle, FTA introduced a requirement for project  sponsors to submit a \u201cmake the case\u201d document to articulate the benefits  of a proposed New Starts project. FTA officials intended to use the  document to help interpret data produced by the local travel forecasting  models, but FTA did not prepare any written guidance on what  information to include or provide report templates. Without such  information, project sponsors stated that they did not understand what  should be included in the document or how it would be used, and FTA  officials later acknowledged that many of the submissions did not meet  their expectations.", "SAFETEA-LU addressed these communication problems by requiring that  FTA routinely publish policy guidance. Specifically, SAFETEA-LU requires  that FTA publish policy guidance for comment and response no later than  120 days after the enactment of SAFETEA-LU, each time significant  changes are made, and at least every 2 years. FTA responded to this  requirement by publishing policy guidance for the New Starts program in  January 2006 and soliciting public comments on the proposed changes  outlined in the guidance. Furthermore, in its January guidance, FTA  included possible long-term changes to the large starts component of the  New Starts program that FTA is considering. FTA stated that it hoped to  use the policy guidance as a forum for discussing possible changes with  the transit community so that FTA could take the community\u2019s comments  into account when developing the NPRM for the New Starts program. In  addition, FTA held multiple listening sessions across the country, during  which officials told project sponsors about proposed changes to the New  Starts program and their rationale for implementing these changes. Most  of the project sponsors and industry representatives we interviewed told  us that they appreciated FTA\u2019s efforts to solicit their feedback and to  encourage an open discussion about the proposed changes.", "Finally, we have identified steps for increasing the accountability of the  New Starts and JARC programs. For example, we previously reported that  outcome evaluations of completed transit and highway projects were not  usually conducted to determine whether proposed outcomes were  achieved. We noted that because outcome evaluations are not usually  completed, agencies miss an opportunity to learn from the successes and  shortcomings of past projects to better inform future planning and  decision making and increase accountability for results. FTA also  identified such evaluations as an opportunity to hold agencies accountable  for results and identify lessons learned, and therefore, starting in fiscal  year 2003, FTA required project sponsors to complete before and after  studies for completed New Starts projects. SAFETEA-LU codified the  requirement for before and after studies, and required that these studies  (1) describe and analyze the impacts of the new fixed guideway capital  project on transit services and transit ridership, (2) evaluate the  consistency of predicted and actual project characteristics and  performance, and (3) identify sources of differences between predicted  and actual outcomes. In addition, SAFETEA-LU included several  provisions, including the following, that emphasize the accuracy and  consistency of project cost and ridership estimates in the New Starts  process:    SAFETEA-LU requires the Secretary of Transportation to consider the  reliability of the forecasting methods used by New Starts project sponsors  and their contractors to estimate costs and ridership as part of the New  Starts evaluation process.", "SAFETEA-LU allows the Secretary of Transportation to provide a higher  grant percentage than requested by the project sponsor if the net cost of  the project is not more than 10 percent higher than the net cost estimated  at the time the project was approved for advancement into preliminary  engineering and the ridership estimated for the project is not less than 90  percent of the ridership estimated for the project at the time the project  was approved for advancement into preliminary engineering.", "SAFETEA-LU requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit an annual  report to congressional committees analyzing the consistency and  accuracy of cost and ridership estimates made by contractors to public  transportation agencies developing new projects.", "Likewise, we have raised issues associated with FTA\u2019s measurement of the  JARC program\u2019s results and made recommendations for improvement. In  April 2002, we testified that FTA had not yet completed its evaluation of  the JARC program or reported to Congress, as TEA-21 required. We also  expressed concerns about FTA\u2019s plan to evaluate the program using one  performance measure\u2014the number of accessible employment sites\u2014 because it would not allow FTA to fully address key aspects of the  program or criteria for selecting grantees. We reiterated these concerns in  our December 2002 report and recommended that FTA report to Congress  on the results of its evaluation of JARC, as required by law, and consider  as part of its evaluation of the effectiveness of the JARC program in  meeting both of its goals. Our most recent review of the JARC program  concluded that the data used in FTA\u2019s 2003 evaluation of the JARC  program lacked the consistent, generalizable, and complete information  needed to draw any definitive conclusions about the program as a whole.  According to FTA, it has faced obstacles in evaluating the JARC program  primarily because grantees have had difficulty collecting and reporting  information on their programs. SAFETEA-LU requires the Secretary of  Transportation to evaluate the JARC program and submit a report  describing the results of this study to Congress by August 2008.  Specifically, the Secretary must conduct a study to evaluate the  effectiveness of the grant program and the effectiveness of recipients  making grants to subrecipients. FTA has already begun to take some steps  to meet its evaluation requirements, even prior to issuing its final program  guidance. These steps may also address some of the concerns we  previously raised about FTA\u2019s evaluation of the JARC program. For  example, FTA has identified new performance measures and goals,  developed a preliminary performance evaluation framework to guide its  data collection efforts, and is currently in the process of researching  options for simplifying its data collection system and reducing the  reporting requirements for grantees.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
