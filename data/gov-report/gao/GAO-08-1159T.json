Since fiscal year 2000, DOD significantly increased the number of major defense acquisition programs and its overall investment in them. During this same time period, the performance of the DOD portfolio has gotten worse. The total acquisition cost of DOD's 2007 portfolio of major programs under development or in production has grown by nearly $300 billion over initial estimates. Current programs are also experiencing, on average, a 21-month delay in delivering initial capabilities to the warfighter--often forcing DOD to spend additional funds on maintaining legacy systems. Systemic problems both at the strategic and at the program level underlie cost growth and schedule delays. At the strategic level, DOD's processes for identifying warfighter needs, allocating resources, and developing and procuring weapon systems--which together define DOD's overall weapon system investment strategy--are fragmented and broken. At the program level, weapon system programs are initiated without sufficient knowledge about system requirements, technology, and design maturity. Lacking such knowledge, managers rely on assumptions that are consistently too optimistic, exposing programs to significant and unnecessary risks and ultimately cost growth and schedule delays. Our work shows that acquisition problems will likely persist until DOD provides a better foundation for buying the right things, the right way. This involves making tough decisions as to which programs should be pursued, and more importantly, not pursued; making sure programs can be executed; locking in requirements before programs are ever started; and making it clear who is responsible for what and holding people accountable when responsibilities are not fulfilled. Recent congressionally mandated changes to the DOD acquisition system, as well as initiatives being pursued by the department, include positive steps that, if implemented properly, could provide a foundation for establishing a well balanced investment strategy, sound business cases for major weapon system acquisition programs, and a better chance to spend resources wisely. At the same time, DOD must begin making better choices that reflect joint capability needs and match requirements with resources. DOD investment decisions cannot continue to be dictated by the military services who propose programs that overpromise capabilities and underestimate costs to capture the funding needed to start and sustain development programs. To better ensure warfighter capabilities are delivered when needed and as promised, incentives must encourage a disciplined, knowledge-based approach, and a true partnership with shared goals must be developed among the department, the military services, the Congress, and the defense industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) management of its major weapon system acquisitions\u2014an area that  has been on GAO\u2019s high risk list since 1990.

Put  simply, cost growth reduces DOD\u2019s buying power. As program costs  increase, DOD must request more funding to cover the overruns, make  trade-offs with existing programs, delay the start of new programs, or take  funds from other accounts. Delays in providing capabilities to the  warfighter result in the need to operate costly legacy systems longer than  expected, find alternatives to fill capability gaps, or go without the  capability.

Ultimately, the  process produces more demand for new programs than available  resources can support. This imbalance promotes an unhealthy competition  for funds that encourages programs to pursue overly ambitious  capabilities, develop unrealistically low cost estimates and optimistic  schedules, and to suppress bad news. Similarly, DOD\u2019s funding process  does not produce an accurate picture of the department\u2019s future resource  needs for individual programs\u2014in large part because it allows programs to  go forward with unreliable cost estimates and lengthy development  cycles\u2014not a sound basis for allocating resources and ensuring program  stability.

Our  body of work in best practices has found that an executable business case  is one that provides demonstrated evidence that (1) the identified needs  are real and necessary and that they can best be met with the chosen  concept and (2) the chosen concept can be developed and produced  within existing resources\u2014including technologies, funding, time, and  management capacity. Although DOD has taken steps to revise its  acquisition policies and guidance to reflect the benefits of a knowledge- based approach, we have found no evidence of widespread adoption of  such an approach in the department. Our most recent assessment of major  weapon systems found that the vast majority of programs began  development with unexecutable business cases, and did not attain, or plan  to achieve, adequate levels of knowledge before reaching design review  and production start\u2014the two key junctures in the process following  development start (see figure 2).", "Knowledge gaps are largely the result of a lack of disciplined systems  engineering analysis prior to beginning system development. Systems  engineering translates customer needs into specific product requirements  for which requisite technological, software, engineering, and production  capabilities can be identified through requirements analysis, design, and  testing. Early systems engineering provides knowledge that enables a  developer to identify and resolve gaps before product development begins.  Because the government often does not perform the proper up-front  analysis to determine whether its needs can be met, significant contract  cost increases can occur as the scope of the requirements change or  become better understood by the government and contractor. Not only  does DOD not typically conduct disciplined systems engineering prior to  beginning system development, it has allowed new requirements to be  added well into the acquisition cycle. The acquisition environment  encourages launching ambitious product developments that embody more  technical unknowns and less knowledge about the performance and  production risks they entail. A new weapon system is not likely to be  approved unless it promises the best capability and appears affordable  within forecasted available funding levels. We have recently reported on  the negative impact that poor systems engineering practices have had on  several programs such as the Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System,   F-22A, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff  Missile and others.", "With high levels of uncertainty about technologies, design, and  requirements, program cost estimates and related funding needs are often  understated, effectively setting programs up for failure. We recently  compared the service and independent cost estimates for 20 major weapon  system programs and found that the independent estimate was higher in  nearly every case, but the difference between the estimates was typically  not significant. We also found that both estimates were too low in most  cases, and the knowledge needed to develop realistic cost estimates was  often lacking. For example, program Cost Analysis Requirements  Description documents\u2014used to build the program cost estimate\u2014are not  typically based on demonstrated knowledge and therefore provide a shaky  foundation for estimating costs. Cost estimates have proven to be off by  billions of dollars in some of the programs we reviewed. For example, the  initial Cost Analysis Improvement Group estimate for the Expeditionary  Fighting Vehicle program was about $1.4 billion compared to a service  estimate of about $1.1 billion, but development costs for the system are  now expected to be close to $3.6 billion. Estimates this far off the mark do  not provide the necessary foundation for sufficient funding commitments  and realistic long-term planning.", "When DOD consistently allows unsound, unexecutable programs to pass  through the requirements, funding, and acquisition processes,  accountability suffers. Program managers cannot be held accountable  when the programs they are handed already have a low probability of  success. In addition, they are not empowered to make go or no-go  decisions, have little control over funding, cannot veto new requirements,  and they have little authority over staffing. At the same time, program  managers frequently change during a program\u2019s development.", "Limiting the length of development cycles would make it easier to more  accurately estimate costs, predict the future funding needs, effectively  allocate resources, and hold decision makers accountable. We have  consistently emphasized the need for DOD\u2019s weapon programs to establish  shorter development cycles. DOD\u2019s conventional acquisition process often  requires as many as 10 or 15 years to get from program start to production.  Such lengthy cycle times promote program instability\u2014especially when  considering DOD\u2019s tendency to change requirements and funding as well  as leadership. Constraining cycle times to 5 or 6 years would force  programs to conduct more detailed systems engineering analyses, lend  itself to fully funding programs to completion, and thereby increasing the  likelihood that their requirements can be met within established time  frames and available resources. An assessment of DOD\u2019s acquisition  system commissioned by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2006 similarly  found that programs should be time-constrained to reduce pressure on  investment accounts and increase funding stability for all programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Way Forward: Potential Solutions", "paragraphs": ["Our work shows that acquisition problems will likely persist until DOD  provides a better foundation for buying the right things, the right way.

We have made similar recommendations in past GAO reports,  but DOD has disagreed with some and not fully implemented others.", "These changes will not be easy to make. They will require DOD to  reexamine not only its acquisition process, but its requirement setting and  funding processes as well.

More specifically, this means assuring requirements for specific weapon  systems are clearly defined and achievable given available resources and  that all alternatives have been considered. System requirements should be  agreed to by service acquisition executives as well as combatant  commanders. Once programs begin, requirements should not change  without assessing their potential disruption to the program and assuring  that they can be accommodated within time and funding constraints. In  addition, DOD should prove that technologies can work as intended before  including them in acquisition programs. More ambitious technology  development efforts should be assigned to the science and technology  community until they are ready to be added to future generations of the  product. DOD should also require the use of independent cost estimates as  a basis for budgeting funds. Our work over the past 10 years has  consistently shown when these basic steps are taken, programs are better  positioned to be executed within cost and schedule.", "To keep programs executable, DOD should demand that all milestone  decisions be based on quantifiable data and demonstrated knowledge.  These data should cover critical program facets such as cost, schedule,  technology readiness, design readiness, production readiness, and  relationships with suppliers. Development should not be allowed to  proceed until certain knowledge thresholds are met\u2014for example, a high  percentage of engineering drawings completed at critical design review.  DOD\u2019s current policies encourage these sorts of metrics to be used as a  basis for decision making, but they do not demand it. DOD should also  place boundaries on the time allowed for system development.", "To further ensure that programs can be executed, DOD should pursue an  evolutionary path toward meeting user needs rather than attempting to  satisfy all needs in a single step. This approach has been consistently used  by successful commercial companies we have visited over the past decade  because it provides program managers with more achievable  requirements, which, in turn, facilitate shorter cycle times. With shorter  cycle times, the companies we have studied have also been able to assure  that program managers and senior leaders stay with programs throughout  the duration of a program.", "DOD has policies that encourage evolutionary development, but programs  often favor pursuing more revolutionary, exotic solutions that will attract  funds and support. The department and, more importantly, the military  services, tend to view success as capturing the funding needed to start and  sustain a development program. In order to do this, they must overpromise  capability and underestimate cost. In order for DOD to move forward, this  view of success must change. World-class commercial firms identify  success as developing products within cost estimates and delivering them  on time in order to survive in the marketplace.

Past efforts have had similar goals, yet we continue to find all  too often that DOD\u2019s investment decisions are too service- and program- centric and that the military services overpromise capabilities and  underestimate costs to capture the funding needed to start and sustain  development programs. This acquisition environment has been  characterized in many different ways. For example, some have described it  as a \u201cconspiracy of hope,\u201d in which industry is encouraged to propose  unrealistic cost estimates, optimistic performance, and understated  technical risks during the proposal process and DOD is encouraged to  accept these proposals as the foundation for new programs.

DOD and the military services cannot continue to view success  through this prism.", "More legislation can be enacted and policies can be written, but until DOD  begins making better choices that reflect joint capability needs and  matches requirements with resources, the acquisition environment will  continue to produce poor outcomes. It should not be necessary to take  extraordinary steps to ensure needed capabilities are delivered to the  warfighter on time and within costs. Executable programs should be the  natural outgrowth of a disciplined, knowledge-based process. While DOD\u2019s  current policy supports a knowledge-based, evolutionary approach to  acquiring new weapons, in practice decisions made on individual  programs often sacrifice knowledge and realism in favor of revolutionary  solutions.
