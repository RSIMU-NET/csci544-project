For example, in fiscal year 2012, each state was to receive a minimum of approximately $2.74 million, with each state receiving additional funds based on its relative risk score. Conversely, UASI grant awards are made based on its FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model, which ranks each urban area relative to others in that year, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership decisions on how funding should be allocated.

More recently in 2018, FEMA added additional factors to better assess vulnerability in each state and urban area, such as the number of special events where large crowds gather and soft targets susceptible to lone wolf attacks, among other things. However, GAO found that FEMA does not fully utilize scientific practices recognized by the National Research Council and the Office of Management and Budget as best practices.

In fiscal year 2013, FEMA shifted its UASI grant funding to a  process referred to as \u201cfunding bands.\u201d In fiscal year 2018, for example,  UASI grantees such as Orlando, Florida; Hampton Roads, Virginia; and  San Antonio, Texas each received a $1.5 million UASI grant, whereas a  grouping of UASI grantees that included Sacramento, California;  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Oregon each received $2.5  million.", "According to FEMA officials, grouping jurisdictions with similar risk scores  into funding bands is an effort to stabilize and retain grantees\u2019 funding  levels over multiple years, as annual UASI grants will fund projects that  are multiyear investments and carried out over a 24 to 36-month  performance period. For example, if one jurisdiction increased by four  ranks and another jurisdiction in the same group dropped six ranks, the  two jurisdictions would stay in the same funding band if the overall risk  scores remained close together. The purpose of the funding bands is to  ensure that some consistency in funding exists for jurisdictions, given  minor changes in the relative risk ranking. FEMA looks at the natural risk  breaks and historical grant allocation data for each year. For example,  each year FEMA presents for consideration by DHS leadership the  historical funding and the number of urban areas that have been placed in  specific funding bands in prior grant years, if any, and the differences  between the relative risk scores in the current fiscal year.

Additionally, the NRC recommended that all risk  models undergo verification and validation\u2014or a sensitivity analysis at the  least\u2014of its risk-based grant assessment model. Finally, the NRC  recommended that FEMA should undertake an external peer review by  technical experts outside of DHS, and review its risk-informed formulas in  order to identify issues such as logic flaws, evaluate the ramifications of  the choices of weightings and parameters, and improve the risk model\u2019s  transparency. However, FEMA has not fully adopted these scientific  practices for its risk-based grant assessment model.", "Documentation: FEMA documentation on the sources of data used for  the model\u2019s calculations does not include information that would enable a  reviewer to understand the underlying assumptions that form the basis for  its risk-based grant assessment model\u2014such as the size of the weights  assigned to Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequence, or the justification  for changes to these weights from one year to the next. FEMA officials  stated that they focus their limited time and resources on developing the  executive summary-level materials that DHS leadership will use to  determine final grant eligibility and grant allocation amounts. Also, to a  lesser extent, FEMA officials said they rely on the expertise of the subject  matter experts from DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and DHS\u2019s  National Protection and Preparedness Division\u2019s Office of Cyber and  Infrastructure Analysis, parts of DHS that contribute to the annual risk  assessment process.", "In April 2018, we identified documentation as one of the key  methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic  analysis. Specifically, the elements include that the analysis is clearly  written with a plain language summary, has clearly labeled tables that  describe the data used and results, and has a conclusion that is  consistent with these results. The analysis cites all sources used and  documents that it is based on the best available economic information.  The analysis documents that it complies with a robust quality assurance  process and, where applicable, the Information Quality Act, and should  disclose the use and contributions of contractors and outside consultants.  FEMA officials agreed with our analysis of FEMA\u2019s supporting  documentation, and officials stated that maintaining additional  documentation could further assist reviewers. Documenting how subject  matter expert assumptions are made would help FEMA increase the  transparency of the model for key internal and external stakeholders.", "In-Depth Analyses: Similarly, we could not determine whether FEMA  sufficiently performed all the analyses of the model\u2019s sensitivity needed to  determine how changes to its risk-based grant assessment model could  affect the resulting risk scores. FEMA officials stated that they have only  analyzed the effect of a data element when it has been added to the  model (e.g.: the Soft Target Index in 2018). Further, FEMA officials were  unable to provide us with documentation on their sensitivity analyses  processes or their results.", "DHS\u2019s Risk Lexicon states that sensitivity analysis can be used to  examine how individual variables can affect the outputs of risk  assessment methodologies. In addition, OMB Circular A-94 recommends  that the outcomes from a risk model should be analyzed to determine  how sensitive such outcomes are to changes in the model\u2019s  assumptions. The assumptions that deserve the most attention will  depend on the dominant elements and the areas of greatest uncertainty  of the program being analyzed. In addition, research in the actuarial  sciences also states that sensitivity analysis \u201cis of fundamental  importance to risk analysts, especially in the presence of complex  computational models with uncertain inputs.\u201d", "As we stated earlier, understanding the extent that uncertainty has on the  results of the model can be especially important if the model produces  materially different results in response to even small changes in  assumptions\u2014often referred to as the \u201csensitivity\u201d or \u201crobustness\u201d of a  model\u2019s assumptions and results. We have reported on FEMA\u2019s risk- based grant assessment model in June 2008 and March 2013, where we  found grant years when the risk model was sensitive to even small  changes. For example, we noted that a potential increase or decrease  in a measure would have resulted in one urban area displacing the  eligibility of another, thereby potentially shifting funding as well. FEMA  officials stated that they focus their limited time and resources on  developing the executive summary-level materials that DHS leadership  will use to determine final grant eligibility and grant allocation amounts.  FEMA officials agreed that they could better document the steps used in  their analyses across all the model\u2019s measures and weights so that a  complete understanding of potential impacts are documented and can be  made available to leadership when making decisions about changes.", "FEMA\u2019s implementation of sensitivity analyses could help the agency to  assess changes to the risk-based grant assessment model including the  introduction of new data elements into Threat, Vulnerability, and  Consequence indexes, the modifications to how existing data elements  are calculated, and the changing of the weights assigned to the Threat,  Vulnerability, and Consequence indexes. Further, FEMA\u2019s  implementation of sensitivity analyses has the ability to show decision  makers the impact or predicted impact of adjustments to FEMA\u2019s risk- based grant assessment model, including with potential shifts in funding  towards or away from certain grantees.", "Use of External Peer Review: FEMA has not subjected its risk-based  grant assessment model to a peer review by independent, external  technical experts, as previously recommended in 2010 by the NRC.  According to FEMA officials, its risk assessment methodology has  undergone comprehensive internal reconsideration over time to better  reflect real-world scenarios, but such reviews have not included external  peer reviews. FEMA officials stated that its risk-based grant assessment  model has gone through past reviews including a review as part of DHS\u2019s  quadrennial review in 2014, and the model is reviewed by internal subject  matter experts from DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and DHS\u2019s  National Protection and Preparedness Division\u2019s Office of Cyber and  Infrastructure Analysis as part of the annual risk assessment process.  FEMA officials stated that the agency is exploring the possibility of  participating in a DHS collaborative group to internally review and provide  feedback on the model\u2019s underlying assumptions and methods. Such a  group could review the underlying components of the current risk-based  grant assessment model and suggest improvements, as well as present  and evaluate other risk assessment theories and approaches. FEMA  officials told us they have encountered time and resources constraints on  establishing an external peer review process.", "As we have previously reported, independent external peer reviews can  increase the probability of success by improving the technical quality of  projects and the credibility of the decision-making process, and provide  reasonable assurance that the agency\u2019s approach is reproducible and  defensible. In addition, in December 2004, OMB issued the  memorandum \u201cFinal Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review\u201d which  established government-wide guidance aimed at enhancing the practice  of peer review of government science documents. OMB noted that peer  review can increase the quality and credibility of the scientific information  generated across the federal government, which was an effort to improve  the quality of the scientific information upon which policy decisions are  based. OMB also noted that, while peer review may take a variety of  forms, agencies will need to consider at least the following issues when  coordinating an external peer review: individual versus panel review;  timing; scope of the review; selection of reviewers; disclosure and  attribution; public participation; disposition of reviewer comments; and  adequacy of prior peer review.", "These scientific processes are designed to help decision makers better  understand the impact or predicted impact of risk management  alternatives, and provide greater confidence in the reliability of the risk  assessment model\u2019s results.

Decreased funding levels for SHSP and UASI  grant programs have increased the importance of using risk management  techniques to more effectively target finite federal dollars. DHS and FEMA  have strengthened its risk-based grant assessment model for allocating  grants, taking into account analysis and recommendations from a variety  of reviews. These improvements include the addition of a Vulnerability  Index and modifications to the Threat Index. We have identified  opportunities where FEMA could strengthen its scientific practices. First,  documenting the model\u2019s underlying assumptions and the results of  sensitivity analysis can assist decision makers in better understanding the  predicted impact of risk management alternatives. Second, expanding the  use of sensitivity analysis could further enhance the model. Developing a  greater understanding of the how uncertainty affects its risk-based grant  assessment model\u2019s results helps achieve the objectives of risk  management. Third, coordinating an independent external peer review of  the methodology of its risk-based grant assessment model would better  position the agency to provide reasonable assurance that FEMA\u2019s risk  model and grant allocation approach that FEMA uses for its SHSP and  UASI programs are reasonable, of high-quality, and credible.
