The current administration has taken several steps to strengthen and further the performance-resource linkage by making budget and performance integration one of its five management initiatives included in the President's Management Agenda. GAO has reported and testified numerous times on agencies' progress in making clearer connections between resources and results and how this information can inform budget deliberations.

Building on agencies' hard-won achievements in developing plans and measures, the government faces the challenge of promoting the use of that information in budget decision making, program improvement, and agency management. More explicit use of performance information in decision making promises significant rewards, but it will not be easy. Decision makers need a road map that defines what successful performance budgeting would look like, and identifies key elements and potential pitfalls. Credible performance information and measures are critical for building support for performance budgeting. For performance data to more fully inform resource allocation decisions, decision makers must feel comfortable with the appropriateness and accuracy of the outcome information and measures presented--that is, that they are comprehensive and valid indicators of a program's outcomes. Decision makers likely will not use performance information that they do not perceive to be credible, reliable, and reflective of a consensus about performance goals among a community of interested parties. The quality and credibility of outcome-based performance information and the ability of federal agencies to evaluate and demonstrate their programs' effectiveness are key to the success of performance budgeting. Successful performance budgeting is predicated on aligning performance goals with key management activities. The closer the linkage between an agency's performance goals, its budget presentation, and its net cost statement, the greater the reinforcement of performance management throughout the agency and the greater the reliability of budgetary and financial data associated with performance plans. Clearer and closer association between expected performance and budgetary requests can more explicitly inform budget discussions and shift the focus from inputs to expected results. The test of performance budgeting will be its potential to reshape the kinds of questions and trade-offs that are considered throughout the budget process. The real payoff will come in strengthening the budget process itself. The focus on outcomes potentially can broaden the debate and elevate budget trade-offs from individual programs to a discussion of how programs work together to achieve national goals. It is critical to understand how programs fit within a broader portfolio of tools and strategies for program delivery. Shifting perspectives from incremental budgeting to consideration of all resources available to a program, that is, base funding as well as new funds, potentially can lead to a reexamination of existing programs, policies, and activities. Prudent stewardship of our nation's resources is essential not only to meeting today's priorities, but also for delivering on future commitments and needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss efforts to further integrate budget  and performance information\u2014what many have referred to as  \u201cperformance budgeting.\u201d Since the Government Performance and Results  Act (GPRA) was enacted in 1993, federal agencies have been increasingly  expected to focus on achieving results and to demonstrate, in performance  plans and reports, how their activities help achieve agency goals.

The Scorecard criteria for the budget and  performance integration initiative include elements such as the integration  of budget and planning staff, an integrated performance plan and budget  grounded in outcome goals and aligned with the staff and resources  necessary to achieve program targets, and whether the agency can  document program effectiveness.

It can also provide information on what  outcomes are being achieved, whether resource investments have benefits  that exceed their costs, and whether program managers have the requisite  capacities to achieve promised results.", "Although performance budgeting can reasonably be expected to change the  nature of resource debates, it is equally important to understand what it  cannot do. Previous management reforms have been doomed by inflated  and unrealistic expectations, so it is useful to be clear about current goals.", "Performance budgeting cannot replace the budget process as it currently  exists, but it can help shift the focus of budgetary debates and oversight  activities by changing the agenda of questions asked in these processes.  Budgeting is essentially the allocation of resources; it inherently involves  setting priorities. In its broadest sense, the budget debate is the place  where competing claims and claimants come together to decide how much  of the government\u2019s scarce resources will be allocated across many  compelling national purposes. Performance information can make a  valuable contribution to this debate, but it is only one factor and it cannot  substitute for difficult political choices. There will always be a debate  about the appropriate role for the federal government and the need for  various federal programs and policies\u2014and performance information  cannot settle that debate. It can, however, help move the debate to a more  informed plane, one in which the focus is on competing claims and  priorities. In fact, it raises the stakes by shifting the focus to what really  matters\u2014lives saved, children fed, successful transitions to self- sufficiency, and individuals lifted out of poverty.", "Under performance budgeting, people should not expect that good results  will always be rewarded through the budget process while poor results will  always have negative funding implications. Viewing performance budgeting  as a mechanistic arrangement\u2014a specific level of performance in exchange  for a certain amount of funding\u2014or in punitive terms\u2014produce results or  risk funding reductions\u2014is not useful. Such mechanistic relationships  cannot be sustained. Rather than increase accountability, these approaches  might instead devalue the process by favoring managers who meet  expectations by aiming low.  The determination of priorities is a function of  competing values and interests that may be informed by performance  information but also reflects such factors as equity, unmet needs, and the  appropriate role of the federal government in addressing these needs.", "OMB\u2019s PART initiative illustrated that improving program design and  management may be a necessary investment in some cases. For example,  the Department of Energy\u2019s Environmental Management (Cleanup)  program was rated \u201cineffective\u201d under PART. The administration  recommended additional funds for the program compared to fiscal year  2002 funding and reported that the Department will continue to work with  federal and state regulators to develop revised cleanup plans.

Likewise, GAO\u2019s work has noted limitations in the  quality of agency performance and evaluation information and in agency  capacity to produce rigorous evaluations of program effectiveness. We  have previously reported that agencies have had difficulty assessing many  program outcomes that are not quickly achieved or readily observed and  contributions to outcomes that are only partly influenced by federal funds.

To achieve the financial management  improvements envisioned by the CFO Act, FFMIA, and more recently, the  PMA, agencies need to modernize their financial management systems to  generate reliable, useful, and timely financial information throughout the  year and at year-end.

Through GPRA  reporting, agencies have increased the information available on program  results.

However, in survey based on 1995  data covering 23 departments and independent agencies, we found that  agencies were devoting variable but relatively small amounts of resources  to evaluating program results. Many program evaluation offices were small,  had other responsibilities, and produced only a few effectiveness studies  annually. Moreover, systematic program evaluations\u2014and units  responsible for producing them\u2014had been concentrated in only a few  agencies. Although many federal programs attempt to influence complex  systems or events outside the immediate control of government, we have  expressed continued concern that many agencies lack the capacity to  undertake the program evaluations that are often needed to assess a  federal program\u2019s contributions to results where other influences may be at  work. In addition to information on the outcomes, impact evaluations using  scientific research methods are needed to isolate a particular program\u2019s  contribution to those outcomes. Yet in our survey, we found that the most  commonly reported study design was judgmental assessment of program  effects. These judgmental assessments, one-time surveys, and simple  before-and-after studies accounted for 40 percent of the research methods  used in agencies\u2019 evaluation studies conducted during the period we  studied.", "There are inherent challenges affecting agencies\u2019 capacity to conduct  evaluations of program effectiveness. For example, many agency programs  are designed to be one part of a broader effort, working alongside other  federal, state, local, nonprofit, and private initiatives to promote particular  outcomes. Although information on the outcomes associated with a  particular program may be collected, it is often difficult to isolate a  particular program\u2019s contribution to those outcomes. Additionally, where  federal program responsibility has devolved to the states, federal agencies\u2019  ability to influence program outcomes diminishes, while at the same time,  their dependence on states and others for data with which to evaluate  programs grows.", "In past reports, we have identified several promising ways agencies can  potentially maximize their evaluation capacity. For example, careful  targeting of federal evaluation resources on key policy or performance  questions and leveraging federal and nonfederal resources show promise  for addressing key questions about program results. Other ways agencies  might leverage their current evaluation resources include adapting existing  information systems to yield data on program results, drawing on the  findings of a wide array of evaluations and audits, making multiple use of  an evaluation\u2019s findings, mining existing databases, and collaborating with  state and local program partners to develop mutually useful performance  data.", "Our work has also shown that advance coordination of evaluation activities  conducted by program partners is necessary to help ensure that the results  of diverse evaluation activities can be synthesized at the national level.", "Improvements in the quality of performance data and the capacity of  federal agencies to perform program evaluations will require sustained  commitment and investment of resources, but over the longer term, failing  to discover and correct performance problems can be much more costly.

The history of performance budgeting has shown that the  supply of information will wither if it is perceived to have failed to affect  decision making. Accordingly, PART may complement GPRA\u2019s focus on  increasing the supply of credible performance information by promoting  the demand for this information in the budget decision making process.", "Successful use of performance information in budgeting should not be  defined only by the impact on funding levels in presidential budget requests  and the congressional budget process. Rather, resource allocation  decisions are made at various other stages in the budget process, such as  agency internal budget formulation and execution and in the congressional  oversight and reauthorization process. If agency program managers  perceive that program performance and evaluation data will be used to  make resource decisions throughout the resource allocation process and  can help them make better use of these resources, agencies may make  greater investments in improving their capacity to produce and procure  quality information. For example, in our work at the Administration on  Children and Families, we describe three general ways in which resource  allocation decisions at the programmatic level are influenced by  performance: (1) training and technical assistance money is often allocated  based on needs and grantee performance, (2) partnerships and  collaboration help the agency work with grantees towards common goals  and further the administration\u2019s agenda, and (3) organizing and allocating  staff around agency goals allow employees to link their day-to-day  activities to longer-term results and outcomes.

Moreover, these structures can vary considerably across the  departments and agencies of the federal government. For example, the  current budget account structure was not created as a single integrated  framework, but developed over time to reflect the many roles it has been  asked to play and to address the diverse needs of its many users. It reflects  a variety of different orientations which for the most part do not reflect  agency performance goals or objectives. Agency budget accounts, for  instance, can be organized by items of expense, organizational unit,  program, or a combination of these categories.", "The general lack of integration between these structures can hamper the  ability of agencies to establish and demonstrate the linkage between  budget decisions and performance goals. While special analyses can help  illustrate these linkages, such efforts are often burdensome and awkward.  A systematic capacity to crosswalk among these disparate structures can  help encourage a more seamless integration of resources with results.  Better matching of full costs associated with performance goals helps  increase decision makers\u2019 understanding of the links between requested  resources and expected performance outcomes. This will eventually  require linkages between performance planning and budget structures (to  highlight how requested resources would contribute to agency goals) as  well as linkages between performance plans and financial reporting  structures (to highlight the costs of achieving agency goals). Ultimately,  over the longer term, this integration may require changing the structures  themselves to harmonize their orientations.", "Our work indicates that progress has been made. Agencies are developing  approaches to better link performance plans with budget presentations and  financial reporting. They have made progress in both in establishing  linkages between performance plans and budget requests and in translating  those linkages into budgetary terms by clearly allocating funding from the  budget\u2019s program activities to performance goals.", "For example, table 1 and figure 2 show the approaches used by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in its last three  performance plans. In table 1, for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, HUD used  summary charts to array its requested resources by general goal but  progressed from portraying this linkage with an \u201cx\u201d in fiscal year 2000 to  using funding estimates derived from its budget request in fiscal year 2001.  Figure 2 shows the fiscal year 2002 plan in which HUD removed the  summary charts and instead directly portrayed the linkages in the body of  the plan.", "We have also seen progress in agencies\u2019 initial efforts to link annual  performance reporting with annual audited financial statements. For  example, for fiscal year 2000, 13 of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act,  compared to 10 in fiscal year 1999, reported net costs in their audited  annual financial statements using a structure that was based on their  performance planning structure.", "Better understanding the full costs associated with program outcomes is  another important but underdeveloped element of performance budgeting.  This entails a broader effort to more fully measure the indirect and accrued  costs of federal programs. The administration has proposed that agencies  be charged for the government\u2019s full share of the accruing costs of all  pension and retiree health benefits for their employees as those benefits  are earned.  Such a proposal could help better reflect the full costs accrued  in a given year by federal programs.", "Recognizing long-term costs is also important to understanding the future  sustainability and flexibility of the government\u2019s fiscal position.

We have continued to point out that the  federal government is a long way from successfully implementing the  statutory reforms of the 1990s.

As part of this  oversight, Congress should consider the associated management and  policy implications of crosscutting programs.", "Given this environment, Congress should also consider the need for  processes that allow it to more systematically focus its oversight on  programs with the most serious and systemic weaknesses and risks. At  present, Congress has no direct vehicle to provide its perspective on  governmentwide performance issues. Congress has no established  mechanism to articulate performance goals for the broad missions of  government, to assess alternative strategies that offer the most promise for  achieving these goals, or to define an oversight agenda targeted at the most  pressing crosscutting performance and management issues. Congress  might consider whether a more structured oversight approach is needed to  permit a coordinated congressional perspective on governmentwide  performance matters. Such a process might also facilitate congressional  input into the OMB PART initiative. For example, although the selection of  programs and areas for review is ultimately the President\u2019s decision, such  choices might be informed and shaped by congressional views and  perspectives on performance issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["How would \u201csuccess\u201d in performance budgeting be defined? Simply  increasing the supply of performance information is not enough. If the  information is not used\u2014that is, if there is insufficient demand\u2014the quality  of the information will deteriorate and the process either will become rote  or will wither away. However, for the reasons noted, the success of  performance budgeting cannot be measured merely by the number of  programs \u201ckilled\u201d or a measurement of funding changes against  performance \u201cgrades.\u201d Rather, success must be measured in terms of the  quality of the discussion, the transparency of the information, the  meaningfulness of that information to key stakeholders, and how it is used  in the decision-making process. If members of Congress and the executive  branch have better information about the link between resources and  results, they can make the trade-offs and choices cognizant of the many  and often competing claims at the federal level.", "A comprehensive understanding of the needs of all participants in the  budget process, including what measures and performance information are  required at different stages of the budget cycle, is critical. Making  performance budgeting a reality throughout the federal government will be  facilitated by efforts to improve the structural alignment of performance  planning goals with budget and cost accounting structures and  presentations. However, developing credible performance measures and  data on program results will be absolutely critical in determining whether  the performance perspective becomes a compelling framework that  decsion makers will use in allocating resources.", "Performance budgeting is difficult work. It requires taking a hard look at  existing programs and carefully reconsidering the goals those programs  were intended to address\u2014and whether those goals are still valid. It  involves analyzing the effectiveness of programs and seeking out the  reasons for success or failure. It involves navigating through the maze of  federal programs and activities, in which multiple agencies may operate  many different programs, to address often common or complementary  objectives. However, the task of revising and reforming current programs  and activities that may no longer be needed or that do not perform well is  fraught with difficulties and leads to real \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d  Notwithstanding demonstrated weaknesses in program design and  shortfalls in program results, there often seems to be little \u201clow hanging  fruit\u201d in the federal budget. In fact, some argue that because some  programs are already \u201cin the base\u201d in budgetary terms, they have a  significant advantage over new initiatives and new demands."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
