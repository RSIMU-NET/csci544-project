This testimony is based on GAO reports issued in March and July 2017. To do this work GAO reviewed federal trafficking data and conducted three surveys. We surveyed the 203 known tribal LEAs, 86 major city LEAs, and 315 victim service provider organizations that received fiscal year 2015 DOJ or HHS grants that could be used to assist human trafficking victims."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While federal agencies generally maintain data on human trafficking cases that occur in Indian country, they do not maintain data on whether the victims are Native American (Native American status). All four federal agencies that investigate or prosecute human trafficking in Indian country\u2014the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the U.S. Attorneys' Offices\u2014are required to record in their case management systems whether a human trafficking offense was involved in the case. With the exception of ICE, these agencies are also required to record whether the crime took place in Indian country. ICE officials explained that the agency does not record this information because, unlike BIA and the FBI, ICE is not generally involved in criminal investigations in Indian country. Also, officials from the four agencies said they do not maintain data on Native American status of victims for various reasons, including that such data has no impact on their investigations and prosecutions.", "Some law enforcement agencies (LEA) reported encountering human trafficking in Indian country or of Native Americans and cited victim reluctance to participate in investigations and other factors as barriers to investigation and prosecution. Of the 132 tribal LEAs that responded to GAO's survey, 27 reported initiating investigations they considered to have involved human trafficking from 2014 to 2016. Few major city LEAs\u20146 of 61 survey respondents\u2014reported that they encountered human trafficking involving Native American victims from 2014 to 2016. Further, among the 27 responding tribal LEAs, 18 indicated that they believe victims are reluctant to participate in investigations for reasons including drug addiction and distrust of law enforcement.", "The departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Homeland Security (DHS) administered 50 federal grant programs from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 that can be used to address human trafficking in Indian Country or of Native Americans, but DOJ could do more to identify the number of Native American victims served. For example, DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women requires grantees to report Native American status of victims served, but not by type of crime. DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention do not require grantees to collect and report Native American status of victims served. However, in fiscal year 2017, OVC began providing recipients of human trafficking-specific grant programs the option to report the race or Native American status of victims served. While Native American status may not generally be a factor for determining whether a victim can receive services, it may be a factor for determining how best to assist this demographic. GAO recommended that DOJ require its grantees to report the number of human trafficking victims served and, as appropriate, the Native American status of those victims. DOJ agreed to implement the first part of this recommendation, but did not agree to the second part, citing victim confidentiality and other reasons. In June 2017, DOJ reported ongoing and planned actions to better capture the number of victims served but reiterated its concerns about collecting Native American status. GAO maintains that collecting grantee information on both the number and Native American status of victims served is important and will continue to monitor implementation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recently completed work on  human trafficking in Indian country or of Native Americans.", "Human trafficking\u2014the exploitation of a person typically through force,  fraud, or coercion for such purposes as forced labor, involuntary  servitude, or commercial sex\u2014is occurring in the United States.  According to the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal year 2015 annual report to  Congress on human trafficking, traffickers seek out persons perceived to  be vulnerable. Vulnerability comes in many forms, including age  (minors), poverty, homelessness, chemical dependency, prior  experiences of abuse, involvement in foster care programs, and lack of  resources or support systems. Native Americans are a vulnerable  population. For example, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, in  2010, 28 percent of Native Americans were living in poverty, compared to  15 percent of the general population. Also, according to the 2010 National  Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, conducted by the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 27 percent of Native  American women had been raped in their lifetime compared to 18 percent  of American women, overall. In addition, Indian children enter foster care  at twice the rate of all American children.", "My testimony today summarizes our research on human trafficking in  Indian country and of Native Americans, including federal efforts to  address this issue and perspectives from tribal and local law enforcement  agencies and victim service providers.

For the purposes of our  reviews, our discussion of human trafficking relates to: (a) human  trafficking that occurs in Indian country (regardless of whether the victim  is Native American); and (b) human trafficking of individuals who are  Native American (regardless of whether they were trafficked in Indian  country or elsewhere).", "For our March 2017 work on federal agencies\u2019 data collection, we  obtained and reviewed data from federal investigative and prosecutorial  agencies on the number of human trafficking investigations and  prosecutions they conducted for which the crime occurred in Indian  country or at least one of the victims was Native American. We obtained  data for fiscal years 2013 through 2016, the most recently available data.  We determined that the data, when available, were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our reporting objectives. For our July 2017 work on tribal  and major city LEAs\u2019 experiences, we conducted surveys of three groups:  all known tribal LEAs (132 of 203 responded); major city LEAs (61 of 86  responded); and victim service providers (162 of 315 responded). For our  work on federal grant programs, we reviewed fiscal year 2014 and 2015  human trafficking grant programs identified through our prior human  trafficking work and interviewed federal officials responsible for  administering human trafficking-related grant programs to learn whether  the granting agencies required grantees to report whether the victims they  served were Native American (Native American status). Further details on  the scope and methodology for our previously issued reports are  available within each published product. We conducted the work on which  this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

In certain circumstances, state or tribal  law enforcement may have jurisdiction to investigate crimes in Indian  country; therefore, these figures likely do not represent the total number  of human trafficking-related cases in Indian country.

Officials told us that Native  American status of victims is only relevant for Indian country cases  because it is necessary for establishing which law enforcement agency  has jurisdiction over the case. Similarly, FBI officials reported that they  only collect information that is necessary for the investigation, which does  not include the victim\u2019s race or Native American status.
