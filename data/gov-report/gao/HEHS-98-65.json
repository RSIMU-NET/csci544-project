Since its inception, Head Start has served over 16 million children at a total cost of $35 billion. Funding for Head Start has tripled in the past 10 years. In addition, the President recently announced several proposals to help working parents secure affordable, quality child care, including significantly expanding Head Start so it could serve more eligible children.", "Growing out of the War on Poverty in the mid-1960s, Head Start was created to provide comprehensive educational, health, social, and mental health services to disadvantaged preschool children. The program was built on the philosophy that effective intervention in children\u2019s lives can be best accomplished through family and community involvement.", "Much has changed since the mid-1960s, and many questions exist about how the program operates in today\u2019s environment. For example, although it is widely known that Head Start provides a large array of services to children, less is known about the services it provides families and how services are delivered to participants. Head Start regulations emphasize that programs secure and use community resources to provide services before using Head Start funds; however, the extent to which programs secure other funding is not known. Furthermore, upon Head Start\u2019s creation, although it was many communities\u2019 main early childhood program for serving disadvantaged children and their families, other programs now also serve disadvantaged children. Finally, questions exist about how predominantly part-day Head Start programs will adapt to meet the changing needs of the families they serve, particularly in view of the increased need for full-day child care resulting from changes in welfare policy.", "Although Head Start does collect information on all its programs annually, that information does not completely portray Head Start program operations. Head Start collects information on the type and extent of services provided and the types of children and families being served through an annual survey. The program collects no information, however, on the number of hours and months of the year, for example, that children attend center programs. Nor does it collect information on Head Start program income and expenditures or other early childhood programs operating in communities in which Head Start programs operate. Moreover, although Head Start does collect information on the number of families the program serves, it collects no information on the number of individual family members served. Consequently, as the Congress prepares to reexamine the Head Start program in 1998, information needed for answering many questions is unavailable, incomplete, or lacking enough detail to facilitate important decisions about the program.", "To address some of these questions in preparation for Head Start\u2019s reauthorization, we were asked to describe the (1) number and characteristics of those served, (2) services provided and the way they are provided, (3) federal and nonfederal program dollars received and spent by programs delivering Head Start services, and (4) other programs providing similar\u2014in part or in whole\u2014early childhood services. Although many other early childhood programs exist, our review focused solely on programs operating in Head Start service delivery areas and those operated by Head Start agencies.", "The methodology for our study had several components: we (1) surveyed all Head Start programs, (2) analyzed data from Head Start\u2019s annual survey of programs, (3) conducted telephone interviews of a number of programs to gather illustrative information about Head Start programs, and (4) visited several Head Start programs to observe the programs and discuss survey responses. (See app. I for a discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology.) This report presents information on what we call Head Start\u2019s regular program, that is, those programs that operate in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and serve 85 percent of the children. Thus, programs serving special populations\u2014Migrant, Native American, and pregnant women and infants\u2014are excluded. Such programs represent a small percentage of Head Start children served, and each program is unique. Because of this focus, and other reasons discussed in the report, certain figures, such as enrollment data, may differ from Head Start\u2019s official 1996-97 figures.", "The scope of our work for this report excluded several issues. For example, we did not address issues of Head Start program quality, although some early childhood experts and the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion have voiced concern about the uneven quality of some Head Start programs. Nor did we address Head Start\u2019s impact on the lives of those it serves. In a previous report, we examined the research conducted on the program in the past 20 years and found it inadequate to draw conclusions about the impact of the national program.As agreed with your offices, we will be issuing a separate report on how Head Start uses its processes, systems, and performance measures to ensure program and fiscal accountability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Head Start, the centerpiece of federal early childhood programs, was created in 1965 as part of President Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty. Head Start\u2019s primary goal is to improve the social competence of children in low-income families. Social competence is the child\u2019s everyday effectiveness in dealing with both the present environment and later responsibilities in school and life. Social competence involves the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health, nutritional needs, and other factors. To support the social competence goal, Head Start programs deliver a broad range of services to children. These services include educational, medical, nutritional, mental health, dental, and social services. Another essential part of every program is parental involvement in parent education, program planning, and operating activities.", "Head Start programs are governed by performance standards, which set forth the expectations and minimum requirements that all Head Start programs are expected to meet. Program officials expect these standards, however, to be largely self-enforcing, with the exception that Head Start\u2019s 12 regional offices conduct on-site monitoring of Head Start programs every 3 years. The program also has a separate set of performance standards for services for children with disabilities. Both sets of performance standards, which have governed the program since 1975, were revised in the 1990s. Head Start issued performance standards for children with disabilities in 1993. The performance standards for the rest of the programs became effective in January 1998 and attempt to reflect the changing Head Start population, the evolution of best practices, and program experience with the earlier standards.", "Head Start targets children from poor families, and regulations require that at least 90 percent of the children enrolled in each program be low income. By law, certain amounts are set aside for special populations of children, including those with disabilities and Native American and migrant children. The program is authorized to serve children at any age before the age of compulsory school attendance; however, most children enter the program at age 4."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Head Start Has Three Approved Program Options", "paragraphs": ["Head Start programs may be delivered in any of three Head Start-approved program options. One option involves the enrolled child receiving the bulk of Head Start services at a center; however, some home visits are required. Centers operate varying numbers of hours per day for either 4 or 5 days per week. Providing services at children\u2019s homes is a second option. The children receive the bulk of services at home, with some opportunities for them to interact in a group setting. The combination option\u2014the third\u2014 entails both center attendance and home visits. In addition, programs may implement a locally designed option, which, as the name implies, is developed at the local program level. Locally designed options may take many forms, such as family day care homes.", "How are services delivered in a center setting, the most common option? The center may be housed in a church basement, at a parent\u2019s work site, in a public school building, at a college or university, or some other location. A Head Start teacher as well as a second adult instruct the children using a curriculum relevant to and reflective of the needs of the population served. Head Start regulations emphasize that large and small group activities take place throughout the day. Children should be encouraged to solve problems, initiate activities, explore, experiment, question, and gain mastery through learning by doing. In addition to educational services, children receive other services. Meals and snacks are provided as appropriate. Within a certain number of days of entering the program, children receive a thorough health screening and medical and dental examination. This screening may take place on or off site. Program staff ensure that treatment and follow-up services are arranged for all health problems detected. In addition, Head Start staff are expected to visit the children\u2019s homes to assess their and their families\u2019 need for services. For example, these visits may identify the families\u2019 need for services such as emergency assistance or crisis intervention. Staff may also provide families with information about community services and how to use them. During these visits, staff are expected to develop activities for family members to use at home that will reinforce and support the child\u2019s total Head Start experience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Head Start Administration Involves Grantee Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Head Start is administered by HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which includes the Head Start Bureau\u2014one of several under ACF. Grantees, which deliver Head Start services at the local level, numbered about 1,440 in fiscal year 1996. Grantees may contract with organizations\u2014called delegate agencies\u2014in the community to run all or part of their local Head Start programs. Grantees and delegate agencies include public and private school systems, community action agencies and other private nonprofit organizations, local government agencies (primarily cities and counties), and Indian tribes. Unlike some other federal social service programs funded through the states, HHS awards Head Start grants directly to local grantees. HHS distributes Head Start funds using a complex formula, based upon, among other things, previous allotments and the number of children, aged 5 and under, below the poverty line in each state compared with the number in other states. Head Start, a federal matching grant program, requires grantees to typically obtain 20 percent of program costs from nonfederal funds. These funds can be in the form of cash, such as state, county, and private money, or in-kind contributions such as building space and equipment. Head Start regulations require that programs identify, secure, and use community resources in providing services to Head Start children and their families before using Head Start funds for these services. As a result, Head Start programs have established many agreements for services.", "Head Start has served over 16 million children since its inception. The passage of the 1990 Head Start Expansion and Quality Improvement Act resulted in increased funding for Head Start to allow more children the opportunity to participate in Head Start as well as improve the quality of Head Start services. In fiscal year 1996, Head Start received $3.6 billion in funding and served about 752,000 children. This figure reflects children served through all of Head Start\u2019s programs. The regular Head Start program serves children and families residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. About 85 percent of Head Start children are served through the regular Head Start program. Head Start also operates programs for migrant and Native American populations.", "Recognizing that the years from conception to age 3 are critical to human development, the Congress established Early Head Start in 1994. This program targets children under age 3 from low-income families as well as expectant mothers. Since 1967, however, Head Start has served children and families now targeted by the Early Head Start program through Parent Child Centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent GAO Reports on Head Start", "paragraphs": ["In the past 3 years, we have issued several reports on the Head Start program. One report discussed local perspectives on barriers to providing Head Start services. That report, among other things, concluded that Head Start lacked enough qualified staff to meet the complex needs of children and families. Other barriers included a limited availability of health professionals in the community willing to help Head Start staff in providing services and programs having difficulties getting suitable facilities at reasonable costs. In our most recent report, we concluded that the body of research conducted on the Head Start program does not provide information on whether today\u2019s Head Start is making a positive difference in participants\u2019 lives. Specifically, we found that the body of research conducted on the program was inadequate for use in drawing conclusions about the impact of the national program in any area in which Head Start provides services such as school readiness or health-related services. We also stated that no single study of the program used a nationally representative sample so that findings could be generalized to the national program. We recommended that the Secretary of HHS include in HHS\u2019 research plan an assessment of the impact of regular Head Start programs. In commenting on this report, HHS mentioned, among other things, that estimating program impact at the national level is not appropriate because of the extreme variability of local programs. That is, local Head Start sites have great flexibility, and, even though all programs share common goals, they may operate very differently. Thus, HHS considers a single, large-scale, national study of impact to be methodologically inappropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Head Start Serves Both Children and Families", "paragraphs": ["Head Start programs were funded to serve about 701,000 children at any one time in program year 1996-97; however, the number of different children enrolled in the program throughout the 1996-97 program year was about 782,000, which averaged about 454 children per program, ranging from a low of 17 to a high of 6,045. The number of different children enrolled in the program includes children who are funded with all sources of funds, such as those received from state agencies, and who have been enrolled in Head Start for any length of time, even if they dropped out or enrolled late, provided they have attended at least one class or, in home-based programs, received at least one home visit.", "Head Start estimates capacity or the number of children that can be served at any one time in two ways. Total funded enrollment (701,000) is the number of children that can be served at any one time with Head Start grant funds, as well as funds from other sources, such as state agencies. This estimate includes children, regardless of funding source, who are an integral part of the Head Start program and who receive the full array of Head Start services. Head Start-funded enrollment (667,000) is an estimate of the number of children that can be served at any one time with Head Start grant funds only (see table II.1 in app. II for enrollments by state). Although programs are authorized and expected to serve a certain number of children, according to Head Start Bureau officials, local programs may negotiate with their regional offices to adjust their enrollment. Thus, programs may choose to fill fewer slots or establish more slots. To illustrate, a program authorized to serve 50 children may choose to actually serve only 40 children or to serve 60. By serving fewer children, the program can support other enhancements, such as providing employees with full benefits. Head Start Bureau officials also stated that some states have regulations and laws that also affect the number of slots that can be filled. A state that requires training and licensing of its early childhood staff, for example, might be limited in the number of children it could serve if licensed staff cost more. Differences in the cost of living can also affect the number of slots that can be filled.", "In addition, Head Start programs served about 711,000 families of Head Start children, which Head Start regulations define as all people living in the same household who are supported by the income of the parent or guardian and related by blood, marriage, or adoption.", "Head Start does not require that programs count the number of individual family members served, however, so the number of services provided them is unknown.", "The children and families Head Start served had some similar demographic characteristics (see fig. 1).

In addition, most (61 percent) have only one parent or are headed by other relatives, or they are foster families or have other living arrangements. Head Start families are generally very poor as indicated by several measures (see fig. 3).

Recognizing that an increasing proportion of Head Start families work and many who may receive public assistance are participating in welfare reform initiatives in response to TANF, the Head Start Bureau announced that programs that provide more full-day, full-year Head Start services will receive special priority for funding. Head Start urged programs to consider combining Head Start expansion funds with other child care and early childhood funding sources and to deliver services through partnerships such as community-based child care centers. This focus on providing full-day, full-year services departs from previous expansion priorities, which emphasized part-day, part-year, or home-based services.", "For our review we talked with Head Start program officials who had applied for expansion funds to meet the needs of working parents. Officials operating a program in Florida, for example, stated that they plan to expand the number of days and hours the program currently operates: hours of operation will be expanded from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. In addition, officials operating a program in Vermont stated that it plans to provide full-day, full-year services as well.

For example, when asked the main methods the programs used to provide medical services for enrolled children, 73 percent of survey respondents said that they referred participants to services, and some other entity or program, such as Medicaid, primarily paid for the service (see fig. 5 and table II.3 in app. II). Because most Head Start children are eligible for Medicaid\u2019s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program, Head Start programs may refer children to Medicaid providers; thus, Head Start provides access to these services with little or no impact on the Head Start programs\u2019 budgets.

Nearly 90 percent of programs reported that they both delivered and funded education services for enrolled children.

For our review, we asked several Head Start directors about some of the services they provided directly to family members. Program officials stated that they typically provided services to the siblings, while providing services to the enrolled child. For example, education services provided to enrolled children in a home-based program may be provided to siblings as well, benefiting all enrolled children and their siblings. The director of a program in Montana, for example, stated that staff bring along snacks for the siblings during home visits.

These children received some or most\u2014but not all\u2014of the services typically provided by Head Start programs. Respondents reported serving about 14,000 Head Start-eligible children through these other programs. California served the greatest number of such children (3,216) followed by Kentucky (2,652) (see table II.7 in app. II). These programs provided many of the same services as Head Start programs, but not all services were provided to all children. Education services, meals, social services, and immunizations were the most often provided; dental, medical, and other nutrition services were the least often provided. Thirty percent of the programs responded that they provided no services to families. Families or siblings were more likely to receive social services and parent literacy training through Head Start and less likely to receive medical services, such as dental, mental health, and immunizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In many respects, the Head Start program is at a crossroads because the context in which it operates today differs greatly from that of 30 years ago when the program was established. The services available to poor children have changed and communities have enhanced resources for serving poor children and their families. Consequently, Head Start facilitates or brokers many services provided by others, referring and linking families to these services, rather than providing them directly. The one service that almost all Head Start programs provide directly is education, although the number of early childhood education programs other than Head Start has grown in the past 30 years.", "Furthermore, changes in welfare policy have important implications for Head Start. Most Head Start programs operate for only part of the day and part of the year. As changes in welfare policy require increasing numbers of poor people\u2014including Head Start parents\u2014to seek and maintain employment, however, the need for full-day, full-year services will intensify. The administration\u2019s proposals to help working parents secure affordable, quality child care include substantially increasing Head Start enrollment. Head Start\u2019s predominantly part-day, part-year programs present obstacles for meeting the needs of working families. Head Start will need to balance the administration\u2019s wish to serve more eligible children, which has typically been done by creating more part-day, part-year slots, with the need for more full-day, full-year services more compatible with working families\u2019 needs.", "Finally, information about Head Start\u2019s effectiveness and the efficiency of various Head Start models is lacking. As we reported earlier, although Head Start research has been conducted, it does not provide information on whether today\u2019s Head Start is positively affecting the lives of today\u2019s participants whose world differs vastly from that of the 1960s and early 1970s. In addition, funding for Head Start programs varies widely. We do not know to what extent, however, this variation may be attributable to efficiencies in providing services or to other factors such as programs\u2019 ability to leverage other community resources, characteristics of the population served, or program structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["ACF provided general comments about the Head Start program and specific technical comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate. Four of ACF\u2019s comments that were not incorporated in the report addressed services provided to children\u2019s siblings, data on hours and months of attendance, use of funds for food costs, and hiring of parents.", "ACF commented that our discussion of services provided to enrolled children\u2019s siblings is misleading because it implies that Head Start programs are actively providing services to such children. ACF contends that Head Start programs do not use grant funds to provide services to siblings and that such services are provided only to the extent that they are part of the enrolled child\u2019s services. Nevertheless, a small percentage of Head Start survey respondents reported that they did use Head Start funds to deliver services to families and siblings. Our report emphasizes, however, that when provided, many of these services are neither paid for nor delivered by Head Start. Head Start facilitates siblings\u2019 and families\u2019 access to services in much the same way as it does to enrolled children. We also report that our interviews with Head Start officials showed that siblings sometimes receive services as part of the program\u2019s services to the enrolled child. For example, Head Start staff may bring along snacks for siblings during home visits and provide education services for the siblings during such visits. It is likely that in such a situation, the Head Start program would consider this to be providing services directly because Head Start funds might have been used to pay the staff\u2019s salary and the cost of siblings\u2019 snacks.", "In addition, ACF commented that Head Start does collect data on the number of hours per day or months per year that enrolled children attend center programs and that such information is available through its Head Start Cost data system. During this study, we reviewed the Head Start Cost data system and found\u2014and Head Start officials had previously confirmed\u2014that reporting of Head Start Cost data is optional and not all programs provide such data. Furthermore, the data collected by the system on the number of hours per day or months per year that children attend center programs really reflect programs\u2019 projected center operating schedules, not their actual schedules.", "ACF also stated that our discussion of USDA reimbursement is somewhat inaccurate and that USDA covers the vast majority of all food costs incurred by Head Start programs, with Head Start grant funds paying only a small portion of these costs. AFC stated that it is not conceivable that 40 percent of Head Start programs are using Head Start funds as their primary source of meals and food because programs are required to seek such reimbursement from USDA. We did not change our figures in the report, however, because they directly reflect the reports of our survey respondents.", "In addition, ACF stated that the discussion of hiring parents should clarify that Head Start hires parents only for jobs for which they are qualified and that many parents have advanced through the Head Start ranks and now hold professional-level positions in the program. We assessed, however, neither the qualifications of the parents Head Start employs nor the number who hold professional-level positions in the programs and therefore the report does not address these issues.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Head Start Bureau, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

In many cases, we reviewed questionnaires for explanations of questionable responses. When we could not resolve questions, we called survey respondents for clarification. In a few cases, respondents had reported numbers incorrectly; and, in these cases, we corrected the data, or, if correction was not possible, we rejected the erroneous data. Second, we looked for a systematic pattern in the distribution of nonrespondents. Because we thought that program size (defined by total funded enrollment) might be related to response patterns, we examined whether programs of various sizes were more or less likely to respond. Although smaller programs tended to be somewhat less likely to respond, the difference in the response rate, coupled with the small number of the nonrespondents, yielded an inconsequential overall impact.", "In most cases we based our analyses simply on the answers of survey respondents. No weighting for nonresponse was done because our response rate was so high that adjustments for nonresponse would have hardly affected our findings.
