The median marginal tax rate for households without DC plans or IRAs was 15 percent, compared to 25 percent for households with those savings vehicles. A defined benefit (DB) pension plan could provide a monthly benefit during retirement years for those without a DC plan or IRA; however, in 2010 only 15 percent of married households and 11 percent of single households without a DC plan or IRA had a DB plan.", "The existing Saver's Credit tax incentive could result in small increases in a household's retirement annuity--that is, the household's annual retirement income received from DC or DB plans. GAO estimates that, on account of this credit, the median annuity increase for households in the lowest earnings quartile ($929-34,377) would be $155. If, however, the Saver's Credit was refundable (i.e., could generate a tax refund in excess of tax paid), it could result in larger increases in households' annuities across all earnings levels, and the median increase for households in the lowest earnings quartile would be $876 per year.", "Implementing automatic IRAs, unless waived by participants, could expand retirement coverage and modestly increase retirement annuities for households at all earnings levels. Specifically, 7 percent of all households could receive retirement annuities from automatic IRAs even though these households had no DB or DC plans, according to GAO's projections. Workers with DB or DC plans could also benefit from automatic IRAs at certain points in their lifetime if their jobs do not offer such plans.

However, even these  increases could bolster the financial prospects of many future retirees.  These options do, of course, pose important trade-offs for individuals,  employers, and the government that will need to be carefully weighed.  Individuals, especially those in lower-income households, will still have to  make difficult choices between spending now and saving for later.

The SCF is a triennial,  nationally representative survey from the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve. The 2010 SCF surveyed 6,482 households about their  pensions, incomes, labor force participation, asset holdings and debts,  use of financial services, and demographic information. The SCF is  conducted using a dual-frame sample design. One part of the design is a  standard, multistage area-probability design, while the second part is a  special over-sample of relatively wealthy households. This is done in  order to accurately capture financial information about the population at  large as well as characteristics specific to the relatively wealthy. The two  parts of the sample are adjusted for sample nonresponse and combined  using weights to make estimates from the survey data representative of  households overall. In addition, the SCF excludes people included in the  Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the United States.  Furthermore, the 2010 SCF dropped 10 observations from the public data  set that had net worth at least equal to the minimum level needed to  qualify for the Forbes list.", "For the purposes of this report, a household refers to the primary  economic unit within a household, which the SCF refers to as a family. To  estimate the age, marital status, net worth, tax filing status, and whether  the household had a member with a DC or DB plan, we relied on variable  definitions used for Federal Reserve publications using the SCF. To  estimate AGI and tax rates, we used TAXSIM, an application provided by  the National Bureau of Economic Research that estimates tax information  for households using survey data. To prepare the data for TAXSIM, we  relied on a program provided by the Federal Reserve. We followed SCF  documentation and estimated the standard errors that incorporate both  implicates and replicate weighting. The estimated populations we used for  our analysis were derived with the first implicate.", "The SCF and other surveys that are based on self-reported data are  subject to several other sources of nonsampling error, including the  inability to get information about all sample cases; difficulties of definition;  differences in the interpretation of questions; respondents\u2019 inability or  unwillingness to provide correct information; and errors made in  collecting, recording, coding, and processing data.

GEMINI simulates all types of Social Security benefits including  retired workers\u2019, spouses\u2019, survivors\u2019, and disability benefits. It can be  used to model a variety of changes to Social Security. GEMINI uses  inputs from SSASIM, which has been used in numerous prior GAO  reports, and PENSIM, which was developed for the Department of Labor.  GEMINI relies on SSASIM for economic and demographic projections  and relies on PENSIM for simulated life histories of large representative   Life  samples of people born in the same year and their spouses.histories include educational attainment, labor force participation,  earnings, job mobility, marriage, disability, childbirth, retirement, and  death.

Additionally, any projected statistics (such as life expectancy,  employment patterns, and marital status at age 60) are, where possible,  consistent with intermediate cost projections from the Social Security  Administration\u2019s Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT).

When operating as an add-on, GEMINI is started  automatically by SSASIM for one of two purposes. GEMINI can enable  the SSASIM macro model to operate in the Overlapping Cohorts (OLC)  mode or it can enable the SSASIM micro model to operate in the  Representative Cohort Sample (RCS) mode. The SSASIM OLC mode  requests GEMINI to produce samples for each cohort born after 1934 in  order to build up aggregate payroll tax revenues and Old-Age, Survivors,  and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefit expenditures for each calendar  year, which are used by SSASIM to calculate standard trust fund financial  statistics. In either mode, GEMINI operates with the same logic, but  typically with smaller cohort sample sizes in OLC mode than in the RCS  or stand-alone-model mode.", "PENSIM simulates the timing for each life event by using data from  various longitudinal data sets to estimate a waiting-time model (often  called a hazard function model) using standard survival analysis methods.  PENSIM incorporates many such estimated waiting-time models into a  single dynamic simulation model. This model can be used to simulate a  synthetic sample of complete life histories. PENSIM employs continuous- time, discrete-event simulation techniques, such that life events do not  have to occur at discrete intervals, such as annually on a person\u2019s  birthday. PENSIM also uses macro-demographic and macroeconomic  variables generated by SSASIM.", "PENSIM imputes pension characteristics using a model estimated with  1996\u20141998 establishment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Employee Benefits Survey (now known as the National Compensation  Survey). Pension offerings are calibrated to historical trends in pension  offerings from 1975 to 2005, including plan mix, types of plans, and  employer matching. Further, PENSIM incorporates data from the 1996\u2013 1998 Employee Benefits Survey to impute access to and participation  rates in DC plans in which the employer makes no contribution, which the  Bureau of Labor Statistics does not report as pension plans in the  National Compensation Survey. The inclusion of these \u201czero-matching\u201d  plans enhances PENSIM\u2019s ability to accurately reflect the universe of  pension plans offered by employers.

According to PSG, PENSIM generates simulated DC plan participation  rates and account balances that are similar to those observed in a variety  of data sets. For example, measures of central tendency in the simulated  distribution of DC account balances among employed individuals are  similar to those produced by an analysis of the Employee Benefit  Research Institute-Investment Company Institute 401(k) database and of  the 2004 SCF.

The economists\u2019 overall  reviews ranged from highly favorable to highly critical. While the  economist who gave PENSIM a favorable review expressed a \u201chigh  degree of confidence\u201d in the model, the one who criticized it focused on  PENSIM\u2019s reduced form modeling. This means that the model is  grounded in previously observed statistical relationships among  individuals\u2019 characteristics, circumstances, and behaviors, rather than on  any underlying theory of the determinants of behaviors, such as the  common economic theory that individuals make rational choices as their  preferences dictate and thereby maximize their own welfare.

Therefore,  estimating future Social Security benefits should reflect that actuarial  deficit and account for the fact that some combination of benefit  reductions and revenue increases will be necessary to restore long- term solvency. Our tax-increase-only benchmark simulated \u201cpromised  benefits,\u201d or those benefits promised by the current benefit formula.  We also developed an alternative benefit-reduction-only benchmark  which simulated \u201cfunded benefits,\u201d or those benefits for which  currently scheduled revenues are projected to be sufficient (see  Sensitivity Analysis below). Our tax-increase-only benchmark raised  payroll taxes once and immediately by the amount of Social Security\u2019s  actuarial deficit as a percentage of payroll. It resulted in the smallest  ultimate tax rate of those we considered and spread the tax burden  most evenly across generations; this was the primary basis for our  selection. The later that taxes are increased, the higher the ultimate  tax rate needed to achieve solvency, and, in turn, the higher the tax  burden on later taxpayers and lower on earlier taxpayers. Still, any  policy scenario that achieves 75-year solvency only by increasing  revenues would have the same effect on the adequacy of future  benefits in that promised benefits would not be reduced.  Nevertheless, alternative approaches to increasing revenues could  have very different effects on individual equity. All estimates related to  this benchmark were simulated using the SSASIM OLC mode.  Starting in 2013, we increased the tax rate by 2.61 percent in order to  achieve 75-year solvency. As reported in the Social Security  Administration\u2019s 2012 Trustees Report, immediately raising taxes by  2.61 percent would achieve solvency.", "In our policy scenarios, we varied other assumptions to see how these  variations affect retirement income at age 67.

This  scenario served as the baseline against which we compared the  results for the existing and refundable Saver\u2019s Credit scenarios.", "Existing Saver\u2019s Credit. This scenario was drawn from the existing  design of the Saver\u2019s Credit as established by the Economic Growth  and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Under the credit\u2019s current  design, taxpayers may receive a non-refundable credit of up to $1,000  ($2,000 if married filing jointly) for contributing to a pension plan or  IRA. The credit amount is equal to the credit rate multiplied by the  amount of qualified contribution (of up to $2,000 per individual).  Taxpayers receive a credit rate of 50, 20, or 10 percent depending on  AGI and filing status. Certain students, individuals under age 18, and  those who are claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer\u2019s return  are not eligible to receive the credit. If a worker receives a pre- retirement distribution from a pension plan, any credit received in that  year and the subsequent two years will be reduced by the amount of  the distribution. We used information from the Internal Revenue  Service to determine current AGI limits. 2013 AGI limits are: $59,000  for individuals with a filing status of married filing jointly, $44,250 for  individuals with a filing status of head of household, and $29,500 for  individuals with a filing status of single, married filing separately, or  widow(er). Limits in subsequent years were indexed to inflation.  PENSIM assumed the credit was deposited directly into the taxpayer\u2019s  DC account. This is not a requirement under law, and in reality the  credit would be part of the household\u2019s tax refund. We assumed a 100  percent utilization rate, meaning that all eligible taxpayers received  the credit, to show the maximum potential accumulation for retirement  income from the Saver\u2019s Credit. This utilization rate also reflects  PENSIM\u2019s default values for 2012 and beyond. We did not assess  behavioral responses related to the utilization of the Saver\u2019s Credit.", "Refundable Saver\u2019s Credit. This scenario had the same eligibility  requirements and 2013 AGI limits as the existing Saver\u2019s Credit  scenario. Starting in 2014, the following changes were implemented,  drawn from our understanding of modifications included in the  President\u2019s budget proposal of fiscal year 2011: (1) the credit became  fully refundable, (2) all taxpayers received a 50 percent credit rate  (there is no phase-out), and (3) AGI limits were increased. The 2014  AGI limits were: $85,000 for individuals with a filing status of married  filing jointly, $63,750 for individuals with a filing status of head of  household, and $42,500 for individuals with a filing status of single,  married filing separately, or widow(er). Limits in subsequent years  were indexed to inflation. Individuals could receive a refundable credit  of up to $1,000 if filing singly or $2,000 if filing jointly. PENSIM  assumed that the credit is deposited directly into the taxpayer\u2019s DC  account. This change was not proposed in the President\u2019s budget.

This scenario is drawn from our understanding of  H.R. 4049 The Automatic IRA Act of 2012. For our scenario, we  assumed that private sector employers began offering automatic IRAs  in 2014. Employers who employed more than 10 employees and did  not offer a DB or DC plan were required to offer automatic IRAs to  employee ages 18 and over after they have been employed for 90  days. Contributions were made to traditional IRAs. If the employee  did not select a contribution rate or investment fund, 3 percent of the  employee\u2019s salary was contributed to a target-date fund. The  aggregate participation rate is centered around a target participation  rate of 69 percent in the year 2035, when the cohort was age 40 and  in the midst of its prime working years. We selected this rate by  estimating a hypothetical average participation rate using parameters  from economic literature and SCF data on households that did not  currently participate in a DC or IRA plan. Our model considered the  effects of automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans, the effects of an  employer match (or a lack there-of), income, and age. Individuals may  choose to terminate their participation in the automatic IRA after being  enrolled in the plan.
