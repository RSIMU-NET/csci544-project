Recognizing this increase, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has launched a governmentwide initiative to consolidate data centers. GAO was asked to (1) assess whether agency consolidation documents include adequate detail for agencies to consolidate their centers, (2) identify the key consolidation challenges reported by agencies, and (3) evaluate whether lessons learned during state government consolidation efforts could be leveraged at the federal level. To address these objectives, GAO assessed the completeness of agency inventories and plans, interviewed agencies about their challenges, and evaluated the applicability of states' consolidation lessons to federal challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In launching its federal data center consolidation initiative, OMB required the 24 participating agencies to submit data center inventories and consolidation plans by the end of August 2010, and provided guidance on key elements to include in the inventories and plans--such as hardware and software assets, goals, schedules, and cost-benefit calculations. The plans indicate that agencies anticipate closing about 650 data centers by fiscal year 2015 and saving about $700 million in doing so. However, only one of the agencies submitted a complete inventory and no agency submitted complete plans. Further, OMB did not require agencies to document the steps they took, if any, to verify the inventory data. For example, in their inventories, 14 agencies do not provide a complete listing of data centers and 15 do not list all of their software assets. Also, in their consolidation plans, 20 agencies do not reference a master schedule, 12 agencies do not address cost-benefit calculations, and 9 do not address risk management. The reason for these gaps, according to several agency officials, was that they had difficulty completing their inventories and plans within OMB's timelines. Until these inventories and plans are complete, agencies may not be able to implement their consolidation activities and realize expected cost savings. Moreover, without an understanding of the validity of agencies' consolidation data, OMB cannot be assured that agencies are providing a sound baseline for estimating consolidation savings and measuring progress against those goals. Agencies identified multiple challenges during data center consolidation, including those that are specific to OMB's consolidation initiative as well as those that are cultural, funding-related, operational, and technical in nature. For example, in attempting to fulfill OMB's requirements, 19 agencies reported difficulty in obtaining power usage data. In addition, 9 agencies reported challenges in maintaining services during the transition to consolidated services. Moving forward, it will be important for agencies to focus on mitigating such challenges as they implement their consolidation plans. Many state governments have undertaken data center consolidation initiatives in recent years and have encountered challenges similar to those reported by federal agencies. Specifically, 19 states reported lessons learned that could be leveraged at the federal level. For example, a West Virginia official reported that since the state had no funding for data center consolidation, it used the natural aging cycle of hardware to force consolidation; that is, when a piece of hardware was ready to be replaced, the new applications and software were put onto a consolidated server. Also, officials from North Carolina reported that organizations are typically concerned that by consolidating data centers, they will lose control of their data, service levels will decline, or costs will rise. The state learned that during the process of consolidation, the organizations' concerns should be documented, validated, and addressed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Federal Chief Information Officer, department secretaries, and agency heads take steps to ensure that agency data center inventories and consolidation plans are complete.

For example, according to the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), the electricity cost to operate federal servers and data  centers across the government is about $450 million annually. According  to the Department of Energy (Energy), data center spaces can consume  100 to 200 times as much electricity as standard office spaces. Reported  server utilization rates as low as 5 percent and limited reuse of these data  centers within or across agencies lends further credence to the need to  restructure federal data center operations to improve efficiency and  reduce costs.

Another 7 agencies, including the Departments of Defense  (Defense), Homeland Security (DHS), and Transportation  (Transportation), provide partial information on their maximum and  average server utilization, and on their counts of physical servers,  virtual hosts, and virtual operating systems.", "IT facilities, energy, and storage. Three agencies provide complete  information on their IT facilities, energy, and storage, while 20 provide  partial information. For example, the Department of State (State)  includes all the required information, while the Department of  Education (Education) provides complete information on its annual  data center operational cost, total rack count, and storage information,  but only provides partial information on its annual data center  electricity cost and total electricity usage. Also, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has partial information  on its total rack count and does not provide any information for the  other required parts of this element. \uf0b7  Geographic location and real estate. Nine agencies provide  complete information on their data center locations, while 14 provide  partial information. For example, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) provides complete information on its number of data centers  and the gross floor area of those centers, but does not provide  information on the number of server rooms and closets and the gross  floor area of those facilities. Other agencies such as Energy and the  Department of Labor (Labor) only provide partial information on their  number of centers, server rooms, and closets, and the gross floor  area of those facilities.", "Because agency goals are intended to be built on the information  provided by the inventories, agencies cannot ensure the reliability of their  savings and utilization forecasts until the underlying inventories have  been completed.", "While it is important that reported data are sufficiently complete, accurate,  and consistent, OMB\u2019s guidance on agency inventories does not require  agencies to document what they did to verify their data, or to disclose any  limitations on that data. Nonetheless, several agencies took informal  steps to validate their data. For example, Department of Agriculture  (Agriculture) officials stated that they interviewed staff who submitted  inventory information and conducted on-site visits of data centers.  Additionally, Department of Commerce (Commerce) officials reported that  they reviewed the inventory data and clarified missing or suspect entries  with those who submitted the information. Also, a Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) official stated that there were two rounds of data  verification and that Treasury bureaus were sometimes asked to verify  submitted information. However, officials from other agencies, such as  Defense, Energy, and NASA, confirmed that their inventories had not  been verified. Further, in some cases, such as with the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) and NASA, agency officials reported  that their inventory information was estimated.", "Notwithstanding agencies\u2019 informal verification efforts, complete,  accurate, and consistent performance information will be important to  OMB to guide its decisions on how best to oversee federal data center  consolidations.

OMB noted the importance of agencies\u2019 consolidation plans in providing a  technical road map and approach for achieving specified targets for  infrastructure utilization, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency. Table 3  provides a detailed description of each of these elements.", "While 23 agencies submitted consolidation plans to OMB, selected  elements are missing from each plan. For example, 22 agencies provide  complete information on their qualitative impacts, but only 6 provide  complete information on their quantitative goals. Further, while all 23  agencies specify their consolidation approach, only 5 indicate that a cost- benefit analysis was performed for the consolidation initiative. In many  cases, agencies submitted some, but not all, of the required information.  Figure 2 provides an assessment by element, and a discussion of each  element follows the figure. A detailed summary of the agencies\u2019 status of  completion of each key element is provided in appendix II. In addition, this  information is provided for each agency in appendix III.  \uf0b7  Quantitative goals. Six agencies provide complete savings and  utilization forecasts and 17 agencies provide partial forecasts. For  example, Defense\u2019s savings and utilization forecasts are incomplete,  while Treasury and the Social Security Administration (SSA) provide  complete savings forecasts, but incomplete utilization forecasts. Some  agencies identified reasons for not having completed these forecasts.  For example, Treasury\u2019s plan states that the department\u2019s savings  and utilization targets do not include demand from new organizations  required under recent legislation and that the plan will be updated as  further information becomes available. The plan also notes that the  forecasts could change when the department completes associated  cost-benefit analyses. Additionally, NASA\u2019s plan states that the  agency is performing an assessment of its assets to form an accurate  baseline, on which actual targets for reduction can be predicted. This  plan also notes that as the agency\u2019s asset and inventory information is  improved, NASA will evaluate opportunities to further consolidate  applications and virtualize operating systems. \uf0b7  Qualitative impacts. Twenty-two agencies describe the qualitative  impacts of their consolidation initiatives and 1 agency does not. For  example, Agriculture\u2019s plan describes goals such as reducing overall  energy use and reducing the real estate footprint for data centers.  Additionally, HHS reports that the consolidation effort will result in  more efficient monitoring of data center power. Finally, the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) describes goals such  as optimizing use of IT funding by increasing efficiencies and  increasing the availability of resources and systems to the user  community. However, Education does not provide any qualitative  impacts. Although the department links its consolidation plan to a  federal strategic sustainability plan, the sustainability plan does not  contain qualitative impacts such as those required by OMB. \uf0b7  Summary of consolidation approach. All 23 agencies include a  summary of the agencies\u2019 proposed consolidation approaches. For  example, Commerce describes five approaches that will support the  department\u2019s FDCCI goals: consolidating and decommissioning data  centers, increasing server virtualization and IT equipment utilization,  moving to cloud computing, acquiring green products and services,  and promoting \u201cgreen IT.\u201d Similarly, the Department of the Interior  (Interior) provides four approaches to help realize its consolidation  goals: decommissioning, consolidation, cloud computing, and server  and storage virtualization. For a more detailed discussion of  alternative data center consolidation approaches, see appendix IV. \uf0b7  Scope of consolidation. Nineteen agencies\u2019 plans include a well- defined scope for data center consolidation, 2 provide partial  information on the scope of their consolidation efforts, and 2 do not  provide this information. Specifically, the agencies that provide this  information list the data centers included in the consolidation effort  and what consolidation approach will be taken for the systems within  each center (i.e., decommissioning, consolidation, cloud computing,  or virtualization). For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) lists 87 data centers and Labor lists 20 data centers, in which all  of the systems will be consolidated, decommissioned, or virtualized.  Alternatively, Energy has not yet determined what action will be taken  for each of its facilities and Interior identifies the total numbers of  centers to be retained or expanded, but does not describe the  consolidation approach for individual data centers. Two agencies, the  Department of Justice (Justice) and NASA, are still working to  determine which of their data centers are to be consolidated. \uf0b7  High-level timeline. Twenty agencies include a high-level timeline for  consolidation efforts, 1 agency includes partial information on its  timelines, and 2 do not provide timelines. For example, Labor and VA  both provide the fiscal years in which every data center listed will be  consolidated and the National Science Foundation (NSF) states what  year the agency\u2019s primary data center will be decommissioned and  replaced with private and public cloud services. In contrast, Defense  only describes broad goals to be accomplished by fiscal year 2013  and does not include specific milestones for each data center.  Further, NASA does not include this information in its plan and notes  that the agency is still working to determine its data center inventory. \uf0b7  Performance metrics. Six agencies identify specific performance  metrics for their consolidation programs, 4 agencies provide partial  information on their metrics, and 13 agencies did not identify specific  metrics. For example, both Transportation and GSA specify metrics  such as savings in energy consumption, cost variance, and schedule  variance. Alternatively, State reports that the department\u2019s data center  consolidation program maintains metrics at both the system and  process performance levels, but does not provide any specifics as to  the nature of those metrics. Further, although Defense does not  provide metrics at the department level, the Air Force has developed  a method to provide such measures. \uf0b7  Master program schedule. Three agencies reference a completed  master program schedule, and 20 do not. For example, while  Agriculture, DHS, and Interior discuss their master schedules, other  agencies, such as Commerce and HHS do not. Some agencies, such   as Defense, Labor, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  plan to develop them in the future. \uf0b7  Cost-benefit analysis. Five agencies provide a cost-benefit analysis  that encompasses their entire consolidation initiative, 6 agencies  provide only selected elements of a cost-benefit analysis, and 12  agencies do not provide a cost-benefit analysis. For example, DHS  details full annualized investment and savings estimates through fiscal  year 2015, while other agencies, such as State and OPM, provide  only partial information. Specifically, State acknowledges that not all  costs are accounted for in its analysis and OPM reports that its  analysis is preliminary. Additionally, Commerce provides costs and  savings for several data center consolidations but acknowledges that  estimates cannot be provided for all of the department\u2019s planned  consolidation initiatives. Eight of the agencies that do not provide a  cost-benefit analysis, such as HHS, Justice, and USAID, plan to  conduct one in the future. \uf0b7  Risk management. Fewer than half of the agencies both reference a  consolidation risk management plan and require that risks be tracked.  For example, HHS discusses its approach to risk management and  identifies a series of technical, security, funding, and management  risks and provides a mitigation strategy for each. Additionally, VA  describes a five-phase approach to risk management that includes  identifying and monitoring risks. However, Education requires that  risks be tracked, but does not reference the existence of an actual risk  management plan. Nine agencies do not reference a risk  management plan or requirements for tracking risks. \uf0b7  Communications plan. Eighteen agencies consider a  communications strategy for the agencies\u2019 consolidation initiatives,  and 5 agencies do not. For example, Energy describes a series of  coordinated activities that are intended to support the consolidation  effort. Additionally, NASA details its approach to consolidation  coordination and communication and SBA details individual  communication responsibilities among consolidation stakeholders.  However, Treasury and NRC do not describe such a communications  strategy.", "When asked about the elements missing from their plans, many agency  officials stated that they completed what they could within the timelines  provided by OMB. Several agency officials noted that it was difficult to  obtain all of the required data from component agencies, while others  reported that their data collection efforts were made more difficult by  OMB\u2019s tight time frames and changes in templates and guidance.  Moreover, officials from two agencies stated that some of the information  contained in their plans had been estimated. However, OMB has not  required agencies to complete the missing elements or to resubmit their  final plans. According to an OMB official, agencies have been instructed  to move forward with their consolidation initiatives, and as noted earlier,  OMB intends to monitor the agencies\u2019 progress annually.", "We have previously reported that without a clear description of the  strategies and resources an agency plans to use in meeting its goals, it  will be difficult to assess the likelihood of the agency\u2019s success in  achieving its intended results.

Some challenges are more common  than others. Specifically, the number of agencies reporting a particular  challenge range from 1 agency to 19 agencies. Table 4 details the  reported challenges as well as the numbers of agencies experiencing that  challenge. The table is followed by a discussion of the most prevalent  challenges.", "Agencies reported nine challenges that are specific to OMB\u2019s data center  consolidation initiative, including meeting tight FDCCI deadlines and  obtaining power usage data as required by OMB. Specifically, 19  agencies reported that obtaining power usage data was a challenge. For  example, a Commerce official stated that while more than half of the  agency\u2019s data centers have power consumption figures or costs  associated with power usage, some of the agency\u2019s facilities do not have  metering capabilities for power consumption and that the agency has  some server rooms that lack metering at the equipment. Similarly, Labor\u2019s  Deputy CIO stated that the department does not have metering for data  centers. Consequently, the agency used best practices to estimate how  much power is being used at data centers. In addition, 11 agencies found  that the tight FDCCI deadlines were a challenge. For example, Labor\u2019s  Deputy CIO stated that the time frames were overly aggressive and did  not allow the agency to provide the information OMB requested or to  complete the planning that is necessary for such an important  undertaking. An Energy official stated that there is no quick path to  consolidation and that the agency was faced with the decision of either  moving forward with inadequate inventory information or taking more time  to make decisions. The official stressed that the agency would like to  consolidate in the correct manner.", "Agencies reported four cultural challenges to data center consolidation,  including accepting cultural change and implementing consolidation in an  organizational structure not geared towards consolidation (i.e., a  decentralized enterprise). The most prevalent challenge was acceptance  of cultural change, with 15 agencies reporting it as a challenge. For  example, an Agriculture official stated that there is a challenge in  addressing cultural change surrounding data center consolidation. With  data center consolidation, systems personnel may not be in the same  location as the data. To address this, Agriculture refined its  communications plan so that lessons learned can be passed on to other  staff. An EPA official noted the agency experienced this challenge when  employees were reluctant to cede control of resources under their  immediate control. EPA mitigated that challenge by building relationships  with stakeholders early on. In addition, 8 agencies reported that  implementing the consolidation was challenged by their organizational  structures. For example, a Justice official stated that the agency uses a  federated IT approach within which the departmentwide CIO\u2019s office has  primary responsibility for architecture, common infrastructure, and  standards decisions, while each component IT department has primary  responsibility for application resource decisions. According to this official,  such a federated approach offers Justice\u2019s components more autonomy  when making decisions, but creates obstacles for departmentwide efforts  such as FDCCI. Further, an Energy official cited the department\u2019s  decentralized environment as a challenge in being able to collect data  center inventory information.", "The data center consolidation initiative is supposed to result in cost  savings, but multiple agencies reported challenges in funding their  initiatives. For example, a Transportation official reported that the need  for upfront funding for consolidation efforts was a challenge. A NASA  official stated that the agency spent approximately $1.5 million on an  asset management tool to assist the agency in creating its inventory.  Further, a State official noted the challenge of having to fund the  consolidation efforts long before cost savings will be realized. In addition,  9 agencies reported that identifying cost savings for consolidation efforts  was a challenge. For example, an Energy official stated that it was too  early in the consolidation process for Energy to be able to quantify cost  savings, since the agency does not have data on cost or exactly which  data centers will be closed. A State official stated that it is difficult to  estimate cost savings since the department does not have information on  power usage for all facilities. Further, a Treasury official noted challenges  in identifying cost savings, particularly because a reduction in utilized  square footage at a facility does not mean that the leasing agency will  issue a refund check on the lease. Similarly, building managers at private  facilities will typically not issue a refund if an agency begins using less  energy.", "Agencies reported eight operational challenges to data center  consolidation, including maintaining services during the consolidation  transition and implementing cloud computing. Nine agencies reported that  maintaining services during the consolidation transition is a challenge. For  example, a Labor official stated that keeping the business running during  the transition is a big concern of the agency. Three agencies reported that  moving to cloud computing was a challenge. For example, a Commerce  official stated that the agency\u2019s biggest challenge was how to implement  cloud computing. This official cited the need to investigate how private  and public cloud computing will fit into the agency\u2019s mission, and to  determine how to manage security issues surrounding cloud computing.", "Agencies reported 10 technical challenges to data center consolidation,  including maintaining the appropriate level of system security and  planning the migration strategy. While agencies reported more technical  challenges than any other type of challenge, these challenges are more  diverse, with fewer agencies experiencing each individual challenge.  Three agencies reported that maintaining the appropriate level of system  security was a challenge. For example, an OPM official stated that one of  the challenges faced was the need to maintain personally identifiable  information while exploring options such as cloud computing. In addition,  a State official identified the challenge of including classified servers in  the consolidation initiative. Two agencies reported that planning the  migration strategy was a challenge. For example, an SSA official pointed  out the difficulty in scheduling migration across approximately 1,500 field  offices.", "One approach agencies can use to manage challenges such as the ones  listed above is through formal risk management processes. However, as  noted in the prior section, less than half of the agencies included a  discussion of risk management in their data center consolidation plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned by States Can Be Leveraged to Mitigate Challenges at the Federal Level", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on the importance of using lessons  learned\u2014a principal component of an organizational culture committed to  continuous improvement. Sharing such information serves to  communicate acquired knowledge more effectively and to ensure that  beneficial information is factored into planning, work processes, and  activities. Lessons learned also provide a powerful method of sharing  good ideas for improving work processes, facility or equipment design  and operation, quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness.", "OMB posted lessons learned by three states on its data center  consolidation Web page for federal agencies to review. However, there  is more that agencies can learn. Many state governments have  undertaken data center consolidation initiatives in recent years. Although  they have encountered unique challenges, they have also encountered  challenges similar to those reported by federal agencies. Specifically, the  National Association of State CIOs and a literature search identified 20  states that reported on challenges they faced, or lessons they learned,  from their data center consolidation initiatives. Of these, 19 reported  lessons learned that could be leveraged at the federal level. For example,  officials from North Carolina reported that organizations are typically  concerned that by consolidating data centers, they will lose control of their  data, service levels will decline, or costs will rise. The state learned that to  help mitigate this during the process of consolidation, the organizations\u2019  concerns should be documented, validated, and addressed. In another  example, a West Virginia official reported that since the state had no  funding for a consolidation, it had to be creative in executing the  consolidation. The state used the natural aging cycle of hardware to force  consolidation; that is, when a piece of hardware was ready to be  replaced, the applications and software were put onto a consolidated  server. As a final example, two states reported lessons learned that could  be applied to the challenge of providing a quality asset inventory. Officials  from Utah and Texas emphasized the importance of having an accurate  inventory of all equipment that could be impacted by the project. The  official from Texas added that it is important to have a third party collect  technical data across agencies, and that it is beneficial to have this work  completed by outside parties, in order to ensure objectivity and  consistency. Table 5 identifies lessons learned by states that could be  applied by federal agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With agencies reporting having almost 1,600 federal data centers, OMB\u2019s  goal of consolidating 800 centers by 2015 is ambitious. To its credit, OMB  has established an accountability infrastructure through its data center  consolidation task force composed of representatives from each of the  participating agencies. OMB and federal agencies have also taken  important steps to reduce the number and increase the efficiency of the  federal data centers. However, only one agency has completed its  required data center asset inventory, no agencies have completed their  consolidation plans, and OMB has not required that agency inventory  information be verified. Despite these limitations, OMB has instructed  agencies to move forward with their plans. Moving forward to consolidate  obviously redundant or underutilized centers is warranted\u2014and should  result in immediate cost savings and increased efficiency. However,  without a complete asset inventory and a comprehensive plan, agencies  are at increased risk that they will be ill-prepared to manage such a  significant transformation. This could slow the consolidations and reduce  expected savings and efficiencies.", "In moving ahead in their consolidation efforts, agencies are encountering  challenges, including those that are technical, operational, and cultural in  nature. Some state governments have also engaged in data center  consolidation initiatives and dealt with similar obstacles in doing so. By  virtue of these experiences, these states can offer insights and  suggestions that federal agencies can use to mitigate their challenges  and risks. In doing so, agencies will be better positioned to address their  consolidation goals and to meet OMB\u2019s goals for reducing the number  and cost of federal data centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that the federal data center consolidation initiative  improves governmental efficiency and achieves cost savings, we are  making four recommendations to OMB.
