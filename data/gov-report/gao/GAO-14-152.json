In  February 2012, the DOD Deputy Chief Management Officer granted  Milestone B approval for DEAMS to enter the Engineering Development  Phase of the acquisition life cycle, which is considered the official start of  the program. DEAMS program functionality is intended to be implemented  across the Air Force in a series of releases in two increments\u2014Increment  1 will include six releases and Increment 2 will include two releases.  DOD has approved the funding for the Air Force to proceed with the  acquisition of the functionality for the first increment of DEAMS. This  funding is approximately $1.6 billion, with deployment scheduled to occur  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.

The methodology is a compilation of characteristics and  associated best practices that federal cost estimating organizations and  industry use to develop and maintain reliable cost estimates throughout  the life of an acquisition program.", "In May 2012, we issued the Schedule Guide as a companion to the Cost  Guide. A consistent methodology for developing, managing, and  evaluating capital program cost estimates includes the concept of  scheduling the necessary work to a timeline, as discussed in the Cost  Guide. Simply put, schedule variances are usually followed by cost  variances. Because some program costs, such as labor, supervision,  rented equipment, and facilities, cost more if the program takes longer, a  reliable schedule can contribute to an understanding of the cost impact if  the program does not finish on time. In addition, management tends to  respond to schedule delays by adding more resources or authorizing  overtime. Further, a schedule risk analysis allows for program  management to account for the cost effects of schedule slippage when  developing the life-cycle cost estimate. A cost estimate cannot be  considered fully credible if it does not account for the cost effects of  schedule slippage.", "A well-planned schedule is a fundamental management tool that can help  government programs use public funds effectively by specifying when  work will be performed in the future and measuring program performance  against an approved plan.

Appendix I contains  our detailed analysis of the DEAMS schedule estimate. The success of  any program depends on having a reliable schedule of the program\u2019s  work activities that will occur, how long they will take, and how the  activities are related to one another. As such, the schedule not only  provides a roadmap for systematic execution of a program, but also  provides the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address  potential problems, and promote accountability.", "Comprehensive. A schedule should reflect all activities as defined in the  program\u2019s work breakdown structure, including activities to be performed  by the government and the contractor; the resources (e.g., labor,  materials, and overhead) needed to do the work; and how long each  activity will take.", "We found that the schedule used to support the Milestone B decision  included the activities to be performed by both the government and  contractor for Releases 1 through 3 of Increment 1. However, the  schedule did not reflect activities to be performed for Releases 4 through  6 of Increment 1 and for Releases 1 and 2 of Increment 2. The DEAMS  Program Manager stated that a comprehensive schedule for Increment 1  that included the activities for all six releases would not be completed until  mid-2014. The Program Manager also stated that Increment 2 had not  been included because program officials did not know the detailed  activities to be performed that far in advance. To address this issue, the  DEAMS program office developed a roadmap depicting Releases 1  through 6 of Increment 1 and Releases 1 and 2 of Increment 2 with a full  deployment date of fiscal year 2017. However, the program office did  not provide a schedule that supported the estimated dates in the  roadmap.", "A comprehensive schedule should reflect all of a program\u2019s activities and  recognize that uncertainties and unknown factors in schedule estimates  can stem from, among other things, data limitations. As such, a schedule  incorporates different levels of detail depending on the information  available at any point in time. That is, near-term effort will be planned in  greater detail than long-term effort. Effort beyond the near term that is  less well defined is represented within the schedule as long-term planning  packages. Planning packages are a summarization of the work to be  performed in the distant future with less specificity. Planning packages  are planned at higher levels such that a single activity may represent  several months of effort, generic work to be accomplished, or even a  future contract or phase. Planning packages can be used as long as they  are defined and estimated as well as possible. By not including all work  for all deliverables for both increments and all releases, the DEAMS  program could incur difficulties resulting from an incomplete  understanding of the plan and what constitutes a successful conclusion  for the program. DEAMS program officials provided a draft of the  Schedule Management Plan that documented their intent to use a  planning package approach when updating the DEAMS schedule in the  future.", "Resources were identified in the schedule; however, the resources were  not assigned to specific activities in the schedule. Although our analysis  determined that activity durations were manageable and reasonably  estimated, resource availability affects estimates of work and its duration,  as well as resources that will be available for subsequent activities.  DEAMS program management officials told us that government resource  allocations are determined by management as needed. These officials  told us that management does not necessarily take into consideration the  resource information captured in the schedule when determining resource  allocations. However, DEAMS officials did not provide any documentation  that specific resources were being mapped to the schedule. As  mentioned above, the estimates of work required and duration for an  activity are tied to the availability of resources; therefore, the lack of such  information could hinder management\u2019s ability to compute total labor and  equipment hours, calculate total project and per-period cost, resolve  resource conflicts, and establish the reasonableness of the plan.", "Well-constructed. A schedule should be planned so that critical project  dates can be met. To meet this objective, all activities should be logically  sequenced\u2014that is, listed in the order in which they are to be carried out.  In particular, activities that must finish prior to the start of other activities  (i.e., predecessor activities), as well as activities that cannot begin until  other activities are completed (i.e., successor activities), should be  identified and their relationships established. The establishment of a  critical path is necessary for examining the effects of any activity slipping  along this path. The calculation of a critical path determines which  activities drive the project\u2019s earliest completion date. The schedule should  also identify total float so that the schedule\u2019s flexibility can be accurately  determined.", "We found that the majority of logic used to sequence the activities within  the schedule was generally error-free with a minimal use of lags, clearly  indicating to program management the order of activities that must be  accomplished. Although we found few missing logic relationships for  Release 3 of Increment 1, approximately 25 percent of the remaining  activities for Releases 1 and 2 of Increment 1 were missing logic  relationships. Because interdependencies among activities were not  identified, the DEAMS program management officials\u2019 ability to properly  calculate dates and predict changes in the future is impaired. We found a  significant number of constraints for activities throughout the schedule.  A schedule is intended to be a dynamic, proactive planning and risk  mitigation tool that models the program and can be used to track progress  toward important milestones. Schedules with constrained dates can  portray an artificial or unrealistic view of the project. Constraints should be  minimized because they can create false dates in a schedule.", "Further, the schedule did not have a valid critical path and identified  critical activities more by their constraints than by logic. Rather than  relying on constraints, the schedule should use logic and durations in  order to reflect realistic start and completion dates for activities.  Successfully identifying the critical path relies on several factors, such as  capturing all activities, properly sequencing activities, and assigning  resources, which, as noted earlier, had not been done. Without a valid  critical path, management cannot focus on activities that will have  detrimental effects on the key project milestones and deliveries if they  slip.", "We found that total float was not reasonable, and that in some instances  unreasonable float was a direct result of improper sequencing or missing  logic. Releases 1 and 2 of Increment 1 showed that 25 percent of  program activities had total float equal to or greater than 392 working  days, meaning that those activities could slip almost 2 working years and  not affect the end date of the program. Without knowledge of the reason  float exists for a program activity, management cannot determine the  flexibility of tasks and therefore cannot properly reallocate resources from  tasks that can safely slip to tasks that cannot slip without adversely  affecting the estimated program completion date.", "Credible. A schedule should be horizontally and vertically integrated. A  horizontally integrated schedule links products and outcomes with other  associated sequenced activities, which helps verify that activities are  arranged in the right order to achieve aggregated products or outcomes.  A vertically integrated schedule ensures that the start and completion  dates for activities are aligned with such dates on subsidiary schedules  supporting tasks and subtasks. Such mapping or alignment among  subsidiary schedules enables different groups\u2014such as government  teams and contractors\u2014to work to the same master schedule, and  provides assurance that the representation of the schedule to different  audiences is consistent and accurate. A schedule risk analysis should  also be performed using statistical techniques to predict the level of  confidence in meeting a program\u2019s completion date.", "We found that Release 3 of Increment 1 exhibited horizontal integration,  but Releases 1 and 2 of Increment 1 did not because date constraints  prevented forecasted dates from being calculated realistically for future  activities. If the schedule lacks horizontal integration, activities whose  durations are greatly extended will have no effect on key milestones  reflected in the schedule. We further found that Releases 1 and 2 of  Increment 1 did not demonstrate vertical integration. For example, we  found instances where the start dates for the same activities differed by 1  day, 1 week, and 1 month between the government and contractor  schedules. Unless the schedule is vertically integrated, lower-level  schedules will not be consistent with upper-level schedule milestones,  affecting the integrity of the entire schedule and the ability of different  teams to work to the same schedule expectations.", "DEAMS program management officials stated that a schedule risk  analysis had not been conducted because the schedule had not been  approved to be used as a baseline schedule\u2014the target schedule against  which program performance can be measured, monitored, and reported.  These officials stated that although this analysis had not been conducted,  they were collecting best-case and worst-case durations from the  contractor with their periodic schedule delivery. These data can be used  by program management to calculate more reliable estimates of durations  for future activities. However, we found that the schedule did not contain  best- or worst-case duration data for 600 of 605 detailed activities. For the  five instances where duration data were contained in the schedule, we  determined that four were questionable because two activities were  already completed and two had already exceeded the worst-case  estimate. If a schedule risk analysis is not conducted, program  management cannot determine the likelihood of the project\u2019s completion  date, how much schedule risk contingency is needed to provide an  acceptable level of certainty for completion by a specific date, risks most  likely to delay the project, how much contingency reserve each risk  requires, and the paths or activities that are most likely to delay the  project. As discussed later, the lack of a schedule risk analysis can affect  the credibility of the cost estimate.", "Controlled. A schedule should be continuously updated using logic,  durations, and actual progress to realistically forecast dates for program  activities. A schedule narrative should accompany the updated schedule  to provide decision makers and auditors a log of changes and their effect,  if any, on the schedule time frame. The schedule should be analyzed  continuously for variances to determine when forecasted completion  dates differ from planned dates. This analysis is especially important for  those variations that affect activities identified as being in a program\u2019s  critical path and that can affect a scheduled completion date. A baseline  schedule should be used to manage the program scope, the time period  for accomplishing it, and the required resources.", "We found that DEAMS program management met weekly to discuss  proposed schedule changes and updated the schedule\u2019s progress.  However, a schedule narrative was not prepared by DEAMS program  management. In addition, we found a number of date anomalies  throughout the schedule, including activities with planned start dates  scheduled to occur in the past and activities with actual finish dates  scheduled to occur in the future. We also found a number of out-of- sequence activities in the schedule\u2014activities that started before their  predecessors finished, in contradiction to the planned sequence. If the  schedule is not continually monitored to determine when forecasted  completion dates differ from planned dates, then it cannot be used to  determine whether schedule variances will affect work needed to be  accomplished at a future date.", "We also found that there was no baseline schedule that could be used to  measure program performance. DEAMS program management officials  did maintain a schedule narrative document that contained a list of  custom fields and assumptions; however, the document did not explain  ground rules and assumptions, justifications for logic, and other unique  features of the schedule. These officials stated that other process  documents were being developed. Without a formally established  baseline schedule to measure performance against, management cannot  identify or mitigate the effect of unfavorable performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updated Schedule Also Did Not Follow Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Our assessment of the updated schedule dated October 2012 found that  it was not comprehensive, well-constructed and credible. Although the  DEAMS Program Manager stated that the government and contractor  activities for Releases 1 through 3 of Increment 1 had been integrated in  the October 2012 schedule, this schedule was not comprehensive.  Specifically, it excluded activities for both the government and contractor  related to Releases 4 through 6 of Increment 1 and Releases 1 and 2 of  Increment 2. If activities are missing from the schedule, then other best  practices will not be met. The schedule was also missing relationships for  a significant number of the remaining milestones and activities. In  addition, the October 2012 schedule included a significant number of date  constraints with little or no justification for their use in the schedule.  Similar to the previous schedule, the updated schedule presented  unreasonable float throughout and did not include a schedule risk  analysis. As a result of these shortcomings, the updated schedule was  not reliable. Further, program officials could not rely on this schedule as a  baseline to effectively manage and monitor program performance.", "In May 2013, program management officials provided another updated  DEAMS schedule that they stated included some improvements, but they  acknowledged that it contained issues that prevented the schedule from  meeting best practices. For example, these officials stated that the May  2013 schedule included long-term planning packages for activities related  to Releases 4 through 6 of Increment 1 and Releases 1 and 2 of  Increment 2, integrated government and contractor activities, and  reduced the number of constraints and out-of-sequence activities in the  schedule. However, the officials acknowledged that several outstanding  issues remained related to, for example, vertical and horizontal  integration, missing logic relationships, and the lack of a schedule risk  analysis. Although we did not independently assess the May 2013  schedule to determine whether it met the four schedule characteristics,  we did confirm that it included long-term planning packages, which are  needed to create a complete picture of the program from start to finish  and to allow the monitoring of a program\u2019s critical path. The results of our  analyses of the schedule that supported the February 2012 Milestone B  decision and October 2012 DEAMS schedule reflect similar weaknesses  to those we reported in October 2010.

The  cost estimate captured such things as the source data used, the  calculations performed and the results of the calculations, and the  rationale for choosing a particular estimating methodology. This  information was captured in such a way that the data used to derive the  estimate can be traced back to, and verified against, the sources so that  the estimate can be easily replicated. However, there was no discussion  of efforts taken, if any, to ensure the reliability of the data used. The  DEAMS Program Management Office presented evidence of receiving  approval of the estimate through briefings to management.", "Accurate. A cost estimate should be based on an assessment of most  likely costs (adjusted properly for inflation), updated to reflect significant  changes and grounded in a historical record of cost estimating and actual  experiences on other comparable programs.", "We found that the cost estimate for DEAMS was accurate. The cost  estimate provided results that were substantially unbiased, and the cost  model detailed the calculations and inflation indexes underlying the  estimate. Calculations within the model could be traced back to  supporting documentation. The cost estimate was updated regularly to  reflect significant changes in the program and updated annually to  incorporate actual costs expended in prior fiscal years. Further, the cost  estimate was based on historical data. However, the cost estimate did not  discuss variances between planned and actual costs, which would enable  estimators to assess how well they are estimating program costs and to  identify lessons learned.", "Credible.

An  independent cost estimate developed by the Air Force Cost Analysis  Agency was reconciled to the program\u2019s estimate. However, a sensitivity  analysis was not completed for each of the major cost drivers. As a result,  the cost estimator will not have a clear understanding of how each major  cost driver is affected by a change in a single assumption and thus which  scenario most affects the cost estimate. Further, as discussed previously,  because a schedule risk analysis was not performed as required by best  practices, the cost estimate does not include a contingency amount to  account for any schedule slippage that could occur.
