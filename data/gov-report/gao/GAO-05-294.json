By 2002, almost one-fourth of the 100 largest plans were less than 90 percent funded. Further, because of leeway in the actuarial methodology and assumptions sponsors may use to measure plan assets and liabilities, underfunding may actually have been more severe and widespread than reported. Additionally, 62.5 percent of sponsors of the largest plans each year on average made no cash contribution because the rules allow sponsors to satisfy minimum funding requirements through plan accounting credits that substitute for cash contributions. From 1995 to 2002, only 6 unique plans in our sample were subject to an additional funding charge (AFC), the primary funding mechanism to address underfunding, a total of 23 times. By the time a firm was subject to an AFC, its plan was likely significantly underfunded, and such plans remained poorly funded. By using other funding credits, just over 30 percent of the time sponsors of these plans were able to forgo cash contributions in the years their plans were assessed an AFC. Two very large and significantly underfunded plans terminated without their sponsors owing a cash contribution in the 3 years prior to termination, illustrating further weaknesses in the AFC. To the extent that financially weak firms sponsor underfunded plans, weaknesses in funding rules create a potentially large financial risk to PBGC and thus retirement security generally. From 1995 to 2002, on average each year, 9 of the largest 100 plans had a sponsor with a speculative grade credit rating, suggesting financial weakness and poor creditworthiness. Plans of speculative grade-rated sponsors had lower average funding levels and were more likely to incur an AFC than other plans. As of September 30, 2004, PBGC estimated that plans of financially weak companies with a \"reasonably possible\" chance of termination had plans with an estimated $96 billion in underfunding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\u2019s (PBGC) single-employer  insurance program is a federal program that insures certain benefits of the  more than 34 million worker, retiree, and separated vested participants of  over 29,000 private sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans. In recent  years, because of unfavorable economic conditions and the collapse of  large underfunded pension plans sponsored by well-known firms like  Bethlehem Steel, U.S. Airways, and United Airlines, the program\u2019s  financial condition has worsened significantly. From a $9.7 billion surplus  at the end of fiscal year 2000, the program reported a $23.3 billion deficit  as of September 2004, including a $12.1 billion loss for fiscal year 2004. In  addition, financially weak firms sponsored DB plans with a combined   $96 billion of underfunding as of September 2004, up from $35 billion as of  2 years earlier.

An amendment to  ERISA and the tax code added the additional funding charge (AFC), a  supplementary charge assessed to sponsors of certain underfunded plans.

In previous reports, we  have called for comprehensive DB pension reform that, among other  elements, would include changes to the current funding rules to encourage  firms to better, and more transparently, fund their plans. We have also  called for a range of PBGC insurance program and other related reforms.  Because of the risks facing the single-employer program, in July 2003 we  placed the program on our high-risk list of government operations facing  significant vulnerabilities.

DB plan formulas vary widely, but benefits are frequently based on  participant pay and years of service, and typically paid upon retirement as  a lifetime annuity, or periodic payments until death. Because DB plans  promise to make payments in the future, and because tax-qualified DB  plans must be funded, employers must use present value calculations to  estimate the current value of promised benefits. The calculations require  making assumptions about factors that affect the amount and timing of  benefit payments, such as an employee\u2019s retirement age and expected  mortality, and about the expected return on plan assets, expressed in the  form of an interest rate. The present value of accrued benefits calculated  using mandated assumptions is known as a plan\u2019s \u201ccurrent liability.\u201d  Current liability provides an estimate of the amount of assets a plan needs  today to pay for promised benefits.", "Before the enactment of ERISA, few rules governed the funding of DB  pension plans, and participants had little assurance that they would  receive the benefits promised. ERISA, and several amendments to the law  since its passage, established minimum funding requirements for sponsors  of pension plans in order to try to ensure that plans contain enough assets  to pay promised benefits. In principle, a sponsor must annually fund the  amount required to fund the plan\u2019s \u201cnormal cost,\u201d the amount of earned  benefits allocated during that year, plus a specified portion of other  liabilities that may be amortized over a period of years.", "Compliance with the minimum funding requirements is recorded through  the plan\u2019s funding standard account (FSA). The FSA tracks events that  affect the financial health of a plan during that plan year: credits, which  reflect improvements to the plan\u2019s assets, such as contributions, amortized  experience gains, and interest; and charges, which reflect an increase in  the plan\u2019s financial requirements, such as the plan\u2019s normal cost and  amortized charges such as the initial actuarial liability, experience losses,  and increases in a plan\u2019s benefit formula. If FSA credits exceed charges in  a given plan year, the plan\u2019s FSA registers a net \u201ccredit balance\u201d that may  be carried forward to the next plan year; conversely, a prior year\u2019s funding  deficiency also carries forward. The FSA credit balance at year-end is  equal to the FSA credit balance at the beginning of the year plus FSA  credits less FSA charges.  Compliance with the minimum funding standard  requires that the FSA balance at the end of the year is non-negative. An  existing credit balance accrues interest and may be drawn upon to help  satisfy minimum funding requirements for future plan years, and therefore  may offset the need for future cash contributions.", "ERISA and the IRC prescribe rules regarding the assumptions that  sponsors must use to measure plan liabilities and assets. For example, for  plan years 2004 and 2005, the IRC specifies that the interest rate used to  calculate a plan\u2019s current liability must fall within 90 to 100 percent of the  weighted average of the rate on an index of long-term investment-grade  corporate bonds during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the  beginning of the plan year. Similarly, rules dictate that sponsors report an  \u201cactuarial\u201d value of assets that must be based on reasonable assumptions  and must take into account the assets\u2019 market value. This value may  differ in any given year, within a specified range, from the current market  value of plan assets, which plans also report. While different assumptions  will change a plan\u2019s reported assets and liabilities, sponsors eventually  must pay the amount of benefits promised; if the assumptions used to  compute current liability differ from the plan\u2019s actual experience, current  liability will differ from the amount of assets actually needed to pay  benefits.", "Funding rules generally treat a plan as an ongoing entity, and plans do not  necessarily have to maintain an asset level equal to current liabilities every  year. However, the funding rules include certain mechanisms that are  intended to keep plans from becoming too underfunded. One such  mechanism is the AFC, introduced by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of 1987 (OBRA \u201887). The AFC requires sponsors of plans with more  than 100 participants that have become underfunded to a prescribed level  to make additional plan contributions in order to prevent funding levels  from falling too low. With some exceptions, plans with an actuarial value  of assets below 90 percent of current liabilities are affected by the AFC  rules. The rules for determining the amount of the AFC are complex, but  they generally call for sponsors to pay a percentage of their unfunded  liability. Under current law, plans that owe an AFC may still apply FSA  credits to meet their funding obligation and therefore may not be required  to satisfy the AFC with a cash contribution.", "In addition to setting funding rules, ERISA established PBGC to guarantee  the payment of the pension benefits of participants, subject to certain  limits, in the event that the plan could not. Under ERISA, the termination  of a single-employer DB plan may result in an insurance claim with the  single-employer program if the plan has insufficient assets to pay all  benefits accrued under the plan up to the date of plan termination. PBGC  may pay only a portion of a participant\u2019s accrued benefit because ERISA  places limits on the PBGC benefit guarantee. For example, PBGC generally  does not guarantee benefits above a certain amount, currently $45,614  annually per participant at age 65. Additionally, benefit increases arising  from plan amendments in the 5 years immediately preceding plan  termination are not fully guaranteed, although PBGC will pay a portion of  these increases. Further, PBGC\u2019s benefit guarantee is limited to the  monthly straight life annuity benefit the participant would receive if she  were to commence the annuity at the plan\u2019s normal retirement age.  Sponsors of PBGC-insured DB plans pay annual premiums to PBGC for  their coverage. Premiums have two components: a per participant charge  paid by all sponsors (currently $19 per participant), and a \u201cvariable-rate\u201d  premium that some underfunded plans pay based on the level of unfunded  benefits.", "Despite the presence of minimum funding rules and the AFC, plan  underfunding has persisted. In recent years, the level of total plan  underfunding has increased rapidly, from about $39 billion in 2000 to an  amount estimated to exceed $450 billion as of September 30, 2004. While  the single-employer program has over $39 billion in assets to pay benefits  in the near term, it already faces liabilities of over $62 billion. Thus, there  is concern that the expected continued termination of large plans by  bankrupt sponsors will push the program more quickly into insolvency,  generating greater pressure on the Congress, and ultimately the taxpayers,  to provide PBGC financial assistance to avoid reductions in guaranteed  payments to retirees. Because of concerns about the long-term viability  of the single-employer program, as illustrated by its growing accumulated  deficit (see fig. 1), in July 2003 we placed the program on GAO\u2019s high-risk  list of agencies and programs that need broad-based transformations to  address major challenges. In October 2003, we identified several  categories of reform that the Congress might consider to strengthen the  program over the long term. We concluded that the Congress should  consider comprehensive reform measures to reduce the risks to the  program\u2019s long-term financial viability. These suggested reforms included  strengthening funding rules, along with possibly modifying program  guarantees; restructuring PBGC premiums; improving the transparency of  plan and program information; and certain other reforms.", "GAO has a statutory responsibility for auditing the overall financial  position of the executive branch of the U.S. government. In a recent  report, we describe the serious challenges facing the nation from current  fiscal policies that, if unchecked, will lead to large, escalating, and  unsustainable budget deficits. This fiscal challenge stems in part from  increasing obligations of retirement-related programs like Social Security,  which faces long-term financial insolvency because of increased life  expectancy. Improvements in life expectancy have extended the average  amount of time spent by workers in retirement, from 11.5 years in 1950 for  the average male worker to 18 years as of 2003.", "In February 2005, the Administration proposed several measures designed  to strengthen funding for single-employer DB pension plans. The main  elements of reform include (1) reforming the funding rules to ensure that  sponsors keep their retirement promises; (2) improving disclosure to  workers, investors, and regulators about pension plan status; and   (3) reforming premiums to better reflect a plan\u2019s risk and restoring the  PBGC to financial health.

Given that DB plans on average held approximately half of their assets in  stocks from 1995 to 2000, the decline in stock prices meant a sharp  decline in the value of many plans\u2019 pension assets. In addition, over the  sample period, 30-year Treasury bond rates, which served as the  benchmark for the rate used by plans to calculate pension liabilities,  generally fell steadily, raising liabilities.

This weighting offers  sponsors the advantage of being able to smooth fluctuations in liabilities  that sharp swings in interest rates would cause, thereby reducing volatility  in minimum funding requirements and making funding more predictable.  However, the weighting reduces the accuracy of liability measurement  because the rate anchoring reported liabilities is likely to differ from  current market values. If the rates used to calculate current liabilities are  falling, this would have the effect of decreasing the rise in reported  liabilities associated with lower rates, making plans appear better funded  than they actually were. In a rising interest rate environment, the opposite  would be true. However, because rules allowed sponsors to measure  liabilities using a rate above the 4-year weighted average, sponsors could  reduce plan current liabilities compared with what their value would be if  calculated at current rates. The 4-year weighted average of the reference  30-year Treasury bond rate exceeded the current market rate in 76 percent  of the months between 1995 and 2002, and the highest allowable rate for  calculating current liabilities exceeded the current rate in 98 percent of  those months.

The actuarial value of assets cannot be  consistently above or below market, but in a given year may be anywhere  from 80 to 120 percent of market asset level. In our sample, 86 percent of  plans reported a different value for actuarial and market assets. On  average, using the market value instead of actuarial value of assets would  have raised reported funding levels by 6.5 percent each year. However,  while the market value exceeded actuarial value of assets during the late  1990s, when plan funding was generally strong, in the weaker funding year  of 2002 market assets dipped below actuarial assets. In 2001 and 2002,  calculating plan funding levels using market assets would have greatly  increased the number of plans below 90 percent funded each year. A  similar calculation for 2002 would have drastically increased the number  of large plans below 80 percent funded, from 6 to 24.

Annual cash contributions for the 100 largest plans averaged  approximately $97 million on plans averaging $5.3 billion in current  liabilities. This average contribution level masks a large difference in  contributions between 1995 and 2001, during which period annual  contributions averaged $62 million (in 2002 dollars), and in 2002, when  contributions increased significantly to $395 million per plan. Further, in   6 of the 8 years in our sample, a majority of the largest plans made no cash  contribution to their plan (see fig. 3). On average each year, 62.5 plans  received no cash contribution, including an annual average of 41 percent  of plans that were less than 100 percent funded.", "The funding rules allow sponsors to meet their plans\u2019 funding obligations  through means other than cash contributions. If a plan has sufficient FSA  credits from other sources, such as an existing credit balance or large  interest or amortization credits, to at least match its FSA charges, then the  plan does not have to make a cash contribution in that year. Because  meeting minimum funding requirements depends on reconciling total  annual credits and charges, and not specifically on cash contributions,  these other credits can substitute for cash contributions.", "From 1995 to 2002, it appears that many of the largest plan sponsors  substituted a significant amount of FSA credits for cash contributions. The  average plan\u2019s credit balance carried over from a prior plan year totaled  about $572 million (2002 dollars) each year, and 88 percent of plans on  average carried forward a prior credit balance into the next plan year from  1995 to 2002. Not only could these accumulated credit balances help a plan  to meet minimum funding obligations in future years, but they also accrue  interest that further augments a plan\u2019s FSA credits. In contrast to large  prior-year credit balances, annual cash contributions averaged only   $97 million, in 2002 dollars. On average each year, cash contributions  represented 90 percent of the minimum required annual funding (from  cash and credits). However, this average figure was elevated by high  levels of contributions by some plans in 1995, 1996 and 2002. From 1997 to  2000, when funding levels were generally strong, cash contributions  averaged only 42 percent of minimum required annual contributions (see  fig. 4). During these years, a majority of plans in our sample received no  cash contribution (see fig. 5). Cash contributions represented a smaller  percentage of annual minimum required funding during years when plans  were generally well funded, indicating that in these years more plans  relied more heavily on credits to meet minimum funding obligations.", "In addition to large credit balances brought forward from prior years,  sponsors added funding credits from other sources. For example, plans  reported approximately $42 million (2002 dollars) each year in net interest  credits. These credits accrue to a plan\u2019s FSA like interest on a bank  account, accruing to an existing credit balance at the beginning of the plan  year and to other credits, such as contributions, added during the plan  year. Rules also allow plans to accrue credits from the excess of a plan\u2019s  calculated minimum funding obligation above the plan\u2019s full funding  limitation; these credits averaged $47 million (2002 dollars) from 1995 to  2002. Other plan events result in plan charges, which reflect events that  increase the plan\u2019s obligations. For example, plans reported annual  amortization losses, which could result from actual investment rates of  return on plan assets below assumed rates of return (including outright  losses) or increases in the generosity of plan benefits; these net  amortization charges averaged almost $28 million (2002 dollars) in our  sample. Total funding credits, offset by charges, may help satisfy a plan\u2019s  minimum funding obligation, substituting for cash contributions, and may  explain why a significant number of sponsors made zero cash  contributions to their plans in many years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSA Accounting Rules Can Make Required Contributions Less Volatile but May Obscure Funded Status and Reduce Contributions", "paragraphs": ["The FSA credit accounting system provides some advantages to DB plan  sponsors. Amortization rules require the sponsor to smooth certain events  that affect plan finances over several years, and accumulated credit  balances act as a buffer against swings in future funding requirements.  These features often allow sponsors to better regulate their annual level of  contributions. In contrast, contributions and funding levels might fluctuate  greatly from year to year if funding were based strictly on yearly  differences between the market value of plan assets and current liabilities.  Thus, a contribution system with an FSA accounting feature may make  funding requirements less volatile and contributions more predictable than  one in which funding was based entirely on current assets and liabilities.  Similarly, current-law measurement and funding rules provide a plan with  some ability to dampen volatility in required funding caused by economic  events that may sharply change a plan\u2019s liabilities or assets. Pension  experts told us that this predictability and flexibility make DB sponsorship  more attractive to employers.", "However, the FSA accounting system, by smoothing annual contributions  and liabilities, may distort a plan\u2019s funding level. For example, suppose a  sponsor accrues a $1 million credit balance from making a contribution  above the required minimum in a year. Suppose then that this $1 million  purchases assets that lose all of their value by the following year. Even  though the plan no longer had this $1 million in assets, the sponsor could  still use that credit balance (plus interest on the credit balance) to reduce  this year\u2019s contribution to the plan. Because of amortization rules, the  sponsor would have to report only a portion of that lost $1 million in asset  value as a plan charge the following year. Similarly, sponsors are required  to amortize the financial effect of a change in a plan\u2019s benefit formula,  which might result in increased benefits and therefore a higher funding  obligation, over a 30-year period. Thus, even though higher benefits would  immediately raise a plan\u2019s obligation to fund, the sponsor could spread  this effect in the plan\u2019s FSA over 30 years. This disconnection between the  reported and current market condition of plan finances raises the risk that  plans will not react quickly enough to deteriorating plan conditions.  Further, it reduces the transparency of plan financial information to  stakeholders, such as participants, and investors.", "The experience of two large plans that terminated in a severely  underfunded state help illustrate the potential disconnection between FSA  accounting and the plan\u2019s true funded status. As stated earlier, the  Bethlehem Steel Corporation and LTV Steel Company both had plans  terminate in 2002, each with assets approximately equal to 50 percent of  the value of benefits. Yet each plan was able to forgo a cash contribution  each year from 2000 to 2002, instead using credits to satisfy minimum  funding obligations, primarily from large accumulated credit balances  from prior years. Despite being severely underfunded, each plan reported  an existing credit balance in 2002, the year of termination (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full Funding Limitation Rule May Have Allowed Some Plan Sponsors to Forgo Plan Contributions", "paragraphs": ["Another possible explanation for the many instances in which sponsors  made no annual cash contribution regards the full funding limitation  (FFL). The FFL is a cap on minimum required contributions to plans that  reach a certain funding level in a given plan year. However, the FFL does  not necessarily represent the contribution that would raise plan assets to  the level of current liability. Between 1995 and 2002, rules permitted some  plans with assets as low as 90 percent of current liability to reach the FFL,  meaning that a plan could be considered fully funded without assets  sufficient to cover all accrued benefits. The FFL is also distinct from the  plan\u2019s annual maximum tax-deductible contribution. Because sponsors  may be subject to an excise tax on contributions above the maximum, the  annual maximum contribution can act as a real constraint on cash  contributions. In contrast, the FFL represents a \u201cmaximum minimum\u201d  contribution for a sponsor in a given year\u2014a ceiling on the sponsor\u2019s  minimum funding obligation for the plan.", "Flexibility in the FFL rule has allowed many plan sponsors to take steps to  minimize their contributions. In our sample, from 1995 to 2002  approximately two-thirds of the sponsors in each year made an annual  plan contribution at least as large as the plan\u2019s FFL. However, in 65  percent of these instances, the sponsor had chosen the highest allowable  rate to calculate current liability; using a lower rate to calculate current  liability may have resulted in a higher FFL, and therefore may have  required a higher contribution. Further, the FFL was equal to zero for   60 percent of plans each year, on average. This means that these plans  were permitted to forgo cash contributions as a result of the FFL rule.

In some years, the maximum deductible  contribution rules truly constrained some sponsors from making any cash  contribution. In 1998, 50 of 60 plans that contributed to the maximum  deductible amount had a maximum deductible contribution of zero (see  fig. 6). This meant that any cash contribution into those plans that year  would generally subject the sponsor to an excise tax. For 37 of these  plans, this was the case even if the sponsor had chosen the lowest  statutorily allowed interest rate for plan funding purposes, which would  have produced the highest calculated current liabilities. This constraint  did not apply to as many plans in some other years. For example, in 1996,  52 plans contributed the maximum deductible amount. Thirty of these  plans had a maximum deductible contribution of zero.

To determine if a  sponsor owes an AFC, rules dictate that the sponsor calculate current  liability using the highest allowable interest rate, which results in a plan\u2019s  lowest possible measure of current liability. Because the highest allowable  rate exceeded current market rates in 98 percent of the months from   1995 to 2002, this likely lowered current liability measures for AFC  purposes, which would cause fewer plans to be assessed an AFC. In our  sample, 5 plans that reported funding levels below 80 percent on a current  liability basis did not owe an AFC, perhaps because current liability does  not require the use of the highest allowable interest rate.", "Sponsors that owed an AFC had mixed success at improving their plans\u2019  financial conditions in subsequent years, and most of these plans remained  significantly underfunded.

Applying an alternative measure of plan funding that used the  reported market value measure of plan assets, we obtained broadly similar  results. Plans of speculative grade-rated sponsors were also more likely  to be underfunded. From 1995 to 2002, each year, on average, 18 percent  of speculative grade-rated plans had assets that were below 90 percent of  current liability. Plans of nonspeculative grade-rated sponsors had just  over half this incidence, or an average of 10 percent of plans funded below  90 percent of current liability.", "Large plans sponsored by firms with a speculative grade rating were also  more likely to incur an AFC.

No high investment grade sponsors  (those rated AAA or AA) were required to pay an AFC for this period.  While the AFC is intended to be a backstop for underfunded plans, for our  sample, it affected only those plans that were rated A or lower. The AFC  may, to some extent, protect PBGC from additional losses so plans cannot  become even more underfunded, especially if the plan is at risk for  financial distress. However, to the extent that speculative grade-rated  sponsors are considered to pose a significant risk for near-term  bankruptcy, the AFC may not be an effective mechanism for improving a  plan\u2019s funding level. Plan sponsors that are in financial distress are, by  definition, having difficulty paying off debts and may be ill equipped to  increase cash contributions to their plan. That is, the AFC itself may be a  symptom of plan distress rather than a solution to improve a plan\u2019s  funding level.

The Administration has already presented a  proposal for reform and others may soon emerge from the Congress. While  the complexity of the challenges suggests a considerable debate ahead, the  emerging consensus that action needs to be taken may be cause for  optimism.", "Our analysis here examines the effectiveness of certain funding rules and  suggests that these rules have contributed to the general underfunding of  pensions and, indirectly, to PBGC\u2019s recent financial difficulties. The  persistence of a large number of underfunded plans, even during the  strong economic period of the late 1990s, implies that current funding  rules are not stringent enough to ensure that sponsors can fund their  pensions adequately. Perhaps even more troubling is that current rules for  measuring and reporting plan assets and liabilities may not reflect true  current values and may understate the funding problem. Further, the very  small number of sponsors of underfunded plans that pay the AFC indicates  that the rule needs to be strengthened if it is to serve as the primary  mechanism for shoring up assets in underfunded plans.", "The current rules have the reasonable and important goals of long-term  funding adequacy and short-term funding flexibility so as to reduce annual  contribution volatility. However, our work shows that although the current  system permits flexibility, it also permits reported plan funding to be  inadequate, misleading, and opaque, and even so, funding and  contributions for some plans can still swing wildly from year to year. This  would appear not to serve the interest of any DB pension stakeholders  effectively. The challenge is determining how to achieve a balance of  interests: how to temper the need for funding flexibility with accurate  measurement, adequate funding, and appropriate transparency.

This would appear not to serve the interest of any DB pension  stakeholders effectively.", "Despite flaws in the funding rules, our work here shows that most of the  largest plans appear to be adequately funded. Rules should acknowledge  that funding will vary with cyclical economic conditions, and even  sponsors who make regular contributions may find their plans  underfunded on occasion. Periodic and mild underfunding is not usually a  major concern, but it becomes a threat to workers\u2019 benefits and to PBGC  when the sponsor becomes financially weak and the risk of bankruptcy  and plan termination becomes likely. This suggests that perhaps the  stringency of certain funding rules can be adjusted depending on the  financial strength of the sponsor, with stronger sponsors being allowed  greater latitude in funding and contributions than weaker sponsors that  might present a near-term bankruptcy risk. However, focusing more  stringent funding obligations on weak plans and sponsors is difficult in  that strong firms and industries can quickly become risky ones, and once  sponsors and plans become too weak, it may be difficult for them to make  larger contributions and still recover.", "It should be noted also that while change in the funding rules is an  essential piece of the reform puzzle, it is certainly not the only piece.  Indeed, pension reform is a challenge precisely because of the necessity of  fusing together so many complex, and sometimes competing, elements  into a comprehensive proposal. Ideally, effective reform would  improve the accuracy of plan asset and liability measurement while  minimizing complexity and maintaining contribution flexibility;    develop a PBGC insurance premium structure that charges sponsors  fairly, based on the risk their plans pose to PBGC, and provides  incentives for sponsors to fund plans adequately;    address the issue of severely underfunded plans making lump-sum  resolve outstanding controversies concerning cash balance and other  hybrid plans by safeguarding the benefits of workers regardless of age;  and  improve plan information transparency for PBGC, plan participants,  unions, and investors in a manner that does not add considerable  burden to plan sponsors.", "Developed in isolation, solutions to some of these concerns could erode  the effectiveness of other reform components or introduce needless  complexity.

For example, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid  serve the larger population of retired and disabled workers, many of  whom are also affected by DB reform. The demographic dynamics of  increased longevity in life and retirement affecting the DB system also  affect these other programs, intensifying existing fiscal pressures on the  federal budget. Thus, DB pension reform, with these other issues, has  important implications both for the distribution of retirement income for  current and future generations and for our overall success in addressing  these broader budgetary challenges.", "Even with meaningful, carefully crafted reform, it is possible that some DB  plan sponsors may choose to freeze or terminate their plans. Sponsor exit  is a serious concern, given the important role DB plans play in providing  retirement security. However, this is a natural consequence of the inherent  trade-off that exists in a private pension system that on one hand depends  on voluntary plan sponsorship and on the other is tax subsidized and   backed by federal insurance in order to promote the retirement security of  our nation\u2019s workers.

Such  reform may result in a system with features very different from the  framework currently governing DB plans and PBGC. However, significant  reforms that would place the DB system and PBGC on a sounder financial  footing could also be enacted and could retain many of the features of the  current regulatory system. Should the Congress choose to move in this  latter direction, this report highlights certain areas where carefully crafted  changes could improve plan funding. Specifically, the Congress should  consider measures that include    Strengthening the additional funding charge. One way to do this  would be to consider raising the threshold levels of funding that trigger  the AFC so that any sponsor with a plan less than 90 percent funded  would have to make additional contributions. So that plans do not have  an incentive to fund just barely above 90 percent, additional  consideration may be given for a gradual phase-in of the AFC for plans  that are underfunded between 90 percent and 100 percent of current  liability. Requiring that financially weak plans that owe an AFC base  their contributions on termination liability rather than current liability  might add stringency to the minimum funding rules and might be  appropriate, since weak sponsors of underfunded plans present a  greater risk of distress termination to PBGC than other sponsors.  These reforms could be enacted singly or jointly, but each would  subject more plans to an AFC, and the reforms would shore up at-risk  plans before underfunding becomes severe.", "Limiting the use of FSA credits toward meeting minimum  funding requirements. We have noted that some sponsors repeatedly  relied on FSA credits, such as a prior year credit balance or net interest  credits, to avoid making cash contributions to their plans, and that this  has been particularly problematic for underfunded plans prior to their  termination. While FSA credits may have the benefit of moderating  contribution volatility in the near term, they also have the weakness of  allowing the sponsors of severely underfunded plans to avoid cash  contributions and may contribute to volatility later. The Congress  should consider ways, even if it retains the FSA, to scale back the  substitution of credits for annual cash contributions.", "While admittedly an extremely complicated matter, meaningful effective  reform must confront the issue of accurate measurement.
