This testimony is based on a recent report for the ranking member of this subcommittee on the content, quality, and cost of the Border Patrol's basic training program for new agents and addresses (1) the extent to which the Border Patrol's basic training program exhibits the attributes of an effective training program and the changes to the program since September 11, 2001; (2) the cost to train a new agent and how this compares to the costs of other similar law enforcement basic training programs; and (3) any plans the Border Patrol has developed or considered to improve the efficiency of its basic training program. To address these issues, GAO reviewed relevant documents; observed classroom training and exercises at the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico; assessed the methodologies of training cost estimates; and interviewed Border Patrol officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Border Patrol's basic training program exhibits attributes of an effective training program. GAO's training assessment guide suggests the kinds of documentation to look for that indicate that a training program has a particular attribute in place. The Border Patrol's training program included all of the applicable key attributes of an effective training program. The core curriculum used at the Border Patrol Academy has not changed since September 11, but the Border Patrol added new material on responding to terrorism and practical field exercises. Border Patrol officials are confident that the academy can accommodate the large influx of new trainees anticipated over the next 2 years. In fiscal year 2006, the average cost to train a new Border Patrol agent at the academy was about $14,700. While differences in programs make a direct comparison difficult, it appears that the Border Patrol's average cost per trainee at the academy is consistent with that of training programs that cover similar subjects and prepare officers for operations in similar geographic areas. For example, the estimated average cost per trainee for a Bureau of Indian Affairs police officer was about $15,300; an Arizona state police officer, $15,600; and a Texas state trooper, $14,700. The Border Patrol is considering several alternatives to improve the efficiency of basic training delivery at the academy and to return agents to the field more quickly. For example, in October 2007 the Border Patrol plans to implement a proficiency test for Spanish that should allow those who pass the test to shorten their time at the academy by about 30 days. The Border Patrol is also considering what training it can shift from the academy to postacademy training conducted in the field, which could further reduce the amount of time trainees spend at the academy. However, Border Patrol officials have expressed concerns with having a sufficient number of experienced agents available to serve as first-line supervisors and field training officers. The Border Patrol also currently lacks uniform standards and practices for field training, and shifting additional training responsibilities to the field could complicate this situation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our work on the  costs and challenges related to training 6,000 new Border Patrol agents by  the end of December 2008.", "The U.S. Border Patrol is responsible for patrolling 8,000 miles of the land  and coastal borders of the United States to detect and prevent the illegal  entry of aliens and contraband, including terrorists and weapons of mass  destruction.

According  to Border Patrol officials, this could benefit about half of all trainees,  because about half of all recruits already speak Spanish. The Border Patrol  also plans to convert postacademy classroom training to computer-based  training beginning in October 2007, allowing agents to complete the 1-day- a-week training at their duty stations rather than having to travel to the  sector headquarters for this training. As a result, fewer senior agents will  be required to serve as instructors for postacademy training. Finally, the  Border Patrol is considering what other training it can shift from the  academy to postacademy and field training conducted in the sectors,  which could further reduce the amount of time trainees spend at the  academy.", "While these strategies may improve the efficiency of training at the  academy, officials expressed concern about the sectors\u2019 ability provide  adequate supervision and continued training once the new agents arrive at  the sectors. Some Border Patrol officials are concerned with having  enough experienced agents available in the sectors to serve as first-line  supervisors and field training officers for these new agents. According to  the Chief of the Border Patrol, agencywide the average experience level of  Border Patrol agents is about 4 or 5 years of service. However, in certain  southwest border sectors the average experience level is only about 18  months. Moreover, the supervisor-to-agent ratio is higher than the agency  would like in some southwest sectors. Border Patrol officials told us that a  5-to-1 agent-to-supervisor ratio is desirable to ensure proper supervision of  new agents, although the desired ratio in certain work units with more  experienced agents would be higher. Our analysis of Border Patrol data  showed that as of October 2006, the overall agent-to-supervisor ratios for  southwest sectors, where the Border Patrol assigns all new agents, ranged  from about 7 to 1 up to 11 to 1.", "These ratios include some work units with a higher percentage of  experienced agents that do not require the same level of supervision as  new agents. To augment the supervision of new agents, the Border Patrol  is considering using retired Border Patrol agents to act as mentors for new  agents. Nevertheless, given the large numbers of new agents the Border  Patrol plans to assign to the southwest border over the next 2 years, along  with the planned reassignment of experienced agents from the southwest  border to the northern border, it will be a challenge for the agency to  achieve the desired 5-to-1 ratio for new agents in all work units in those  sectors receiving the largest numbers of new agents.", "In addition to concerns about having a sufficient number of experienced  agents to serve as supervisors and field training officers, the Border Patrol  does not have a uniform field training program that establishes uniform  standards and practices that each sector\u2019s field training should follow. As a  result, Border Patrol officials are not confident that all new trainees  currently receive consistent postacademy field training. Moreover, the  addition of new training expectations may complicate this situation. The  Border Patrol is in the process of developing a uniform field training  program that it plans to implement beginning in fiscal year 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["While Border Patrol officials are confident that the academy can  accommodate the large influx of new trainees anticipated over the next   2 years, the larger challenge will be the sectors\u2019 capacity to provide  adequate supervision and training. The rapid addition of new agents along  the southwest border, coupled with the planned transfer of more  experienced agents to the northern border, will likely reduce the overall  experience level of agents assigned to the southwest border. In turn, the  Border Patrol will be faced with relying on a higher proportion of less  seasoned agents to supervise these new agents. In addition, the possible  shifting of some training from the academy to the sectors could increase  demand for experienced agents to serve as field training officers.  Moreover, without a standardized field training program, training has not  been consistent from sector to sector, a fact that has implications for the  sectors\u2019 ability to add new training requirements and possibly  consequences for how well agents will perform their duties. To ensure that  these new agents become proficient in the safe, effective, and ethical  performance of their duties, it will be extremely important that new agents  have the appropriate level of supervision and that the Border Patrol have a  sufficient number of field training officers and a standardized field training  program.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
