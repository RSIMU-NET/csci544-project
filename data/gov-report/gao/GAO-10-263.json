These funding formulas are typically established  through statute and expressed as one or more equations containing one or  more variables. Executive branch agencies also use formulas to determine  the amount of federal matching grants for jointly funded federal assistance  programs where the amount of the federal match varies among the states  based upon the formula calculation. For example, Medicaid\u2019s Federal  Matching Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is determined through a statutory  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income relative to U.S. per capita  income. Various statutory or administrative provisions can also modify  the amount that would otherwise be determined under the formula. These  provisions may be included to avoid disruptions that could be caused by  year-to-year changes in funding, to cover fixed costs of a program, or for  other reasons.", "Congress can use formula grants to target funds to achieve federal  assistance program objectives by including specific variables in the  formulas that relate to the programs\u2019 objectives. For example, for a  program intended to serve a specific segment of the population, the  formula may contain variables that measure or identify the subset of the  population. Therefore, the formula for a program designed to provide  services for children in low income areas may contain variables that  identify the total number of children living in poverty in a certain area.", "Historically, many formulas have relied at least in part on decennial census  and related data as a source of these variables. The decennial census  collects, among other things, information on whether a residence is owned  or rented, as well as respondents\u2019 sex, age, and race. To update decennial  population counts, the Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates Program produces  population estimates for each year following the last published decennial  census, as well as for past decennials, using administrative records such as  birth and death certificates and federal tax returns. Census-related data  stem from the decennial census and the Bureau\u2019s population estimates and  include (1) surveys with statistical samples designed to represent the  entire population using data from the decennial census or its annual  updates, and (2) statistics derived from decennial census data, its annual  updates, or census-related surveys.", "Two of the census-related surveys produced by the Bureau include the  American Community Survey (ACS) and the Current Population Survey  (CPS). The ACS is an annual survey of about 3 million housing units that  collects information about people and housing, including information  previously collected during the decennial census. The CPS is a monthly  survey of about 50,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau for  the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides data on the labor force  characteristics of the U.S. population. Supplemental questions also  produce estimates on a variety of topics including school enrollment,  income, previous work experience, health, employee benefits, and work  schedules.", "Federal agencies use census data, annual updates, and surveys based on  these data to produce other statistics used in federal assistance grant  formulas. For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis produces per  capita income data\u2014a derivative of decennial census data\u2014by dividing  personal income by population obtained from census population  estimates. Per capita income is used to calculate Medicaid\u2019s FMAP.

Further, the extent to which one particular factor can affect the role of  population in grant funding varied across programs. Although at least one  factor that could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas  was present in each program in our review, the number and combination  of factors varied across programs.

The examples presented below are  illustrative and do not necessarily indicate the relative importance of a  factor compared to the other factors present."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Variables Other Than Total Population Can Affect Role of Population in Grant Funding Formulas", "paragraphs": ["All of the programs in our review included one or more grants with  formulas containing variables other than total population. Obviously,  absent other factors, funding based on these formulas will be affected less  by changes in population than those that rely solely on total population.  The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund formula is based on total population  and a subset of total population\u2014states\u2019 shares of individuals aged 5 to 24  relative to total population. The Federal Transit Program grants for  urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 are based on total population  and variables related to the level of transit service provided. TANF  supplemental grants are awarded based on a formula with multiple  variables. According to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s  Administration of Children and Families (ACF), which administers the  program, supplemental grants are awarded to states with exceptionally  high population growth in the early 1990s, historic welfare grants per poor  person lower than 35 percent of the national average, or a combination of  above average population growth and below average historic welfare  grants per poor person. Medicaid\u2019s FMAP is based on a 3-year average of a  state\u2019s per capita income relative to U.S. per capita income with per capita  income defined as personal income divided by total population. The  FMAP is affected by both changes in population and personal income.  Because changes in population and personal income are not correlated,  the affect of a population change may be diminished or increased by a  change in personal income. Finally, because per capita is squared\u2014that is,  multiplied by itself\u2014in the formula, the affect of a population change may  be greater than if per capita income were not squared.", "In addition to the number of variables, the number of equations can also  affect the role of population in grant funding formulas. Under CDBG,  metropolitan counties and cites are eligible for the greater of the amounts  calculated under two different equations. The variables in the first  equation are population, extent of poverty, and extent of overcrowded  housing. The variables in the second equation are population growth lag,  extent of poverty, and age of housing. The use of the dual equation  structure and the variables other than population in each equation reduce  the effect of population changes on grant funding.", "Some formulas also have base amounts that are set at the amount of  funding in a specified prior year and the remainder for funding is  calculated according to a formula. For programs with set base amounts,  only a portion of the funding might be affected by a change in population.  Because appropriation amounts can change from year to year, the base  amount portion of the grant will represent less of the total grant amount if  appropriations increase, making total grant funding affected more by a  change in population. When appropriations decrease, the share of the  overall funding subject to the formula is lower, lessening the effect of a  change in population on total funding.", "Some programs we reviewed contained such base amounts in their  funding formula. Under IDEA Part B, generally each state first receives the  same amount it received for fiscal year 1999 for the program for children  aged 3 through 21, and, for the program for children aged 3 through 5, the  amount the state received in fiscal year 1997. For the remainder of the  state\u2019s funding in a given year, (1) 85 percent is based on the state\u2019s share  of the 3 through 21 year old population for the school-aged program, and  the 3 through 5 year old population for the preschool program and (2) 15  percent is based on the state\u2019s share of those children living in poverty. In  another example, the Head Start program guarantees the same base  amount as in the prior year. The remainder of the funding is allocated to  cost of living increases and Indian and migrant and seasonal Head Start  programs depending upon the amount remaining. According to ACF,  which administers Head Start, when the increase in appropriation is large  enough to allow for expansion of Head Start, those funds are calculated  based on the relative share of children aged 3 and 4 living in poverty in  each state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors That Modify the Formula Amount Could Affect the Role of Population in Grant Funding", "paragraphs": ["Some factors modify the amount that a state would otherwise receive  under the funding formula and could affect the role of population in grant  funding formulas. The factors include the following: (1) hold harmless  provisions and caps; (2) small state minimums; and (3) funding floors and  ceilings.", "Hold Harmless Provisions/Caps: Hold harmless provisions and caps limit  the amount of a decrease or increase from a prior year\u2019s funding. Hold  harmless provisions guarantee that the grantee will receive no less than a  specified proportion of a previous year\u2019s funding. If a population change  resulted in a decrease in funding below a designated amount, the hold  harmless provision would raise the amount of funding above what the  grantee would otherwise have received under the formula and the amount  of the increase would be deducted from the funding amounts of grantees  not affected by the hold-harmless provision. Title I includes a hold  harmless provision guaranteeing the amount made available to each local  educational agency (LEA) not be less than from 85 to 95 percent of the  previous fiscal year\u2019s funding, depending on the LEA school age child  poverty rate.", "Similarly, caps\u2014also known as \u201cstop gains\u201d\u2014limit the size of an annual  increase as a proportion of a previous year\u2019s funding amount or federal  share. If a population change resulted in an increase in funding above a  certain amount, the cap would limit the effect of the population change.  Under IDEA Part B, no state\u2019s allocation is to exceed the amount the state  received under this section for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the  sum of 1.5 percent and the percentage increase in the amount  appropriated under this section from the preceding fiscal year.", "Small-State Minimums: Small-state minimums guarantee that each state  will receive at least a specified amount or percentage of total funding.", "These minimums can typically benefit smaller states that would otherwise  receive allocations below the minimum. However, whether a state is  considered \u201csmall\u201d depends upon the program and is not necessarily based  directly on a state\u2019s population or geographic size. Several components  within the federal-aid highway program contain such state minimums. For  example, there is a statutory 0.5 percent state minimum on the annual  apportionment from the Highway Trust Fund to the Surface  Transportation Program for states having less than a specified threshold of  qualifying roads, vehicle miles traveled on those roads, and taxes paid into  the fund. When states\u2019 minimums are applied, grant funding formulas may  be affected less by changes in population.", "Floors/Ceilings: Floors and ceilings are lower and upper limits placed on  the amount a state can receive under a formula. If a change in population  results in funding under the formula falling below the floor, the state  would be guaranteed the amount of the floor. If a population change  results in the state exceeding the ceiling, the state could not receive more  than the ceiling amount. The federal government\u2019s share of Medicaid  expenditures ranges from 50 percent (floor) to 83 percent (ceiling).  Although 1973 was the most recent year that any state was affected by the  ceiling, states often benefit from the FMAP floor. In fiscal year 2009, 13  states received the minimum 50 percent matching rate. In our 2003 report  on federal formula grant funding, we found that in 2002, under the  statutory formula, which is based on the ratio of a state\u2019s per capita  income relative to U.S. per capita income, Connecticut would have  received a 15 percent federal matching rate. Despite Connecticut\u2019s  relatively high per capita income\u2014a calculation based in part on  population\u2014Connecticut received a 50 percent federal match. For  Connecticut, in this particular year, the floor affected the role of  population in the amount of the federal match. Similarly, because CHIP\u2019s  matching formula is based on the Medicaid FMAP, CHIP\u2019s enhanced FMAP  is also affected by Medicaid\u2019s floor and ceiling. For example, if a state  was affected by the 50 percent floor, the state would receive a matching  percentage of 65 percent. As a result, funding for states benefiting from the  floor would be affected less by changes in population.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days from the  report date.
