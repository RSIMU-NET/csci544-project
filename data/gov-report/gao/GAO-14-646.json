GAO previously identified best practices that state that a project timeline is critical for managing and measuring an entity's performance on projects and that choosing and documenting well-regarded criteria that are used to make comparisons can lead to strong, defensible conclusions. Initially, VA planned to conclude the Dialysis Pilot after the pilot locations were all open for 5 years. However, in March 2014, VA officials told GAO they are no longer operating under this timeline but instead plan to conclude the pilot once the pilot locations achieve (1) the creation of a model for a VA-operated, free-standing dialysis clinic that can be replicated by other VA medical centers (VAMC) and (2) the confirmation of the time necessary for a pilot location to reach a \u201cbreakeven point.\u201d VA considers that a pilot location has achieved a breakeven point when it repays its start-up funding and the VAMC realizes a cost savings because its treatment cost for dialysis at the pilot location is lower than purchasing care from non-VA dialysis providers. However, VA has not formally documented these pilot location achievements as criteria for concluding the Dialysis Pilot. By not doing so, the transparency of VA's management decisions on pilot location outcomes is compromised and the Department lacks accountability for ensuring the success of the Dialysis Pilot.", "The Dialysis Pilot has been under evaluation for 2 years by VA and the contractor it selected to conduct an independent analysis of pilot location quality of care and treatment costs. However, neither has concluded its evaluation. Specifically, VA noted that the delayed openings and initial operational issues of two pilot locations\u2014Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Cleveland, Ohio\u2014led to limited data availability, and it recommended another 12 months of data be collected on these two pilot locations before drawing conclusions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA document its plans for concluding the Dialysis Pilot.

Veterans with ESRD are generally  prescribed dialysis, which is a life-saving medical procedure that removes  excess fluids and toxins from the bloodstream. Dialysis treatments are  time intensive. Specifically, veterans receiving dialysis treatments  typically must receive three outpatient treatments per week with each  treatment lasting about four hours. Veterans usually remain on dialysis for  the rest of their lives unless they receive a kidney transplant. Due to VA\u2019s  limited dialysis capacity in its own facilities, VA most commonly provides  dialysis to veterans by referring them to non-VA dialysis providers in their  local communities through the Non-VA Medical Care Program (non-VA  medical care). In fiscal year 2013, VA referred about 14,000 veterans to  non-VA dialysis providers at a cost of about $425 million.", "In 2009, VA began developing a pilot program at several VA medical  centers (VAMC) to provide dialysis to veterans in VA-operated dialysis  clinics in response to several issues\u2014including an increasing number of  veterans needing dialysis, rising costs of providing dialysis through non- VA medical care, and unsuccessful efforts to lower these costs. The  resulting Dialysis Pilot was approved by the Secretary of VA in  September 2010. Ultimately, VA believes the Dialysis Pilot will lead to the  development of a business model with a mission of providing more  veterans\u2019 dialysis treatments in VA facilities and less through non-VA  medical care. Through this pilot, VA established four VA-operated dialysis  clinics located near sponsoring VAMCs in Durham and Fayetteville, North  Carolina; Cleveland, Ohio; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Raleigh  and Fayetteville pilot locations opened in June 2011, the Philadelphia  pilot location opened in October 2012, and the Cleveland pilot location  opened in July 2013.", "In May 2012, we issued a report on VA\u2019s Dialysis Pilot that identified  several weaknesses in VA\u2019s execution of the planning and early  implementation phases of the pilot. Specifically, we found VA did not  appropriately document its pilot location selection process, produce  consistent and comparable cost estimates for pilot locations, provide clear  and timely written guidance on how to repay start-up funding to VA  Central Office, and provide guidance on how to calculate cost savings  generated by the pilot locations.concern about issues raised in our prior report, you asked us to continue  our evaluation of VA\u2019s Dialysis Pilot.

To calculate each pilot  location\u2019s average cost per treatment, VA divided each pilot location\u2019s  total health care costs by its total number of treatments. To calculate  non-VA dialysis providers\u2019 average cost per treatment, VA created a  composite figure using the average per treatment contract rate from  the two largest non-VA dialysis providers located in each pilot  location\u2019s VISN, a per treatment VA claims processing fee, a per  treatment VA physician cost for nephrology oversight, and a per  treatment VA financial administrative cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dialysis Pilot Evaluation Contractor Review", "paragraphs": ["In September 2012, VA awarded a 3-year contract to an evaluation  contractor to provide an independent evaluation of its Dialysis Pilot\u2014 including a comparison of the clinical quality provided by the four pilot  locations with non-VA dialysis providers and a dialysis per treatment cost  comparison between the pilot locations and the Non-VA Medical Care  Program.", "Clinical quality: To evaluate the clinical quality of care provided by  the pilot locations, the evaluation contractor is assessing the results of  several measures\u2014such as mortality, hospitalization, and infection  rates\u2014for the pilot locations and comparing them to relevant state  and national results.

According to VA officials, the first  achievement that indicates success is the creation of a model for a  VA-operated, free-standing dialysis clinic that can be replicated by  other VAMCs. Such a model would include clear documentation of the  necessary staff, equipment, time, and resources required to establish  a new clinic and serve as a guide to other VAMCs seeking to  establish similar clinics. VA officials did not specify a timeline for the  creation of this model; however, they did state that they believe the  pilot locations have already achieved this milestone.", "Pilot location breakeven points. VA officials stated that the second  achievement that indicates success is the confirmation of the time  necessary for a pilot location to reach its breakeven point\u2014which VA  has defined as the point when a pilot location achieves cost savings in  the Non-VA Medical Care Program for dialysis services for its  sponsoring VAMC and repays its start-up funding to VA Central  Office. Through the Dialysis Pilot, sponsoring VAMCs for the pilot  locations were each provided about $2.5 million in start-up funding to  establish a VA-operated, free-standing dialysis clinic and were to  finish repaying this start-up funding to VA Central Office in fiscal year  2014. According to VA Central Office officials, all four pilot locations  have repaid their start-up funding as of the beginning of fiscal year  2014 and two pilot locations\u2014Raleigh and Fayetteville\u2014have  demonstrated that their cost per treatment is lower than comparable  per treatment costs of non-VA dialysis providers in their areas.  Achieving this breakeven point indicates that the pilot locations are no  longer incurring additional costs for VA and are fulfilling VA\u2019s goal of  providing dialysis treatments to veterans at a lower cost than similar  care provided through non-VA dialysis providers.", "While VA officials indicated they could conclude the Dialysis Pilot once  the pilot locations had created a replicable model and realized their  breakeven points, VA has not formally communicated these  achievements in writing as criteria for concluding the pilot. Moreover,  these criteria were not included in the performance work statement for the  evaluation contractor, and according to a VA official, have not been  formally recorded in any official document.
