Such practices are especially important when TSA moves into the newly created Department of Homeland Security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over a year has passed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  turned commercial aircraft into missiles, killing thousands of people,  destroying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of property, and realigning our national  priorities. These attacks tragically underscore the forces that are likely to  shape American society, the United States\u2019 place in the world, and the role  of the federal government. The federal government is engaged in a  comprehensive review, reassessment, reprioritization, and as appropriate  reengineering of what the government does, how it does business, and in  some cases, who does the government\u2019s business. Leading public and  private organizations in the United States and abroad have found that for  organizations to successfully transform themselves they must often  fundamentally change their cultures so they are more results oriented,  customer focused, and collaborative in nature. Ultimately, federal agencies  will need to transform their cultures to meet the realities of a post- September 11 environment and the challenges of the 21st century.", "In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Congress passed the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) in November 2001, which  created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as a new  organization in the Department of Transportation (DOT). According to  ATSA, TSA is responsible for security in aviation and other modes of  transportation. In addition, ATSA requires TSA to implement specific  practices that are intended to make it a results-oriented organization. Also  in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Congress created the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better coordinate the United  States\u2019 efforts to combat terrorism. The creation of this department moves  TSA and its responsibilities for security of all modes of transportation out  of DOT and into the newly created DHS.", "A key factor to help organizations achieve their missions and program  results is to implement a positive control environment. A positive control  environment provides discipline and structure as well as the climate that  influences the quality of internal control. In essence, a positive control  environment requires management and employees to establish a supportive  attitude toward internal control and conscientious management. As such,  effective internal control includes strategic planning, budget formulation  and execution, organizational alignment and control, performance  measurement, human capital, financial management, information  technology, and acquisition.", "At your request, this report describes TSA\u2019s actions and plans for  implementing the results-oriented practices required in ATSA and  recommends next steps for TSA to take to build a results-oriented  organizational culture and to establish a positive control environment. To  address the objective of this report, we reviewed our models, guides,  reports, and other products on strategic planning and performance  measurement, strategic human capital management, transformation  efforts, and other related areas to identify results-oriented practices and  recommend next steps for TSA. We next analyzed ATSA in relation to our  products to identify any results-oriented practices that were statutorily  required in the legislation. We interviewed officials from various TSA  offices responsible for strategic planning, human capital, training, budget,  public affairs, and policy, among others and reviewed TSA and DOT  missions, performance goals and measures, performance agreements,  policies and procedures, and organizational charts and other relevant  documentation. For additional information on our scope and methodology,  see appendix I.", "This report addresses a part of your larger request for GAO to provide  information on the extent to which TSA\u2019s policies, procedures, and  organizational structure are likely to ensure the adequate oversight of its  workforce of air marshals, airline passenger and baggage screeners, and  other security personnel, as well as other matters. We have testified before  your committee and issued reports on TSA and aviation security that  address issues included in your larger request. In an ongoing effort to  provide real-time, constructive assistance to TSA, we provided TSA with  our guides and reports on strategic planning and strategic human capital  management. See related GAO products listed at the end of this report for a  list of GAO reports, testimonies, guides, and other products related to TSA,  transportation security, and results-oriented practices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Unlike other federal organizations that must transform their existing  cultures, TSA has the opportunity to create a culture that fosters high  performance from the outset. For TSA, this means creating a culture that  focuses on   results rather than processes;  matrixes rather than stovepipes;  an external (citizen, customer, and stakeholder) perspective rather than   employee empowerment rather than micromanagement;  risk management rather than risk avoidance; and  knowledge sharing rather than knowledge hoarding.", "TSA is an organization facing immense challenges to simultaneously build  the infrastructure of a large government agency responsible for security in  all modes of transportation and meet unprecedented deadlines required in  ATSA to federalize aviation security. Two of the most significant deadlines  require TSA to  deploy federal passenger screeners at security checkpoints at 429  airports across the nation by November 19, 2002, and  install explosives detection systems to screen every piece of checked  baggage for explosives no later than December 31, 2002.", "In July 2002, we testified before your committee on the progress TSA has  made in enhancing aviation security and in meeting the deadlines to deploy  federal screeners at security checkpoints and to install explosives  detection systems. At that time, we reported that while TSA\u2019s efforts were  well underway to hire and train thousands of key security personnel,  including federal screeners and security directors, TSA had experienced  unexpected delays in finding and hiring security screener personnel who  met the requirements of ATSA. We also reported that while TSA had made  progress in checking all bags for explosives and planning for the purchase  and installation of explosives detection equipment, TSA had not kept pace  with planned milestones to meet congressional deadlines for using  explosives detection systems to screen 100 percent of checked baggage. In  addition, we reported that TSA had not fully implemented the  responsibilities required in ATSA such as the security of other modes of  transportation, cargo security, and general aviation security. Finally, we  also observed that the move of TSA from DOT to a DHS poses further  challenges that may delay progress on meeting mandated deadlines and  addressing other security vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s transportation  system.", "TSA and DOT leadership have also testified before the Congress at several  hearings on challenges TSA was facing as it tried to meet its deadlines and  other transportation security responsibilities while establishing itself as a  federal organization. Leadership stated that one of TSA\u2019s challenges is to  build a large organization from the ground up. Specifically, in January 2002,  TSA only had approximately 15 employees of the more than 60,000 it  reported it would need by the end of 2002. In addition, the Under Secretary  of Transportation for Security testified that at that time the congressionally  mandated cap on the number of employees it can employ of 45,000 would  limit its ability to meet the deadlines. TSA also testified on the need for  additional funding to meet its security responsibilities and the delays it  experienced in receiving this funding. According to TSA and DOT, delays in  funding and restrictions on the use of the additional funding at that time  had undermined TSA\u2019s ability to meet the deadlines. DOT leadership stated  that TSA is especially disadvantaged by operating under a continuing  resolution because it does not have money from previous years to help  bridge the gaps between programmatic needs and the funding it receives  under the continuing resolution.", "When the Congress created TSA, it required practices consistent with other  government initiatives to restructure their agencies in order to instill  results-oriented organizational cultures. In the United States and abroad,  governments have restructured their agencies to improve the delivery of  government services and clarify accountability for results. During the 1980s  and 1990s, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  reported that its member countries increased efforts to restructure their  public sector organizations for results. Among member countries,  restructured organizations represent about 50 percent, sometimes as high  as 75 percent, of public expenditure and public servants.", "In 1988, the United Kingdom started to restructure its government agencies  to increase their focus on accountability and improve customer service.  Called \u201cexecutive agencies,\u201d these restructured agencies are still the  predominant form of service delivery in the United Kingdom. As of  December 2001, there were over 130 executive agencies covering more  than three-quarters of the British civil service. In July 2002, the Prime  Minister\u2019s Office of Public Services Reform reviewed the performance of  these executive agencies and set out to identify management principles  that may have contributed to their success. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office  concluded that the restructured executive agency model has been a  success and the management principles underlying the restructured  agencies continue to be highly relevant. These principles are: (1) a clear  focus on delivering specified goals within a framework of accountability,  (2) responsibility for performance resting clearly with the chief executive  and agency staff, and (3) an agency focus that is outward rather than  inward.", "In the 1990s, the Congress recognized the need to restructure federal  agencies and to hold them accountable for achieving program results. To  this end, the Congress established performance-based organizations  (PBOs), modeled after the United Kingdom\u2019s executive agencies: the Office  of Student Financial Assistance, United States Patent and Trademark  Office, and Air Traffic Organization. Designed in statute, PBOs were to  commit to clear management objectives and specific targets for improved  performance. These clearly defined performance goals, coupled with direct  ties between the achievement of performance goals and the pay and tenure  of the head of the PBO and other senior managers, were intended to lead to  improved performance. Specifically, the head of the PBO is appointed for a  set term, subject to annual performance agreements, and eligible for  bonuses for improved organizational performance.", "Similarly for TSA, the Congress required an Under Secretary to be  appointed for a 5-year term to manage TSA who is entitled to a bonus based  on performance; measurable goals to be outlined in a 5-year performance  plan and reported annually; a performance management system to include  individual and organizational goals for managers and employees; an annual  performance agreement for the Under Secretary, senior managers, and  staff; an oversight board to facilitate communication and collaboration; and  public reporting requirements to build citizen confidence.", "TSA will be 1 of over 20 originating agencies or their components with  differing missions, cultures, systems, and procedures that are to move into  DHS. The newly created DHS is the most recent manifestation of the  continuing consideration of how best to restructure government to respond  to the challenges of the 21st century. At a GAO-sponsored forum on mergers  and transformation, participants observed that people and cultural issues  are at the center of successful mergers and transformations.

Ultimately, successful organizations  understand that they must often change their culture to successfully  transform themselves, and that such a change starts with top leadership.  Top leadership involvement is essential to overcoming an organization\u2019s  natural resistance to change, marshalling the resources needed in many  cases to improve management, and building and maintaining the  organizationwide commitment to new ways of doing business. At a recent  GAO-sponsored roundtable, we reported on the necessity to elevate  attention, integrate various efforts, and institutionalize accountability to  lead efforts to fundamentally transform an agency and address key  management functions at the highest appropriate level in the  organization. At TSA, the leadership faces a daunting challenge to create  this results-oriented culture. From the outset, this challenge was  exacerbated by the change in TSA\u2019s head position, the Under Secretary of  Transportation for Security, just 8 months after the organization was  established. TSA has continually stated its commitment to becoming a  high-performing organization, and has reinforced that commitment in its  performance agreements for TSA executives.", "TSA leadership has expressed its commitment to creating a results- oriented organizational culture. Specifically, in its 180-day action plan  report to the Congress outlining goals and milestones for defining  acceptable levels of performance in aviation security, TSA stated that it is  committed to \u201cbeing a leading-edge, performance-based organization\u2014an  organization whose operative culture establishes performance  expectations that support the mission, drives those expectations into  organizational and individual performance plans, and collects objective  data to assess its performance.\u201d", "TSA leadership also plans to use the Baldrige performance excellence  criteria as a management tool to promote an awareness of quality and  performance in TSA. These criteria are: leadership, strategic planning,  customer and market focus, information and analysis, human resource  focus, process management, and business results. TSA leadership hired a  former Baldrige award application examiner to be TSA\u2019s Chief Quality  Officer and to head the Office of Quality Performance. According to TSA  officials, the Office of Quality Performance will serve as internal  consultants to TSA management to help them use the Baldrige criteria as a  tool to create a culture focused on performance.", "To hold TSA\u2019s leadership accountable for achieving results, ATSA requires  TSA to establish a performance agreement between the Under Secretary  and the Secretary of DOT that includes organizational and individual  performance goals. A TSA official told us that as of November 2002, no  performance agreement had been finalized for the Under Secretary since  the current Under Secretary has been acting in the position. During times  of transition, high-performing organizations recognize that performance  agreements can reinforce accountability for organizational goals. To this  end, when TSA moves into its new parent department, DHS, TSA can use  performance agreements to maintain a consistent focus on its goals. ATSA  also allows for the Under Secretary to receive a bonus for any calendar  year up to 30 percent of the annual rate of pay, based on a performance  evaluation. However, TSA\u2019s interim performance management system does  not specifically address performance bonuses for the head of TSA.", "In addition, ATSA requires TSA to establish performance agreements  between TSA\u2019s Under Secretary and his or her executives that set  organizational and individual performance goals. TSA has created a  standardized performance agreement for TSA executives as a part of its  interim performance management system. TSA\u2019s executive agreements  include both organizational and individual goals, as shown in figure 1. For  example, each executive performance agreement includes an  organizational goal such as to maintain the nation\u2019s air security and ensure  an emphasis on customer satisfaction. The agreement also includes  individual goals, such as to meet or exceed requirements for satisfactory  performance and to demonstrate commitment to civil rights. In addition,  the agreement includes competencies, such as to provide leadership in  setting the workforce\u2019s expected performance levels and ensure that the  executive\u2019s work unit contributes to the accomplishment of TSA\u2019s mission.  TSA can strengthen these performance agreements by setting explicit  targets that are directly linked to organizational goals.", "Governmentwide, to help hold senior executives accountable for  organizational results, federal agencies are to establish performance  management systems that (1) hold senior executives accountable for their  individual and organizational performance by linking performance  management with the results-oriented goals of the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA); (2) evaluate senior executive  performance using measures that balance organizational results with  customer satisfaction, employee perspectives, and any other measures  agencies decide are appropriate; and (3) use performance results as a basis  for pay, awards, and other personnel decisions. We have found that  progress is needed in explicitly linking senior executive expectations for  performance to results-oriented organizational goals and greater emphasis  should be placed in fostering the necessary collaboration both within and  across organizational boundaries to achieve results.

ATSA\u2019s requirements for TSA are consistent with the results- oriented planning and reporting principles embodied in GPRA. GPRA  provides a strategic planning and management framework intended to  improve federal performance and hold agencies accountable for achieving  results. Effective implementation of this framework requires agencies to  clearly establish results-oriented performance goals in strategic and annual  performance plans for which they will be held accountable, measure  progress towards those goals, determine the strategies and resources to  effectively accomplish the goals, use performance information to make the  programmatic decisions necessary to improve performance, and formally  communicate results in performance reports. Specifically, ATSA requires  TSA to submit to the Congress a 5-year performance plan and an annual  performance report, but does not specify when these documents are to be  submitted to the Congress.", "TSA has taken the first steps to establishing the performance planning and  reporting framework consistent with GPRA. The starting point for the  framework envisioned under GPRA is the strategic plan that describes an  organization\u2019s mission, outcome-oriented strategic goals, strategies to  achieve these goals, and key factors beyond the agency\u2019s control that could  impact the goals\u2019 achievement, among other things. According to TSA  officials, TSA is currently developing its strategic plan. TSA has, however,  made components of its plan public. TSA has articulated its mission, vision,  and values. TSA\u2019s mission is to protect the nation\u2019s transportation systems  to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. TSA\u2019s vision is  to continuously set the standard for excellence in transportation security  through people, processes, and technologies and its values are integrity,  innovation, courtesy and respect, competence, customer focus, dedication,  diversity, and teamwork. In addition, TSA has set an overall strategic goal:  to prevent intentional harm or disruption to the transportation system by  terrorists or other persons intending to cause harm. To support this  strategic goal, TSA has defined three performance goals:  meeting the ATSA mandates to federalize transportation security,  maintaining and improving aviation security, and  servicing TSA customers.", "To demonstrate its progress toward meeting its performance goals, TSA  established an initial set of 32 performance measures. For example, TSA\u2019s  primary performance measures for its performance goal to maintain and  improve aviation security are the percentage of bags screened by  explosives detection systems and the percentage of trained screeners.  Other measures to complement these primary measures include the  percentage of explosives detection systems deployed, the percentage of  screeners with 60 hours of on-the-job training completed, and the  percentage of screeners compliant with training standards. TSA plans to  develop more outcome-oriented goals and measures in fiscal year 2003 and  is in the process of finalizing strategies to achieve its goals.", "To report on its progress in meeting its performance goals and measures,  TSA has begun to build the capacity to gather and use organizational  performance information. TSA has installed an automated performance  management information system, which became operational in April 2002  and is designed to collect and report data on TSA\u2019s performance measures.  Data will be collected from federal security directors, security screener  supervisors, and headquarters officials and reported through Web-based  reports designed for internal decision making and external reporting.  According to TSA officials, the system will be expanded to include goals  and measures related to all modes of transportation in upcoming fiscal  years. As required by ATSA, TSA reported on November 19, 2002, that it  submitted its first annual performance report.", "TSA has linked its aviation security performance goals to those of its parent  department, DOT, to provide a clear, direct understanding of how the  achievement of its performance goals will lead to the achievement of DOT\u2019s  strategic goal for homeland security, as shown in figure 2. Specifically,  TSA\u2019s performance goals to federalize and maintain and improve aviation  security are intended to contribute to DOT\u2019s performance goal to \u201creduce  vulnerability to crime and terrorism and promote regional stability\u201d and its  strategic goal on homeland security, to \u201censure the security of the  transportation system for the movement of people and goods and support  the National Security Strategy.\u201d As TSA establishes its performance goals  for other modes of transportation, it should continue to align its goals with  DOT\u2019s goals. When TSA moves to DHS, it will be necessary to maintain goal  alignment with its new parent department.", "GPRA requires agencies to consult with the Congress and solicit the views  of other stakeholders as they develop their strategic plans. However, TSA  has stated few plans to involve stakeholders in its strategic planning  process. Such consultations provide an important opportunity for TSA and  the Congress to work together to ensure that agency missions are focused,  goal are specific and results oriented, and strategies and funding  expectations are appropriate and reasonable. Results-oriented  organizations also recognize that it is important to broaden stakeholder  involvement to create a basic understanding among stakeholders of  competing goals. As TSA works to meet its goals, it will continue to face  ongoing challenges to balance aviation security against customer service.  While TSA needs to screen passengers and baggage carefully to meet its  goal to maintain the security of the aviation system, it must efficiently  move customers and their baggage through the aviation system to minimize  passenger inconvenience to encourage them to continue using air  transportation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommended Next Steps", "paragraphs": ["Establish security performance goals and measures for all modes  of transportation as part of a strategic planning process that  involves stakeholders.

TSA, as a new organization, has a critical challenge in   (1) integrating potentially more than 60,000 employees into a new  organization, (2) creating a common culture, and (3) achieving its security,  customer satisfaction, and related performance goals in an effective,  efficient, and economical manner. The individual performance  management system can be an essential tool in meeting all three of the  above. To help agency leaders manage their people and integrate human  capital considerations into daily decision making and the program results  they seek to achieve, we developed a strategic human capital model. The  model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies should apply, as well as  some of the steps they can take, to make progress in managing human  capital strategically. In our model, we identify two critical success factors  that can assist organizations in creating results-oriented cultures: (1) a \u201cline  of sight\u201d showing how unit and individual performance link to  organizational goals and (2) the inclusiveness of employees. TSA can apply  these factors to its performance management system to help create a  results-oriented culture.", "ATSA requires TSA to establish a performance management system that is  to strengthen the organization\u2019s effectiveness by providing for the  establishment of goals for managers, employees, and the organization that  are consistent with the agency\u2019s performance plan. TSA used the Federal  Aviation Administration\u2019s system until it established its own system in July  2002, when TSA leadership approved an interim employee performance  management system. The interim system is to remain in place until a  permanent system is created and implemented. As of November 2002, TSA  had not established a time frame for implementing its permanent  performance management system.", "TSA\u2019s interim system provides specific requirements for planning individual  performance, monitoring that performance, determining employee  development needs, appraising performance, and recognizing and  rewarding performance, as shown in figure 3. For example, at the  beginning of the appraisal cycle, employees\u2019 expectations are to be  established using a performance agreement; throughout the cycle  supervisors are to monitor performance; halfway through the performance  cycle supervisors are to provide feedback to employees and identify  employee development needs; and at the end of the cycle, supervisors are  to appraise performance at two levels: fully satisfactory and unacceptable.  Employees may then receive a bonus or other incentive if their  performance is at the fully satisfactory level. TSA\u2019s first appraisal cycle  ended November 15, 2002.", "In addition, ATSA requires that TSA\u2019s performance agreements for its  employees include individual and organizational goals. These performance  agreements can help TSA align individual and organizational goals and  establish the line of sight that helps create a results-oriented culture. TSA  has created standardized performance agreements for groups of employees  including transportation security screeners, supervisory transportation  security screeners, supervisors, and executives. These performance  agreements include a consistent set of organizational goals, individual  goals, and standards for satisfactory performance. Supervisors may  customize performance agreements for the individual job by adding  additional organizational and individual goals and standards of  performance. For example, the standardized performance agreement for  security screeners includes two organizational goals: (1) to improve and  maintain the security of American air travel by effectively deterring or  preventing successful terrorist (or other) incidents on aircraft and at  airports, with minimal disruption to transportation and complete service to  travelers and (2) to ensure an emphasis on customer satisfaction while  maintaining the nation\u2019s air security. In addition, the standardized  performance agreement for security screeners includes an individual goal  to consistently meet or exceed the basic proficiency requirements by:  vigilantly carrying out duties with utmost attention to tasks that will   demonstrating the highest levels of courtesy to travelers and working to  maximize their levels of satisfaction with TSA services,  working as an effective team member at assigned post to ensure that  security violations do not get past the team,  contributing to the accomplishment of TSA\u2019s mission and vision,   behaving in a way that supports TSA\u2019s values, and  demonstrating the highest level of concern for the civil rights of  coworkers and the traveling public.", "Finally, the agreement includes standards for satisfactory performance for  security screeners. Standards include (1) completing all required training  successfully and as scheduled, performing satisfactorily on required  proficiency reviews, and passing operational testing satisfactorily and   (2) performing security functions in an effective and timely manner in  accordance with TSA prescribed guidelines.", "As described in our strategic human capital model, in addition to and  concurrent with the first critical success factor of creating a line of sight  showing how unit and individual performance link to organizational goals,  successful organizations involve employees to build results-oriented  cultures. This critical success factor is especially timely for TSA as it  transitions from its interim performance management system and finalizes  its permanent system. Particularly when developing a new results-oriented  performance management system, leading organizations have found that  actively involving employees can build confidence and belief in the system.

In addition to providing  candid and constructive feedback to help individual employees maximize  their potential in understanding and realizing goals and objectives of the  agency, an effective performance management system provides  management with the objective and fact-based information it needs to  reward top performers and the necessary information and documentation  to deal with poor performers. Under TSA\u2019s interim performance  management system, employee performance is appraised at only two  levels\u2014fully satisfactory and unacceptable. We have observed that such a  pass/fail system does not provide enough meaningful information and  dispersion in ratings to recognize and reward top performers, help  everyone attain their maximum potential, and deal with poor performers.  As a next step, TSA should consider appraisal systems with more than two  standards of performance. By using its performance agreements as the  basis in making distinctions in performance, TSA can have objective and  fact-based information and the documentation necessary to have an  effective performance management system.", "Involve employees in developing its permanent performance  management system. TSA has the opportunity to create a culture that  values the importance of employees to help TSA achieve its goals.  Employee involvement improves the quality of the system by providing a  front line perspective and helping to create organizationwide  understanding and ownership. In addition, even after TSA develops its  permanent performance management system, involving employees in the  process can help employees perceive that the system is fair.", "We have identified practices that organizations can apply to further involve  employees. The practices TSA can adopt to promote inclusiveness and  encourage employee ownership for the permanent performance  management system include the following.", "Seek employee input. Leading organizations not only provide  information to employees but also commonly seek their employees\u2019  input on a periodic basis and explicitly address and use that input to  adjust their human capital practices. As TSA matures as an organization  it can collect feedback using employee satisfaction surveys, focus  groups, employee advisory councils, and/or employee task forces.", "Involve employees in planning and sharing performance information.  Involving employees in the planning process to develop agency goals  helps to increase employees\u2019 understanding and acceptance of them and  improve motivation and morale.

For example, TSA reported  that at that time it had identified security screener standards; selected  private contractors to recruit, assess, and train security screeners;  developed a preliminary plan for deploying federal screeners to the  airports; developed an initial screening checkpoint design; and reviewed  available and emerging explosives detection technology. The report did not  include all of the information required in ATSA. For example, ATSA  required specific information such as the dates of installation of each  system to screen all checked baggage for explosives and the date each  system is operational.", "Since TSA has issued the statutorily required action plan and progress  reports, it has continued to publicly report on its progress. Specifically,  TSA created a Web site that provides information for customers and the  public, including updates on its progress toward meeting the deadlines in  ATSA; speeches, statements, and testimonies by TSA and DOT leadership;  information on aviation security technology such as explosives detection  systems; fact sheets on TSA contractors; frequently asked questions related  to TSA\u2019s policies and procedures; information for the traveling public; and  information on employment opportunities with TSA. For example, a private  citizen could find out when TSA would be hiring security screeners at her  or his local airport, how to apply for a position with TSA, and what objects  are prohibited and permitted to be carried onto an airplane.", "In addition, TSA created an Office of Communications and Public  Information. The purpose of this office is to provide information to the  general public concerning TSA, its people, programs, policies, and events.  To facilitate this mission, the Office of Communications and Public  Information maintains a call center to receive and respond to inquiries  from the public.

TSA established an ombudsman position to, among  other things, serve external customers. Specifically, TSA\u2019s ombudsman is  responsible for recommending and influencing systemic change where  necessary to improve TSA operations and customer service. As of  November 2002, TSA is recruiting to fill this position. We have reported that  through the impartial and independent investigation of citizens\u2019  complaints, federal ombudsmen help agencies be more responsive to the  public, including people who believe their concerns have not been dealt  with fairly or fully through normal channels. Ombudsmen may  recommend ways to resolve individual complaints or more systematic  problems, and may help to informally resolve disagreements between the  agency and the public.", "In addition, TSA is tracking performance on its customer service. For  example, TSA\u2019s primary performance measure for customer satisfaction is  the average wait time and percentage of passenger complaints per 1,000  passengers. Other measures to gauge customer satisfaction include the  percentage of flights delayed due to security issues, the percentage of  incidents/interventions per 1,000 passengers, the number of weapons  seized per 1,000 passengers, and the number of seats delayed due to  security issues, among others.", "As part of its ongoing challenge to balance security against customer  service, TSA is reviewing existing security procedures in order to eliminate  those that do not enhance security or customer service. For example, the  Under Secretary testified that TSA has recently eliminated two procedures  to reduce customers\u2019 \u201chassle factor\u201d at airports. In August 2002, TSA  allowed passengers to carry beverages in paper or foam polystyrene  containers through walk-through metal detectors and prohibited screeners  from asking passengers to drink or eat from any containers of food or liquid  as a security clearance procedure. TSA also eliminated the requirement for  the airlines to ask a series of security-related questions to customers at  check-in. In addition, TSA recently lifted the existing rule that prohibits  parking within 300 feet of airport terminals. TSA has replaced this rule with  parking security measures specific to each airport and linked to the  national threat level.", "Lastly, TSA is also planning to create a customer satisfaction index (CSI)  for aviation operations, which includes collecting customer information  from national polls, passenger surveys at airports, the TSA call center, and  customer feedback at airports. TSA intends to use data from the CSI to  improve performance. As a first step, TSA conducted 12 focus groups with  air travelers to help it understand the aspects of customer experiences that  influence satisfaction with and confidence in aviation security. TSA learned  from the focus groups that:  the federalization of aviation security significantly increased the   key attributes that drive increased satisfaction and confidence include  attentiveness of screeners, thoroughness of the screening process,  professionalism of the workforce, and consistency of the process across  airports;  wait time was not a significant driver of satisfaction, and participants  said they would be willing to wait longer if they thought it would make  them more secure;  the lack of checked baggage screening reduces confidence; and   secondary screening processes are a significant driver of reduced  satisfaction.", "The results of the focus groups will help TSA develop the passenger  surveys to be used to collect data for the CSI.
