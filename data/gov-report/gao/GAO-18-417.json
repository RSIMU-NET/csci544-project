Multiple  hiring officials stated that employees at their human resource offices  may not have an understanding of either the technical nature of the  positions being filled at the lab or the lab\u2019s unique hiring authorities,  and that this lack of knowledge could create delays. Other officials  noted that their servicing human resource offices seemed to be  inflexible regarding certain paperwork requirements. For example,  officials at one lab stated that their human resource office requires  candidates\u2019 resumes to be formatted in a particular way, and that they  have been required to ask candidates to make formatting changes to  their resumes. An official at another lab stated that the lab has faced  similar challenges with regard to the formatting of transcripts and has  had to request clarifying documentation from the university.

Hiring officials and supervisors we interviewed stated that their  lab had lost candidates due to the length of the hiring process. One  supervisor we interviewed stated that he has encountered candidates  who really wanted to work at his lab but had had to pursue other  opportunities because they could not afford to wait to be hired by the  lab. Multiple newly hired employees we interviewed described the  process as slow or lengthy, but described reasons why they were  willing to wait. For example, some employees were already working at  their lab in a contractor or post-doctoral fellowship position, and  accordingly they were able to continue in these positions while  completing the hiring process for the permanent positions they now  hold. One employee stated that if the process had gone on any  longer, he likely would have accepted another offer he had received,  while another employee stated that he knew of at least two post- doctoral fellows at his lab who chose not to continue in the hiring  process for a permanent position at the lab due to the length of the  hiring process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Defense Labs Track Hiring Data, but the Defense Laboratories Office Has Not Obtained and Monitored These Data or Evaluated the Effectiveness of Hiring at the Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["The department and the defense laboratories track hiring data that can be  used to evaluate some aspects of the individual labs\u2019 hiring efforts, but  the Defense Laboratories Office has not routinely obtained or monitored  these data or evaluated the effectiveness of hiring, including the use of  hiring authorities, across the defense laboratories as a whole.  Laboratory hiring data are captured at the department level in the  Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS)\u2014the department\u2019s  system of record for personnel data. In addition, the individual  defense  laboratories track hiring data, including the type of hiring authority used  and certain milestone dates that can be used to measure the length of the  hiring process, known as time to hire.", "According to OPM guidance and our prior work, time to hire is a  measure that may inform about the effectiveness of the hiring process,  and federal agencies are required to report time to hire for certain types of  hiring actions to OPM. Defense laboratory officials stated that, from their  perspectives, the time- to-hire metric does not sufficiently inform about  the effectiveness of the use of specific authorities, particularly when using  the most commonly tracked milestones\u2014from the initiation of a request  for personnel action to an employee\u2019s entrance-on-duty date. For  example, officials stated that when a direct hire authority is used to hire a  candidate who is completing the final year of his or her educational  program, the lab may identify and provide a tentative offer to this  candidate several months prior to graduation, consistent with private- sector recruitment methods. In this case, officials stated that the length of  time between the initiation of the request for personnel action and the  candidate\u2019s entrance-on-duty date, following his or her graduation, could  span a period of several months. According to defense laboratory  officials, the total number of days for this hiring action gives the  appearance that the use of the hiring authority was not efficient in this  case; however, officials stated that it would have been effective from the  supervisor\u2019s perspective, because the use of the hiring authority resulted  in the ability to recruit a highly qualified candidate in a manner that was  more competitive with the private sector.", "Further, time-to-hire data, as reflected by the milestone dates that are  currently tracked across the defense laboratories, may not reflect a  candidate\u2019s perception of the length of the hiring process. More  specifically, a candidate may consider the hiring process to be completed  upon receiving a job offer (either tentative or final), which could occur  weeks or months before the candidate\u2019s entrance-on-duty date, the  commonly used end-point for measuring time to hire. According to  officials, the length of time from when the offer is extended to entrance on  duty can be affected by a candidate\u2019s individual  situation and  preferences, such as the need to complete an educational program or  fulfill family or professional responsibilities prior to beginning work in the  new position. In other cases, certain steps of the hiring process, such as  completing the initial paperwork or obtaining management approval, may  occur after a candidate has been engaged but prior to the initiation of a  request for personnel action\u2014the commonly used start-point for  measuring time to hire. In this situation, the candidate\u2019s perception of the  length of the hiring process may be longer than what is reflected by the  time-to-hire data.", "For the reasons described above, some defense laboratories measure  time to hire using milestones that they have determined more  appropriately reflect the effectiveness of their hiring efforts. For example,  officials from one lab stated that they have sought to measure the length  of the hiring process that occurs prior to the request for personnel action,  while officials from some labs stated that they measure time to hire using  the tentative offer date as an end-point. In addition, some laboratories  informally collect other types of data that they use in an effort to evaluate  their hiring efforts, such as the reasons why candidates decline a job offer  or feedback on the hiring process from newly hired employees.", "However, officials from the Defense Laboratories Office stated that their  office has not conducted any review of the effectiveness of defense  laboratory hiring, including the use of hiring authorities, across the labs.  The National Defense Authorization Action for Fiscal Year 2017 gave  authority to conduct and evaluate defense laboratory personnel  demonstration projects to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Research and Engineering, under which the Defense Laboratories Office  resides. Defense Laboratories Office officials stated that the office has not  evaluated the effectiveness of defense laboratory hiring because it does  not have access to defense laboratory hiring data, has not routinely  requested these data from the labs or at the department level to monitor  the data, and has not developed performance measures to evaluate the  labs\u2019 hiring. As noted, laboratory hiring data are captured at the  department level in DCPDS and in a variety of service- and laboratory- specific systems and tools. However, the Defense Laboratories Office  does not have access to these data and, according to one official, the  office would not have access to defense laboratory hiring data unless  officials specifically requested them from the labs or from the Defense  Manpower Data Center, which maintains DCPDS. According to the  official, the Defense Laboratories Office has not routinely requested such  data in the past, in part because their role did not require evaluation of  such data.", "In addition, the Defense Laboratories Office has not developed  performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of hiring across the  defense laboratories or the labs\u2019 use of hiring authorities. An official from  the Defense Laboratories Office stated that the office may begin to  oversee the effectiveness of the defense laboratories\u2019 hiring efforts and,  in doing so, may consider establishing performance measures to be used  consistently across the labs, which could include time-to-hire or other  measures. However, as of March 2018, the office had not established  such measures for use across the defense laboratories nor provided any  documentation on any planned efforts.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should design appropriate types of control activities to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, including top-level reviews of actual  performance and the comparison of actual performance with planned or  expected results.

In addition, without evaluating the  effectiveness of the defense laboratories\u2019 hiring efforts, the department  cannot understand any challenges experienced by the labs or determine  appropriate strategies for mitigating these challenges.

Officials from the Defense Laboratories Office  stated that the labs were unable to use the authority because the  department\u2019s current process\u2014the publication of a federal register  notice\u2014for allowing the laboratories to use the hiring authority took longer  than anticipated. On June 28, 2017\u20142 \u00bd years after the authority was  granted in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015\u2014the department published a  federal register notice allowing the defense laboratories the authority to  use the direct hire for students.", "DOD officials stated that the department has typically published a federal  register notice whenever the defense laboratories are granted a new  hiring authority in legislation\u2014for example, when an NDAA is issued, or  when certain modifications to the demonstration projects are made. The  Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service\u2014through its personnel  policymaking role for the department\u2014at the time required that the  federal register notice process be used to implement any hiring  authorities granted to the defense labs by Congress in legislation.  These procedures were published in DOD Instruction 1400.37. DOD  officials identified coordination issues that occurred during the approval  process of the federal register notice across the relevant offices as the  cause of the delay associated with this federal register notice.", "Changes to DOD organizational structures further complicated the  process of implementing new hiring authorities for defense laboratories.  Specifically, in late 2016 a provision in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017  shifted the authority to conduct and evaluate defense laboratory  personnel demonstration projects from the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Within the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the  Defense Laboratories Office has been tasked with the responsibility for  matters related to the defense laboratories. According to the Director of  the Defense Laboratories Office, informal discussions about the transition  began shortly after the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 was passed in late  2016. According to that official, despite the shift in oversight responsibility,  coordination between the offices of the Under Secretaries for Research  and Engineering and for Personnel and Readiness is required on issues  related to civilian personnel, including defense laboratory federal register  notices.", "Although a formal process for coordination did not exist at the start of our  review, officials from the Defense Laboratories Office stated that  representatives from the offices have met approximately five times since  December 2016 and were taking steps to establish a coordination  process for implementing new authorities. According to officials from the  Defense Laboratories Office, during those meetings as well as during  other, less formal interactions, officials have taken steps to formalize the  roles and responsibilities of the relevant offices. According to officials  from the Defense Laboratories Office, as of May 2018 the office was  drafting a memorandum to formalize the roles and responsibilities of the  Defense Laboratories Office and the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to correspond to the federal  register notice approval process; however, officials did not provide a  completion date.", "The Defense Laboratories Office established and documented its own  federal register approval process in spring 2017 and updated it in early  2018. The aforementioned memorandum would further describe the roles  and responsibilities for the Offices of the Under Secretary for Research  and Engineering and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Civilian Personnel Policy in carrying out the updated process. According  to officials, this is the process the office will use moving forward for  coordination and approval of any future federal register notices. On March  6, 2018, the Office published a federal register notice that rescinds the  earlier instruction published by the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory  Service of the Office of the Under Secretary of Personnel and Readiness.

Although Defense Laboratories Office  officials provided a flowchart of the office\u2019s updated federal register  approval process for coordination, this process did not include time  frames for specific stages of the coordination. Officials stated that they  cannot arbitrarily assign time frames or deadlines for a review process  because any time frames will be contingent on the other competing  priorities of each office, and other tasks may take priority and thus push  review of a federal register notice down in order of priority. Our prior work  has found that other federal agencies identify milestones, significant  events, or stages in the agency-specific rulemaking process, and track  data associated with these milestones. That work also found that,  despite variability  across federal agencies in the length of time taken by  the federal rulemaking process, scheduling and budgeting for rulemaking  are useful tools for officials to manage regulation development and  control the resources needed to complete a rule.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government further  establishes that management should design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks. Further, management should also  establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate  authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.

We obtained data that were  coordinated by the Defense Manpower Data Center and prepared by the  Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service\u2019s Planning and  Accountability Directorate. These data included, among other things,  hiring process milestone dates and type of hiring authority used for each  civilian hire at the defense laboratories for fiscal years 2015 through  2017. We selected these years because they were the three most recent  years for which hiring data were available, and because doing so would  allow us to identify any trends in the use of hiring authorities or the length  of time taken to hire. The data we obtained were extracted from DCPDS  using the Corporate Management Information System.", "The team refined the data to include only those hiring actions that were  made by the 15 defense laboratories included within the scope of our  review. In addition, we excluded hiring actions that used a 700-series  nature of action code, which denotes actions that relate to position  changes, extensions, and other changes, which we determined should  not be included in our analysis. We included actions that used nature of  action codes in the 100-series (appointments) and 500-series  (conversions to appointments). For the purpose of calculating time to hire,  we also excluded records with missing dates and those for which the  time-to-hire calculation resulted in negative number (that is, the record\u2019s  request for personnel action initiation date occurred after the enter-on- duty date). Specifically, we excluded 92 actions for which no request for  personnel action initiation date was recorded and 205 actions for which  the date occurred after the enter-on-duty date, for a total of 2.57 percent  of all hiring actions. We included in our calculation 7 actions for which the  request for personnel action initiation date was the same date as the  enter-on-duty date, resulting in a time to hire of zero days.", "To determine the extent to which the defense laboratories use existing  hiring authorities, based on the department\u2019s data, we analyzed the  current appointment authority codes identified for individual hiring actions.  Current appointment authority codes are designated by the Office of  Personnel Management and are used to identify the law, executive order,  rule, regulation, or other basis that authorizes an employee\u2019s most recent  conversion or accession action. Based on our initial review of the data,  we determined that, in some cases, more than one distinct current  appointment authority code could be used to indicate the use of a certain  hiring authority. Alternately,  a single current appointment authority code  could in some cases be used for indicating more than one type of  authority. In these cases, the details of the specific type of hiring authority  that was used for the hiring action can be recorded in the description field  associated with the current appointment authority code field. For this  reason, in order to determine the type of hiring authority used, it was  necessary to analyze the description fields for the current appointment  authority code when certain codes were used. Two analysts  independently reviewed each description and identified the appropriate  hiring authority. Following this process, the two analysts compared their  work and resolved any instances in which the results of their analyses  differed. A data analyst used the results to produce counts of the number  of times various categories of hiring authorities were used, as well as the  average time to hire for each hiring authority category.", "For those instances where the analysts could not identify a hiring  authority on the basis of the three digit codes or the description fields, the  hiring actions were assigned to an \u201cunknown\u201d category. We note that the  \u201cunknown\u201d category included 591 hiring actions, or approximately 5  percent of the total data for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. In addition,  within the laboratory-specific direct hire authority category, if a  determination could not be made about the specific type of laboratory- specific direct hire authority used, the hiring action was captured in the  \u201cdirect hire authority, unspecified\u201d category because the action was  clearly marked as one of the laboratory-specific direct hire authorities but  the type of authority (for example, direct hire for veterans) was unclear. Of  the 5,303 hiring actions identified as a laboratory-specific direct hire  authority, 0.1 percent of the hiring actions fell into the unspecified  category. Based on the aforementioned steps and discussions with  officials from the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service and the  Defense Manpower Data Center and reviews of additional documentation  provided to support the data file, as well as interviews with officials from  13 of the laboratories about their data entry and tracking, we determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the  frequency with which the labs used specific hiring authorities and  calculating the time it takes the labs to hire, or time to hire, for fiscal years  2015 through 2017.", "To describe officials\u2019 views of hiring authorities and other incentives, we  conducted a survey of officials at each of the defense laboratories on (1)  their perceptions of the various hiring authorities and incentives, (2)  whether those authorities and incentives have helped or hindered hiring  efforts, (3) the extent to which they experienced barriers to using hiring  authorities, and (4) any challenges during the hiring process, among other  things. We administered the survey to the official at each defense  laboratory who was identified as the Laboratory Quality Enhancement  Program Personnel, Workforce Development, and Talent Management  Panel point of contact, because we determined that this individual would  be the most knowledgeable about his or her lab\u2019s hiring process and use  of hiring authorities. One laboratory\u2014the Space and Naval Warfare  Systems Command Centers\u2014had two designated Laboratory Quality  Enhancement Program Personnel, Workforce Development, and Talent  Management Panel points of contact, one for each of its command  centers (Atlantic and Pacific).

We sent a second reminder email and copy of the questionnaire to those  who had not responded 2 weeks following the initial distribution of the  questionnaire. We received questionnaires from all 16 participants by  August 4, 2017, for a 100 percent response rate. Between July 26 and  October 5, 2017, we conducted additional follow-up with 11 of the  respondents via email to resolve missing or problematic responses.", "Because we collected data from every lab, there was no sampling error.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, how the responses were processed  and analyzed, or the types of people who do not respond can influence  the accuracy of the survey results. We took steps in the development of  the survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these  non-sampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that  were obtained. For example, a survey specialist designed the  questionnaire, in collaboration with analysts having subject matter  expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft questionnaire was pretested to  ensure that questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to  comprehend. The questionnaire was also reviewed by internal subject  matter experts and an additional survey specialist.", "Data were electronically extracted from the Microsoft Word  questionnaires into a comma-delimited file that was then imported into a  statistical program for quantitative analyses and Excel for qualitative  analyses. We examined the survey results and performed computer  analyses to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error, and we  addressed such issues as necessary. Quantitative data analyses were  conducted by a survey specialist using statistical software. An  independent data analyst checked the statistical computer programs for  accuracy.", "To obtain information on department- and service-level involvement in  and perspectives of defense laboratory hiring, we interviewed officials at  the Defense Personnel Advisory Service, Defense Laboratories Office,  Army Office of the Assistant G-1 for Civilian Personnel, and Navy Office  of Civilian Human Resources.

We selected the six laboratories  based on the following two criteria: (1) two laboratories from each of the  three services, and (2) a mix of both corporate research laboratories and  research and engineering centers. In addition, because some hiring  activities can occur at subordinate levels within a laboratory\u2014such as a  division or directorate\u2014we included at least one subordinate level entity  for each service. In total, we selected: Army Research Laboratory  Sensors and Electron Devices directorate; Aviation and Missile Research,  Development, and Engineering Center (Army); Naval Research  Laboratory; Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division; Air Force  Research Laboratory Information directorate; and Air Force Research  Laboratory Space Vehicles directorate. For each lab, we requested to  interview the official(s) most knowledgeable about the lab\u2019s hiring  process, supervisors who had recently hired, and newly hired employees.", "We initially requested to interview one group each of supervisors and  newly hired employees. Following our first round of interviews at one  laboratory, we requested to interview two groups each of supervisors and  newly hired employees. Subsequent to this request, at one lab we were  able to conduct one supervisor interview and at a second lab we were  able to conduct one newly hired employee interview, due to scheduling  constraints.
