While the agency has undertaken several efforts over the years to address the backlog issue, workload increases and long-standing problems associated with the program have impeded their success. The rapid growth in OHA\u2019s pending case backlog and longer case-processing times have caused hardship for those disability claimants who are unable to work or to afford needed medical treatment while awaiting a final decision.

The Social Security Act defines disability under both programs as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a severe physical or mental impairment. The impairment must be medically determinable and expected to last at least a year or result in death.", "Claimants file an application for disability benefits\u2014both DI and SSI\u2014with one of SSA\u2019s over 1,300 field offices.

Claimants who are dissatisfied with the initial DDS determination may request a \u201creconsideration\u201d of the claim within 60 days of their notice of decision.

Upon receipt of a hearing request, hearing office support staff review and prepare the case file for hearing. If necessary, staff may recommend to the ALJ that additional medical evidence be developed before holding a hearing. The hearing is generally the first time in the disability determination process that a claimant has the opportunity for a face-to-face meeting with a decisionmaker. At the hearing, the claimant and witnesses\u2014who may include medical or vocational experts\u2014provide testimony. The ALJ inquires into the issues, receives relevant documents into evidence, and allows the claimant or the claimant\u2019s representative to present arguments and examine witnesses.

These problems have been identified in numerous internal and external studies conducted over the last 2 decades. We reviewed these studies and found that SSA\u2019s key long-standing problems can be classified into four basic categories: multiple levels of claims development and decision-making, fragmented program accountability, decisional disparities between DDS and OHA adjudicators, and SSA\u2019s failure to consistently define and communicate its management authority over the ALJs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hearings Backlog and Case-Processing Times Have Increased With Workload Growth", "paragraphs": ["The number of disabled beneficiaries has steadily increased over the last decade.

Between 1985 and 1995, initial DI and SSI applications increased by 57 percent, from 1.6 million to 2.5 million.

Within SSA, a denied disability claim may pass through as many as four decision-making levels (initial, reconsideration, ALJ hearing, and Appeals Council) before a final decision is rendered. As a claim moves from one level to the next it is readjudicated, and multistep procedures for review, evidence collection, and decision-making are employed.", "In addition to delays associated with multiple layers of review and decision-making, delays also occur as a claim moves from one employee or facility to another and waits at each employee\u2019s desk to be processed. As workloads have grown, the amount of time a claim waits at each processing point has increased. Since 1985, average case-processing time at OHA has grown from 167 days to about 350 days. Following a 1992 review of OHA operations, SSA found that claimants can wait as long as 550 days to receive a hearing decision notice. The same report noted that, in the case of one claim, only 4 days of the 550 involved actual work on the claim. Some of the delay is necessary, however, because of scheduling and due process notice requirements.

SSA\u2019s own internal reviews have found that poor coordination among components has reinforced a lack of understanding among OHA staff of the roles and responsibilities of other components and created the perception that no one is in charge of the disability programs.", "Fragmentation in the disability process is further evidenced by OHA\u2019s organizational and operational separation from the rest of SSA. OHA\u2019s headquarters is located in Falls Church, Virginia, while SSA\u2019s headquarters is located in Baltimore. OHA regional staff are also separated from SSA regional staff. SSA\u2019s own reviews have found that organizational fragmentation has led to a lack of interaction between OHA and the rest of SSA and fostered a \u201cstepchild\u201d mentality among many OHA employees. For example, SSA found that OHA staff had little sense of belonging to the wider SSA and were unfamiliar with its organizational structure, philosophy, and goals. This mentality has affected SSA\u2019s ability to implement operational plans for the disability programs.", "Finally, SSA lacks a common automated database for managing claims as they move through the various components involved in the disability determination process. Consequently, as a claim moves from one organizational level to another, some data must be manually reentered into the computer by the various components, and the status of disability claims is not adequately recorded for reference by others. Outdated manual processes and fragmented automated systems have made improving the disability determination and appeals process difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decisional Disparities Between DDS and OHA Adjudicators", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, ALJs allowed benefits in about 75 percent of the cases they decided. By awarding a relatively high percentage of cases that DDSs have previously denied, ALJs may encourage more appeals to OHA. While all of the reasons for decisional disparities are not conclusively known, many have hypothesized that possible causes include the de novo hearings process, which allows claimants to submit additional evidence upon appeal; face-to-face interviews between ALJs and claimants; decisional errors by both DDSs and ALJs; and different applications of disability decisional policies at the DDS and ALJ levels.", "Some decisional disparities may be attributable to OHA\u2019s de novo hearings process. Under this process, the ALJ does not review the DDS\u2019 decision or rule on its adequacy. Instead, the ALJ conducts what is called a de novo hearing in which evidence is considered and weighed again, and the ALJ issues a decision based on his or her own findings. With the de novo hearing, claimants may submit new evidence to the ALJ that may not have been available at the time of the DDS review and decision. SSA\u2019s reviews have found that more than a quarter of ALJ awards are based on such new evidence, which may include claimant testimony that their condition has worsened since the original DDS review. Thus, by design, some differences in decisional results are built into the system.", "Also, face-to-face interviews between ALJs and claimants may lead to disparate decisions. The ALJ hearing is generally the first time that claimants have the opportunity for a meeting with a decisionmaker. Unlike DDSs, which perform a paper review of the file to determine disability, ALJs personally interview claimants concerning their disability claim. A 1982 SSA study reported that a personal appearance by claimants during the hearing increased the likelihood of an ALJ allowance. In 1989, we reported that hearings provide ALJs with the opportunity to extensively question claimants and that, as a result, ALJs often reverse DDS decisions because they determine that claimants are more limited in their activities than DDSs had perceived.", "Errors made by both DDS staff and ALJs may also contribute to disparities. In a 1994 SSA study, a group of medical consultants and disability examiners found a 29-percent DDS error rate for cases appealed to OHA. In the same study, a group of ALJs found a 19-percent error rate in ALJ allowances. These relatively high rates of error suggest that obtaining consistency across the two levels may be difficult.", "Finally, some disparities may be attributable to SSA\u2019s differing mechanisms for providing decisional guidance to DDSs and ALJs. To determine disability, SSA has a single standard composed of various statutes, regulations, Social Security Rulings, and court rulings governing eligibility. DDS decisionmakers are required to use SSA\u2019s Program Operations Manual System (POMS), which is SSA\u2019s detailed interpretation of the standard. ALJs, on the other hand, are not required to use POMS, which provides little decisional latitude. Instead, they base their decisions on their own interpretation of the statutes, regulations, Social Security Rulings, and court rulings. To an undetermined extent, different interpretations of the same disability standard may cause DDSs and ALJs to reach disparate decisions on the same claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems With SSA\u2019s Management Authority Over ALJs", "paragraphs": ["APA protects ALJ decisional independence. Although ALJs are SSA employees, APA prohibits SSA management from taking actions that might interfere with an ALJ\u2019s ability to conduct full and impartial hearings. However, SSA has not consistently defined and communicated to regional and hearing office management the types of management actions that are legally permissible for managing ALJs without hindering judicial independence.", "SSA\u2019s 1992 Office of Workforce Analysis report found that many ALJs are operating under the belief that they are exempted by APA from nearly all management control. As a result, SSA has experienced numerous legal and operational challenges to its efforts to better manage the appeals process. SSA management has also been reluctant to exercise its management authority over ALJs for fear it will violate APA. The APA issue continues to be important today, because the success of the redesign plan may be affected by the degree of ALJ cooperation and the extent to which SSA can mandate ALJ compliance with the plan\u2019s initiatives.", "In 1989, we reported that, since the 1970s, ALJs had successfully opposed management initiatives to increase their productivity on the grounds that such SSA actions interfered with their decisional independence. Many ALJs believe they need to closely protect their judicial independence because of what they perceive as past excesses of agency authority. For example, in 1977 several ALJs sued SSA when it attempted to impose case production quotas on them. The ALJs alleged that SSA\u2019s actions violated their decisional independence under APA and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. SSA ultimately settled the lawsuit, rescinded its policy of establishing quotas for ALJ dispositions, and revised transfer and training policies to remove any mention of production figures. In the early 1980s, SSA began targeting the decisions of ALJs with high award rates for special review. According to SSA, these reviews were conducted in response to congressional concerns that ALJs with high allowance rates could be more prone to errors. As a result of these reviews, some ALJs were to be subject to retraining and possible disciplinary actions. The initiative prompted a lawsuit by the Association of Administrative Law Judges, which claimed that the practice of targeting selected ALJs violated their decisional independence. Before the court\u2019s ruling, SSA entered into a settlement agreement with the ALJs and rescinded its practice of targeting individual decisionmakers.", "Although APA is an important safeguard of due process, SSA\u2019s own studies confirm that, in many instances, the act has been interpreted in a way that has impeded SSA\u2019s ability to effectively manage day-to-day hearing office work and to implement uniform policies and procedures. For example, SSA\u2019s 1992 Office of Workforce Analysis report noted that an \u201cextreme\u201d interpretation of APA by many ALJs had led to a lack of clear lines of management authority within hearing offices and impeded effective service delivery. SSA also found that hearing offices lacked procedural consistency and effective mechanisms to share \u201cbest practices,\u201d because many ALJs believed judicial independence entitled them to establish their own \u201cunique\u201d work flow procedures. The report also noted that inconsistent procedures resulted in significant variations in the content and organization of hearing office files and created obvious problems when case files were transferred among offices to balance OHA\u2019s workloads.", "SSA also reported a wide variety of organizational configurations among hearing offices, despite an agency effort to actively encourage \u201cpooling\u201d hearing office resources to increase efficiency and distribute work more evenly. Many ALJs opposed the pooling initiative, preferring instead a \u201cunit\u201d system in which each ALJ had his or her own personal staff. SSA reported that several ALJs had rejected the pooling configuration despite the agency\u2019s findings that the \u201cunit\u201d system unnecessarily increased case-processing time. However, the report did not include any directives or recommendations for mandating ALJ compliance with SSA\u2019s pooling efforts.", "In an early 1990s plan to improve the disability appeals process, SSA noted that significant ambiguities existed regarding the limits APA imposed on SSA management practices and that APA issues underlie many of the problems affecting the disability program\u2019s variations in hearing office procedures, work flow, and workload management. In April 1995, SSA once again acknowledged the constraints APA imposed on its ability to manage and called for better clarifying APA principles.", "Our most recent field work confirmed that SSA still has not consistently defined and communicated the types of management actions that are legally permissible under APA. During our review, a number of SSA and OHA managers and staff told us that despite SSA\u2019s recognition of the problems associated with ensuring ALJ compliance with agency initiatives, it has not resolved the issue. Staff commonly complained that ALJs often used APA protections to oppose initiatives they did not agree with and conceded that managers were reluctant to mandate ALJ compliance for fear of violating the act. They also told us that ALJ opposition to prior agency initiatives to improve the appeals process has contributed to the growth in OHA\u2019s backlog of cases and that reducing the backlog will be difficult unless SSA addresses the APA issue. Officials in SSA\u2019s Office of General Counsel also noted that while SSA is aware of the management tools available to it, there have been inconsistencies in the way this information has been communicated agencywide.

These individuals conferred with claimant representatives after reviewing cases, conducted limited case development, and drafted decisions to be reviewed and approved by ALJs. With expanded prehearing conferencing under STDP, OHA attorneys have been given quasi-judicial powers, such as the authority to issue allowance decisions for certain appealed cases without ALJ involvement or approval. Under the initiative, OHA attorneys now engage in extensive development of the case record, conduct conferences with claimant representatives and sources of medical and vocational evidence, and are empowered to issue allowance decisions. If they cannot allow the claim on the basis of their review of the evidence, it is scheduled for hearing before an ALJ.", "OHA guidelines for prehearing conferencing give 595 senior attorneys the authority to issue allowance decisions. To fully implement the initiative, SSA had to pursue a regulatory change giving OHA staff attorneys the authority to decide certain appealed cases that were formerly limited to ALJ jurisdiction. But the process of defining the specific duties and responsibilities these attorneys would have under STDP was lengthy, and implementation did not begin until July 1995, or almost 6 months after the projected start date. Delays also occurred with other initiatives designed to support prehearing conferencing. For example, backlog reduction goals for prehearing conferencing are partly dependent upon STDP initiatives to provide more computers and staff to assist OHA with case preparation and decision-writing. But due to protracted collective bargaining negotiations with SSA\u2019s union and other difficulties, full implementation of these initiatives was delayed for several months. Through expanded prehearing conferencing, SSA had originally expected to process 98,000 additional cases by December 1995 and 126,000 more by December 1996.

The decision to add OHA attorneys was based upon the experiences of SSA\u2019s Boston and New York regional offices, which had tested the use of OHA attorneys in screening units and were obtaining higher allowance rates. According to SSA, the opportunity for screening unit examiners to discuss issues with an attorney gives examiners helpful insight into the intent of the POMS requirements and enables them to reverse incorrect DDS reconsideration denials earlier in the process.", "Most cases reviewed by the screening units are selected on the basis of computer-generated profiles that identify disability claims likely to be incorrectly denied by DDSs. SSA officials contend that \u201cprofiling\u201d minimizes the risk of making incorrect allowances.

The agency also noted that, to substantially improve the level of service to claimants, incremental improvements to the process were no longer feasible. At the time of our review, SSA was in the early implementation planning and testing stages of the redesign effort, and none of the initiatives had been fully implemented.", "To address the problem of multiple levels of claims development and decision-making, the redesign plan includes initiatives to eliminate both DDS reconsideration and Appeals Council reviews. In place of the reconsideration review, SSA plans to establish an Adjudication Officer (AO) position as the focal point for prehearing activities.

By focusing prehearing responsibilities on a single adjudicator, SSA expects that the time needed to ensure the completeness of the record will be substantially reduced and that more appealed cases will be resolved without ALJ involvement.", "The redesign plan also includes initiatives that SSA believes will address the problem of fragmented program accountability. To improve overall accountability for claims processing, SSA plans to revise its management information processes to better assess the agency\u2019s service to claimants. Information regarding staff actions at each step of the process is to be made available to all components, and a single measure of time from the claimant\u2019s first point of contact with SSA until final notification of a decision will be developed.

At the initial DDS level, a Disability Claims Manager position will be established as the focal point for moving the claim through the earliest stages. For OHA\u2019s prehearing activities, the AO position will be the responsible agent. At the hearing level, the ALJ will be the responsible official.

Under the redesigned process, claimants will be provided the opportunity to meet with a DDS decisionmaker before the claim is initially decided. This meeting is intended to ensure that all available evidence has been presented and that claimants understand what evidence will be considered in reaching the decision.
