Nursing home providers are required to disclose parties with an ownership or control interest in order to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. CMS, the HHS agency responsible for managing these two programs, maintains ownership and chain data in its Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). GAO examined (1) the extent of PI nursing home ownership and firms' involvement in homes' operations, (2) whether PECOS reflects PI ownership, and (3) how HHS and states use ownership data for oversight. GAO identified PI ownership using a proprietary database and analyzed data from six PI firms about their interest and involvement in nursing homes. GAO examined PECOS data for selected PI-owned nursing home chains and discussed ownership data with officials from HHS, CMS, and six states that also collect data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that 1,876 unique nursing homes were acquired by PI firms from 1998 through 2008. While some of the acquisitions involved entire nursing home chains, which included both the operations and any owned real estate, other acquisitions involved only the real estate. Sometimes the same nursing homes were acquired more than once. Ten PI firms accounted for 89 percent of the 1,876 unique nursing homes acquired by PI firms during this period. Of the six PI firms from which GAO collected information, those that acquired a chain reported being more involved in nursing home operations than those that only acquired the real estate. These firms had representatives on the nursing home chain's board of directors, but they generally characterized their involvement as related to the chain's strategic direction rather than day-to-day operations. PI firms that acquired real estate only had no representation on the boards of the operating companies, but officials at one PI firm observed that some leasing arrangements have the potential to affect operations. PECOS provided a confusing picture of the complex ownership structures and chain affiliations of the six PI-owned nursing home chains GAO reviewed. The database did not provide any indication of the hierarchy or relationships among the numerous organizational owners listed for PI-owned nursing homes. Further, PI ownership was often not readily apparent in the data, which could be the result of (1) PI firms not being required to be reported because of how they structured their acquisitions, (2) provider confusion about the reporting requirements, or (3) related entities that were reported but were not easily identifiable with the PI firms. Finally, PECOS chain information was not straightforward and was sometimes incomplete, making it difficult to link all the homes in a chain. Compounding these shortcomings, CMS's ability to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reported ownership data is limited. HHS has made limited use of PECOS ownership data. The only CMS division with routine access to PECOS data has been largely focused on populating the database and has not developed any standardized reports on nursing home ownership that it could share with interested parties. Some states collect their own ownership information but it can be limited to owners that operate in their state. As a result, tracking compliance problems among commonly owned homes or multistate chains can be ad hoc. State officials and others expressed interest in nationwide ownership data, such as PECOS, to improve nursing home oversight. Recognizing the growing interest in PECOS data, CMS has established a workgroup to consider how to accommodate the PECOS interests of other groups within the agency and is considering whether and how to provide access to external parties such as states. The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides CMS with an opportunity to address shortcomings in the current PECOS database and to make ownership information available to states and consumers in a more intelligible way."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of HHS and CMS Administrator consider requiring the reporting of certain information to make nursing home ownership structures more understandable and take other actions to improve the accuracy and dissemination of these data as HHS implements new ownership reporting requirements in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. HHS concurred with all of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nursing home industry has experienced significant restructuring in the  last two decades, with many of the nation\u2019s largest nursing home  companies\u2014including publicly traded companies that owned hundreds of  homes\u2014having undergone mergers, bankruptcies, and divestitures.  Recently, private investment (PI) firm ownership of nursing homes has  attracted attention. The ownership interest or securities of PI firms  generally are not publicly traded and their activities are not otherwise  subject to federal financial disclosure requirements. Thus, when a PI firm  acquires a publicly traded nursing home company, essentially taking the  nursing home private, the company\u2019s finances and management become  less transparent. In addition, PI firms may hold their acquisitions for a  short time and place large levels of debt on the acquired entity, leading to  concerns that quality of care may be adversely affected. A 2007 New York  Times investigation of nursing homes owned by PI firms reported that  quality of care declined in homes after they were purchased by such  firms.  Another study, however, did not show a definitive link between PI  ownership of nursing homes and quality of care and called for more work  on the issue.", "To determine the effect of ownership on nursing home quality of care, it is  necessary to have complete and accurate ownership information that  provides a clear understanding of the relationship of each owner to the  nursing home and any other owners. Since at least the late 1970s, the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been required to collect  ownership information on providers, such as nursing homes, participating  in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the largest payers of nursing  home care in the nation. CMS is responsible for oversight of providers  that participate in these two programs. Congressional hearings held in  2007 and 2008 focused in part on quality of care at PI-owned homes and  CMS\u2019s ability to identify homes with common ownership.", "You asked us to look at PI ownership of nursing homes, CMS\u2019s capacity to  identify nursing home owners, and the impact of PI ownership on the  quality of care provided. This report addresses (1) the extent of PI  ownership of nursing homes and PI firms\u2019 involvement in the operations of  homes they have acquired, (2) whether PI ownership of nursing homes is  reflected in the ownership information reported to CMS, and (3) how  nursing home ownership data are used for oversight by HHS and states.  We plan to examine the impact of PI ownership of nursing homes on the  quality of care in a subsequent report.", "To identify the extent of PI ownership of nursing homes, we examined PI  acquisitions from 1998 through 2008, primarily using merger and  acquisition data compiled by Dealogic, a company that offers financial  analysis products to the investment banking industry. We assessed the  procedures that Dealogic uses to collect and analyze data and determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  supplemented the Dealogic data with information about additional  acquisitions that we identified through other sources, including press  releases from company Web sites, nursing home industry publications, an company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Because some homes were sold more than once during the 1998 through  2008 period and also because of the way some of the PI nursing home  acquisitions were structured, we report PI nursing home acquisitions in  two ways. First, we report the number of unique homes PI firms acquired during the period. Second, we identify 10 PI firms that owned the most  nursing homes as of December 2008. We contacted these top 10 firms\u2014 which represented almost 90 percent of all unique homes acquired by PI  firms during the 1998 through 2008 period\u2014both to confirm the numbers  of homes they currently owned and to understand the extent of their  involvement in the operations of these nursing homes. We confirmed the  number of nursing homes currently owned for 9 of the 10 firms,  representing about   78 percent of all unique nursing homes acquired by PI firms during the  period. We also analyzed information that 6 of these 9 PI firms provided, representing about 68 percent of unique nursing homes, on the extent of  their involvement in nursing home operations.", "To identify whether PI ownership of nursing homes is reflected in the  ownership information collected by CMS, we examined nursing home data  in CMS\u2019s Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS),  the national database of enrollment information submitted to CMS by  providers in the Medicare program. We obtained and analyzed extracts of   PECOS data as of August and September 2009, for 1,003 nursing homes in  six PI-owned chains, using identifying information provided by PI firms.  We also interviewed officials in CMS\u2019s Division of Provider and Supplier  Enrollment, responsible for PECOS, to learn what ownership information  is captured by PECOS, how CMS enforces ownership disclosure  requirements, and how CMS ensures the accuracy of the data. We  determined that, for our purposes of reviewing ownership information  collected by CMS, the PECOS data were sufficiently reliable.", "To determine how other HHS components use nursing home ownership  data and what data states collect to oversee providers, we interviewed the  following:    CMS\u2019s Survey and Certification Group, which is responsible for oversight  of state survey activities and enforcement of nursing home quality  standards;   officials from 4 of CMS\u2019s 10 regional offices, which assist the Survey and  Certification Group in its oversight of state survey activities, to understand  their use of and access to ownership data;   CMS components responsible for other CMS initiatives related to the  collection of data that could be used to identify nursing home chains;   six state survey agencies (California, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New  Jersey, and Texas) that collect nursing home ownership information when  they license nursing homes to operate in their jurisdictions; and    HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), which has the authority to exclude  nursing homes from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal  health care programs.", "We also reviewed CMS and other federal and state documents and relevant  federal regulations and statutes.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2008 through September  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Some providers contract with  separate entities to manage nursing homes. In addition, the provider may  or may not own the real estate where care is delivered and any associated  medical or other equipment. Nursing home real estate assets can be  separated from nursing home operations for a number of reasons,  including to limit liability or to obtain financing. The ownership and  control relationships among these various entities can be complex.

Restructuring of the nursing home industry following  bankruptcies among several large nursing home chains, as well as  increased liability litigation in states such as Florida and Texas, which  prompted some chains to sell their homes in these states, created an  opportunity for private investment firms to acquire nursing homes that  were being sold by these chains.

Consequently, information on the operations of PI firms\u2014 including a firm\u2019s acquisition and sale of companies\u2014is generally not as  readily available as that of publicly traded firms.

One investment strategy undertaken by  private equity firms is the \u201cleveraged buyout.\u201d In a typical leveraged  buyout, a private equity firm establishes a fund and obtains capital  commitments from investors. These investors often include public and  corporate pension plans, endowments and foundations, insurance  companies, and individuals.

After attempting to  improve the financial performance of the company (which can be over a   3- to 5-year period but may be longer), the fund sells the company; any  profits from the sale are returned to the fund and generally distributed to  fund investors and the private equity firm.

Because we had additional  information, we were able in some cases to recognize the varying levels of  ownership reported in the data, including entities that were holding  companies, private investment funds with no employees, or entities that  were investors in the private investment firm or an affiliate, relationships  that were not otherwise apparent from the data. For example, the  Washington State Investment Board, which invests state and local pension  funds, was listed among the owners for homes acquired by one PI firm,  and the California Public Employees Retirement System was listed among  the owners for nursing homes acquired by another PI firm. According to  the PI firms, these two entities are passive investors; that is, they do not  play a role in management of the nursing home chains.", "Fully capturing these complex relationships among nursing home owners  poses challenges for a data system such as PECOS. For example, in  documents one PI-owned nursing home chain submitted to a state agency,  the chain\u2019s delineation of its ownership structure took several pages to  describe and included a detailed chart of the ownership structure. CMS  officials said that providers can supply such organizational charts when  they submit Medicare enrollment information, but these documents are  maintained outside of PECOS by CMS contractors; currently, PECOS does  not have the capacity to store them.", "Some states that we interviewed that collect nursing home ownership  information for licensure purposes collect information to capture  relationships among owners. Officials at two states we interviewed  maintain databases that attempt to capture the hierarchy of the ownership  structure surrounding the nursing home. Missouri\u2019s ownership database,  for example, can be used to identify successive levels of ownership (see  fig. 4), which is not possible to discern with the data in PECOS.", "State officials also told us, however, that they are challenged by complex  ownership structures among nursing homes. State officials from Missouri,  Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, and California cited complex ownership  structures\u2014including multiple layers\u2014as obscuring ownership or making  oversight difficult. State officials also observed that nursing home chains  have set up separate limited liability companies as operators of each home  and they do not always obtain information that identifies the ultimate  parent owner. For example, Illinois officials noted that they do not  always obtain ownership information for the parent company, such as a  private equity firm, and sometimes their records only show the individual  limited liability company as the owner, such that a nursing home set up as  an individual limited liability company in one town would not be linked to  a home from the same chain set up as a limited liability company in  another town.", "Expanded reporting requirements contained in the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act and regulations to implement the act provide CMS  with an opportunity to address some of these issues. In particular, the act  requires homes to provide the identity of and information on \u201cadditional  disclosable parties\u201d and their relationship to the nursing home and one  another. In addition, the act requires that nursing homes report the  organizational structure of additional disclosable parties organized as  limited liability companies including, for example, their members, and  managers, and as applicable, their percentage ownership interest in the  company. While these expanded reporting requirements may provide more  insights into the relationships among some of the owners in PECOS, they  may not capture the hierarchy and relationships across all the numerous  owners currently being reported.", "PI ownership was often not readily apparent in PECOS. The  Medicare enrollment application does not ask for information on the  business type of organizational owners, including whether they are PI  firms, so it is not possible to use PECOS to identify all PI-owned nursing  homes. When we tried to identify the specific private investment firms we  were aware of in the ownership data in PECOS, we found that the entities  through which the PI firms acquired nursing homes were often listed. In  some cases, associating these entities with the PI firm was relatively  straightforward, as the entities had names that were readily identifiable  with the PI firms. For example, among the many owners listed for homes  in the HCR ManorCare chain, were the entities Carlyle Partners V MC, L.P.  and Carlyle MC Partners, L.P., two private investment funds managed by  The Carlyle Group, the PI acquirer of the chain.", "In contrast, PI ownership of other homes we examined was difficult to  identify in PECOS. In four of the PI-owned chains we examined, PI firms  or entities readily identifiable with the PI firms were not apparent among  the organizational owners reported for any of the nursing homes in the  chains or were listed for only a small fraction of the homes. The number of  homes in these four-PI owned chains for which PI ownership was not  readily apparent in PECOS accounted for 62 percent of the 1,003 nursing  homes we examined. We were not able to fully explain this situation. It is  possible that some PI firms, by virtue of how they structured their  transactions to acquire the homes, may not have been required to be  reported by the governing statute at the time. It is also possible that  entities were reported that we did not recognize were related to the PI  firm. On the other hand, PI firms may not have been reported, even if  required, for other reasons, for example, due to confusion about the  reporting requirements. Specifically, we found the following:    Representatives of one PI firm that was not listed in PECOS among the  owners for any of the homes in the chain it acquired said that a special  purpose entity (SPE) was created for the acquisition of the chain and was  reported as an owner on the Medicare enrollment application. The SPE,  which was not readily identifiable with the PI firm, was reported for only  about three-quarters of the chain\u2019s homes. The representatives said that  the PI firm itself did not own any interests in the SPE and so was not on  the application. Individuals associated with the PI firm were listed as  officers/directors for most of the homes in the chain.", "Another PI firm, which was also not reported as an owner for any of the  homes in the chain it acquired, did own the SPE used to acquire the chain,  according to officials of the nursing home chain. However, the officials  said that after closing on the acquisition, the title to each of the homes was  held by a subsidiary of the company that operates all the homes and  therefore the SPE neither holds title to nor operates the homes but rather  is an indirect owner. The SPE, which was not readily identifiable with the  PI firm, was listed among the organizational owners in PECOS for a small  portion of the homes. The statute currently requires the reporting of  persons and certain entities that have an ownership or control interest of  at least 5 percent, including indirect interests, in the assets of the provider  entity.", "A third PI firm sold the real estate for most of the homes in the chain to  another company shortly after the acquisition; the company then leased  the facilities back to an affiliate of the PI firm. The affiliate was listed as an  owner in PECOS for most of the homes in the chain; the PI firm was not.  The individuals involved in the PI firm\u2019s purchase of the nursing home  chain are also principals of the affiliate, some of whom were reported in  PECOS as individuals having an ownership interest for a portion of the  homes in the chain.", "Finally, for one PI firm, the company the PI firm formed to fund its  acquisition of the chain, which was readily identifiable with the firm,  appeared as an owner in PECOS but for less than 20 percent of the homes  in the chain. In this case, the chain\u2019s representatives said they had been  instructed by the CMS contractor to report only two levels of ownership  above the nursing home. As a result, the ownership information reported  by this chain was far from complete, and no common owner, including the  PI firm, was apparent for all of the homes. The representatives of the chain  said that they decided to submit complete ownership information for their  homes, on their own initiative, and were in the process of doing so,  working with a new CMS contractor.", "PECOS does not provide a clear picture of individuals in the  ownership structure. The information in PECOS on individuals with an  ownership or control interest in the provider is collected separately from  and is not linked to information about organizational owners and does not  provide a clear picture of where they fit in the ownership structure.  Specifically, the Medicare enrollment application asks for the names and  even the birth dates of individuals with an ownership or control interest\u2014 including those with 5 percent or more direct or indirect ownership in the  provider, with a partnership interest in the provider, or who are directors  or officers of the provider\u2014but it does not ask for the organization they  are affiliated with or their titles. As a result, it is not clear if individuals  reported as having a 5 percent or more ownership or control interest are  direct or indirect owners of the nursing home provider. In addition, CMS  has not required providers to report information about individuals who are  partners, officers, or directors of entities above the nursing home provider  level, such as members of the nursing home chain\u2019s board of directors,  which in some cases would include representatives of the PI firm.  Identification of these entities is important because they are ultimately  responsible for the management of the chain. Providers may be reporting  such individuals, but it was not possible for us to distinguish this in the  data because they are broadly categorized as officers or directors with no  information included on their affiliated organizations. This issue could be  addressed when HHS implements the reporting provisions of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "In contrast, two states we contacted\u2014Missouri and Texas\u2014collect more  comprehensive information about individuals with ownership or control  interests in the nursing home provider and in entities above the provider  level. These states also collect information on the specific positions of  reported individuals in these entities, such as president, secretary,  member, or general or limited partner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PECOS Data for a PI Firm That Acquired Real Estate Only Were Incomplete and PECOS Chain Ownership Information Was Not Collected in a Straightforward Manner", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the challenges in identifying PI owners in PECOS data, we  found that the data were sometimes incomplete and that the information  on chain ownership was not collected in a straightforward manner,  making chain associations difficult to identify.", "One PI firm that acquired real estate only was not reported. A PI  firm that leased nursing home real estate to a provider but that also had a  security interest in the assets of the provider was not reported in PECOS;  however, a security interest may constitute an ownership or control  interest for purposes of Section 1124 that could obligate disclosure as an  owner on the Medicare enrollment application. For example, we found  that one firm was not reported in PECOS among the owners of the nursing  homes within the chain for which it owned the real estate. However, a  lease agreement indicates that the PI firm also had a security interest in  the nursing home\u2019s assets that could obligate reporting of the entity as the  holder of an ownership or control interest. Officials with the PI firm told  us that they were not familiar with the application\u2019s reporting  requirements. CMS officials noted that it may not be clear to providers that  these entities must be reported, as the instructions on the application do  not specifically indicate that a security interest is a reportable interest, and  that going forward CMS may need to revise the application to make this  explicit. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires that  entities and individuals that lease or sublease real property to nursing  homes be reported, whether or not they have a security interest or other  reportable interests. Such information, however, will not be reported to  HHS until after it issues a final rule implementing the act\u2019s requirements,  which may not be for several years.", "Some states currently collect information on nursing home real estate  owners. For example, Illinois collects information on nursing home real  estate owners, if different from the operator, and requires the submission  of any lease agreements. Illinois officials told us that the state also  requires operators to report individuals who directly or indirectly own at  least 5 percent of the nursing home real estate and their percentage stake.  With this information the state can then identify at the state level if the  same individuals have ownership stakes in both the nursing home real  estate and the operating company. CMS also has acknowledged real estate  owners in issuing guidelines on its notification policy for poorly  performing nursing homes designated as Special Focus Facilities. The  guidelines direct notification to owners of the building and land if separate  from the holder of the provider agreement and described such owners as  an \u201caccountable party.\u201d", "PECOS chain information was not straightforward and sometimes  was incomplete. PECOS was established in part to make provider-chain  associations clear, but we found that making these associations in PECOS  was not straightforward because of the way the data were collected; in  addition, the chain data were sometimes incomplete. Rather than  requiring providers to report all of the homes that are part of the same  chain, CMS requires each home to report its chain home office. The chain  home office is the entity responsible for providing centralized  management and administrative services to providers under common  ownership and common control.", "When we reviewed the chain data in PECOS for the six PI-owned chains  for which we had information, we found that most, but not all, of the  homes belonging to the same chain could be identified through their chain  home office information, in particular by using the name of the chain  home office administrator. Not all homes within the same chain were  associated with the same chain home office. For example, most of the  homes in the Trilogy Health Services chain were divided among three  different chain home offices. The three groups of homes could not be  effectively linked by the chain home office name or address fields in  PECOS, but they did share the same chain home office administrator. CMS  officials told us that the one way they have to link homes reported under  different chain homes offices is if the homes have the same chain home  office administrator listed. However, in some cases, homes belonging to  the same PI-owned chain were reported under different chain home  offices with different chain home office administrators, which can make  linking all of the homes belonging to the same chain more challenging.  Table 3 shows chain information in PECOS for the six nursing home  chains we examined.", "In addition to the difficulty of using PECOS to identify all homes in a  chain, we found that one large PI-owned chain did not report chain home- office information for more than 200 homes. Officials from the nursing  home chain indicated that when the chain was acquired by the PI firm,  most of the nursing homes were set up under separate licensees and had  not yet been branded with the chain name, so the company made the  decision not to report these homes as part of a chain. The officials said  they have since reversed this decision and are in the process of updating  the chain information for these homes. They noted that prior to the  acquisition by the PI firm, they reported all the homes in the chain under  one chain home office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completeness and Accuracy of Provider Reported Ownership Data Is Difficult to Verify and CMS Contractor Performance May Contribute to Problems in PECOS Data", "paragraphs": ["Some of the problems we observed with the ownership and chain data in  PECOS are due in part to CMS\u2019s limited ability to recognize when the  information reported by providers is incomplete or inaccurate. CMS\u2019s  contractors have several responsibilities for verifying information reported  on the Medicare enrollment application. For example, contractors are  required to check that the reported legal business names and tax  identification numbers of providers and organizational owners match  those in Internal Revenue Service documentation. CMS contractors are  also responsible for following up with providers to resolve missing or  inconsistent information. For example, a CMS official explained that if  contractors independently came across ownership associations that  should be reported, the contractor should contact the provider. A CMS  official acknowledged, however, that the agency and its contractors may  not always be aware of missing or inconsistent information. For example,  the CMS official confirmed that the agency would not necessarily know if  a provider\u2019s chain affiliation was not reported. One CMS official  explained that the agency does not have the resources to delve into the  relationships of the entities reported to identify if there are any more  owners not being reported. The official explained that CMS relies on the  ownership information that is self-reported to CMS and that the agency is  not \u201clooking behind\u201d what is reported to verify that the ownership  information is complete.", "Contractor performance may also contribute to the completeness of the  data in PECOS. As noted earlier, representatives of one nursing home  chain told us that its CMS contractor instructed them to report only two  levels of ownership above the nursing home provider, resulting in several  entities going unreported as owners for many of the homes. In another  example involving the same contractor, chain information was not  reported for more than 200 homes. After some investigation, a CMS official  confirmed that, based on the information reported on the Medicare  enrollment application for these homes, the contractor should have  followed up with the provider about the lack of data reported. However,  the contractor\u2019s office responsible for processing this provider\u2019s  applications had since closed, and the current contractor was not able to  ascertain whether this follow up had occurred. Finally, in a third example,  when we noted that a specific organizational owner was not reported for  all homes in a chain, an official from the PI firm that acquired the chain  said this entity was reported on all the Medicare enrollment applications  submitted and suggested that the data may reflect the CMS contractor\u2019s  preference for what is entered into PECOS from the application.", "The performance of CMS contractors is overseen by project officers in the  agency\u2019s Center for Medicare Management, which developed a new on-site  audit program to review contractors\u2019 management of provider enrollment  functions. According to a CMS official, the on-site audits are designed to  pick up on instances in which contractors failed to follow up with  providers about missing information on the Medicare enrollment  application. The on-site audits, however, cover all provider types, not just  nursing homes; focus on the processing of the application as a whole, not  on particular sections of the application, such as the ownership sections;  and, according to a CMS official, do not attempt to verify the accuracy or  completeness of the ownership information reported on the application.  According to a CMS official, as of August 2009, the agency had conducted  two on-site audits under the new program. Beyond on-site audits CMS  does not conduct checks on the PECOS database for internal consistency,  such as whether nursing homes reported to be part of a chain in fact have  a common owner reported.

For example, officials in Maryland, Illinois, and New  Jersey cited cases where they used ownership information to contact the  owners, including landlords, to address patterns of poor care within a  home or across a chain. A Maryland official said that providing oversight  at the higher chain level is important because they have observed  instances of chain owners shifting staff from other nursing homes to the  home where the state identified problems, resulting in problems showing  up at the homes that lost staff resources.", "However, state agency officials in four states we interviewed told us that  they have difficulty obtaining information on chains that operate homes in  other states, even though many nursing home companies operate in  multiple states.

Although the utility to states and consumers of the ownership information  in PECOS in its present state is debatable because the information is  sometimes hard to decipher, the implementation of the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act provides CMS with an opportunity to collect  meaningful ownership information and to make it available in an  intelligible way."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making 11 recommendations to the Secretary of HHS and the  Administrator of CMS.", "As the Secretary of HHS develops regulations to implement the expanded  nursing home ownership reporting and disclosure requirements contained  in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we recommend that the  Secretary, given the complex arrangements under which nursing homes  can be acquired and operated, consider requiring the reporting of the  following five types of information:  the organizational structure and the relationships to the facility and to one  another of all persons or entities with direct or indirect ownership or  control interests in the provider (as defined in the act), such that the  hierarchy of all intermediate persons and entities from the provider level  up to the chain and the ultimate owner is described; for entities reported as having ownership or control interests, specify  whether or not the entities have an operational role; for example, special  purpose entities created solely for the purpose of acquiring the nursing  home but having no operational role should be identified as such; the percentage ownership interest in the provider for all entities and  individuals who have an ownership or control interest (as defined in the  act);  the names and titles of the members of the chains\u2019 governing body; and the organizational affiliation of individuals with an ownership or control  interest (as defined in the act).", "To ensure proper administration of current reporting requirements, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS issue guidance on the  circumstances under which the holder of a security interest in a provider  may be considered to have a reportable interest.", "To ensure that all providers that belong to the same nursing home chain  can be readily identified, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS  require each provider to report the identity of other nursing homes that  are part of the same chain.", "To improve the usability and accuracy of the ownership and control  information collected and stored in PECOS, we recommend that the  Administrator of CMS take the following three actions:    Expand the scope of CMS\u2019s existing workgroup intended to make PECOS  data available within the agency by developing a comprehensive strategy  for disseminating PECOS data to HHS, states, and the public; for example,  CMS could develop and make available standardized reports on  nationwide ownership data and could include ownership information on  its Nursing Home Compare Web site.", "Examine state systems to identify best practices for the collection and  public dissemination of nursing home ownership and chain information,  including ways in which states make the hierarchy among owners more  apparent.", "More closely monitor the activities of CMS contractors that review the  ownership and control information submitted by providers that participate  in Medicare and Medicaid to help ensure its accuracy and completeness.", "To help ensure that the requirements for the collection of ownership and  control information from nursing home providers that participate in  Medicare and Medicaid keep pace with evolving ownership structures, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS periodically review the  requirements related to reporting on the agency\u2019s provider enrollment  form to ensure that it promotes accurate and complete reporting of  nursing home ownership information consistent with the statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment and also invited the  nine PI firms that cooperated with our study to review the draft.

In addition, five of the nine PI  firms reviewed the draft and provided oral comments. Officials from some  of the firms noted that our report offered a fair and balanced depiction of  the subject matter, but some PI firm officials also expressed concerns  about how PI firms were portrayed. Two of the six state survey agencies  we interviewed provided technical comments on relevant excerpts of the  draft report, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "CMS concurred with all of our recommendations and said that it planned  to implement them in various ways, including through the development of  new regulations or revisions to the Medicare enrollment process.

Officials from one firm said the report described real- estate-only acquisitions well and officials from the other PI firm  considered the report to be a thorough and comprehensive treatment of  the subject matter. In general, PI firm officials commented on our  portrayal of the firms, the data in PECOS on the nursing homes they  owned, and expanded nursing home ownership reporting requirements in  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "Portrayal of PI firms. Officials from some PI firms expressed concerns  that our report implied that PI ownership of nursing homes was somehow  unique and therefore warranted special scrutiny. Officials from one firm  stated that there was little difference between nursing homes owned by PI  firms and those owned by public shareholders, beyond SEC reporting  requirements for the latter. For example, officials from one firm noted that  all homes, regardless of ownership, are subject to state licensure and  disclosure requirements and routine surveys to ensure compliance with  federal quality standards. Officials representing two firms also commented  that the use of complex ownership structures is not unique to companies  owned by PI firms. One official made the point that the nursing home\u2019s  ownership structure prior to its acquisition by a PI firm was in many ways  just as complex and not at all unusual for a public company. Other  officials noted that multiple layers of ownership exist across the corporate  world and are not particular to the nursing home industry or to health  care. Similarly, officials at one firm wanted us to note that PECOS  ownership data and chain affiliation are hard to decipher for all nursing  homes, not just those owned by PI firms. Because our study focused on  the ownership of nursing homes by PI firms and how PI nursing home  ownership was captured in PECOS, we did not examine how PECOS  captures the ownership of nursing homes by other entities. As a result, our  conclusions were limited to the complexity of PI ownership structures and  the limited ability of PECOS to help to clarify the relationships among the  entities and individuals reported as having an ownership or control  interest.", "PI firms\u2019 PECOS data. Officials representing two PI firms were  concerned that our report implied that the ownership information in  PECOS was not clear or was problematic because providers did not  submit necessary information to CMS. Officials at one firm also thought  the tone of the report suggested that PI firms were trying to hide  information and stressed that they had disclosed all required information  and were very forthcoming with information. Officials representing two PI  firms also said that there was no way for firms to see whether the  information they provided on the Medicare enrollment application was  correctly entered into PECOS. Nursing home providers now have the  option of using CMS\u2019s internet-based PECOS to submit, change, and view  their enrollment information online, but we did not review this system,  which was implemented for nursing homes in April 2009.", "Our finding that the ownership data in PECOS were hard to decipher  focused in large part on shortcomings in the collection of data for PECOS,  such as the lack of information on how entities and individuals with  reported ownership or control interests are related. We also found that in  one case complete ownership information was not reported for homes in  one PI-owned chain in part due to incorrect advice provided to a PI firm  by a CMS contractor. In another instance, PI ownership was not reported  because it may not have been clear that entities with a security interest  should be reported. Finally, chain home office information, which is  required to be reported was missing for most of the homes in the chain  acquired by one PI firm. An official with the nursing home chain said that  the company had separately provided information on the homes in the  chain it acquired to another office in CMS but that this information had not  been integrated into PECOS. The official commented in general about  problems with information being siloed at CMS in separate data systems.", "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Officials representing  two of the PI firms noted their support for the expanded ownership  reporting requirements included in the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act, but officials at these firms also expressed caution on which  entities or individuals should be subject to disclosure and how detailed  reportable ownership data should be. For example, officials with one firm  told us that decision makers, but not necessarily all owners or investors,  should be reportable, and in particular, they did not believe that owners  they considered passive investors, such as public pension funds, should be  reported. An official from this PI firm suggested that what should matter  from a policy perspective is the entity responsible for the care provided  (the nursing home company) and the entity that controls it (the private  investment firm). An official with another PI firm stressed the importance  of a reporting system that makes clear which entities control or play a role  in decision-making, and that even a system that displays a hierarchy and  ownership percentages may not adequately reflect this role. The official  stated that a designation such as managing partner denoted an entity with  decision-making responsibility. We recommended that HHS consider  requiring providers to identify whether reported ownership entities have  an actual operational role, which we believe would help address this issue.", "An official representing another PI firm expressed a different view and  said that CMS needs to capture more detailed ownership information  similar to what some states collect so that it has complete information on  all ownership layers. This comment is consistent with our  recommendation that CMS examine states systems to identify best  practices for the collection of nursing home ownership information.", "The PI firms also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

While leasing arrangements with nursing home  operators may have the potential to influence the operations of the homes,  firms that acquired a chain reported that they were more involved in  nursing home operations than firms that acquired real estate only. Table 4  summarizes PI firm responses on such issues as the time frames for  closing out their investments, or exit strategy, and being on the board of  directors of the nursing home chain.", "Investment Rationale. Four of the six PI firms (firms A, B, C, and D)  acquired nursing home chains, and officials at all four described increased  demand for long-term care due to an aging population as their attraction to  those investments. To help meet demographic demand, officials at firms A  and D said they sought high-quality chains that focused on providing post- acute care to high-acuity patients (those with clinically complex problems)  and indicated that these chains had top notch management already in  place. An official at firm C said the firm was attracted by the  improvements it could make to the nursing home chain.", "Officials at all four PI firms characterized their investments as \u201clong term,\u201d   but the number of years they planned to hold the investments differed.  Officials at firm A said they planned to hold their investment 3 to 9 years,  during which time the firm intended to expand the number of patients the  chain served to meet the long-term growth potential of the industry. An  official at firm C indicated that it was likely the firm would maintain its  investment in the chain for at least 20 years. Officials at firms B and D did  not specify a range or number of years.", "Structural Changes. Officials at firms A and C said they divided the  operations and the real estate into separate companies for tax or financing  purposes but kept those companies under common ownership. An official  at firm C explained that the creation of separate operating and real estate  companies was designed to attract investors who wanted exposure to only  one side of the nursing home company. In hindsight, however, the official  said that the separate entities created for the acquisition were not worth  the legal costs and reporting requirements and that the firm planned on  collapsing the operating and real estate companies to simplify the  organizational structure. Officials at firms B and D did not mention any  changes to the organizational structure of the chains they acquired.", "Officials at firms A and C explained the benefits from having operations  and real estate under the same chain ownership. An official at firm A  stated that it was unlikely that the real estate could be converted to  another use and that therefore it made sense for the nursing home  operator, who is licensed to run the home, to own the real estate. An  official noted that an operating company that does not own its real estate  is unable to use the property as collateral for a loan. Finally, officials at  this PI firm told us that the chain\u2019s common ownership structure should  reassure patients that the chain would take responsibility for any  problems that occur. An official at firm C said that the chain leases some  of its nursing homes from unaffiliated real estate owners but that it  planned to cease operations at those locations if it was unable to purchase  the real estate. Another firm official noted that tension over responsibility  for improvements can arise in any industry with unaffiliated operating and  real estate companies\u2014leaving the operator with less incentive to make  those improvements. One real-estate-only acquirer strongly disagreed with  this statement and noted that a landlord with a triple net lease has a great  incentive for ensuring the real estate is appropriately maintained. This firm  said such leases clearly state the responsibilities of the real estate owner  and the operator with respect to facility improvements and said that  disagreements have been few and limited.", "Involvement in Nursing Home Operations. Officials at all four PI firms  that acquired a chain said that they held seats on the chains\u2019 boards of  directors. In general, they characterized their involvement as related to the  strategic direction of the chain and indicated that they are not involved in  day-to-day operations. They noted that the updates they receive at board  meetings help to guide their decisions for the strategic direction of the  chain.", "Strategic direction. Officials at all four PI firms described the chain\u2019s  executive management as the ultimate decision maker for the chain, and  officials at firms A, B, and D indicated their involvement in nursing home  operations primarily ensured that the chain continued the objectives it  already had set for itself. Officials at firm A said they had helped the chain  implement an ongoing transformation from a focus on custodial care to  becoming primarily a provider of postacute care and rehabilitative  services to higher acuity patients. This official said that the board of  directors ensured that the staff at the facilities could meet this goal.  Although the nursing home chain already had this goal in place as a  publicly traded company, officials at the PI firm said that they helped to  achieve this goal by allowing the chain to make investments more quickly.  They also emphasized that the chain does not turn away residents to meet  its strategic objective.", "Management changes. Officials at firms A, B, and D said they kept the  same executive management after they acquired the chain because the  chain was already well managed. An official who worked at the chain prior  to firm A\u2019s acquisition told us that the firm helped hire more regional  office managers and more managers overall but also felt that minimal  organizational changes had occurred after acquisition by the PI firm. In  contrast, an official at firm C believed that the chain the firm acquired had  quality of care challenges and later hired a physician as chief executive  officer. An official at this firm indicated that the firm\u2019s goal was to help  transform the nursing home industry and, as a result, the firm recruited  managers that held the same values.", "Quality-of-care monitoring. Officials at two firms gave specific examples  of how they oversee quality of care. An official at firm C told us that the  firm helped its chain introduce best practices and standardized training to  nursing home staff. According to firm officials, the firm directed capital to,  among other things, hire directors of clinical education, train facility staff  to focus on the awareness of each patient\u2019s individual needs, and reduce  staff turnover. One senior official at this chain said that all the personnel,  from the caregivers to management, have gone through a significant  cultural change since the PI firm had acquired it. An official at the firm  said that if the firm had not purchased this particular chain, a different PI  firm would have taken over and he believes that the quality of care would  have suffered. However, an official of the firm emphasized that each  nursing home within the chain made more decisions about the care  provided inside the home than did the chain\u2019s board of directors.", "Officials at another firm explained that they receive reports on quality of  care\u2014including CMS\u2019s 5-star ratings\u2014to help guide management  decisions. The firm helped create an Independent Quality Committee to  provide the board with independent expert guidance on reading and  assessing quality of care data. After examining the data, the board  discusses how to address problems. An official with the chain said that it  can take underperforming homes and improve them by sharing resources  across the chain.", "Capital improvements. Officials at all four PI firms indicated that they  were directly involved in capital improvements or expansion plans for the  chains they acquired. Firm A said it helped the chain to undertake  investments that furthered the chain\u2019s long-term expansion strategy. This  chain has sought approval from state governments to build several new  facilities. Firm B said it mainly helps with decisions about the nursing  homes\u2019 capital structure and the capacity to fund the development of new  homes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PI Firms That Made Real- Estate-Only Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["Investment Rationale. Three of the six PI firms (firms D, E, and F) made  real-estate-only acquisitions. Officials of firms D and E described  increased demand in long-term care due to an aging population as a factor  that attracted them to those investments. For example, officials at firm D  said the business and organizational models they developed brought  needed investment into the nursing home industry after a decline in the  late 1990s. Similarly, officials at firm E said that no new nursing homes  had been built in recent years and that the demand for senior housing will  exceed the available supply. In contrast, an official of firm F described the  firm\u2019s investments in nursing home real estate as an opportunity to acquire  additional real estate; that is, they did not view their nursing home real  estate acquisitions any differently than their acquisitions of commercial or  residential real estate.", "These three firms had different exit strategies for their nursing home real  estate investments. Although officials at firm D described one of their  nursing home real estate investments as \u201clong term,\u201d they did not specify a  time frame. However, they have sold other nursing home real estate  investments in 1 to 5 years from the initial investment.  Officials at firm E  said they acquired nursing home real estate with the goal of selling the  investments at a profit 3 to 5 years later. After declining growth in real  estate value, the firm sold one portfolio of such investments about 2 years  after the initial acquisition and had planned on selling its other portfolios.", "In contrast, an official at firm F said the firm\u2019s acquisitions were a  mechanism to collect rent and they had no intention of selling.", "Involvement in Nursing Home Operations. The three PI firms that  made real-estate-only acquisitions had no representation on the boards of  the operating companies to which they leased real estate. Through their  lease arrangements with nursing home operators, however, they may have  the potential to influence the operations of the homes.", "Lease arrangements. All three PI firms lease the real estate to nursing  home operators under \u201ctriple net\u201d agreements. Officials at firm E told us  that triple net leases are the industry standard for nursing homes. Under  these agreements, in addition to rent, the operator agrees to pay all real  estate taxes, property insurance, and maintenance on the property  (including capital costs). These officials said that because the average age  of their facilities was 30 years, they required the operators to make an  annual per-bed deposit for maintenance. This deposit was refunded when  the nursing home operator submitted evidence (paid invoices) that it had  undertaken maintenance.", "Firms D and E had leases with the nursing home operators that calculated  a base rent plus rent as a percentage of the operator\u2019s adjusted net income  or excess cash flow\u2014ranging from 35 to 50 percent. Officials at firm E  said that they examined whether an operator could meet the terms of the  lease before they made an initial investment in the property. According to  officials at this PI firm, the major variable that influenced a nursing home  operator was not the operator\u2019s ability to pay debts and rent, but rather  the level of reimbursement received for resident care. However, officials at  a PI firm that purchased a nursing home chain told us that such leasing  arrangements can have negative consequences. They explained that the  real estate owner shares profits with minimal risk, but when revenues  decline, nursing home operators are more likely to cut staff to pay the base  rent and to maintain a level of profitability.", "Separation of real estate from operations. Officials at firms D and E told  us that the separation of real estate and operations under unaffiliated  companies benefited the operator by allowing greater access to capital for  the nursing home. Officials at firm D said that they purchased nursing  homes and separated the entities that owned the real estate from those  that operated the facilities. They said they created this structure to attract  financial lenders and investors back to the nursing home industry and  reduce the risk associated with the closure of facilities because of high  insurance premiums resulting from litigation. According to officials at this  firm, this structure still ensured that the legal process could reach an  accountable party to help address potential quality-of-care problems.", "Quality-of-care monitoring. While officials at all three firms reported that  they do not tell the nursing home operators to whom they lease how to run  their businesses, officials at firms D and E monitored the operators\u2019 quality  of care. Officials at both firms said that good quality of care resulted in  good financial outcomes. They indicated that they would consider  terminating a lease if poor or declining care persisted, but officials at  neither firm said they had encountered such a situation. Officials at firm D  said their involvement at the operating level is typically limited to  oversight of their tenants through an affiliated asset management  company. The asset managers are expected to monitor compliance with  the lease, perform financial reviews and analyses, conduct on-site  inspections of each facility\u2019s physical plant, and continuously review each  facility\u2019s clinical performance. Officials at firm E said that the terms of  their leases required nursing home operators to have plans of correction  that addressed quality-of-care problems. Officials at this firm told us that  they have clinical staff to help them interpret state survey reports of the  nursing homes to which they lease real estate. If clinical care declined  below a certain point at a home, the officials said that they would increase  their monitoring. While these officials said they would ask the home\u2019s  operator how it planned to address resident care problems, they  emphasized that they would not tell the operator what to do.", "In the more than 5 years they had owned nursing home real estate, an  official at firm F told us that the firm had not monitored the quality of care  provided by the operators to whom it leased facilities. However, the  official said the firm would like to start monitoring operations, because\u2014 unlike their other commercial investments\u2014they do not manage the  operations of their nursing homes. Should an operator lose its state license  to operate a nursing home, the official of the firm told us that their  investment would be at risk, because it can be difficult to identify a new  nursing home operator or to convert the property to another use. Although  the official at this firm said the firm would intervene before an operator  lost its license, the firm did not consider monitoring quality of care until  approached by an independent third party that said it could help interpret  operators\u2019 state survey results."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, Walter Ochinko, Assistant Director;  Jennie Apter; Ramsey Asaly; Joanne Jee; Dan Lee; Linda McIver; Luis  Serna; Amy Shefrin; and Jessica Smith made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Poorly Performing Nursing Homes: Special Focus Facilities Are Often  Improving, but CMS\u2019s Program Could Be Strengthened.
