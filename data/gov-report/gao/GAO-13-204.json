Some states have implemented electronic tracking systems that can be used to track PSE sales and determine if individuals comply with legal PSE purchase limits. Two states, along with select localities in another state, have made products containing PSE available to consumers by prescription only. GAO was asked to review issues related to meth. Thus, GAO examined, among other things, (1) the trends in domestic meth lab incidents over the last decade; (2) the impact of electronic tracking systems on meth lab incidents and limitations of this approach, if any; and (3) the impact of prescription-only laws on meth lab incidents and any implications of adopting this approach for consumers and the health care system. GAO analyzed data such as data on meth lab incidents and PSE product sales and prescriptions. GAO also reviewed studies and drug threat assessments and interviewed state and local officials from six states that had implemented these approaches. These states were selected on the basis of the type of approach chosen, length of time the approach had been in use, and the number of meth lab incidents. The observations from these states are not generalizable, but provided insights on how the approaches worked in practice."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Methamphetamine (meth) lab incidents--seizures of labs, dumpsites, chemicals, and glassware--declined following state and federal sales restrictions on pseudoephedrine (PSE), an ingredient commonly found in over-the-counter cold and allergy medications, but they rose again after changes to methods in acquiring PSE and in the methods to produce meth. According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) data, the number of lab incidents nationwide declined through 2007 after the implementation of state and federal regulations on PSE product sales, which started in 2004. The number of meth lab incidents reported nationally increased after 2007, a trend primarily attributed to (1) the emergence of a new technique for smaller-scale production and (2) a new method called smurfing--a technique used to obtain large quantities of PSE by recruiting groups of individuals to purchase the legally allowable amount of PSE products at multiple stores that are then aggregated for meth production.", "Electronic tracking systems help enforce PSE sales limits, but they have not reduced meth lab incidents and have limitations related to smurfing. By electronically automating and linking log-book information on PSE sales, these systems can block individuals from purchasing more than allowed by law. In addition, electronic tracking systems can help law enforcement investigate potential PSE diversion, find meth labs, and prosecute individuals. However, meth cooks have been able to limit the effectiveness of such systems as a means to reduce diversion through the practice of smurfing.", "The prescription-only approach for PSE appears to have contributed to reductions in lab incidents with unclear impacts on consumers and limited impacts on the health care system. The implementation of prescription-only laws by Oregon and Mississippi was followed by declines in lab incidents. Law enforcement officials in Oregon and Mississippi attribute this reduction in large part to the prescription-only approach. Prescription-only status appears to have reduced overall demand for PSE products, but overall welfare impacts on consumers are unclear because of the lack of data, such as the cost of obtaining prescriptions. On the basis of the limited information available from health care providers in Oregon and Mississippi, there has not been a substantial increase in workload demands to provide and dispense prescriptions for PSE products."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Methamphetamine (meth) is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant drug  that has limited medical uses. Today, meth can be made by anyone  using easily obtainable household goods and consumer products.  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Office  of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), illicit meth used in the United  States today is manufactured by Mexican drug-trafficking organizations in  \u201csuper labs\u201d located in Mexico and California, as well as by cooks in  \u201csmall toxic labs\u201d predominately located in the central United States, from  the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes and from the plains to the  Appalachian Mountains. These labs pose significant public safety and  health risks and financial burdens to local communities and states where  they are found. The toxic chemicals and solvents involved in meth  manufacturing can result in fiery explosions and expose property and  people, including children, to contaminates that are dangerous and costly  to remove.", "In the wake of an increased law enforcement focus on illicit meth labs in  the 1980s, meth manufacturing methods changed. Meth cooks  discovered new, easier ways to make more potent meth that required the  use of precursor chemicals such as pseudoephedrine (PSE), a nasal  decongestant commonly found in over-the-counter (OTC) cold and allergy  medications. PSE is the primary essential ingredient used to make meth  in the United States today. Initial federal efforts to address a growing  meth problem primarily focused on increased meth-trafficking penalties  and regulating the bulk importation, exportation, and distribution of meth  precursor chemicals such as PSE. However, by 2004, the annual number  of meth lab incidents reported by law enforcement had reached an all- time high of over 24,000. In response, many states began taking steps to  further regulate PSE at the point of sale, such as requiring customers to  present photo identification (ID) when purchasing PSE products and  pharmacists to keep PSE products behind the counter and maintain a log  of all sales. In 2006, the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005  (CMEA) was passed to, among other things, regulate the retail sale of  OTC PSE products by setting daily and monthly sales limits for customer  purchases and requiring sellers to keep these products behind the  counter and maintain a written or electronic sales logbook.", "Recognizing the serious public safety and health risks and financial  burdens of these labs, state and local governments and Congress have  since taken or considered taking further action to help prevent PSE  diversion to make illicit meth. For example, some states have  implemented electronic tracking systems that can be used to track PSE  sales and determine if individuals comply with legal PSE purchase limits.  Two states, along with select localities in another state, have made  products containing PSE available to consumers by prescription only. In addition, since 2010, at least 69 bills have been introduced in 18 states  that would require consumers to obtain a prescription to purchase PSE  products. In this context, you requested that we provide information on  domestic meth lab incident trends and the impacts these two approaches  have had on the domestic meth lab problem. Accordingly, this report  addresses  the trends in domestic meth lab incidents over the last decade and the  impact of domestic meth labs on the communities affected by them; the impact of electronic tracking systems on domestic meth lab  incidents and the limitations, if any, of using these systems; and  the impact of prescription-only laws on domestic meth lab incidents  and any implications of this approach for consumers and the health  care system.", "To identify trends in domestic meth lab incidents over the last decade, we  analyzed data for all states from DEA\u2019s National Seizure System on lab  seizure incidents that occurred during the last 10 complete calendar  years, 2002 through 2011. Using these data, we analyzed the number of  incidents nationally, by region, and by type of lab and lab capacity. To  assess the reliability of these data, we discussed the data with agency  officials and compared them with other data and documentation, where  available, from states we selected as case studies for this review. We  selected this non-probability sample of states to reflect a mix of  characteristics, such as the type of approach chosen for controlling the  sale of PSE products (electronic tracking or prescription-only), length of  time the approach has been in use, and the number of meth labs seized  relative to the state\u2019s population size. We worked with DEA to resolve  any data discrepancies and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We also interviewed federal  officials, as well as state and local officials in the 6 case study states  about meth lab trends. While we cannot generalize any findings or results  to the national level from this sample, this information provided  perspectives on the factors affecting meth lab trends. We also reviewed  drug threat assessments and reports by the National Drug Intelligence  Center (NDIC) and information from DEA and ONDCP officials.

We also obtained and reviewed data provided by the Mississippi  Board of Pharmacy\u2019s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) to  assess the impact on consumers. We also reviewed a report prepared for  the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA) and interviewed  the state boards of pharmacy and state associations representing  pharmacists in Mississippi and Oregon and the National Consumers  League and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. We  selected these organizations because they have previously surveyed  consumers about access to PSE products.

Mixing chemicals in meth labs creates substantial risks of  explosions, fires, chemical burns, and toxic fume inhalation. These burns  and related injuries resulting from these events can be more serious than  burns and injuries sustained through non-meth-lab-related causes. For  example, a 2008 study conducted of meth and non-meth burn patients  that received treatment in one hospital burn unit in Kalamazoo, Michigan,  from 2001 through 2005, found that meth lab patients tended to have  more frequent inhalation injuries, needed greater initial fluid resuscitation  volume, required intubation more frequently, and were more likely to have   The small size of the relatively  complications than non-meth patients.new One Pot or Shake and Bake method can be even more dangerous  than larger meth labs, as drugmakers typically hold the One Pot container  up close, increasing the risk for severe burns from the waist to the face.  According to the director of the Vanderbilt University Regional Burn  Center in Tennessee, meth lab injuries can also be more severe than  burns resulting from just fires alone because patients often suffer thermal  burns from the explosion, as well as chemical burns from exposure to  caustic chemicals. He also noted that meth lab burn patients tend to be  more difficult to treat because their addiction and overall poor physical  health make it difficult for them to facilitate their own recovery as well as  the fact that most attempt to hide the cause of their injury, which can  hinder the administration of proper care.", "The treatment for meth lab-related burns and injuries can be very  expensive.

Parents and caregivers who are meth  dependent can become careless and often lose their capacity to take care  of their children such as ensuring their children\u2019s safety and providing  essential food, dental and medical care, and appropriate sleeping  conditions. Children living in households where meth labs are operated  are also at increased risk for being physically and sexually abused by  members of their own family or other individuals at the site.", "To protect the children discovered at meth lab sites from further harm and  neglect, social service agencies remove the children from their homes  and place them in foster care. Foster care is a social welfare service that  serves the needs of abused and neglected children. Child welfare  workers can remove a child if it is determined that remaining with the  parents will jeopardize a child\u2019s welfare. Children are placed either with a  surrogate foster family or in a residential treatment facility called a group  home with the intent to provide temporary housing in a safe and stable  environment until reunification with the child\u2019s birth parents or legal  guardians is possible. Reunification happens once the state is convinced  that the harmful factors that triggered removal no longer exist. Several  states and jurisdictions have created special protocols and programs to  address the needs of children exposed to clandestine meth labs. These  protocols and programs typically involve medical screening of the children  for toxicity and malnourishment, emergency and long-term foster care,  and psychological treatment. Social service agencies may also seek to  enroll meth-involved parents and their children in a family-based  treatment program, where both the parents and children receive services.  Family-based treatment programs offer treatment for adults with  substance use disorders and support services for their dependent  children in a supervised, safe environment that allows the family to  remain together and prevents exposure to further harm. The costs to  state department of human service agencies to provide services to these  children can be significant depending on the number, age, and specific  needs of the child. For example, from January 2006, through December  2011, the Missouri Department of Social Services substantiated 702  reports of children exposed to meth labs, involving a total of 1,279  children. Of those 1,279 children, 653 required placement in departmental  custody. The total cost of providing custodial care to children exposed to  meth labs in Missouri since August 2005, was approximately $3.4 million  according to the department. In one Missouri county, so many children  were being removed from meth lab homes and placed in state custody  that there are now no longer any foster families available to care for  them. Similarly, according to the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s  Services, 1,625 children were removed from meth lab homes from  January 2007 through December 2011 and placed in foster care at a cost  of approximately $70.1 million.", "The raw materials and waste of the meth labs pose environmental  dangers because they are often disposed of indiscriminately by lab  operators to avoid detection, and can also cause residual contamination  of exposed surfaces of buildings and vehicles where the meth was being  made. According to DEA, for every pound of meth produced, 5 to 6  pounds of toxic waste are produced. Common practices by meth lab  operators include dumping this waste into bathtubs, sinks, or toilets, or  outside on surrounding grounds or along roads and creeks. Some may  place the waste in household or commercial trash or store it on the  property. In addition to dumped waste, toxic vapors from the chemicals  used and the meth-making process can permeate walls and ceilings of a  home or building or the interior of a vehicle, potentially exposing  unsuspecting occupants. As a result, the labs potentially end up  contaminating the interiors of dwellings and vehicles as well as water  sources and soil around the lab site for years if not treated.", "Because of the dangerous chemicals used in making meth, cleaning up  clandestine methamphetamine labs is a complex and costly undertaking.  According to regulations promulgated for the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act by the Environmental Protection Agency, the generator of  hazardous waste is the person who produced or first caused the waste to  be subject to regulation. The act of seizing a meth lab causes any  chemicals to be subject to regulation and thus makes law enforcement  the \u201cgenerator\u201d of the waste when seizing a lab. Accordingly, seizing a lab  makes a law enforcement agency responsible for cleaning up the  hazardous materials and the costs associated with the cleanup. The  materials seized at a clandestine drug laboratory site become waste  when law enforcement officials make the determination of what to keep  as evidence. Those items not required as evidence are considered  hazardous waste and must be disposed of safely and appropriately. The  task of removal and disposal of the hazardous waste is usually left to  contractors who have specialized training and equipment to remove the  waste from the lab site and transport it to an EPA-regulated disposal  facility. Depending on the size of the lab, the cost for such a service to  respond to an average lab incident can range from $2,500 to $10,000, or  up to as much as $150,000 to clean up super labs, according to DOJ.", "To help state and local agencies with the expense of lab cleanup, DEA  established a lab cleanup program where DEA contracts with vendors  and pays them to conduct the cleanup on behalf of the law enforcement  agency seizing the lab. In fiscal year 1998, DEA began funding  cleanups of clandestine drug labs that were seized by state and local law  enforcement agencies, focusing on the removal and disposal of the  chemicals, contaminated apparatus, and other equipment. State and  local law enforcement agencies seeking to utilize this service contact the  DEA to coordinate the cleanup effort. According to DEA program officials,  DEA has spent over $142 million on these cleanups nationwide since  calendar year 2002. See figure 6.", "Given that labs can be placed in a wide range of locations, such as  apartments, motel rooms, homes, or even cars, there is also the potential  need for further remediation of these areas beyond the initial cleanup of  hazardous waste if they are to be safely used or occupied again.  Whereas cleanup involves the removal of large-scale contaminants, such  as equipment and large quantities of chemicals for the purpose of  securing evidence for criminal investigations and reducing imminent  hazards such as explosions or fires, remediation involves removing  residual contaminants in carpeting or walls, for example, to eliminate the  long-term hazards posed by residual chemicals. Procedures for  remediation of a property or structure usually involve activities such as  the removal of contaminated items that cannot be cleaned, such as  carpeting, and wallboard; ventilation; chemical neutralization of residues;  washing with appropriate cleaning agents; and encapsulation or sealing  of contaminants, among other activities. Depending on the extent of the  contamination, the cost to remediate a property can be substantial.Extremely contaminated structures may require demolition. However,  unlike the funding that is available for initial lab cleanup from DEA, there  are no federal funds available for remediation, leaving the owner of a  contaminated property responsible for the costs of any remediation to be  done.", "Because of their toxic nature, meth labs pose a serious physical danger  to law enforcement officers who come across or respond to them, and  therefore must be handled using special protective equipment and  training that are costly to law enforcement agencies. The process of  cooking meth, which can result in eye and respiratory irritations,  explosions and fires, toxic waste products, and contaminated  surroundings, can be dangerous not only to the meth cook but also to  persons who respond to or come across a lab, such as law enforcement  officers. Because of the physical dangers posed by the labs, the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established  requirements for persons, including law enforcement, entering a  clandestine lab. on hazardous waste operations, annual physical exams to monitor the  ongoing medical condition of individuals involved in handling meth lab  sites, and guidelines for protective equipment to be used when working in  a lab. Consequently, whether the lab is raided by investigators or  encountered by accident during the course of an investigation, first  responders and police agencies are required to provide their personnel  specialized training and equipment, such as hermetically sealed hazmat  suits, to safely process a lab. suited up outside the lab as a backup team in case something happens  with the lab and they need to respond, and at least one other officer on- site to provide security while the lab is being processed for evidence and  cleanup. According to one estimate provided by a law enforcement  agency in Indiana, the cost to the agency of the officers\u2019 time as well as  the protective equipment and processing supplies required to respond to  a lab can exceed $2,000 per lab. Given these costs, law enforcement  officials from all case study states agreed that responding to meth labs  can be a significant financial burden on their agencies. For example, in  fiscal year 2010, the Tennessee Meth Task Force spent $3.1 million  providing equipment and training to law enforcement personnel and  responding to meth lab incidents. Further, unlike large multinational drug- trafficking organizations, meth lab operators are usually lower income and  producing meth for personal use; thus operators usually have little in the  way of valuable assets or cash that law enforcement agencies can seize  as a way of recouping the lab seizure response costs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Electronic Tracking Systems Help Enforce PSE Sales Limits but Have Not Reduced Domestic Meth Lab Incidents", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tracking Systems Can Help Enforce Individual Sales Limits, Identify Potential Diversion, and Prosecute Meth Crimes", "paragraphs": ["Electronic tracking systems can help prevent individuals from purchasing  more PSE product than allowed by law.

By spreading out PSE sales among individuals, smurfing  circumvents the preventive blocking of stop sale tracking systems.", "Meth lab incidents in states that have implemented electronic tracking  systems have not declined, in part because of smurfing. For example,  meth lab incidents in the three states\u2014Oklahoma, Kentucky, and  Tennessee\u2014that have been using electronic tracking systems for the  longest period of time are at their highest levels since the implementation  of state and federal PSE sales restrictions. While these states  experienced initial declines in meth lab incidents immediately following  the state and federal PSE sales restrictions put in place from 2004  through 2006, lab incidents have continued to rise since 2007, likely in  part because of the emergence of smurfing and the use of the One Pot  method for production (see table 2).", "Law enforcement officials from every region of the country report that the  PSE used for meth production in their areas can be sourced to local and  regional smurfing operations.

All of the IDs  had been used to purchase the maximum amount of PSE allowed, with  only one transaction (2.4 grams of PSE) blocked by the electronic  tracking system. Law enforcement officials from the four electronic  tracking case study states emphasized that investigating smurfing rings  can be very time and resource intensive because of the large number of  persons involved and the potential use of fraudulent identifications.

In the case  of Oregon, the number of reported meth lab incidents had already  declined by nearly 63 percent by 2005 from their 2004 peak of over 600  labs. After the movement of PSE products to behind-the-counter status in  Oregon in 2005 and implementation of the CMEA and state-imposed  prescription-only approach in 2006, the number of reported meth lab  incidents in Oregon continued to decline in subsequent years. In  Mississippi, after the adoption of the prescription-only approach in 2010,  the number of reported meth lab incidents subsequently declined from  their peak by 66 percent to approximately 321 labs in 2011. See fig.7  below.", "The communities in Missouri that have adopted local prescription-only  requirements also experienced a decline in the number of meth labs. For  example, while lab incidents statewide in Missouri increased nearly 7  percent from 2010 to 2011, the area in southeastern Missouri where most  of the communities have adopted prescription-only ordinances saw lab  incidents decrease by nearly half.", "Even as declines were observed in Oregon and Mississippi after  implementing the prescription-only approach, declines were also  observed in neighboring states that did not implement the approach,  possibly because of other regional or reporting factors. For example, all  states bordering Oregon also experienced significant declines in meth  labs from 2005 through 2011, ranging from a 76 percent decline for  California to a 94 percent decline for Washington state. In Mississippi\u2019s  case, except for Tennessee, all bordering states also experienced  declines in lab incidents from 2009 through 2011, ranging from a 54  percent decrease in Arkansas to a decline of 57 percent in Louisiana.  Consequently, there may be some other factors that contributed to the lab  incident declines across all these states regardless of the approach  chosen. One potential factor for the declines observed from 2010 through  2011 is the exhaustion of DEA funds to clean up labs. According to DEA  officials, as the funds provide an incentive to state and local agencies to  report meth lab incidents to DEA, the lack of funds from February 2011 to  October 2011 may have resulted in fewer lab incidents being reported  during this time period. Other potential factors within the states may have  also contributed to declines in the number of lab incidents in neighboring  states. For example, Arkansas law enforcement officials reported that in  2011, a change in state law took effect that made it illegal to dispense  PSE products without a prescription, unless the person purchasing the  product provided a driver\u2019s license or identification card issued by the  state of Arkansas, or an identification card issued by the United States  Department of Defense to active military personnel. In addition,  Arkansas law requires that a pharmacist make a professional  determination as to whether or not there is a legitimate medical and  pharmaceutical need before dispensing a nonexempt PSE product  without a valid prescription. As a result of these additional requirements,  retailers such as Walmart decided to no longer sell PSE products OTC in  Arkansas and instead require a prescription.", "According to state and local law enforcement officials in Oregon and  Mississippi, the prescription-only approach contributed to the reduction of  reported meth lab incidents within those states. For example, according to  the executive director of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and the  directors of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and the Gulf Coast  HIDTA, the decline in meth lab incidents in their states can be largely  attributed to the implementation of the prescription-only approach.  Although their perspectives cannot be generalized across the broader  population of local law enforcement agencies, law enforcement officials of  other agencies we met with in Oregon and Mississippi also credited the  reduction in meth lab incidents to the implementation of the prescription- only approach.", "To determine the extent to which the declines in lab incidents in Oregon  were due to the prescription-only approach rather than other variables  such as regional or reporting factors, we conducted statistical modeling  analysis of lab incident data, the results of which indicate a strong  association between the prescription-only approach and a decline in meth  lab incidents. Specifically, our analysis showed a statistically significant  associated decrease in the number of lab incidents in Oregon following  introduction of the law, with the lab incident rate falling by over 90 percent  after adjusting for other factors.", "With the decline in meth lab incidents, officials in the prescription-only  states reported observing related declines in the demand and utilization  for law enforcement, child welfare, and environmental cleanup services  that are needed to respond to meth labs:", "Law enforcement: Local law enforcement officials in Oregon and  Mississippi reported that the reduction in meth lab incidents has  reduced the resource and workload demands for their departments to  respond to and investigate meth labs. For example, one chief of a  municipal police department in Oregon reported that the decline in  meth labs has resulted in reduced costs to his department largely in  the form of reduced manpower, training, and equipment expenses  and noted that lab seizures are now so rare that his department no  longer maintains a specialized team of responders to meth labs.  Another chief of a municipal police department in Mississippi noted  that since the adoption of the prescription-only approach, the amount  of time and resources spent on meth-related investigations has  declined by at least 10 percent.", "Child welfare: Officials in both Oregon and Mississippi reported a  reduction in the demand for child welfare services to assist children  found in households where meth lab incidents occurred. For example,  according to a coordinator in Oregon\u2019s Department of Human  Services, the state has not removed a child from a household with an  active lab since 2007. In Mississippi, the Methamphetamine Field  Coordinator with the state Bureau of Narcotics, which tracks the  number of drug-endangered children for the state, reported that the  number of such children declined by 81 percent in the first year that  the prescription-only approach was in effect.", "Environmental cleanup: According to data from DEA and the Oregon  Department of Environmental Quality, declines in costs to clean up  labs in Oregon occurred prior to the implementation of the  prescription-only approach, falling from almost $980,000 in 2002 to  about $580,000 in 2005. However, since 2006, costs for lab cleanup  continued to fall and were about $43,000 in 2011. Funding for  cleanups in Mississippi showed more variation and fluctuation from  year to year; however, between 2010, when the prescription-only  approach was implemented, and 2011, cleanup costs dropped by  more than half (from over $1 million to less than $400,000).", "However, even as the prescription-only approach appears to have  contributed to reducing the number of lab incidents in Oregon, the  availability and trafficking of meth is still widespread and a serious threat  in the state. According to a threat assessment by the Oregon HIDTA,  while the number of reported meth lab incidents has declined, crystal  meth continues to be highly available in the area as Mexican drug  traffickers import the finished product from laboratories outside the state  and from Mexico.", "Moreover, while the prescription-only approach appears to have  contributed to a reduction in the number of meth labs in the states that  have adopted it, the experience of these states to date has shown that  the prescription-only approach does not preclude individuals from  traveling to neighboring states to purchase PSE products for use in meth  labs. Consequently, even as the number of meth lab incidents has  declined in prescription-only states, law enforcement reports that many  lab incidents that still occur in these states are largely due to PSE product  obtained from states without a prescription requirement for PSE. For  example, according to a threat assessment by NDIC, law enforcement  officers interviewed in 2011 reported that the more stringent restrictions  on pseudoephedrine sales in Mississippi have led many pseudoephedrine  smurfing groups to target pharmacies in the neighboring states of  Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee in order to continue operations.  Officials of a sheriff\u2019s office in a county located along the Gulf Coast in  Mississippi stated that the department\u2019s investigations have found that  large numbers of individuals from Mississippi travel out of state to  purchase PSE in an effort to circumvent the Mississippi prescription-only  law. While some out-of-state purchases may be for licit uses, the officials  stated that they believed a substantial proportion of the PSE brought back  from other states was likely being diverted for the production of meth.  According to law enforcement officials in Oregon, most of the incidents  reported there in recent years involved either dumpsites or inactive  \u201cboxed labs\u201d that had been used in previous years but have been  dismantled and stored away for potential future use. According to the  legal counsel for the Oregon Narcotics Enforcement Association, the  association asked law enforcement to determine the source of PSE for  lab incidents, in cases where that could be determined. In every case  where a determination could be made, it was reported that the PSE was  obtained from neighboring states, mostly Washington, but also Idaho,  California, and Nevada.", "According to PSE purchase activity data from the NPLEx electronic  tracking system and the vendor that provides its software platform,  individuals using Oregon identifications have purchased PSE products in  neighboring states. These data indicate that from October 15, 2011,  through August 31, 2012, over 30,000 purchases were made by  individuals using Oregon identifications. Similarly for Mississippi, reports  by law enforcement of individuals traveling to neighboring non- prescription-only states to purchase PSE products is supported by PSE  purchase activity data provided by the NPLEx electronic tracking  system.

Similar to techniques used to divert other controlled  prescription drugs such as pain relievers, diversion of prescribed PSE can  occur through prescription forgery, illegal or improper prescribing by a  physician, or \u201cdoctor shopping,\u201d where an individual goes to several  doctors to obtain a prescription from each doctor. Although these may  provide potential sources of PSE for use in meth labs in prescription-only  states, law enforcement officials in Oregon and Mississippi reported no  known instances from their meth lab investigations of finding that a PSE  product was obtained through one of those methods in order to make  meth. Law enforcement officials in Missouri localities where the  prescription-only requirement has been adopted reported a few instances  of PSE obtained with a prescription being used to make meth. According  to investigators from a regional drug task force in a county in Missouri,  they have found PSE obtained by prescription in at least three meth lab  incidents. Since the county has adopted the prescription-only approach,  they are observing more instances in which prescriptions of PSE are  found at lab incidents. However, they did not find any evidence in these  cases that the PSE had been prescribed illegally or obtained through  prescription forgery or doctor shopping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prescription-Only Status for PSE Appears to Have Reduced Sales of PSE Products, but the Full Impact on Consumers Is Not Known", "paragraphs": ["Judging from the experience of Mississippi, the volume of PSE products  obtained by consumers after the adoption of the approach declined from  levels that existed when PSE was available OTC. Data on Mississippi  OTC PSE product sales and the number of prescriptions for PSE filled  suggest that use of PSE products could have fallen by several hundred  thousand units after the implementation of the prescription-only approach.  For example, annual unit sales of PSE dropped from almost 749,000 in  2009 before the prescription-only approach went into effect, to  approximately 480,000 total units of PSE product sold OTC or prescribed  in 2010, when the approach was in effect for half the year, to  approximately 191,000 units prescribed or sold during 2011, when the  approach had been in place for the full year (see table 3). Data are not  available for Oregon on the sales of PSE products immediately before  and after the implementation of the prescription-only approach to do a  comparable analysis.", "Given the more restrictive access to PSE products consumers would face  under the prescription-only approach, it is expected that consumers will  be impacted. The extent of this impact depends on a number of variables  such as the potential change in the effective price of PSE that the  requirements of the prescription-only approach result in and the  availability of effective substitutes or alternative remedies for PSE, for  example. Under the prescription-only approach, the effective price of  PSE, which includes costs associated with obtaining a prescription, such  as the costs of time and travel to the physician for an appointment as well  as any associated copays or out-of-pocket charges for the appointment  itself, would increase if an in-person visit were necessary, having a  negative impact on consumers. If the PSE prescriptions are being  obtained by consumers at a higher effective price because of these  factors, consumers can be expected to be negatively impacted to some  extent by the prescription-only approach. At the same time, some of these  costs, such as the costs of time and travel to go to an in-person  appointment can be mitigated to the extent patients can obtain a  prescription for PSE through a telephone consultation with their  physicians. While it is likely that the effective price for PSE products is  higher under the prescription-only approach, data on the cost to  consumers for obtaining these prescriptions are not available to make this  comparison. Further complicating the determination of the change in the  effective price of PSE is the fact that the actual costs to a given consumer  for that person\u2019s time, travel, and insurance coverage can vary from  consumer to consumer depending on the person\u2019s individual  circumstances. For example, given their lack of insurance, uninsured  consumers or patients will likely face higher effective costs to obtain PSE  products under a prescription-only approach than those with insurance.  Because of the uncertainty involving these variables and factors, it is not  possible to determine the magnitude of the change in effective price of  PSE for consumers.", "Despite the likely increase in the effective price of PSE because of the  prescription-only approach, according to state agencies and consumer  groups, consumers in Oregon and Mississippi have made few complaints  about the approach since its implementation, although research or  surveys on the issue have not been conducted. For example, according  to the executive director of the Oregon Board of Pharmacy, the state  agency that adopted the rule making PSE a controlled substance, the  board initially received a small number of complaints from consumers  when PSE was initially scheduled, but after a number of months, the  board stopped hearing about it. Officials at the Mississippi Board of  Pharmacy also noted that they have not received any complaints from  consumers about the prescription requirement since it went into effect.  According to consumer and patient advocacy organizations such as the  National Consumers League and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of  America, which conducted surveys of consumers regarding access to  PSE products in 2005 and 2010 respectively, neither organization has  received feedback or complaints from consumers or patients from either  state about the diminished access imposed on PSE products by the  prescription-only approach. Both organizations also noted that they have  not conducted any additional research or surveys on the issue since their  earlier surveys in 2005 and 2010.", "Another variable that determines the impact of the prescription-only  approach on consumers is the availability of substitutes for PSE that  consumers can use as alternatives to offset any potential increase in the  effective price to consumers for obtaining PSE by prescription. To ensure  that consumers still have access to an unrestricted oral OTC  decongestant, manufacturers of cold and allergy medicines reformulated  many products by substituting the ingredient phenylephrine (PE), an  alternative oral decongestant also approved by FDA for use in OTC  medicines that cannot be used to make methamphetamine. However,  according to sales data on PE products in Mississippi for the periods  before and after implementation of the prescription-only approach, the  changes in sales volume for PE products do not appear to show any  direct substitution of PE for PSE by consumers. In fact, the change in  volume in PE products shows a decrease for the 52-week period ending  in December 2011 (see table 4).", "The lack of a consumer shift from PSE products to PE products could be  the result of several potential factors, but data are limited or unavailable  to ascertain their impact. For example, it could reflect, on average,  consumer perception that PE is not an effective substitute for PSE.  Similarly, it could also be an indication that consumers are choosing to  forgo medicating their conditions or are using other medications or  remedies to relieve their symptoms. Another potential factor that could  contribute to this lack of a consumer shift to PE from PSE is the extent to  which PSE sales were being diverted for meth use. Although available  estimates of the extent to which PSE sales are being diverted vary  greatly, the drop in PSE sales without a corresponding increase in PE  product sales could also imply that some of the PSE sales were likely  being diverted for meth production. According to officials of the market  research firm that provided the PE sales data, another potential  explanation for the lack of a distinct shift in demand for PE is the fact that  several PE products had to be recalled by the manufacturer because of  manufacturing issues.", "Industry has noted that PE has limitations as a direct substitute for PSE,  and in 2007, FDA reexamined the effectiveness of PE at the approved  dosing levels. At the request of citizen petitioners who claimed that the  available scientific evidence did not demonstrate the effectiveness of PE  at the approved 10-miligram dosage level, an FDA advisory committee  reviewed the issue in December 2007, including two meta-analyses of   After reviewing  studies provided by the citizen petitioners and CHPA.this evidence, the committee concluded that, while additional studies  would be useful to evaluate higher doses, the 10-miligram PE dose was  effective. However, since the recommendation of the FDA advisory  committee in 2007 to study the effectiveness of PE at higher dosage  levels, it appears that limited work has been undertaken to do so.  According to CHPA, while it agrees that the approved dosage levels of  PE are effective, PE has known limitations that make it a less than viable  substitute for PSE in some long-duration applications and for many  consumers.", "As would be expected under the more restrictive prescription-only  approach, consumers of PSE products would be negatively impacted to  some extent by enactment of the prescription-only approach, considering  the variables that determine the change in the effective price of PSE  products. However, because of uncertainties related to these variables,  such as consumers\u2019 individual situations regarding insurance or the need  for an in-person consultation with their physicians, the effectiveness of  substitutes such as PE or use of other alternatives, and the extent to  which PSE sales have been used for illicit purposes, the net effect on  consumer welfare resulting from enactment of a prescription-only policy  cannot be quantified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Impact on the Health Care System Is Generally Unknown but Substantial Changes in Workload Have Not Been Reported to Date", "paragraphs": ["One of the concerns expressed by industry about the potential impact of  the prescription-only approach is that it is likely to increase the workload  of health care providers and the overall health care system to some  extent. Both the Oregon and Mississippi laws required individuals to  obtain a prescription from a health care provider which requires some  type of visit or consultation with the provider. This visit or consultation  requires increased provider workload to process the prescriptions. In  addition, individuals who do not already have an established relationship  with a health care provider may require a more involved, initial in-person  visit to obtain a prescription, and pharmacies may experience increased  workload because of new dispensing requirements. Assuming that health  care providers charge prices that reflect the costs of providing these  additional services, any increase in the workload of health care providers  should get reflected in the office charge billed the patient.", "While the impact of the prescription-only approach on the health care  system is generally unknown, on the basis of limited information available  from health care providers in Oregon and Mississippi, it does not appear  that there has been a substantial increase in workload demands to  provide and dispense prescriptions for PSE products. According to a  2011 study commissioned by CHPA on managing access to PSE, judging  from Oregon\u2019s experience, the number of health care provider visits did  not grow significantly, as consumers have noted obtaining a prescription  via telephone or fax request. Officials from associations representing  physicians in Oregon stated that their members have not reported any  real impact on their practices, and their research from members suggests  that the benefits of fewer meth labs outweighs any inconvenience for their  membership of requests for prescriptions. Officials from the association  representing Mississippi physicians similarly reported that from the  perspective of a limited sample of its members involved in family practice,  emergency room care, and addiction treatment, no increase had been  observed in the demand for appointments from patients seeking PSE  products. In addition, representatives from the association representing  pharmacists in Oregon stated that they have received few complaints  over the prescription-only requirement. Further, reports from the  experience of Oregon and Mississippi indicate that there has not been a  significant increase in cost to the states\u2019 Medicaid programs. In terms of  an impact on states\u2019 Medicaid programs, officials in those states said  there was no net change in their programs\u2019 policy with the implementation  of the prescription requirement statewide because their programs already  required that participants obtain a prescription for PSE products if they  wanted to have the medication covered under the states\u2019 Medicaid  pharmacy benefit formulary.", "In summary, on the basis of the experience of Oregon and Mississippi,  the use of the prescription-only approach has had the following impacts:  Its apparent effectiveness in reducing the availability of PSE for meth  production has in turn helped to reduce or maintain a decline in the  number of meth lab incidents in the states that have adopted the  approach.", "The reduction in meth lab incidents has led to a corresponding decline  in the demand or need by communities for child welfare, law  enforcement, and environmental cleanup services to respond to the  secondary impacts of the meth labs.", "Although it is difficult to quantify due to the lack of data and wide  variation in the individual circumstances of consumers, the  prescription-only approach has the potential for placing additional  burdens on consumers to some extent.", "Increased the potential for additional workload and costs for the health  care system to provide prescriptions for PSE products.

Using these data, we analyzed the number of  incidents nationally and by region and by type of lab (i.e., P-2-P,  Nazi/Birch and One Pot, or Red Phosphorus) and lab capacity. To assess  the reliability of these data, we discussed the sources of the data with  agency officials knowledgeable about the data to determine data  consistency and reasonableness and compared them with other  supporting data and documentation, where available, from states selected  to be case studies for this review. As reporting by state and local law  enforcement agencies of lab incidents to DEA is voluntary except when  DEA provides funds to the agencies for lab cleanup, because of the  exhaustion of DEA\u2019s cleanup funds less than half way through fiscal year  2011, the number of lab incidents reported for 2011 could be biased  downward as compared with the number of incidents in previous years.  We discussed this issue and its potential implications with DEA officials  that manage the collection of the data and the steps they have taken to  address it. From these efforts and discussions, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To identify key factors that influenced lab seizure incident trends over  time, we obtained the perspectives and information on meth lab incident  trends and factors influencing this trend from state and local officials we  interviewed in states that were selected as case studies. This  nonprobability sample of states was selected to reflect a mix of  characteristics such as the type of approach chosen for controlling the  sale of pseudoephedrine (PSE) products (electronic tracking or  prescription-only), length of time the approach has been in use, and the  number of meth labs seized relative to the state\u2019s population size. The  states selected for inclusion as case study states included Iowa  (electronic tracking), Kentucky (electronic tracking), Mississippi  (prescription-only), Missouri (electronic tracking), Oregon (prescription- only), and Tennessee (electronic tracking). While we cannot generalize  any findings or results to the national level from our sample of states  visited for our case studies, the information from these states provided  perspective on meth lab trends and the experiences of the states in  implementing these approaches. We also reviewed drug threat  assessments and reports by the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC)  and information from officials with DEA and the Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP). We reviewed the methodology of the  assessments and reports and found them sufficiently reliable to provide  perspectives on meth lab incident trends and factors influencing these  trends. We obtained additional information and input regarding factors  that contributed to meth lab incident trends from federal, state, and local  officials participating in the May 2012 conference of the National  Methamphetamine and Pharmaceutical Initiative (NMPI), a national  initiative funded by ONDCP.", "To determine the impact of domestic meth labs on the communities  affected by them, we first reviewed a variety of reports and studies on  meth labs and their impacts from sources such as the Department of  Justice (DOJ), DEA, the RAND corporation, media reports, and published  academic research to identify the particular areas or ways that  communities are directly affected as a result of the presence of labs. On  the basis of this review, we identified the key ways communities are  impacted by meth labs. These included the provision of health care to  meth lab burn victims, threats and dangers posed to the welfare of  children, environmental damage, and increased demand and workload for  law enforcement agencies. While there are other areas or ways that can  be impacted by meth labs, such as treatment for health-related conditions  related to meth abuse and the demand for addiction treatment, these  impacts are caused by the abuse of both imported and domestically  produced meth and are not impacts unique to meth labs. Therefore, we  did not include those areas in our review. To describe impacts on health  care providers to administer care to meth lab operators injured or burned  by their labs, we reviewed and synthesized information from published  academic research comparing the injuries and treatment provided to  meth-lab-burn victims as compared with non-meth lab burn related  patients, documentation from DOJ on meth labs, and media reports on  the reported impacts of meth labs on hospital burn centers. We also  interviewed the director of the burn center at the Vanderbilt University  Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, to get his perspective, as the center  has treated a significant number of burn patients that received their  injuries from a meth lab. To describe impacts of meth labs on child  welfare, we reviewed and synthesized information from DOJ on drug- endangered children, meth lab incident data from DEA on the number of  children reported to be affected by the labs, and published academic  research on the impact of meth abuse on the need for foster care. To  describe environmental damage caused by meth labs, we reviewed and  synthesized information from DOJ on the impact of meth labs, DEA\u2019s  guidance for meth lab cleanup, and a report from the DOJ Inspector  General on DEA\u2019s meth lab cleanup program. For context, we also  obtained information from DEA on its clandestine lab cleanup program  and the funds expended on the program to assist state and local law  enforcement agencies in cleaning up meth labs from 2002 through 2011.  In addition, we obtained and analyzed information from the case study  states of Mississippi, Missouri, and Oregon on any funds state agencies  spent on the cleanup of meth labs. To describe impacts of meth labs on  law enforcement agencies in communities, we reviewed and synthesized  information from DEA\u2019s guidance for meth lab cleanup, documentation  from DOJ on meth labs, as well as information from state and local law  enforcement officials we interviewed from our case study states.", "To determine the impact of electronic tracking systems on domestic meth  lab incidents, we analyzed DEA NSS data on the number of meth lab  incidents that were reported in the 3 states that have implemented  electronic tracking the longest\u2014Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Tennessee\u2014  from 2002 through 2011 to identify any trends in lab incidents that  occurred within those states before and after the implementation of  electronic tracking within those states. To examine the volume of PSE  sales activities the national electronic tracking system monitors and  blocks when necessary, we obtained and reviewed PSE purchase activity  data (purchases, blocks, and exceedances) for 2011 and 2012 from  Appriss, the software firm that developed and manages the software  program MethCheck, which is used as the operational platform for the  National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx), the interstate electronic  tracking system paid for by manufacturers of PSE products. We chose  this time period because those were the most recent years for which data  from multiple states were available. To assess the reliability of these data,  we discussed the data with Appriss officials. From these efforts and  discussions, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To understand how electronic tracking works in  practice and the limitations of this approach, we obtained information from  officials with Appriss as well as officials with state and local law  enforcement and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) in our  electronic tracking case study states of Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and  Tennessee. For these state and local law enforcement officials, we  utilized a snowball sampling methodology in which we initially contacted  key law enforcement officials in those states involved in dealing with the  meth lab problem who identified and provided contacts for other officials  in those states to meet with. From these state and local law enforcement  officials, we obtained information and their perspectives on the use of  electronic tracking, its impact on the meth lab problem within their  jurisdictions, and any potential advantages or limitations of the approach  identified through their investigations and experience with the system to  date. Although their perspectives cannot be generalized across the  broader population of state and local law enforcement agencies in  electronic tracking states, their perspectives provided insights into and  information on the use and impact of the approach in practice and its  limitations.", "To determine the impact of prescription-only laws on domestic meth lab  incidents and any implications of adopting this approach for consumers  and the health care system, we analyzed DEA NSS data on the number  of meth lab incidents that were reported in the prescription-only states of  Mississippi and Oregon and their border states (Alabama, Arkansas,  California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, Tennessee, and Washington) from  2002 through 2011 to identify any trends in lab incidents that occurred  within those states before and after the implementation of the  prescription-only approach. To determine the impact of the prescription- only approach on meth lab incidents in Oregon, we conducted a statistical  modeling analysis of the lab incident data that controlled for other factors  such as region of the country, ethnic composition of the state population,  the proportion of the state population that is male, distance from the  Mexican border, and the state drug arrest rate, among others. For more  details on the methodology used for this analysis, see appendix III.", "To determine the impact of the prescription-only approach in counties and  localities in Missouri that have adopted the approach, we also obtained  and analyzed information from local officials in Missouri on how meth lab  incidents have been impacted since the adoption of the approach within  their jurisdictions. To obtain the perspective of state and local officials on  the impact of the implementation of the prescription-only approach in their  states and localities, we utilized a snowball sampling methodology in  which we initially contacted key law enforcement officials involved in  dealing with the meth lab problem or associations representing law  enforcement in Mississippi, Missouri, and Oregon who then identified and  provided contacts of other officials within their states for us to meet with.  We interviewed these officials to obtain their perspectives on the impact  of the prescription-only approach on the meth lab problem as well as the  perceived impacts on other areas, where possible, such as the demand  for law enforcement, child welfare, environmental cleanup, and the  trafficking of meth within their states. Although their perspectives on these  impacts cannot be generalized across the broader population of state and  local law enforcement agencies in prescription-only states, their  perspectives provided insights into and information on the impact of the  approach in practice. To determine the extent to which individuals in  prescription-only states have been traveling to neighboring states to  obtain PSE product without a prescription or have diverted PSE product  obtained with a prescription, we interviewed and obtained information  from local law enforcement officials in Mississippi, Missouri, and Oregon  on what they have found in their investigations into meth labs and PSE  smurfing. We also obtained and reviewed NPLEx data on PSE purchase  activity from Appriss for PSE purchases made in Washington state with  identifications issued by Oregon from October 15, 2011, to the most  recent full month available (August 2012). We chose the starting date of  October 15, 2011, because that was the date that Washington state  implemented the NPLEx system statewide.", "To gauge the extent of PSE sales made in other states neighboring  Oregon (California, Idaho, and Nevada) to individuals using identifications  issued by Oregon that had not implemented NPLEx but had retailers  within the states that used the NPLEx MethCheck software program, we  obtained and reviewed the MethCheck log data on PSE purchase activity  for those states for the same October 15, 2011, to August 2012 time  period. For Mississippi, we obtained and reviewed NPLEx data on PSE  purchase activity for purchases made with identifications from Mississippi  in the NPLEx states neighboring Mississippi (Alabama, Louisiana, and  Tennessee) between the time those states joined NPLEx to July 2012.  To determine the impact of the prescription-only approach on consumers  in Mississippi, we obtained data from IMS Health Inc. through DEA on the  volume of PSE sales for three 52-week periods ending in December  2009, 2010, and 2011 and analyzed the data for any changes in volume  over time, comparing the 2010 and 2011 periods when the prescription- only approach was in effect with the 2009 period when it was not. To  assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed documentation and  information from IMS Health officials knowledgeable about the data to  determine data consistency and reasonableness. From these reviews, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Because data prior to the period Oregon implemented the  prescription-only approach in 2006 were not available, we were not able  to do a similar analysis for Oregon.", "To examine the number of prescriptions filled in Mississippi for PSE  medications, we obtained and reviewed data provided by the Mississippi  Board of Pharmacy\u2019s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. To assess  the reliability of the data, we discussed the data with officials that manage  the program. From these efforts and discussions, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To obtain  additional information on the reported and estimated impacts of the  prescription-only approach on consumers and the health care system, we  reviewed a report of the potential impacts of the prescription-only  approach prepared for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association  (CHPA). To help obtain perspective on the potential impact on  consumers, we asked the state boards of pharmacy and state  associations representing pharmacists in Mississippi and Oregon, such  as the Oregon State Pharmacists Association, about the extent to which  complaints may have been made by consumers about the prescription- only approach. We also asked the National Consumers League and the  Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America if they had received feedback  or complaints from consumers on the impact of the prescription-only  approach. We chose these organizations because they have previously  surveyed consumers about access to PSE products.", "To understand the prescription-only approach\u2019s impact on the workload  demands for physicians, we obtained the perspective of state  associations representing physicians practicing in Oregon and  Mississippi, such as the Oregon Medical Association and the Mississippi  State Medical Association, on the extent to which their members have  reported seeing an increase in demand for appointments for PSE  prescriptions and any corresponding increase in their workload. While  their perspectives cannot be generalized to the larger population of  physicians in these states, they provided insights into the impact of the  approach on their members\u2019 practices. To determine the impact of the  prescription-only approach on the Medicaid programs within Mississippi  and Oregon, we obtained perspectives and information from Medicaid  program officials in those states on what, if any, changes the approach  required of their prescription formulary and any resulting changes in  program costs.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to January  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The case is exposed to the intervention at some point after the  first period of time; the control is never exposed to the intervention during  the course of the study. The impact of the intervention is represented by  the difference in differences. In this case there are two differences.

In our analysis, each observation represents a  state in each year from 2000 through 2010. Since the interventions were  implemented in 2006, the preintervention period spans 2000 through  2006. The post period spans 2007 through 2010.

Beasley and Case (2000) describe the endogeniety of  interventions, i.e., the fact that policies are made in response to the same  conditions that lead to the outcome. Heckman (2000) and Bertrand and  colleagues (2004) showed that because of serial correlation in the  outcomes over time, difference-in-differences models tended to  underestimate the standard error of the intervention coefficient and  therefore overestimate the test statistic, leading to the interpretation of  statistically significant differences between the case and control units.  Abadie and colleagues (2010) argue that the selection of control units are  made on the basis of subjective measures of affinity between case and  control units and that there is uncertainty in the control units\u2019 ability to  produce the counterfactual outcome trend that the case would have  experienced if the intervention has not taken place.

The unstructured  covariance structure allows for correlations to be different in each  comparison of times without any specific pattern.

Since the correlations seem constant, a compound symmetry structure is  more appropriate.", "The QIC values for the GEE models were similar with the independent,  compound symmetry, and autocorrelation structures specified, but the  QIC was usually lowest for the independence structure with  autoregressive next. This indicates that those structures fit the model  better. Independence in the measures across time is not a logical  assumption given the nature of the data, and the structure of the  correlation matrix specified by the unstructured covariance structure does  not show declining correlations over time described in the autoregressive  structure.
