While most of the inspectors assigned  to seaports perform physical inspections of goods entering the country,  some are \u201ctargeters\u201d\u2014they review documents and intelligence reports and  determine which cargo containers should undergo additional documentary  reviews and/or physical inspections. These determinations are not just  based on concerns about terrorism, but also concerns about illegal  narcotics and/or other contraband.", "The CBP Commissioner said that the large volume of imports and its  limited resources make it impossible to physically inspect all oceangoing  containers without disrupting the flow of commerce. The Commissioner  also said it is unrealistic to expect that all containers warrant such  inspection because each container poses a different level of risk based on  a number of factors including the exporter, the transportation providers,  and the importer. These concerns led to CBP implementing a layered  approach that attempts to focus resources on potentially risky cargo  containers while allowing other cargo containers to proceed without  disrupting commerce.", "As part of its layered approach, CBP employs its Automated Targeting  System (ATS) computer model to review documentation on all arriving  containers and help select or \u201ctarget\u201d containers for additional  documentary review and/or physical inspection. The ATS was originally  designed to help identify illegal narcotics in cargo containers. ATS  automatically matches its targeting rules against the manifest and other  available data for every arriving container, and assigns a level of risk (i.e.,  low, medium, high) to each container. At the port level, inspectors use  ATS, as well as other data (e.g., intelligence reports), to determine whether  to inspect a particular container. In addition, CBP has a program, called  the Supply Chain Stratified Examination, which supplements the ATS by  randomly selecting additional containers to be physically examined. The  results of the random inspection program are to be compared to the  results of ATS inspections to improve targeting. If CBP officials decide to  inspect a particular container, they might first use equipment such as the  Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) that takes a gamma-ray  image of the container so inspectors can see any visual anomalies. With or  without VACIS, inspectors can open a container and physically examine its  contents.", "Other components of the layered approach include the Container Security  Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C- TPAT). CSI is an initiative whereby CBP places staff at designated foreign  seaports to work with foreign counterparts to identify and inspect high- risk containers for weapons of mass destruction before they are shipped  to the United States.

CBP officials told us that, given the urgency to take steps to  protect against terrorism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,  that they had to take an \u201cimplement and amend\u201d approach. That is, they  had to immediately implement targeting activities with the knowledge they  would have to amend them later. Steps taken by CBP include the  following:  In November 2001, the U.S. Customs Service established the National  Targeting Center to serve as the national focal point for targeting  imported cargo for inspection. Among other things, the National  Targeting Center interacts with the intelligence community and  distributes to the ports any intelligence alerts it receives. The National  Targeting Center also assists targeters in conducting research on  incoming cargo, attempts to improve the targeting of cargo, and  manages a national targeting training program for CBP targeters.", "In August 2002, CBP modified the ATS as an anti-terrorism tool by  developing terrorism-related targeting rules and implementing them  nationally. According to CBP officials responsible for ATS, these  targeting rules were developed in consultation with selected  intelligence agencies, foreign governments, and companies. CBP is now  in the process of enhancing the ATS terrorism-related rules. The  newest version of the ATS rules, which is still being tested, gives added  risk points when certain rules apply collectively to the same container.  CBP refers to this as the \u201cbundling\u201d of rules. In these circumstances,  CBP would assume an elevated level of risk for the cargo. Related to  this, CBP is currently in the process of developing and implementing  further enhancements\u2014known as the \u201cfindings module\u201d\u2014to capture  additional information related to individual inspections of cargo  containers, such as whether an inspection resulted in the discovery of  contraband.", "In 2002, CBP also developed a 2-week national training course to train  staff in targeting techniques. The course is intended to help ensure that  seaport targeters have the necessary knowledge and ability to conduct  effective targeting. The course is voluntary and is conducted  periodically during the year at the Los Angeles, Long Beach and Miami  ports, and soon it will be conducted at the National Targeting Center.

Penalties for non- compliance can include a CBP order not to load a container on a ship  at the port of origin or monetary fines. The rule is intended to improve  the quality and timeliness of the manifest information submitted to  CBP, which is important because CBP relies extensively on manifest  information for targeting. According to CBP officials we contacted,  although no formal evaluations have been done, the 24-hour rule is  beginning to improve both the quality and timeliness of manifest  information.

Elements not fully incorporated are  discussed below.", "CBP has not performed a comprehensive set of assessments for cargo  containers. CBP has attempted to assess the threat of cargo containers  through contact with governmental and non-governmental sources.  However, it has not assessed the vulnerability of cargo containers to  tampering or exploitation throughout the supply chain, nor has it  assessed which port assets and operations are the most critical in  relation to their mission and function. These assessments, in addition  to threat assessments, are needed to understand and identify actions to  mitigate risk.", "CBP has not conducted a risk characterization for different forms of  cargo, or the different modes of transportation used to import cargo.  CBP has made some efforts in this regard by characterizing the risk of  each oceangoing cargo containers as either low, medium, or high-risk.  But, CBP has not performed a risk characterization to assess the  overall risk of cargo containers, or determine how this overall risk  characterization of cargo containers compares with sea cargo arriving  in other forms, such as bulk cargo (e.g., petroleum and chemical gas  shipments) or break-bulk cargo (e.g., steel and wood shipments).  Additionally, CBP has not conducted risk characterization to compare  the risk of cargo containers arriving by sea with the risk of cargo  containers (or other cargo) arriving by other modes, such as truck or  rail.

Terrorism experts, members of the international  trade community, and CBP inspectors at the ports we visited  characterized the ship\u2019s manifest as one of the least reliable or useful  types of information for targeting purposes. In this regard, one expert  cautioned that even if ATS were an otherwise competent targeting  model, there is no compensating for poor input data. Accordingly, if the  input data are poor, the outputs (i.e., the risk assessed targets) are not  likely to be of high quality. Another problem with manifests is that  shippers can revise them up to 60 days after the arrival of the cargo  container. According to CBP officials, about one third of these manifest  revisions resulted in higher risk scores by ATS\u2014but by the time these  revisions were received, it is possible that the cargo container may  have left the port. These problems with manifest data increase the  potential value of additional types of information.", "With respect to testing and validation, CBP has not attempted to test  and validate ATS through simulated events. The National Targeting  Center Director told us that 30 \u201cevents\u201d (either real or simulated) are  needed to properly test and validate the system. Yet CBP has not  conducted such simulations to test and validate the system. Without  testing and validation, CBP will not know whether ATS is a statistically  valid model and the extent to which it can identify high-risk containers  with reasonable assurance. The only two known instances of simulated  tests of the targeting system were conducted without CBP\u2019s approval  or knowledge by the American Broadcast Company (ABC) News in  2002 and 2003. In an attempt to simulate terrorist smuggling highly  enriched uranium into the United States, ABC News sealed depleted  uranium into a lead-lined pipe that was placed into a suitcase and later  put into a cargo container. In both instances, CBP targeted the  container that ABC News used to import the uranium, but it did not  detect a visual anomaly from the lead-lined pipe using the VACIS and  therefore did not open the container.", "With respect to instituting random inspections, CBP has a process to  randomly select and examine containers regardless of the risk. The  program\u2014the Supply Chain Stratified Examination\u2014measures  compliance with trade laws and refocused it to measure border  security compliance. One aspect of this new program is random  inspections. However, CBP guidance states that port officials may  waive the random inspections if available resources are needed to  conduct inspections called for by ATS targeting or intelligence tips.  Accordingly, although the containers targeted for inspection may be  randomly selected, the containers being inspected from the program  may not be a random representation.

Some of these constraints, such as space  limitations and inclement weather conditions, are difficult if not  impossible to avoid.", "According to CBP and union officials we contacted, concern about the  safety of VACIS is a constraint to using inspection equipment. Union  officials representing longshoremen at some ports expressed concerns  about the safety of driving cargo containers through the VACIS because it  emits gamma rays when taking an image of the inside of the cargo  container. Towing cargo containers through a stationary VACIS unit  reportedly takes less time and physical space than moving the VACIS  equipment over stationary cargo containers that have been staged for  inspection purposes. As a result of these continuing safety concerns, some  longshoremen are unwilling to drive containers through the VACIS. CBP\u2019s  response to these longshoremen\u2019s concerns has been to stage containers  away from the dock, arraying containers in rows at port terminals so that  the VACIS can be driven over a group of containers for scanning purposes.  However, as seaports and port terminals are often crowded, and there is  often limited space to expand operations, it can be space-intensive and  time consuming to stage containers. Not all longshoremen\u2019s unions have  safety concerns regarding VACIS inspections.

We did not assess  ATS\u2019s hardware or software, the quality of the threat assessments that  CBP has received from the intelligence community, or the appropriateness  or risk weighting of its targeting rules.", "To assess how well the targeting strategy has been implemented at  selected seaports in the country, we visited various CBP facilities and the  Miami, Los Angeles-Long Beach, Philadelphia, New York-New Jersey, New  Orleans, and Seattle seaports. These seaports were selected based on the  number of cargo containers processed and their geographic dispersion. At  these locations, we observed targeting and inspection operations; met with  CBP management and inspectors to discuss issues related to targeting and  the subsequent physical inspection of containers; and reviewed relevant  documents, including training and operational manuals, and statistical  reports of targeted and inspected containers. At the seaports, we also met  with representatives of shipping lines, operators of private cargo  terminals, the local port authorities, and Coast Guard personnel  responsible for the ports\u2019 physical security. We also met with terrorism  experts and representatives from the international trade community to  obtain a better understanding of the potential threat posed by cargo  containers and possible approaches to countering the threat, such as risk  management.", "We conducted our work from January to November 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Maritime Security: Progress Made in Implementing Maritime  Transportation Security Act, but Concerns Remain.
