Recognizing limitations in its IT capabilities that had been previously identified in studies by FDA and others, the agency has begun various initiatives to modernize its IT systems. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the agency's overall plans for modernizing its IT systems, including the extent to which the plans address identified limitations or inadequacies in the agency's capabilities, and (2) assess to what extent the agency has put in place key IT management policies and processes to guide the implementation of its modernization projects. GAO analyzed FDA's plans to determine whether they followed best practices and addressed capability limitations, reviewed key management policies and processes, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In response to federal law and guidance and urgent mission needs, FDA is pursuing numerous modernization projects (including 16 enterprisewide initiatives), many of which are in early stages. However, FDA does not have a comprehensive IT strategic plan to coordinate and manage these initiatives and projects. Such a plan would describe what the agency seeks to accomplish, identify the strategies it will use to achieve desired results, and provide results-oriented goals and performance measures that permit it to determine whether it is succeeding. FDA has developed two high-level planning documents that include some of these elements, but not all: (1) The agency's Strategic Action Plan provides high-level goals and objectives related to modernization of infrastructure and systems, but it does not provide details on IT initiatives, such as milestones and performance measures. (2) An IT plan for FDA's user fee program for drugs and biological products focuses on selected projects in greater detail, but these projects are only a subset of the agency's modernization initiatives. As reflected by its projects and high-level plans, FDA intends to address most of the limitations in its IT systems and infrastructure that had been previously identified. However, successfully overcoming these limitations depends in part on the agency's developing and implementing appropriately detailed plans. A comprehensive IT strategic plan, including results-oriented goals and performance measures, is vital for guiding and coordinating the agency's numerous ongoing modernization projects and activities. Until it develops such a plan, the risk is increased that the agency's IT modernization may not adequately meet the agency's urgent mission needs. FDA has made mixed progress in establishing important IT management capabilities that are essential in helping ensure a successful modernization. These capabilities include investment management, information security, enterprise architecture development, and human capital management. For example, as part of a move to an enterprisewide approach to IT management, FDA has put policies in place for investment management and project management, and it is making progress in addressing information security. However, significant work remains with regard to enterprise architecture (that is, establishing modernization blueprints describing the organization's operation in terms of business and technology), particularly its \"to be\" architecture--a blueprint of where it wants to go in the future. Further, the agency is not strategically managing IT human capital--it has not determined its IT skills needs or analyzed gaps between skills on hand and future needs. In both these areas (enterprise architecture and human capital management), the agency's vision for the future, as captured in an IT strategic plan, would be an important asset. Without an effective enterprise architecture and strategic human capital management, FDA has less assurance that it will be able to modernize effectively and will have the appropriate IT staff to effectively implement and support its modernization efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the  safety and effectiveness of a wide range of consumer products, including  80 percent of our nation\u2019s food supply.

Issues with the quality and availability of  FDA\u2019s data have been raised in several studies. In 2007, the FDA Science  Board issued FDA Science and Mission at Risk, a broad assessment of  challenges facing the agency. This study found that information was not  easily and immediately accessible throughout the agency (including  critical clinical trial data that were available only in paper form),  hampering FDA\u2019s ability to regulate products. Data and information  exchange was impeded because information resided in different systems  that were not integrated. The Science Board also reported that FDA lacked  sufficient standards for data exchanges, both within the agency and  between the agency and external parties, reducing its capability to manage  the complex data and information challenges associated with rapid  innovation, such as new data types, data models, and analytic methods.", "In 2007, FDA commissioned Deloitte Consulting, LLP, to examine ways the  agency could better meet increased demand for information and make  decisions more quickly and easily. Deloitte noted that FDA\u2019s former  decentralized approach to IT, in which the centers developed their own  systems, led to duplicative work efforts, tools, and information. Noting  that the agency had begun moving toward a more enterprisewide  approach, Deloitte recommended further steps, including establishing  enterprisewide information standards and incorporating data exchange  standards into its day-to-day processes and applications in order to  achieve interoperability with external partners.", "Our previous work also has identified issues related to the availability and  quality of the agency\u2019s data. For example, our 1998 study of FDA\u2019s foreign  drug inspection program cited evaluations that essential data for foreign  inspections were not readily available, and that FDA did not have a  comprehensive, agencywide, automated system for managing foreign  inspection of manufacturers. Further, in a series of products (most  recently in September 2008) on FDA inspections of foreign  establishments, we reported that the agency\u2019s databases on these  establishments contained incorrect information and that different  databases had differing information.", "IT infrastructure. Issues raised regarding FDA\u2019s infrastructure include  aging and redundancy. According to the FDA Science Board\u2019s 2007 report,  the agency\u2019s IT infrastructure was outdated and unstable, and it lacked  sufficient controls to ensure continuity of operations or to provide  effective disaster recovery services. For example, as many as 80 percent of  the network servers were more than 5 years old and had exceeded their  recommended service life. In addition, the report stated that outages were  occurring in other systems as well; for example, e-mail problems occurred  during an E. coli food contamination investigation. Further, critical  network components did not reside in data centers that provided the  necessary security, redundancy, and continuity of operations assurances.", "In addition, after assessing the agency\u2019s legacy applications, FDA\u2019s  contractor, High Performance Technologies, Inc., issued a report in 2008  that identified many systems that were redundant and could be combined  with each other, as well as systems that could be retired.", "Ability to use technology to improve regulatory effectiveness. According  to the FDA Science Board report, advances in science and technology  have been outpacing the capabilities of FDA\u2019s IT infrastructure and  systems. For example, although genetics and genome-wide association  analyses are an increasingly important technique in drug reviews, the  agency had minimal IT infrastructure to support genomics-focused efforts,  which generate large data sets. To implement the real-time acquisition and  sharing of genomics data would require the development of appropriate  data storage, mining, analysis, and risk evaluation tools for FDA scientists.", "IT management. Issues with FDA\u2019s IT management have been found in  several areas, including human capital, enterprise architecture,  governance, and information security. In assessing IT human capital, the  Science Board stated that the agency did not have sufficient IT staff with  skills in such areas as capital planning/investment control and enterprise  architecture, that processes for recruitment and retention of IT staff were  inadequate, and that the agency did not invest sufficiently in professional  development.", "Deloitte\u2019s study also commented on IT management, stating that FDA  needed to develop both a common enterprise information management  architecture and an IT architecture to facilitate both short-term  operational gains such as improved information access, as well as long- term gains in strategic flexibility.", "In another study, the Breckenridge Institute examined the process being  used to develop requirements for the agency\u2019s adverse event reporting  system and found that FDA\u2019s management of requirements development  did not follow proper IT methodology, such as documenting the reasons  for changes to system requirements.", "Finally, in October 2008, an HHS inspector general report concluded that  FDA had made progress implementing an infrastructure to support the  security management program.

The plan might include the mission o the agency, key business processes, IT challenges, and guiding principles.  A strategic plan is important to enable an agency to consider the  resources, including human, infrastructure, and funding, that are needed  to manage, support, and pay for projects. For example, a strategic plan  that identifies what an agency intends to accomplish during a given period  helps ensure that the necessary infrastructure is put in place for new or  improved capabilities.

Bioinformatics Board members told us that the Business Review Boards  use these criteria and others specified by the Bioinformatics Board, such  as budget considerations.", "Oversight and project management. As part of an effective IT investment  process, an agency must be able to control its investments\u2014manage its  projects\u2014so that they finish predictably within established schedule and  budget. To accomplish this, agencies should have policies and procedures  for oversight and should provide adequate resources, such as managers  and staff responsible for monitoring projects.

At this stage, an organization also  assigns management roles and responsibilities and establishes plans for  developing enterprise architecture products and for measuring program  progress and product quality; it also commits the resources necessary for  developing an architecture\u2014people, processes, and tools.

A segment architecture allows for the  details needed to implement an enterprise architecture to be built in pie by piece. First a corporate layer of architecture is built that sufficient ly  reflects, among other things, those policies, rules, and standards that apply  across the whole enterprise; then the more specific content needed to  implement the enterprise architecture on a segment-by-segment basis is  added. The segment architecture extends the enterprisewide layer,  providing additional detail and depth needed to implement project and IT  solutions. Accordingly, segment architectures do not stand alone.", "FDA has begun building segments before it has a well-defined enterprise  architecture and before it has prioritized its segments. According to the  Federal Enterprise Architecture Practice Guide, prioritizing segments  should precede building them. Once prioritization is completed, the  agency should define (1) the scope and strategic intent of each segment,  (2) business and information requirements, and (3) the conceptual  solution architecture. FDA has identified 26 segments in all (for example,  product safety, risk analysis, scientific analysis, and external  partnerships), but it has not yet prioritized them. According to FDA, its  enterprise architecture staff are currently working to define a standard set  of criteria that the Bioinformatics Board is to use to set priorities for the  remaining segments.", "Although FDA has not prioritized its segments, it has, according to  officials, completed the architecture for one segment\u2014product safety\u2014 including an \u201cas is,\u201d \u201cto be,\u201d and transition plan. According to the Chief  Architect, the completed product safety segment architecture describes  the scope and strategic intent of the segment, defines business and  information requirements, and includes a description of the solutions  architecture. According to FDA officials, this architecture has been sent to  HHS for approval. However, they could not provide documentation of the  completed segment.", "Attempting to define and build major IT systems without first completing  either an enterprisewide architecture and, where appropriate, the relevant  segment architecture is risky. According to the Federal Enterprise  Architecture Practice Guide, prioritizing segments should precede building  them, and developing the segment architecture should take place before  an agency executes projects. FDA has identified three modernization  projects as being within the product safety segment: MedWatch Plus,  FAERS, and Harmonized Inventory. Thus, the other 13 major  modernization projects are proceeding without the guidance and  constraint of an enterprise or segment architecture. For example, some  projects outside the product safety segment\u2014such as the Common  Electronic Document Room and PREDICT\u2014that will need to use data  from multiple sources may not be able to exchange data seamlessly with  future systems. Similarly, a recent FDA study to identify existing  applications with potential for agencywide use said it could not make  definitive recommendations without a \u201cto be\u201d architecture. Also, going  forward, further development of a \u201cto be\u201d enterprise architecture could be  hindered by the lack of an IT strategic plan, since an enterprise  architecture must align with an organization\u2019s strategic planning. As long  as the architectural context for its enterprise architecture and segment  architectures lags behind its modernization projects, FDA increases the  risk that its modernization solutions will not be defined, developed, and  deployed in a way that promotes interoperability, maximizes shared reuse,  and minimizes overlap and duplication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Begun Steps for Strategically Managing IT Human Capital, but Critical Activities Remain", "paragraphs": ["The success or failure of federal programs, like those of other  organizations, depends on having the right number of people with the right  mix of knowledge and skills.
