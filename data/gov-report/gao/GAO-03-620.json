States' ability to fund services depends on their financial resources in relation to their number of and costs to serve people in poverty. GAO and others have testified before Congress that the current formula does not address wide differences among states in their ability to fund their Medicaid programs and that the formula's reliance on PCI is the primary cause. GAO was asked to determine the extent to which the formula narrows these differences and to identify factors that impede further narrowing of differences. To evaluate the extent to which the formula narrows differences in states' funding ability, GAO used an alternative to PCI that more directly measures states' resources, number of people in poverty, and cost of providing services to this population. Using this measure, GAO determined the effect of the current formula by comparing states' funding ability before and after receiving their federal matching aid. If differences in funding ability were eliminated, the formula would have reduced differences by 100 percent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Medicaid formula narrows the average difference in states' funding ability by 20 percent but often widens the gap between individual states and the national average. Although the receipt of federal matching aid moves 30 states closer to the national average, making the average difference in funding ability smaller, it also moves 21 states farther away from the average, widening the average difference. These 21 states include 3 that are among the states with the largest populations in poverty--California, Florida, and New York. After federal matching aid is added, states' funding ability ranges from 26 percent below the national average for two states to 179 percent above for another. Because of the formula's current structure, in many instances, two states devoting similar proportions of their own resources to Medicaid can spend very different amounts per person in poverty. For example, in fiscal year 2000, California and Wisconsin each devoted about $8 for every $1,000 of their own state resources toward Medicaid. However, under the current formula, Wisconsin receives a relatively high federal matching rate despite its relatively high ability to fund program services, whereas California receives a low federal matching rate despite its relatively low ability to fund program services. With the addition of federal matching aid, Wisconsin is enabled to spend more than twice what California is able to spend per person in poverty ($7,532 versus $3,731). Two factors constrain the formula from further decreasing differences in states' funding ability. First, PCI is not a comprehensive indicator of a state's total available resources and is a poor measure of the size of and cost to serve a state's people in poverty. Second, the statutory provision that guarantees no state will receive less than a 50 percent matching rate benefits many states that already have above-average resources to fund health care for their populations in poverty. For example, 2 of the 11 states that benefit the most from the 50 percent \"floor\" receive matching rates that are 35 and 20 percentage points higher, respectively, than the rates they would receive based solely on their PCI. GAO received comments on a draft of this report from two external reviewers who have Medicaid formula expertise. They generally agreed with the analysis and provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Created in 1965, Medicaid is the largest federal program assisting states in  financing medical and health-related services for certain categories of the  country\u2019s low-income population. In fiscal year 2000, Medicaid served  about 43 million beneficiaries and had expenditures totaling about $196  billion, $111 billion of which was financed by the federal government and  the rest financed by the states. The federal share of total Medicaid  program costs is determined using a statutory formula that calculates the  portion of each state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures that the federal government  will pay, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP),  referred to in this report as the federal matching rate. The formula  calculates the federal matching rate for each state on the basis of its per  capita income (PCI) in relation to national PCI. States with a low PCI  receive a higher federal matching rate, and states with a high PCI receive a  lower rate. The Medicaid statute also provides for a 50 percent minimum  federal matching rate (\u201c50 percent floor\u201d) that reflects a federal  commitment to fund at least half the cost of each state\u2019s program.", "One of the goals of the formula has been to narrow differences among  states in their ability to fund Medicaid services, which is determined by a  state\u2019s financial resources in relation to its low-income population. By  providing higher matching rates to states with low PCI, it was expected  that these states would be in a better position to provide health care  services to low-income populations. (App. I contains a legislative history  of the formula.)", "In 1995, we and other witnesses testified before the Senate Committee on  Finance that the current Medicaid formula did not adequately address  wide differences among states in their ability to fund program services and  that the formula\u2019s reliance on PCI is the primary cause. Witnesses  generally testified that PCI is an unreliable indicator of states\u2019 ability to  fund Medicaid programs.", "Because the formula has not been changed since the program\u2019s inception  and concerns persist regarding its performance with respect to narrowing  differences in states\u2019 ability to fund program services, you asked us to  address the following questions: (1) To what extent does the Medicaid  formula reduce differences in states\u2019 ability to fund program services? (2)  What factors prevent the formula from further narrowing differences in  states\u2019 funding ability?", "To evaluate the extent to which the formula narrows differences in states\u2019  ability to fund program services, we defined a state\u2019s ability to fund its  Medicaid programs as the financial resources potentially subject to state  taxation relative to its number of low-income residents, adjusted for the  cost of providing health care to them. For state resources, we used Total  Taxable Resources (TTR), a measure of all income potentially subject to  taxation that is either produced within a state or received by state  residents from out-of-state sources. TTR is reported annually by the  Department of the Treasury. To determine the number of low-income  people in each state (\u201cpeople in poverty\u201d), we obtained the Bureau of the  Census\u2019s counts of people with incomes at or below the federal poverty  level (FPL). We adjusted the counts of people in poverty to reflect (1) the  higher cost of serving the elderly, who utilize health care services at higher  rates than other age groups, and (2) geographic differences in the cost of  medical personnel, facilities, and supplies used to deliver health care  services. To adjust for age differences in people in poverty, we used data  on Medicaid spending by age group from the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  We used 5-year averages of people in poverty for each age group for 1995  through 1999 to increase the reliability of the state-level population counts  because they are subject to statistical error, especially in smaller states. To  measure geographic differences in the cost of medical personnel, facilities,  and supplies, we used data from the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS) and from the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD).", "We compared states\u2019 funding ability from their own resources with their  funding ability after their resources have been augmented to include the  value of the federal Medicaid matching aid they receive. Throughout this  report, we refer to augmenting a state\u2019s taxable resources this way as state  funding ability with the \u201cvalue\u201d of federal matching aid included. If  differences in funding ability were completely eliminated by adding the  value of federal matching aid, the formula would have reduced differences  in states\u2019 funding ability by 100 percent.

For example, federal law  requires state programs to cover pregnant women and children under age  6 if their family income is at or below 133 percent of the FPL, children  under age 19 in families with incomes at or below the FPL, and individuals  who receive Supplemental Security Income because they have disabling  conditions. For most covered populations, state Medicaid programs are  required to offer certain benefits, such as physician services, inpatient and  outpatient hospital services, and nursing facility and home health services.  State Medicaid programs must provide Early and Periodic Screening,  Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services for most children, intended  as comprehensive, periodic evaluations of children\u2019s health and  developmental history, that include vision, hearing, and dental screening.", "States\u2019 Medicaid programs can differ dramatically because states may  expand their programs beyond the minimum requirements to cover, for  example, individuals whose incomes exceed federally mandated eligibility  thresholds and optional services, such as prosthetic devices and  prescription drugs. For example, a state may extend Medicaid eligibility to  certain population groups, such as pregnant women who have family  incomes above 133 percent of the FPL, or make optional services such as  prescription drugs available to its entire covered population.", "Since the Medicaid program began, total program costs have been  apportioned between states and the federal government using a formula  that provides more generous federal matching aid to states with lower  PCI. The use of PCI in federal grant formulas dates to 1946, when it was  State U.S. \uf8f8 chosen as a proxy for a state\u2019s ability to fund public services. Consistent  with the purpose described in the formula\u2019s legislative history, PCI is used  as a proxy for both state resources and the low-income population. As a  state\u2019s PCI increases, relative to the national average, the formula provides  for a decreasing federal matching rate, meaning the federal government  shares a smaller portion of a state\u2019s costs. By statute, the federal matching  rate may range from 50 percent to 83 percent. The formula\u2019s multiplier,  currently 0.45, represents the state\u2019s share of its total Medicaid costs for a  state with PCI equal to the national average, and the federal government  thus pays a 55 percent share of total costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Formula Narrows Differences in Some States\u2019 Funding Ability and Widens Differences in Others", "paragraphs": ["The Medicaid formula reduces by 20 percent the differences among states  in their ability to fund program services, compared with the national  average funding ability.

In total, 30 states move closer to the national average  after adding the federal match. However, as the right panel of figure 1  shows, adding the value of federal matching aid often has inconsistent  effects. For example, including the value of federal matching aid moves  Alaska\u2019s and Utah\u2019s funding ability farther above, rather than closer to, the  national average funding ability. This happens because PCI does not  adequately reflect that these two states have fewer people in poverty than  the national average. In addition, Utah has lower-than-average costs to  provide health care services. The current formula actually moves 21 states  farther above or below the average:    Four of the 21 states\u2014California, Florida, Hawaii, and New York\u2014have  below-average funding ability before federal matching aid is added and  move farther below the average after federal matching aid is added. These  4 states have approximately 31 percent of the nation\u2019s people in poverty.

States\u2019 Medicaid cost-adjusted spending  per person in poverty varies as well. For example, Alaska\u2019s combined  federal and state spending was over $10,000 per person in poverty, while  Nevada\u2019s spending was approximately $2,500 per person in poverty (see  right panel of fig. 2).", "Because the federal matching formula does not fully eliminate differences  in states\u2019 funding ability, states devoting similar proportions of their own  resources to Medicaid cannot spend the same amounts per person in  poverty, cost adjusted, with federal matching aid factored in. In addition,  because the formula further increases the already high funding ability of  some states and decreases the low funding ability of others, these  spending differences can be quite large. For example, in fiscal year 2000,  both California and Wisconsin devoted roughly the same proportion of  their own resources to fund program benefits\u2014about $8 per $1,000 of  taxable resources\u2014which was close to the national average ($8.37)  proportion of resources states devoted to Medicaid that year. However,  the current formula moved California\u2019s below-average funding ability  farther below the national average and increased Wisconsin\u2019s above- average funding ability farther above. This occurred because Wisconsin  receives a high federal match despite its relatively high funding ability,  whereas California receives a low federal match despite its relatively low  funding ability. Once federal matching aid was factored in, with their  nearly identical funding effort, Wisconsin is enabled to spend more than  twice what California could spend per person in poverty\u2014$7,532  compared with $3,731. Similarly, Florida and Iowa each devoted $6.48 per  $1,000 in state resources toward their Medicaid programs.

In addition, PCI is not a good proxy for the differences  in the cost of providing health care services that are related to the ages of  the population served and the geographic area in which services are  provided. Persons who are elderly typically use health care services at  higher rates than adults and children and therefore cost more to serve.  Two states with low PCIs may have very different proportions of elderly  persons potentially eligible for Medicaid. In addition, costs to provide  health care services vary widely depending on geographic location  because wages and other costs of office space vary regionally. For  example, the District of Columbia and Connecticut have similar PCIs, but  the share of the District\u2019s population in poverty is more than twice  Connecticut\u2019s.

In  performing these calculations, we measured each state\u2019s funding ability  relative to the average funding ability of all states. The resulting indexes of  states\u2019 funding abilities provide a means of comparing relative differences  in states\u2019 ability to fund their Medicaid programs. We used the weighted  absolute mean deviation as a quantitative measure of differences in states\u2019  funding ability. This statistic is a measure of average differences in states\u2019  funding ability. It is calculated by taking the absolute value of each state\u2019s  index of relative funding ability and computing the arithmetic average of  these differences, using the following formula:  X = A state\u2019s funding ability index  XAVG = Weighted average of all states\u2019 funding ability indexes  w = A state\u2019s weighting factor (people in poverty).", "In calculating the mean absolute deviation, we took into account  differences in the potential size of state programs by using the number of  people living in poverty in each state.", "We chose the mean absolute deviation rather than the more commonly  used weighted standard deviation because the latter, by squaring  differences between each state\u2019s funding ability and the national average  funding ability, gives much greater weight to states at the extreme ends of  the distribution of states\u2019 funding abilities, resulting in a measure that is  more sensitive to extreme values and thus less likely to reflect the norm.", "We calculated the mean absolute deviation in states\u2019 funding ability both  without and with the value of federal matching aid added. Calculating the  percentage change in the two mean absolute deviations measures the  extent to which the current formula reduces differences in states\u2019 funding  ability. For example, if the current formula completely eliminated  differences in states\u2019 funding ability, total funding ability of all states  would equal the average of all states, and the mean absolute deviation  would be zero, representing a 100 percent reduction in differences in  states\u2019 funding ability (the maximum possible). Alternatively, if the  formula had no effect in reducing differences in states\u2019 funding ability, the  mean absolute deviation in states\u2019 funding ability with the value of federal  matching aid taken into account would be the same as the mean absolute  deviation in states\u2019 funding ability from their own resources. In this case,  there would be no change in the mean absolute deviation, meaning that  the matching formula had no effect in reducing relative differences in  states\u2019 funding ability.", "Table 3 shows each state\u2019s index of Medicaid funding ability without and  with the value of its federal matching aid.", "The mean absolute deviation of states\u2019 funding ability before taking into  account the value of federal matching aid (column 1 of table 3) yielded an  average difference in states\u2019 relative funding ability of 22.7 percent. The  mean absolute deviation in states\u2019 funding ability after taking into account  the value of federal matching aid (column 2 of table 3) yielded an average  difference of 18.1 percent.
