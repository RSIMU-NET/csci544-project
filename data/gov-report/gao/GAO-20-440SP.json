VA procures medical supplies through both its own  Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program and through the Federal Supply Schedule program\u2014a government-wide program, parts of which  the General Services Administration has long delegated to VA. However, VA has not assessed whether duplication across these  programs is necessary or if efficiencies could be gained. GAO cannot estimate the savings that might be associated with this action  because such savings will be dependent on whether, when, and how VA takes action.", "New Action: GAO recommended that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should take steps to assess duplication between VA\u2019s Medical- Surgical Prime Vendor and Federal Supply Schedule programs to determine if this duplication is necessary or if efficiencies can be  gained.", "Agency Comments and GAO\u2019s Evaluation: VA agreed with this recommendation.

Both the  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have the authority to provide disaster  assistance funding to transit agencies, but FTA has primary responsibility if it receives an appropriation from Congress for its Public  Transportation Emergency Relief program. FTA did not receive an appropriation until roughly 6 months after the first hurricane\u2019s landfall,  thus transit agencies could initially apply to FEMA for assistance. In November 2019, GAO found that although FTA and FEMA  coordinated efforts, both agencies still approved about $35,000 to one applicant for the same expenses in 2019. While the amount of  funding in question was relatively small, without addressing the challenge of identifying transit expenses in FEMA applications, FTA and  FEMA will continue to face the risk that both agencies will approve funding for the same expense in the future.", "New Actions: GAO recommended in November 2019 that FTA and FEMA identify and develop controls, such as methods to more easily  identify transit expenses within applications FEMA receives, to address the risk of duplicate funding.", "Agency Comments and GAO\u2019s Evaluation: The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  agreed with this recommendation and outlined steps they plan to take to address it.

For example, agencies reported saving as much as $15 million migrating email  systems to cloud services. However, GAO reported that 12 of the 16 agencies reviewed had not completed their assessments and that  savings data were unavailable for 84 percent of the 488 cloud investments reviewed. Improving the assessment of investments for cloud  services and tracking related savings can help agencies make better decisions regarding cloud acquisitions and potentially save millions  of dollars from implementing cloud services.", "New actions: GAO made 28 recommendations in April 2019 to all 16 agencies, including that (1) 12 agencies should complete an  assessment of all of their IT investments for suitability for migration to a cloud computing service, in accordance with OMB guidance; and  (2) 16 agencies should ensure that their respective Chief Information Officers establish a consistent and repeatable mechanism to track savings and cost avoidances from the migration and deployment of cloud services. Fourteen agencies agreed with all recommendations, the Department of the Treasury neither agreed nor disagreed, and the Department of Defense agreed with the recommendation on completing assessments, but not with the recommendation on tracking savings.", "Agency comments and GAO\u2019s evaluation: GAO provided a draft of this report section to the 16 agencies for review and comment.

This effort is currently known as the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI). Since 2010,  agencies have closed 6,250 centers and reported $4.2 billion in savings. However, only two of 24 agencies in GAO\u2019s review planned to  fully meet the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) September 2018 government-wide optimization goals, such as determining how  much time data servers sit unused and how effectively data centers use power.", "New actions: GAO made 36 recommendations in April 2019 to 22 of the 24 agencies in its review, including that (1) 11 agencies should  meet DCOI\u2019s data center closure targets; (2) four agencies should meet DCOI\u2019s data center-related cost savings targets and one should  identify additional cost savings opportunities; and (3) 20 agencies should meet DCOI\u2019s data center optimization metric targets. While GAO  cannot precisely estimate the potential savings of taking these actions, combined estimates from agencies for similar prior actions  exceeded $100 million per year, suggesting potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional savings over time.
