In addition, the United States lacks an effective system for confirming receipt of imports--a Kimberley Process requirement for avoiding possible diversions of rough diamond imports. Finally, the United States has not had a plan for monitoring USKPA, but is developing and testing one. Internationally, the United States has helped to strengthen KPCS by participating in KPCS activities and providing assistance to Sierra Leone and Liberia in their efforts to comply with KPCS, but donor assistance to these countries faces challenges.

However, this system needs further  improvement to assure that the rough diamond trade does not include  illicit diamonds. CDTA recommends that the executive branch keep and  publish statistics on rough diamond imports and exports, recognizing that  reliable and comparable data on the international trade in rough diamonds  are an essential tool to effectively implement the certification scheme.  These data can help to identify any irregularities or anomalies that might  indicate the presence of conflict diamonds in the legitimate trade in rough  diamonds.

Subsequent to the enactment of CDTA, Census  reported U.S. rough diamond trade data to KPCS that contained a greater  volume of exports than imports. For example, it reported that the United  States had exported about 3 million carats more than it imported in 2003.  As a non-producing nation, this excess in exports was not plausible and  raised concerns about the accuracy of the U.S. trade data and the potential  laundering of rough diamonds through the United States. In fact, because  the United States does not produce rough diamonds and cuts and polishes  some rough diamonds, exported carats should, on average, be lower than  imported carats. In 2005, the KPCS peer review visit to the United States  recommended that Census identify all anomalies within the systems for  recording data and correct them as necessary, that the United States  provide explanations for the large differences between exports and  imports in 2003 and 2004 to the KPCS Working Group on Statistics, and  that the group follow up on this issue with the U.S. authorities.", "To improve the quality of its data and to comply with KPCS data  requirements, Census made a number of changes, including the following:    Census officials indicated they had identified anomalies that affected the  accuracy of the data, including the misclassification of shipments by  individual filers and the Census\u2019 use of a method that altered some  shipments by recalculating quantities of exports or imports based on  historical price data.", "Census continues to pursue potential causes of inaccuracy in U.S. rough  diamond import and export data.

This change harmonized the U.S. system for data  collection with the vast majority of other KPCS participants. Before this  change, Census used data from its traditional customs-based method to  report to KPCS, which can be different from data collected based on  Kimberley Process certificates.", "Census now checks its own data against the monthly data it receives from  USKPA on the disposition of certificates issued each month. This extra  step has helped Census to identify errors involving quantities or shipments  that were misclassified as rough diamonds.", "Census and CBP modified the Automated Export System (AES) and the  Automated Broker Interface (ABI), so that these computer systems,  through which filers enter export and import shipment data, require  Kimberley Process certificate numbers when entering information on  rough diamond exports and imports. With these changes, filers will now  receive an error if they do not provide a Kimberley Process certificate  number after entering a rough diamond tariff code.

Compared to the nearly 3 million carat discrepancy reported  between imports and exports in 2003, by 2005 Census reported an excess  in exports of less than 300,000 carats compared to imports. However,  Census has not determined whether this annual excess of U.S. exports  compared to imports is reasonable for a non-mining country and, thereby,  does not involve illicit rough diamonds.

Although rough diamonds come into the  United States through multiple ports of entry, about 85 percent of them  come through one port of entry\u2014John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport in New  York City.

If the  reviewing import specialist detects a problem with the documentation, the  shipment is detained until CBP obtains the necessary documentation to  release the shipment. The shipment may be seized if the information is not  obtained within a certain time frame.", "CBP has used four approaches to select imports of commodities for  physical inspections. In the case of rough diamonds, this means physically  opening and examining the content of import parcels. First, given the large  number of imports arriving into the United States every day, CBP uses an  approach to identify high risk import shipments for physical inspections.  According to CBP documentation, this approach enables CBP to balance  its efforts to enforce CDTA with the agency\u2019s Priority Trade Issues and  other responsibilities. Second, CBP has a compliance measurement  program that randomly selects shipments for physical inspection across all  ports. Less than 1 percent of rough diamond shipments each year are  selected for a physical inspection through this program, according to CBP.  Third, physical inspections occur at the discretion of the ports. At JFK, for  instance, CBP physically inspects shipments for different reasons,  including (1) intelligence information entered into CBP\u2019s computer system  before the shipment arrives at port; (2) suspicious discovery in the  documentation review; (3) shipments from unknown importers; or (4)  other information. Finally, CBP inspected all rough diamond imports that  came into JFK on two occasions in 2004 and 2005.

Also, the United States has not had  a policy and plan for periodically or regularly physically inspecting  imports and exports of rough diamonds to ensure that illicit rough  diamonds do not enter the legitimate U.S. trade of these diamonds. In  addition, the United States has failed to confirm most rough diamond  import receipts to foreign export authorities, thereby failing to comply  with a KPCS standard.
