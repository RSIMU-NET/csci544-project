This report identifies examples of these issues, what factors may contribute to these issues, and how, if at all, Labor could address them. GAO matched QW and unemployment files from five selected states with FECA payment files for the period of July 2009 to June 2010. GAO identified 530 individuals who received concurrent FECA compensation payments and wages of at least $5,000 between July 2009 and June 2010. GAO also identified 50 individuals who received concurrent FECA compensation and UI benefits of at least $5,000 each during the same period. GAO randomly selected up to seven recipients from each state for an in-depth review, for a total of 32 QW and 19 UI cases, respectively. These examples cannot be generalized beyond those presented. GAO also reviewed Labor's policies, guidelines, and procedures for managing claims."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found examples of improper payments and indicators of potential fraud in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program, which could be attributed, in part, to oversight and data-access issues. GAO found examples of claimants' receiving overlapping FECA and unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, which may be allowable under certain circumstances, but could also be erroneous. GAO also found that FECA program requirements allow claimants to receive earnings, and earnings increases, without necessarily resulting in adjustment of FECA compensation. For example, of the 32 FECA case files reviewed, GAO found five instances where an individual's wage-earning capacity (WEC), which is used to determine FECA benefits, was not adjusted even though the individual earned substantially more than the wage that was originally used to calculate the WEC. In addition, two FECA claimants continued to receive privateemployment salaries that were not subject to their WEC calculation. This is because, as currently written, program procedures allow claimants to receive increases in earnings, in certain circumstances, without adjustments to FECA compensation, and current law allows for claimants' earnings from dissimilar concurrent private employment at the time of injury to be exempt when determining FECA compensation. As discussed below, GAO identified challenges related to oversight and data access, which could result in improper payments or overlapping benefits.", "GAO found that the Department of Labor (Labor) did not conduct a timely review of the medical activity reports of 4 of the 32 FECA claimants and did not complete a timely review of the employment activity reports of 2 claimants, which could potentially result in an improper payment or be an indicator of potential fraud in one case where a claimant did not respond to repeated Labor requests for the employment activity reports. Labor has taken some steps to enhance oversight of the program, such as developing measures to improve the periodic review of claimants' documentation.", "GAO found that 8 out of 32 claimants underreported employment wages in comparison to the state's quarterly wage (QW) reports. Labor does not have authority to directly access Social Security Administration (SSA) wage data to verify claimants' reported income; consequently, it relies on periodic selfreporting of income. GAO has previously identified this as a potential vulnerability that could increase the risk of claimants receiving benefits they are not entitled to. To address this, Labor proposed legislation allowing the agency to match SSA wage data with FECA files, but the proposal is still pending.", "GAO identified 19 cases where claimants were receiving overlapping UI and FECA benefits totaling over $1.3 million. Four of these 19 claimants received more income from combined UI and FECA benefits than they would have received from their federal salary alone. Four of the five selected states in our review require the offset of UI benefits against FECA compensation payments. Because Labor does not have a process to share necessary data with states to identify overlapping FECA and UI payments, a mechanism to share FECA information with the states would help provide reasonable assurance that payments are being made properly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Labor develop an effective mechanism to share FECA compensation information with states to help identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping UI and FECA payments.

Benefits include  wage-loss benefits, medical benefits, vocational-rehabilitation benefits,  and survivors\u2019 benefits. In fiscal year 2012, the FECA program made  more than $2.1 billion in wage-loss compensation payments to claimants.  The program, administered by the Department of Labor (Labor), provides  benefits to federal employees who sustained injuries or illnesses while  performing their federal duties. For those claims that are approved,  employing agencies reimburse Labor for payments made to their  employees, while Labor bears most of the program\u2019s administrative costs.", "Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) estimated  that future actuarial liabilities for government-wide FECA compensation  payments to those receiving benefits as of fiscal year 2012 would total  over $34 billion (this amount does not include any costs for workers  added to the FECA rolls in future years); the U.S. Postal Service  represents over 40 percent (approximately $14.4 billion) of these  estimated liabilities. Federal agencies\u2019 Offices of Inspector General (IG)  have identified programmatic deficiencies at the employing department  and at Labor that may make the program vulnerable to fraud and abuse.  For these reasons, you asked us to investigate the oversight mechanism  Labor has in place to prevent waste, fraud, or abuse in the FECA  program. This report is a follow-up to our January 2012 report identifying  potential vulnerabilities in the program\u2019s design and controls that could  increase the risk for fraud and promising practices that could help to  reduce the risk of fraud within the FECA program. This report addresses  the following question:  What examples, if any, of improper payments, potential fraud, or  overlapping benefits can be found in the FECA program, what factors  may contribute to these issues, and how, if at all, could Labor address  these factors?", "To answer this objective, we determined whether individuals potentially  received improper payments, potentially committed fraud, or received  overlapping payments by comparing FECA data to quarterly wage (QW)  and unemployment insurance (UI) data from selected states. To do this,  we drew a nonprobability sample from five selected states: California,  Florida, Maryland, New York, and Virginia. To identify instances in which  individuals received both FECA and QW benefits, we matched selected  states\u2019 QW files with FECA beneficiaries for the period of July 2009 to  June 2010. We then applied a minimum threshold of $5,000 to the  amount of both FECA benefits and QW earnings in order to identify a  sample for further review. The threshold of $5,000 was chosen in order to  identify a sample that was significant and that would allow for in-depth  analysis. Individuals may be allowed to receive concurrent FECA and QW  earnings if a person is on partial disability, however in some cases receipt  of concurrent payments may be improper. We identified 530 individuals  who had received concurrent FECA wage-loss compensation payments  and wage payments of at least $5,000 for the 1-year period (i.e., July  2009 to June 2010) We then randomly selected up to seven claimants  from each of the five states for an in-depth review, for a total of 32 cases.  Of the five states, California, Maryland, and New York had seven  individuals selected randomly, Florida had six individuals, and Virginia  had five individuals that met the criteria for selection. For these  beneficiaries, we reviewed QW files from the selected states and FECA  files from Labor. The specific findings from the selected cases cannot be  generalized to other, or all, FECA claimants who also received quarterly  wages.", "To identify FECA claimants who concurrently received UI benefits, we  obtained and analyzed UI files from the same selection of states. Under  certain circumstances, individuals can legitimately receive FECA and UI  concurrently, but claimants could also be receiving these overlapping  benefits erroneously, which could signal potentially improper or fraudulent  payments. We matched these claimants with the FECA files for this same  period. As in our QW analysis, we then applied a minimum threshold of  $5,000 to the amount of both FECA and UI benefit payments. We  identified 50 individuals who received concurrent FECA wage-loss  compensation payments and UI benefits that exceeded the minimum  threshold. We chose the $5,000 threshold in order to identify a sample  that was both significant and would allow for in-depth analysis. We then  randomly selected up to seven claimants from each of the five states for  an in-depth review, for a total of 19 cases. For these beneficiaries, we  reviewed UI files from the selected states and FECA files from Labor. The  findings from these specific cases cannot be generalized to other, or all,  FECA claimants who also received UI benefits.", "In addition, we conducted investigations of 3 of the 51 (19 UI and 32 QW)  individual cases. We selected these cases through a two-stage process.  First, we selected 8 cases for further investigation, 4 from California and 4  from Virginia. The cases were selected on the basis of the number of  cases from each state, geographical proximity to Washington, D.C., and  potential for fraud stemming from an initial file review.that 3 required further investigations on the basis of a lack of supporting  details in the FECA case files. The other five case files contained  information that made it clear why the discrepancy occurred.", "To identify factors that may have contributed to potentially improper or  overlapping benefits, and how, if at all, Labor could address these factors,  we conducted interviews with officials from Labor\u2019s OWCP and  Employment and Training Agency (ETA), and reviewed prior Inspector  General (IG) and GAO reports. We also reviewed Labor\u2019s oversight  mechanisms, which establish policies, guidelines, and procedures for  adjudicating and managing claims under the FECA program and  compared them with those outlined in the Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government.", "To determine the reliability of the FECA and state QW and UI data we  received, we reviewed documentation related to these databases and  interviewed officials responsible for compiling and maintaining relevant  data. In addition, we performed electronic testing to determine the validity  of specific data elements in the databases that we used to perform our  work. We also reviewed detailed FECA and UI case files for the  nongeneralizable selection of individuals who received concurrent FECA  and QW or UI benefits.

OWCP is the central point where FECA claims are processed  and eligibility and benefit decisions are made. Claims examiners (CE) at  OWCP\u2019s 12 FECA district offices determine applicants\u2019 eligibility for FECA  benefits and process claims for wage-loss payments.", "FECA laws and regulations specify criteria for computing compensation  payments. Using information provided by the employing agency and the  claimant on a claims form, OWCP calculates compensation on the basis  of a number of factors, including the claimant\u2019s rate of pay, the claimant\u2019s  marital status, and whether or not the claimant has dependents. Eligible  disabled employees generally receive 66-2/3 percent (or 75 percent if  married or with dependents) of their basic salary, tax-free, plus medical- related expenses. When an injury results in partial disability, and the  employee suffers a wage loss because of the disability, the claimant is  entitled to monthly monetary compensation equal to 66-2/3 percent (or 75  percent if married or with dependents) of the difference between the  claimant\u2019s monthly pay and his or her monthly wage-earning capacity  (WEC).", "According to OWCP officials, initial claims received from employing  federal agencies are reviewed by claims examiners to assess the  existence of key elements. (See fig. 1.) The elements include evidence  that the claim was filed within FECA\u2019s statutory time requirements; that  the employee was, at the time of injury, disease, or death, an employee of  the United States; that the employee was injured while on duty; and that  the condition resulted from the work-related injury. If the key elements are  in place, OWCP will approve a claim and begin processing bills for  medical costs. After initial claim approval, additional reviews are done  while a claim remains active to determine whether the claimant can  continue to receive wage-loss compensation. Once a claim is approved,  payments are sent directly to the claimant or provider. An employee can  continue to receive wage-loss compensation for as long as medical  evidence shows that the employee is totally or partially disabled and that  the disability is related to the accepted injury or condition. Specifically, a  medical review is required annually for employees receiving temporary  total-disability payments, every 2 years for claimants earning loss of WEC  payments, and every 3 years for claimants on the periodic rolls who have  been determined to not have any WEC. Employees receiving  compensation for partial or total disability must advise OWCP  immediately if they return to work, either part-time or full-time.", "Claimants are required to self-report all employment wages, whether  salaried or not, and self-employment. OWCP requires that all individuals  on the periodic roll (both partial and total disability) complete Form CA- 1032 on a yearly basis stating their income or whether their dependent  status has changed. A new employer may also be requested to provide  information regarding a claimant\u2019s employment and earnings. Labor can  use this form to adjust the amount of FECA compensation. Employees  must report even those earnings that do not seem likely to affect their  level of benefits, such as concurrent income that an employee was  receiving prior to his or her injury that was not directly related to the  employee\u2019s federal employment. While earning income will not  necessarily result in a reduced compensation, the FECA statute and  implementing regulations stipulate that failure to report income may result  in forfeiture of all benefits paid during the reporting period. To help verify  income levels, Labor requests that FECA claimants provide it with their  consent to access their Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings file;  however, claimants are not required to provide Labor with their consent,  and authorization to obtain such information is not required to receive  compensation. In instances where Labor is authorized to collect  earnings information from SSA by claimants, according to OWCP  officials, SSA\u2019s earnings data may be as much as 2 years old,may hinder timely adjustments to compensation benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FECA and UI Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Established by the Social Security Act of 1935, the federal-state UI  program generally temporarily and partially replaces the lost earnings of  those who become unemployed through no fault of their own.

Whereas federal statutes and  regulations provide broad guidelines on UI eligibility, the specifics of UI  eligibility are determined by each state. According to Labor\u2019s Employment  and Training Agency, all states require that a claimant must have earned  a specified amount of wages, worked a certain number of weeks in  covered employment, or must have met some combination of the wage  and employment requirements within his or her base period.

In addition to being able and available for work, all  states require by law or by practice that a worker be actively seeking work  or making a reasonable effort to obtain work.

Specifically, a CE is required to conduct a medical review annually for  claimants on total disability receiving long-term compensation who are on  the program\u2019s periodic rolls, every 2 years for claimants earning loss of  WEC payments, and every 3 years for claimants who have been  determined to not have any WEC.

The form must be signed to acknowledge evidence of benefit eligibility  and to acknowledge that criminal prosecution may result from deliberate  falsehood.

According to OWCP, a narrative medical report may be more informative  than the OWCP-5c and more helpful in determining a claimant\u2019s ability to  earn wages. The purpose of the OWCP-5c form is to help clarify whether  a claimant is capable of fulfilling his employment duties by identifying a  claimant\u2019s specific work-tolerance limitation, where the accepted condition  is musculoskeletal in nature. Without this form, it can be difficult to  determine whether the claimant is capable of performing the job and  whether employers can readily accommodate the medical condition. For  all 14 cases, the claimant did suffer a musculoskeletal injury.", "Our review identified 2 out of our sample of 32 FECA claimants who did  not have evidence in their FECA file that OWCP reviewed their  employment activity annually, as required.

Moreover, IGs from employing agencies that participate in FECA  have reported that certain policies and procedures did not exist, or when  they did exist, they were not always followed by employing agencies.

These evaluations are to scrutinize processed work, such as  elements relating to fiscal and operational integrity. Accountability Review  findings are to be reviewed by the relevant OWCP program director and  corrective action plans will be developed, as necessary. In addition,  according to OWCP officials, two new Quality Measures have been  implemented in fiscal year 2013 to rate the accuracy of compensation  benefit payments, and whether the factual and medical evidence of  record supports the current level of benefits provided. According to Labor  officials, OWCP plans to start conducting these reviews by the end of  fiscal year 2013. In 2012, we reported that periodic reviews of FECA case  files are a promising practice and can be used to help increase program  officials\u2019 awareness of potential fraudulent activities. Further, these  controls are consistent with the detection and monitoring component of  GAO\u2019s fraud-prevention framework, and could help to validate  claimants\u2019 eligibility including medical conditions and income information.

As a result, claimants could be earning  more money than they were originally determined capable of earning but  never have the WEC adjusted to account for the increase in wage earning  capacity. According to program procedures, OWCP can modify the WEC  if the claimant is earning 25 percent more than the current pay of the job  for which the beneficiary was originally rated. However, to adjust the  WEC, OWCP must demonstrate that customary criteria for modification is  met such as the claimant is rehabilitated or self-rehabilitated, or evidence  shows that the claimant was retrained for a different job. Of the 32 cases  we reviewed, we found five instances where an individual\u2019s WEC was not  adjusted even though the individual earned substantially more (at least 25  percent) than what was originally calculated as their WEC.

States utilize this information to  determine whether the individual is actually \u201cable and available for work.\u201d  As such, all states must require claimants to certify that they are still  meeting all UI eligibility criteria such as changes in employment status.", "Labor is not required to and thus does not report FECA payments to  NDNH, which is a primary mechanism that some states use to verify  employee wage levels, because NDNH was established as a depository  for wage reporting that, among other things, enables state child-support  agencies to be more effective in enforcing child-support orders. Were  Labor to report FECA payments to this database, states would more  easily be able to identify such payments in their review. Our review of a  nongeneralizable sample of 19 individual cases identified nine claimants  who potentially committed fraud or improperly obtained UI benefits  because they did not properly disclose their FECA benefits to the state on  their UI application, which could have potentially reduced or eliminated  the UI benefit amount.", "As previously discussed, limited access to necessary information is a  potential vulnerability. Without information on individuals who are  receiving federal workers\u2019 compensation payments, it is difficult for the  states to identify those individuals and reduce or terminate the UI  payments to them. As a promising practice we previously reported, Labor  provides quarterly data extracts to employing agencies on wage- compensation payments, medical billing payments, and case- management data. Similarly, if OWCP reported FECA compensation data  to the states (either directly or through NDNH), this could help federal and  state agencies coordinate benefits and reduce the risk of overlapping  payments.", "We have previously reported on the importance of interagency  collaborative mechanisms, such as sharing information across  organizational boundaries, to achieve crosscutting program goals.  Further, although not a requirement, the value of greater information  sharing between federal and state entities is demonstrated by the actions  of some states that check the NDNH to determine if an applicant is  working. For example, by cross-matching UI claims against NDNH data,  states can better detect overpayments to UI claimants who have gone  back to work. While our sample of individuals who have received  overlapping FECA and UI benefits cannot be generalized to the entire  population of FECA claimants, we did identify some claimants who  potentially committed fraud or improperly obtained UI benefits because  they did not properly disclose their FECA benefits to the state on their UI  application. Thus, establishing a mechanism to share FECA  compensation information with states to help identify whether claimants  are inappropriately receiving overlapping UI and FECA payments, to the  extent that it is cost-effective, could help provide ETA with greater  assurance that individuals are receiving benefits in accordance with  statute. We discussed this proposal with OWCP program officials in  January 2013 and they agreed that sharing compensation data with the  states may be beneficial, although they stated that they have never been  asked to provide FECA compensation information previously."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With estimated future actuarial liabilities for government-wide FECA  compensation payments at over $34 billion as of fiscal year 2012, and in  an era of scarce government resources, it is vital that Labor ensures  effective stewardship of those resources. FECA and UI provide an  important safety net for workers who have lost their income because of  workplace injuries or unemployment. However, Labor and the states must  continually monitor these claimants to ensure that they continue to be  entitled to these benefits and that the benefits are adjusted to account for  changes in claimants\u2019 wage earnings and for overlapping state UI  payments. While in certain circumstances receiving concurrent UI and  FECA benefits may be allowable, the cases we identified where claimants  received concurrent UI and FECA benefits without Labor\u2019s knowledge  could be an indicator of improper payments. A cost-effective mechanism  to share FECA compensation information with states to help identify  whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping UI and FECA  payments could help determine the extent that improper payments or  potential fraud are occurring, which could help save taxpayer dollars. In  addition, without the authority to access wage data, which both OWCP  and Labor\u2019s OIG have sought, Labor\u2019s reliance on claimants\u2019 self-reported  employment information limits the agency\u2019s ability to identify potential  fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider granting Labor the additional authority it is  seeking to access wage data to help verify claimants\u2019 reported income  and help ensure the proper payment of benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Labor assess the feasibility of  developing a cost-effective mechanism to share FECA compensation  information with states, such as reporting information to NDNH, to help  identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping UI  and FECA payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Labor for comment on February 28,  2013. Labor provided written comments on the draft, which can be found  in appendix I. Labor agreed with the recommendation to assess the  feasibility of developing a cost-effective mechanism to share FECA  compensation information with the states, such as reporting information to  NDNH, to help identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving  overlapping UI and FECA payments.  Labor stated that it will undertake a  review to determine whether such data sharing and reporting is feasible.  However, Labor expressed concerns regarding the cost-effectiveness of  such an approach.  We agree that it will be important for Labor to assess  the cost-effectiveness of such an approach when conducting its review.   As stated in the report, some states check the NDNH database to verify  employee wage levels.  Thus, establishing a mechanism, such as  reporting FECA compensation to NDNH, could provide a cost-effective  way for states to identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving  overlapping UI and FECA payments, and could help provide ETA with  greater assurance that individuals are receiving benefits in accordance  with statute.", "In its response, Labor also stated that since FECA contains no offset for  UI benefits, a claimant may be entitled to receive both FECA and UI  benefits under a particular state law, which would not be classified as  receiving improper payments.  We recognize, as stated in this report, that  there may be certain situations where individuals are entitled to the  concurrent receipt of FECA and UI benefits.  However, it is also important  to note that, as discussed in the report, claimants may not be eligible to  receive both types of payments in some cases.  For example, some  claimants are not able to meet the \u201cable and available\u201d requirement for UI  benefits because their disability, especially for those receiving  compensation for total disability, may render them unable and unavailable  to work. In addition, certain states, such as four of the five selected states  in our review, require the offset of UI benefits against certain workers\u2019  compensation payments, including FECA.  In addition, Labor stated that  one of our examples cited in our report\u2014example 5\u2014should not be  classified as an improper payment because FECA program procedures  allow a claimant to receive wages from two different employers and not  have those wages affect the claimant\u2019s WEC or ability to receive FECA  benefits.  We agree that this is not an improper payment and did not  classify it as such. As stated in the report, claimants are allowed to  receive such income, in some cases substantial income, while also  receiving FECA compensation benefits.", "Labor also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
