Agency estimation and management of unobligated balances in the reviewed accounts involved the following activities:", "Regular review of unobligated balances . Agency officials for all of the eight reviewed accounts reported having a process for managing unobligated balances throughout the year. For example, officials managing NASA's Science account reported that they monitor unobligated balances monthly by considering obligations from the prior months.", "Tracking the appropriation year of unobligated balances . Officials reported that agencies tracked the year of appropriation for the five reviewed accounts that receive multi-year budget authority. This action is important to help ensure that the agency obligates the authority in the order appropriated to maximize resources. All five accounts had balances that expired during fiscal years 2012 through 2014; however, there can be various reasons for an agency to not obligate funds late in the fiscal year, and in some cases, special authority expands the use of certain budget authority. For example, for State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement accounts, State has the authority to use expired funds beyond their initial period of availability for specific purposes and to extend the availability of certain funds.", "Estimating and identifying needed unobligated balances . Officials managing three of the eight reviewed accounts identified a need to retain unobligated balances to sustain agency operations and manage financial risk. For example, officials responsible for managing Energy's Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) Construction, Rehabilitation, Operation and Maintenance (CROM) account said that two of the account's four use categories have a target to carryover equal to or up to 25 percent of funds against unexpected environmental factors that could introduce financial risk to their mission of marketing hydroelectric power. However, in fiscal year 2014, the balance for one category exceeded its target by approximately $40 million. WAPA officials reported that they have drafted a strategy to manage excess balances, but the strategy has not been fully implemented. Similarly, in fiscal year 2014, within State's D&CP account, officials reported exceeding the target to carryover about 25 percent of projected program expenditures for the next year to manage complex global visa and passport operations for the Consular and Border Security Programs (CBSP) by approximately $440 million. State officials said that they have developed a draft strategy for reducing excess unobligated balances. Officials said that they plan to finalize the strategy by June 2016. In the meantime, they reported taking steps to reduce unobligated balances for CBSP. These steps include decreasing fees or delaying fee increases when unobligated balances were adequate to cover costs.", "In accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidance, the selected agencies used unobligated balances in four of the reviewed accounts to mitigate the effects of the 2013 sequestration.

Sequestration\u2014the cancellation of budgetary resources  under a presidential order\u2014required agencies to carefully scrutinize  spending on nonexempt programs, projects, and activities to manage  these budget reductions. The government shutdown in October 2013  required agencies to make multiple, complex decisions about whether  and how to continue funding mission-critical activities. In the months  following sequestration, agencies were faced with reduced budgets and  reduced capacity for carrying out regular activities, which continued after  the shutdown. This resulted in altered priorities and the need to consider  reallocating available funds between and within budget accounts. Both  sequestration and the government shutdown highlighted the importance  of active management of public funds, as well as the importance of using  available resources effectively. In addition, effective management of  unexpended account balances that carryover for use in the next fiscal  year\u2014and especially, unobligated balances\u2014present agencies with an  opportunity to better respond to unexpected events in the future. An  unexpended balance is the sum of obligated and unobligated balances.  An obligated balance is the amount of obligations already incurred for  which payment has not yet been made. This could include obligations  through a contract for which payment may be made as services are  rendered over time or milestones met. An unobligated balance is the  portion of available budget authority that has not yet been obligated. This  could include a balance in a multi-year appropriation or held in a  business-like account to help mitigate the risk of environmental factors  that may affect collections.", "In fiscal year 2014, unexpended balances in federal budget accounts  were about $2.3 trillion, of which about $870 billion had not yet been  obligated. In 2014, we reported that agencies used unobligated balances  to help manage the effects of sequestration and the government  shutdown on their operations and services, and to protect mission-critical  activities by providing funding for the continuation of such activities. In  our September 2013 report on unexpended balances carried forward in  federal budget accounts, we concluded that answering key questions  during a review of unexpended balances would provide insights into why  a balance exists, what size balance is appropriate, and what opportunities  (if any) for savings exist. We also noted that a review of unexpended  balances may provide opportunities for enhanced oversight of agencies\u2019  management of federal funds, and for the identification of areas where  the federal government can improve and maximize its use of resources.  Further, we stressed that, given the complexity of the federal budget, a  case-by-case analysis at either the account or program level is necessary  to better understand opportunities for achieving budgetary savings or  redirecting resources to other priorities.", "You asked us to build on our prior work on unexpended balances by  reviewing how such balances have changed since our 2013 report and by  evaluating how agencies are managing unexpended balances. Our  objective was to evaluate how selected agencies managed and used  unobligated balances in reviewed accounts, focusing on fiscal years 2012  through 2014, which covers the fiscal year 2013 sequestration and fiscal  year 2014 government shutdown. In addition, we analyzed the size and  composition of unexpended balances in the federal budget from fiscal  years 2012 through 2014, and compared those balances to previously  reported balances for fiscal years 2007 through 2012.", "To address this objective, we examined selected agencies\u2019 management  of unobligated balances in reviewed accounts both during fiscal years  2012 through 2014 and the current management of the reviewed  accounts. For this review, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of four  agencies\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce) and  Energy (Energy). To select these four agencies, we first identified all  budget accounts having unobligated balances in fiscal years 2012, 2013,  or 2014 in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) MAX database.  We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our report.  We selected the four agencies based upon whether they had accounts  with significant unobligated balances as well as whether they used or  were planning to use reprogramming of funds, transfers among accounts,  and/or multi-year funding to mitigate the effects of sequestration, as  reported in our previous work on the 2013 sequestration.", "Within the four selected agencies, we identified a nongeneralizable  sample of eight budget accounts. To select the eight accounts, we  reviewed OMB MAX data for every budget account in the four agencies  for fiscal years 2012 through 2014. From these accounts, we selected  eight accounts for in-depth review based on whether the agencies  reprogrammed funds within accounts, transferred funds among accounts,  and/or used multi-year funds to mitigate the effects of the 2013  sequestration. We also selected accounts that had particularly large  unobligated balances or significant changes in unobligated balances  during fiscal years 2012 through 2014. We selected only accounts with  discretionary appropriations and split authority\u2014a combination of  discretionary appropriations and mandatory budget authority\u2014and  excluded mandatory accounts from our review to avoid duplication with  our concurrent review of mandatory accounts. See table 1 for a list of  accounts selected.", "To evaluate how the selected agencies managed and used unobligated  balances in the reviewed accounts, we reviewed agency budget reports  and guidance, congressional budget justifications, congressional  notifications, and financial and annual reports. We interviewed agency  officials at the department (or agency), the bureau, and account levels  about account management policy and practice with regards to  unobligated balances, using analysis from our prior work (described in  detail below) as criteria.", "We conducted our review from December 2014 to October 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

An  obligation is a definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the  government for the payment of goods and services, or a legal duty that  could mature into a legal liability by virtue of actions that are beyond the  control of the United States. Based on the authority provided in  legislation, agencies obligate and expend funds. For example, an  agency incurs an obligation when it places an order, signs a contract,  awards a grant, or purchases a service. Expenditures or outlays occur  when funds that have been obligated are transferred for payment. See  figure 1 for an overview of this process.", "One of the limits set by appropriations acts is the period of availability of  budget authority: periods of availability include one-year, multi-year, and  no-year. Although federal funding may be available to obligate for one  year, multiple years, or until expended (no-year), only accounts with multi- year or no-year funds may carry forward amounts that remain legally  available for new obligations from one fiscal year to the next. Such  amounts are referred to as unobligated balances. Agencies may also  carry forward obligated balances. As shown in figure 1 and previously  described, obligated balances are the amount of obligations already  incurred for which payment has not yet been made while an unobligated  balance is the portion of available budget authority that has not yet been  obligated. If the agency does not obligate one-year or multi-year funds  by the end of the period of availability, the budget authority will expire.  The agency may not incur new obligations using expired budget authority,  unless otherwise provided by law. The sum of unobligated and obligated  balances is referred to as unexpended balances.", "Federal spending is categorized as discretionary or mandatory. This  distinction refers to the way budget authority is provided. Discretionary  spending is controlled through annual appropriations acts (plus, in some  cases, supplemental appropriations acts). In contrast, mandatory  spending accounts, which include \u201centitlement authority,\u201d receive budget  authority through laws other than appropriations acts. This distinction  affects the management of unobligated balances because mandatory  funding may require programmatic changes to authorizing legislation to  affect unobligated balances, while discretionary accounts are controlled  through the annual appropriation process.", "In 2013, we reported that reviewing unexpended balances\u2014and in  particular, unobligated balances\u2014may provide an opportunity to identify  potential budgetary savings and direct those resources towards other  programs or priorities. We identified four key questions that agencies  and decision makers should answer during a review of unexpended  balances, and used those questions for this review to evaluate  unobligated balances at selected agencies. These questions can provide  insights into why a balance exists, what size balance is appropriate, and  what opportunities (if any) for savings exist (see text box).", "Unobligated balances can provide agencies with flexibility when  responding to unexpected budget events. For example, agencies faced  with reduced budget authority\u2014such as during a sequestration\u2014or with a  lapse in annual appropriations may choose to use unobligated balances  from prior year appropriations that remain available for new obligations to  ensure continuity of agency activities. In 2014, we reported that  unobligated balances that remain legally available from prior year  appropriations could provide agencies with funding flexibility to respond to  sequestration. Similarly, in September 2013, OMB issued guidance to  agencies that said unobligated balances could be used to fund activities  during the government shutdown.", "Sequestration. On March 1, 2013 the President ordered a sequestration  of $85.3 billion across federal government accounts. Final  appropriations enacted on March 26, 2013 had the effect of reducing this  amount to $80.5 billion. The reductions were to be split evenly between  defense and nondefense functions. Under current law, a sequestration of  mandatory spending will occur through fiscal year 2024, and another  sequestration of discretionary appropriations could occur in any fiscal  year through 2021. The fiscal year 2013 sequestration reduced funding  to selected components of federal agencies and their program partners\u2014 such as state and local governments\u2014that assist in carrying out agency  missions. As a result, the selected components and their partners  reduced or delayed some services to the public and operations in 2013.  As we found in March 2014, agencies reported that sequestration  reduced assistance for education, housing, and nutrition, as well as  health and science research and development grants. We also found  that agencies delayed investments such as information technology and  facilities projects.", "In 2013, both mandatory spending and discretionary appropriations were  subject to sequestration. In accounts with budgetary resources classified  as defense spending, prior year unobligated balances were also subject  to sequestration. Prior year unobligated balances in nondefense accounts  were exempt. This means that only prior year balances for some  agencies\u2019 accounts were affected by sequestration, while others were not.  Figure 2 shows the breakdown of unobligated balances by different types  of accounts and how these different balances were treated under  sequestration in fiscal year 2013.", "In fiscal year 2013, agencies had the ability to reprogram funds and had  various transfer authorities to respond to sequestration. Reprogramming  is the shifting of funds from one program activity to another within an  appropriation account for purposes other than those contemplated at the  time of appropriation. Generally, no statutory authority is necessary for  agencies to reprogram funds, but in some instances the ability to  reprogram funds may be limited by law for certain purposes or amounts.  A transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriation accounts.  Agencies must have statutory authority to transfer funds, and that  authority may also be limited by purpose or amount.", "Government Shutdown. The federal government partially shut down for  16 days in October 2013 because of a lapse in appropriations. According  to OMB, about 850,000 federal employees were furloughed for part of this  time, and agencies furloughed federal employees for a combined 6.6  million work days. Over the past 20 years, there have occasionally been  federal lapses in appropriations that led to government shutdowns.", "During a government shutdown, one of the key issues OMB and agencies  must determine is what activities and programs an agency is permitted or  required to continue when faced with a funding gap. The Antideficiency  Act generally restricts agencies from continuing operations funded by  annual appropriations during a government shutdown. However, there  are some categories of activities that are permitted to continue during an  appropriations lapse.

According to EDA officials,  funding in this account that is appropriated for specific disaster relief programs cannot  be spent for other activities. A delay in assistance applications for EDA\u2019s grants could  result in unobligated balances for those program funds. For example, EDA officials  attributed the majority of the $185 million unobligated balance at the end of fiscal year  2012 to the additional $200 million appropriated by Congress in fiscal year 2012 to fund  disaster relief efforts in areas with major disaster designations in 2011, which included  areas affected by Hurricane Irene. According to officials, communities eligible to apply  for this relief were focused on short-term recovery in 2012 and were not in a position to  apply for EDAP funds until long-term recovery plans were in place, generally after the  end of fiscal year 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "paragraphs": ["The sources and fiscal characteristics of the funding influence what  opportunities may exist for budgetary savings. Sources of funding include  appropriations acts (i.e. discretionary spending) and laws other than  appropriations acts (i.e. mandatory spending). Budget accounts can have  both discretionary and mandatory amounts: these are known as split  accounts. Discretionary and mandatory budget authority presents  different issues for Congress in its oversight of the size of any balance.  Specifically, if amounts are mandatory, Congress must make  programmatic changes to authorizing legislation in order to begin to affect  the size of any unobligated balance. Fiscal characteristics include the  period of availability for new obligations and are also important to  evaluating unobligated balances. If an account receives multi-year or no- year appropriations, an unobligated balance can be expected in some  accounts or programs.

Officials said that all expired fiscal year 2014  funds ($369 million) were transferred to the two-year portion of the  account because the $369 million fell within the 15 percent limit.", "For the INCLE account, State has the authority to extend the availability  of certain balances that would have otherwise expired after 2 years.  When funds are obligated during their initial period of availability, those  funds remain available to incur new obligations for an additional 4 years  from the date on which the availability of such funds would have  otherwise expired. To enter into new obligations during this extended  period of availability, State officials must deobligate previously obligated  funds. State reported that deobligated amounts are moved from an  expired account into what officials call an \u201cextended account\u201d and are  available to be reobligated. State officials said that expired funds reflected  in the President\u2019s budget may actually be in a holding status awaiting  coordination, including coordination with Congress. However, State\u2019s  Office of the Inspector General (OIG) also identified issues with the  process of tracking obligations within the INCLE account. State\u2019s OIG  recommended that the agency should develop a list of bureaus\u2019  requirements related to tracking and reporting foreign assistance funds by  program, project, and country, among other things, and develop and  implement a comprehensive plan with target completion dates to address  foreign assistance tracking and reporting requirements. State agreed  and initiated a working group to address the recommendation.", "No-year Funds. In accounts with no-year funds, agencies may choose to  track the year in which such funds were appropriated, but such funds do  not expire. Officials managing the three reviewed accounts at Energy\u2014 DEC, EERE, and WAPA CROM\u2014each reported tracking no-year funds  by the year of appropriation. In contrast, officials from the other three  reviewed accounts with no-year funds reported that they did not do this.  For example, at Commerce, officials managing EDA\u2019s EDAP account  reported that the agency does not track the appropriation year of the  unobligated balances. Officials managing the EDAP account said they  track the funds by program, such as Economic Adjustment Assistance or  Public Works, but do not track funds by year because these are no-year  funds. When a grant funded from the account is completed, officials said  any remaining funds tied to that grant are deobligated, and may be used  to fund a new grant that would qualify under the parameters of the original  activity or subprogram."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Agencies Identified a Need to Retain Unobligated Balances in Three of the Reviewed Accounts, but Unobligated Balances Exceeded Target Levels in Two of These Accounts", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, both the necessity for and appropriate  size of minimum unobligated balances varies among agencies and within  agencies. It is important for agencies to estimate the projected  unobligated balances for the fiscal year and identify the amount of the  balances, if any, which may be necessary to carryover into the following  year to sustain agency operations. For five of our reviewed accounts\u2014 Energy\u2019s DEC and EERE, Commerce\u2019s EDAP, State\u2019s INCLE, and  NASA\u2019s Science\u2014agency officials said a minimum level or consistent  target of unobligated funds was not necessary to maintain operations  across fiscal years. For example, Energy officials managing the DEC  account told us that a minimum level of unobligated funds was not  necessary for their operations and that their goal is to obligate all of their  funds in the first year. Energy officials reported they obligate more than  99 percent of DEC funds, on average, within the first year of  appropriations. Similarly, officials managing the INCLE account said they  would obligate all funds in the first year if possible. However, planning  and reporting requirements often delay obligations leading to significant  unobligated balances each year.", "We have previously reported that unobligated balances in some instances  support an agency\u2019s ability to carry out its mission by providing flexibility  for the agency to respond to contingencies or emergencies. In three of  the eight accounts we reviewed\u2014USPTO\u2019s S&E, State\u2019s D&CP, and  Energy\u2019s WAPA CROM\u2014officials reported that a certain level of  unobligated balances was necessary to properly execute activities and  manage financial risk for certain programs within the accounts.", "In our prior work, USPTO officials reported that maintaining an  operating reserve is important for the user fee funded agency  because, without an unobligated balance, its businesslike operations  would leave the agency vulnerable to financial risk and threaten long- term operational stability. All unobligated balances within USPTO\u2019s  S&E account are considered part of this operating reserve. In  response to our 2012 recommendation, USPTO drafted and, as of  September 25, 2015, has finalized a policy to guide its management  of this operating reserve. The policy describes a method for  determining an acceptable minimum size for the operating reserve as  well as a model for determining its optimal size. This model takes into  account the likelihood and consequence of seven different spending  and fee collection risk factors such as economic uncertainty and  climate, unexpected costs, and fee and workload projection  uncertainties. Depending on the levels of risk and consequence, the  model calls for maintaining, in addition to the established minimum  reserve requirement, between 0- and 4-months of operating expenses  in its reserve.", "Additionally, for the Consular and Border Security Programs (CBSP)  within the D&CP account, State officials said they have a target to  carryover approximately 25 percent of projected program  expenditures for the next year to manage complex global visa and  passport operations. CBSP is fully fee funded, which means that all  appropriations for the program are offsetting collections from consular  fees and surcharges. These fees and surcharges include the Passport  Security Surcharge, the Diversity Visa Lottery fee, and the Machine  Readable Visa fee. Congress has permanently appropriated these  collections to State as no-year authority for CBSP\u2019s use. State set this  target of 25 percent based on activity-specific analysis using historical  data and projections. However, officials did not report using models or  formulas to help anticipate how certain factors would impact the  financial risk of the account. Our previous work has found that  unobligated balances in fee-based accounts should be subject to the  same scrutiny as unobligated balances in accounts funded by general  revenues. Based on our findings from this review, we continue to  believe that agencies need to understand the vulnerabilities of user  fees and to be deliberate in their design of a reserve fund to  effectively manage them.", "Specifically, we found that in fiscal year 2014 unobligated balances for  CBSP accounted for 38 percent, or approximately $1.3 billion, of  projected program expenditures for fiscal year 2015 for the program.  This exceeded the 25 percent target of approximately $850 million by  approximately $440 million. Similarly, in fiscal years 2012 and 2013,  unobligated balances for CBSP accounted for approximately 40  percent of program expenditures for the next fiscal year. State officials  reported that unobligated balances were higher than the  predetermined target, in part, because of limitations on the purposes  for which fees collected under CBSP may be used. In particular, fees  collected for fraud prevention and detection on certain types of visas  can only be spent on specific fraud activities. State officials reported  that annual revenue from this fee is usually higher than the cost of  these activities, resulting in an annual increase in unobligated  balances. However, this limitation on how fees can be spent accounts  for only a small proportion of the excess unobligated balances  (approximately $97 million of the total excess unobligated balance of  $440 million in fiscal year 2014).", "State officials within the Bureau of Consular Affairs said that they  began drafting a plan in 2013 for managing and monitoring funding for  each program within CBSP. According to officials, this plan will  include a strategy on how unobligated balances will be tracked and  managed to reach the identified target of 25 percent. Officials said  that the plan is awaiting clearance by leadership and they anticipate  that it will be finalized by June 2016. While unobligated balances for  CBSP were greater than the 25 percent target in recent years, State  officials reported that they have taken steps to regulate and reduce  unobligated balances. According to officials, these steps included  decreasing fees or delaying fee increases when unobligated balances  were adequate to cover costs; realigning spending, consistent with  authorities, to better coincide with actual costs; and improving internal  coordination to better track and model revenues and obligations. For  example, officials reported that since fiscal year 2012, the cost of the  Passport Security Surcharge service was higher than the $40 fee  charged. In 2015, State announced that it intended to raise the fee to  $60. Officials said that this delay of the fee increase allowed them to  spend down existing unobligated balances. According to data  provided by State, unobligated balances for the Passport Security  Surcharge decreased from 95 percent of next year\u2019s program  expenditures in fiscal year 2012, to 72 percent in fiscal year 2014.", "Similarly, the unobligated balances in WAPA\u2019s CROM account  exceeded the level officials said was necessary to maintain certain  activities and manage risk for those activities. Specifically, officials  said that for two of the account\u2019s four use categories\u2014the annual  expense fund, and purchase power and wheeling\u2014they set a target  level of unobligated balances as contingency funds against  unexpected events. For the annual expense fund, officials set a target  to retain up to one quarter, or 25 percent, of the yearly budget  requirement. For purchase power and wheeling, the target was equal  to 25 percent of each region\u2019s maximum annual receipts. WAPA  officials explained that WAPA\u2019s mission to market hydroelectric power  to multiple regions across the western United States can be affected  by a number of environmental factors such as drought, animal  breeding seasons, and flood prevention\u2014all of which may affect the  function of power generating dams and introduce financial risk. WAPA  officials reported addressing these environmental factors and potential  financial risks by carrying over unobligated funds. WAPA officials told  us that while a carryover of up to or equal to 25 percent in unobligated  balances is the current target for these two use categories, they are  continuing to refine and evaluate the necessary level of unobligated  balances. These officials added that they do not have a model or  formula to estimate anticipated environmental factors, and how those  factors would have a fiscal impact on the agency.", "For fiscal year 2014, unobligated balances for purchase power and  wheeling fell below the 25 percent target. However, for the annual  expense fund, unobligated balances were above this previously  identified target. For the annual expense fund, officials estimated that  the 25 percent target for the unobligated balance would be about $52  million for fiscal year 2014. The unobligated balance, however, for the  annual expense fund was $92 million, or $40 million more than  officials deemed necessary to avoid risk. According to WAPA officials,  the annual expense fund\u2019s unobligated balance for fiscal year 2014  was higher than the predetermined target partially because they  forecasted a 3 percent cost of living increase for personnel, which  never occurred. WAPA officials reported that they developed a  strategy in fiscal year 2013 for managing unobligated balances in the  annual expense fund within the CROM account. According to officials,  the draft strategy includes three alternatives for reducing unobligated  balances in the annual expense fund, including one to decrease future  budget requests and rely on existing unobligated balances to cover  expenses. Officials said that this alternative was approved by WAPA  senior management. However, officials acknowledged that this  strategy would not be fully implemented until officials assess the  outcomes of the strategy at the end of 2015. WAPA officials also  reported that they are considering other strategies for reducing  unobligated balances to required targets. As of October 2015, WAPA  had not finalized or fully implemented a strategy to reduce unobligated  balances.", "Without a finalized and fully implemented strategy for reducing  unobligated balances in excess of the agencies\u2019 predetermined targets for  necessary balances for the identified programs or activities in these two  accounts, Energy and State are missing opportunities to actively manage  unobligated balances. Thus, they should consider whether actions such  as reprogramming or transferring unobligated balances, reevaluating the  necessary threshold of unobligated balances, or reducing funding  requests in future appropriations for these accounts are appropriate  courses of action for using their resources effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials Said Unobligated Balances May Result from, or Be Affected by, Events outside an Agency\u2019s Control", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that the nature of some accounts may  routinely cause unobligated balances that result from events outside of an  agency\u2019s control. Spending in some accounts may require processes to  be completed by state, local, or private entities that receive funds from  federal agencies. If these processes are not completed in a time frame  necessary to obligate the funds in the current fiscal year, funds may  remain unobligated at the end of the fiscal year and be carried over.  These events are separate from the active estimation of the necessary  size of unobligated balances described above. Nevertheless, as we have  previously noted, it is important for agencies to understand how these  events may influence the level of their balances.", "For example, in EDA\u2019s EDAP account, officials said that many of their  programs are driven from the bottom up in that funding cannot be  obligated until potential recipients apply for grants. Specifically, EDA  officials told us that unobligated balances for the Reshoring program have  been carried over for 3 years while the program waits to receive  applications from eligible public and private non-profit organizations. The  Reshoring program, a subprogram under EDA\u2019s Economic Adjustment  Assistance program, provides aid to businesses bringing jobs from  overseas to the U.S. It received approximately $5 million each year for  fiscal years 2013 and 2014. However, funds cannot be obligated until  eligible recipients take actions outlined in programmatic rules and  regulations and these funds were carried over as unobligated balances.", "As we have previously reported, for agencies that rely on user fees for  funding, economic factors may impact the amount of fees collected and  contribute to unobligated balances. For example, officials at USPTO  said that an economic downturn can decrease USPTO\u2019s collected fees.  This would create an imbalance with planned spending, and lead to a  decrease in its operating reserve of unobligated balances.", "Continuing resolution (CR): an  appropriation act that provides budget  authority for federal agencies, specific  activities, or both to continue operation when  Congress and the President have not  completed action on the regular  appropriations acts by the beginning of the  fiscal year. A CR may be enacted for a full  year, up to a specified date, or until regular  appropriations are enacted. CRs have been  passed in all fiscal years since 1997, the most  recent fiscal year that all regular  appropriations bills were completed on time.  During this time, CRs funded an average of 5  months each fiscal year.", "Uncertain budget environments can also affect the level of unobligated  balances. As we reported in March 2013, under a continuing resolution  (CR) agencies may have difficulty making long-term decisions due to  uncertainty about, both, when they will receive their final appropriation,  and what level of funding ultimately will be available. Agencies are  directed to operate at a conservative rate of spending while CRs are in  effect, thus compressing the time period to obligate funds once final  appropriations decisions are made. State officials managing the D&CP  account said that they will limit the obligation of funds until full-year  appropriations are made. Officials said that higher obligation rates occur  in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year as the agency obligates  money for procurement purposes. On the other hand, obligations for  salaries and personnel expenses remain relatively consistent across  quarters. Depending on a number of factors, including the timing of  appropriations for the rest of the year, agencies may not be able to  obligate funds before the end of the fiscal year and so will carryover  unobligated funds. For example, although Energy has a goal for its EERE  account to obligate all funds in the first year of appropriations, in fiscal  year 2014 it carried over unobligated balances of $408 million. Energy  officials said that the majority of the unobligated balance resulted from  delays in issuing funding opportunity announcements associated with  EERE\u2019s research and development programs in the areas of solar  energy, bioenergy, advanced manufacturing, and water power. Officials  said that they delayed the issuance of funding announcements during the  3-month continuing resolution of fiscal year 2014 following the  government shutdown."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Four of Eight Reviewed Accounts Used Unobligated Balances to Mitigate the Effects of Sequestration in Fiscal Year 2013", "paragraphs": ["According to guidance for the fiscal year 2013 sequestration, OMB  recommended early budget planning to minimize the impact on essential  activities tied to an agency\u2019s mission.

Reductions based on sequestration resulted in lower than needed  funds for construction projects related to WAPA\u2019s delivery of cost- based federal hydroelectric power and related services across the  western United States.

These activities  included personnel salaries and benefits, facility operating and  maintenance costs, travel, and other operational requirements.

In addition, we analyzed the size and  composition of unexpended balances in the federal budget from fiscal  years 2012 through 2014, and compared those balances to previously  reported balances for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. To address this  objective, we examined selected agencies\u2019 management of unobligated  balances in reviewed accounts both during fiscal years 2012 through  2014, and the current management of the reviewed accounts. We  focused on unobligated balances because our prior work has shown that  agencies used unobligated balances to offset reductions from the 2013  sequestration and the government shutdown. For this review, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of four agencies\u2014the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Departments of  State (State), Commerce (Commerce) and Energy (Energy). To select  these four agencies, we identified all budget accounts having unobligated  balances in fiscal years 2012, 2013, or 2014 in the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) MAX database.

From these accounts, we selected eight  accounts for in-depth review based on whether the agencies  reprogrammed funds within accounts, transferred funds among accounts,  and/or used multi-year funds to mitigate the effects of the 2013  sequestration. We also selected accounts that had particularly large  unobligated balances or significant changes in unobligated balances  during fiscal years 2012 through 2014. We selected only accounts with  discretionary appropriations and split authority\u2014a combination of  discretionary appropriations and mandatory budget authority\u2014and  excluded mandatory accounts from our review to avoid duplication with  our ongoing review of mandatory accounts.

We interviewed agency officials at the department (or  agency), the bureau, and the account levels about account management  policy and practice, especially with regard to unobligated balances, using  the four key questions from our prior work as criteria. To analyze agency  budget data from fiscal years 2012 through 2014, we asked agency  officials to explain the size of the balances, any balance changes, how  and whether balances were used to mitigate the effects of the 2013  sequestration and the government shutdown, discuss any expired funds,  and whether any transfers or reprogramming occurred during this time.  We discussed with agencies the four key questions described earlier from  our prior work, including the mission and goals of programs supporting  the accounts, sources and fiscal characteristics of the funding, factors  that affect the size and composition of unobligated balances, and agency  estimation and management of balances.", "To describe unexpended balances\u2014including unobligated balances\u2014in  appendix III, we analyzed data on government-wide unexpended  balances across all federal budget accounts for fiscal years 2007 through  2014.
