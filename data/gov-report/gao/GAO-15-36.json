To comply with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), in fiscal year 2011, DOE directed its programs to develop risk assessments using eight qualitative risk factors, such as recent major changes in program funding, and report quantitative information on improper payments. GAO found that 26 of 55 programs did not prepare risk assessments in 2011 and that the quantitative information reported, including the estimated amount of improper payments, was not reliable because, for example, it did not include information for all programs. In reviewing DOE's 2011 risk assessments, GAO also found the following:", "DOE did not always include a clear basis for risk determinations . At least 6 of the 29 programs that prepared risk assessments did not take into account the eight qualitative risk factors, making the basis of their risk determinations unclear. At most, the assessments for 23 programs took into account the risk factors. However, support for their determinations varied widely, and some did not contain enough information to identify how the program arrived at its risk determination, which is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control. DOE's guidance directs personnel to prepare a risk assessment that considers these eight factors but does not provide further direction on what to include. Absent such direction, DOE personnel may not have a consistent understanding of how to complete their risk assessments.", "DOE did not fully evaluate other relevant risk factors . DOE's risk assessments did not fully evaluate other relevant risk factors, such as weaknesses in key controls for preventing and detecting improper payments\u2014including inadequate subcontractor oversight. GAO found that some risk assessments included information from internal control evaluations, but many did not. DOE guidance does not instruct personnel to consider weaknesses in key controls for preventing and detecting improper payments. Without providing specific examples of other relevant risk factors in guidance and directing personnel to consider them when performing risk assessments, DOE will not have reasonable assurance that each of its programs fully evaluates risks.", "Based on its 2011 assessments, DOE was not required under IPERA to prepare risk assessments or report on the amount of improper payments in 2012 and 2013.

The  federal government reported a total of $106 billion in estimated improper  payments in fiscal year 2013 alone. To try to address this problem, the  Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended by the  Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA),  requires, among other things, that federal agencies review their programs  and identify those that are susceptible to significant improper payments\u2014 a process known as a risk assessment. Specifically, IPERA required  agencies to conduct risk assessments for all federal programs and  activities in fiscal year 2011 and at least once every 3 years thereafter for  programs and activities deemed not risk susceptible. Under IPERA,  improper payments are considered \u201csignificant\u201d if they exceed both 1.5  percent of program payments and $10 million, or if the payments exceed  $100 million regardless of the percentage of program payments.", "Much of our reporting on improper payments over the past decade has  focused on large programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or other  programs and activities that involve a significant volume of payments  made to a number of individuals. We have reviewed programs where  payment eligibility decisions were made by entities other than the federal  government, such as state or local governments. We have also reported  on improper payment challenges at federal agencies such as the  Department of Defense that rely on contractors to accomplish their  missions and, consequently, contract annually for hundreds of billions of  dollars in goods and services.", "As the largest contracting agency in the federal government outside of the  Department of Defense, the Department of Energy (DOE) relies primarily  on contractors to carry out its diverse missions and operate its  laboratories and other facilities, spending approximately 90 percent of its  annual budget on contracts and large capital asset projects. DOE\u2019s  history of inadequate management and oversight of its contractors led us  in 1990 to designate DOE\u2019s contract management, including both contract  administration and project management, as a high-risk area vulnerable to  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In January 2009, to recognize progress made at DOE\u2019s Office of Science, we narrowed the  focus of the department\u2019s high-risk designation to two DOE program  elements\u2014the National Nuclear Security Administration and Office of  Environmental Management. In fiscal year 2011, DOE reported in its  Agency Financial Report that it did not have any programs susceptible to  significant improper payments and that it has maintained an overall  improper payments rate of less than 1 percent. Because DOE reported  that it did not have any programs susceptible to significant improper  payments in 2011, the department was not required under IPERA to  prepare risk assessments in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. For those years,  DOE again reported that it did not have any programs susceptible to  significant improper payments and that it maintained an overall improper  payment rate of less than 1 percent.", "In this context, you requested that we review DOE\u2019s internal control  environment, as it relates to IPERA, to determine whether the department  was at low risk for significant improper payments.

We reviewed DOE documents and met with DOE officials to  determine how DOE organized its programs for the purposes of IPERA  compliance over the 3-year period. For all risk assessments prepared for  each DOE program, we analyzed the documentation and supporting  analyses, as well as reports of actual improper payments DOE indentified  through the normal course of business, for fiscal years 2011 through  2013. We reviewed each risk assessment to determine its adherence to  DOE\u2019s IPERA guidance and whether it provided a basis for the risk  determination, among other things. We interviewed DOE headquarters  officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) regarding  their roles in reviewing risk assessments and providing guidance on  preparing risk assessments. We also interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s  Office of the Inspector General (IG) regarding their roles in reporting on  DOE\u2019s IPERA implementation and overseeing DOE\u2019s strategy for  ensuring that contract audits are performed.

At these sites,  we obtained perspectives from over 70 DOE and contractor officials  involved with IPERA reporting, including those that had prepared or  reviewed improper payment risk assessments. We also discussed the  guidance and direction provided by DOE to payment sites in  implementing IPERA, as well as consistency across DOE payment sites  in preparing risk assessments.

With a DOE workforce of about 15,000 employees and in  excess of 100,000 contractor staff, the department relies primarily on its  contractors to manage and operate its sites and accomplish its missions.

DOE\u2019s M&O  contracts, among other things, provide contractors with the authority to  draw money directly from DOE-funded accounts to pay for contract  performance. In contrast, for the less common non-M&O contracts,  DOE relies on more traditional bill payment methods\u2014which include  receipt of an invoice, payment approval and authorization, and  disbursement of funds. In addition to conducting work through its  contractors, DOE manages a number of grant and loan programs\u2014which  accounted for about $2.4 billion of DOE spending in fiscal year 2013.

The choice of contract type  is a principal means for agencies to divide the risk of cost overruns  between the government and the contractor. For example, under a firm- fixed-price contract, the contractor assumes most of the cost risk; by  accepting responsibility for completing a specified amount of work for a  fixed price, the contractor earns a profit if the total costs it incurs in  performing the contract are less than the contract price, but loses money  if its total costs exceed the contract price. Under a time-and-materials  contract, by contrast, the government bears the risk of cost overruns  because payment is based on the number of labor hours billed at a fixed  hourly rate that includes wages, overhead, general administrative costs,  profit, and the costs of materials if applicable. However, time-and- materials contracts include a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at  its own risk, meaning there is no guarantee that costs above the ceiling  price will be reimbursed by the government.", "Under cost-reimbursement types of contracts, the government assumes  the cost risk because it pays the contractor\u2019s allowable costs incurred, to  the extent prescribed by the contract, although these contracts also  establish a ceiling that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. In fiscal  year 2013, about 90 percent, or $21.7 billion, of DOE\u2019s total contract  spending was on cost-reimbursement type contracts that include  contractor fees, according to DOE officials. This includes cost-plus-fixed- fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-award-fee contracts. Under  these types of contracts, the federal agency reimburses a contractor for  all allowable costs and also pays a fee that is either fixed at the outset of  the contract or adjustable based on objective or subjective performance  criteria set out in the contract. Cost-reimbursement types of contracts  place the primary risk of cost overruns on the government because of the  potential for the government to pay more than the contract\u2019s estimated  cost and because the government must reimburse the contractor\u2019s costs  of performance up to the contract cost ceiling regardless of whether the  end item or service is completed. In a September 2009 report, we  concluded that cost-reimbursement types of contracts are suitable only  when the agency\u2019s requirements cannot be defined sufficiently or the cost  of the work cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to allow for the  use of any type of fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement type  contracts allow the agency to contract for work that might otherwise  present too great a risk to contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The choice of a contract type\u2014and whether the contract is an M&O  contract or not\u2014will also affect the types of internal control and contract  auditing activities needed to help protect the government\u2019s interests and  reduce the risk of improper payments. Under federal standards for  internal control, control activities are an integral part of an entity\u2019s  planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for stewardship of  government resources and achieving effective results. Control activities  include both preventive and detective controls. Preventive controls\u2014such  as invoice review prior to payment\u2014are controls designed to prevent  improper payments (errors and fraud), waste, and mismanagement.  Detective controls\u2014such as incurred cost audits\u2014are designed to identify  errors or improper payments after the payment is made. Incurred cost  audits are intended to examine contractors\u2019 cost representations and  reach an opinion on whether the costs are allowable, allocable to  government contracts, and reasonable in accordance with the contract  and applicable government acquisition regulations.

The contracting cycle consists of activities throughout the  acquisition process, including preaward, award, and contract  administration and management. Prior to contract award, an agency  generally identifies a need and develops a requirements package. Under  the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the agency generally determines the  method of acquisition; solicits and evaluates bids or proposals;  determines the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s accounting system; and  ultimately negotiates a price and contract terms, resulting in the contract  award. After contract award, the Federal Acquisition Regulation generally  requires the agency to perform activities related to contract administration  and management, which involves monitoring the contractor\u2019s  performance, as well as reviewing and approving (or disapproving) the  contractor\u2019s requests for payments.", "Contract auditing assists in achieving prudent contracting by providing  those responsible for government procurement with financial information  and advice relating to contractual matters and the effectiveness,  efficiency, and economy of contractors\u2019 operations. Depending on the  contract type, various contract audit activities can occur in the preaward,  award, and administration and management phases of a contract. For  example, before awarding a cost-reimbursement or other non-fixed-price  type contract, the Federal Acquisition Regulation requires agency  contracting officers to determine the adequacy of a contractor\u2019s  accounting system. After certain types of contracts are awarded, contract  audits\u2014including incurred cost audits\u2014are intended to be a key control to  help ensure that contractors are charging the government in accordance  with applicable laws, regulations, and contract terms. At DOE, the  requirements and responsibility for conducting contract and other audits\u2014 including incurred cost audits and audits of subcontractor costs\u2014vary,  depending on whether the contract is an M&O or a non-M&O type  contract, as follows:", "M&O contracts. In its M&O contracts, DOE does not require  contractors to submit invoices; instead, the agency provides  contractors with the authority to draw funds directly from federal  accounts to pay for contract performance. Therefore, DOE does not  rely on traditional invoice reviews prior to payment as a means of  helping prevent improper payments. Instead, DOE relies on a  combination of audits of contractor accounting systems and certain  detective controls. Specifically, using a process known as the  Cooperative Audit Strategy, DOE relies on its M&O contractors to  perform the audit work necessary to ensure that their accounting  systems are adequate and that they are charging DOE for only those  costs that are allowable under the contract. As part of DOE\u2019s  Cooperative Audit Strategy, M&O contractors are required to maintain  an internal audit organization that is responsible for performing  operational and financial audits, including incurred cost audits, and  assessing the adequacy of management control systems.addition, M&O contractors are required to provide adequate audit  coverage of subcontractors where costs incurred are a factor in   In  determining the amount payable.to submit an annual Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed that  includes the contractor\u2019s certification that the costs claimed represent  allowable contract costs. To support this statement, the contractors\u2019  internal audit organization conducts an annual incurred cost audit.  Among other things, in conducting the annual incurred cost audit, the  internal auditors are expected to develop a sampling methodology  that will allow them to test selected transactions to determine whether  the associated costs are allowable under the contracts\u2019 terms and to  make projections regarding the total amount of unallowable costs  based on the testing results. According to DOE\u2019s Financial  Management Handbook, under the Cooperative Audit Strategy,  DOE\u2019s IG is required to annually perform an assessment of these  statements for the 10 M&O contractors who incurred and claimed the  most costs annually. For the remaining M&O Statements of Costs  Incurred and Claimed, the IG is required to perform assessments on a  rotational basis, meaning the IG reviews a few each year until it  completes all of the remaining ones and then starts over again. DOE  officials cite the Cooperative Audit Strategy as a key internal control.", "M&O contractors are also required", "Non-M&O contracts. Non-M&O contractors do not fall under DOE\u2019s  Cooperative Audit Strategy and therefore are not required to submit  an annual Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed, maintain an  internal audit organization, or provide audit coverage of subcontracts.  Instead, DOE relies on traditional bill payment methods, which include  prepayment review of invoices, for its non-M&O contracts. DOE also  relies on contract audits\u2014including incurred cost audits\u2014for detecting  improper payments. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) has  traditionally been the primary auditor for non-M&O contracts\u2014 performing preaward and annual incurred cost audits to ensure that  non-M&O contractor costs are allowable under the contract.

However, 26 sites did not  prepare and submit risk assessments as required (i.e.,10 non-M&O  contractor payment sites, 11 DOE field office sites, and 5 M&O contractor  sites).", "DOE officials said the 10 non-M&O payment sites did not prepare risk  assessments for fiscal year 2011 because they were covered as part of  the risk assessments conducted by the cognizant DOE field office that  year. In reviewing risk assessments, we found that 3 of the 10 non-M&O  payment sites were discussed in the assessment by a cognizant DOE  field office site\u2014the Richland Office. However, the discussion of the non- M&O sites did not constitute a risk assessment for those sites because  the Richland Office only made limited mention of the internal controls  used by these 3 non-M&O sites, rather than a more robust assessment of  the risk factors. Moreover, we found no evidence that the remaining 7  non-M&O sites were assessed by the cognizant field office site\u2014in part,  because many of the other cognizant field office sites did not prepare risk  assessments in 2011. DOE officials told us that the Oak Ridge Office,  which prepared a risk assessment in 2011, was the cognizant DOE field  office that covered the risk assessments for some of the non-M&O  contracts. However, we found that its risk assessment did not address the  eight risk factors as they relate to the specific payment processes and   For example, at the time of  controls at the non-M&O contractor sites.the fiscal year 2011 reporting, the Oak Ridge payment site oversaw USA  Repository Services LLC, a non-M&O payment site, but the Oak Ridge  risk assessment does not mention the contractor or discuss any of the  processes and controls specific to that contractor. Assessing risk at the  non-M&O contractors is important because many of the prepayment  review processes and controls that impact the risk associated with  making an improper payment reside at the non-M&O contractor site. For  example, upon receipt of an invoice, DOE officials at the non-M&O site  are responsible for verifying that the goods and services reflected on the  invoice have been received. Regardless of whether the cognizant DOE  field site\u2019s risk assessment covered these non-M&O contractors, not  having completed risk assessments for these non-M&O contractor sites  limited the information DOE needed to assess the risk for all of its  programs.", "For the 11 DOE field office sites that did not prepare and submit risk  assessments as required, DOE officials said that the 11 sites did not have  to prepare risk assessments.

A-123 is OMB\u2019s Circular on reporting for internal controls and certain   DOE officials said that during DOE\u2019s IPERA training,  financial risks.sites have been instructed to consider the results of the A-123  evaluations, which include evaluation of key risks and controls, when  determining susceptibility to high risk of improper payments.

In our  review of DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2011 risk assessments, of the 29 sites that  did risk assessments, at most, 10 included information stating that the  results of A-123 evaluations were considered as part of the risk  assessments. Information from A-123 evaluations on internal controls  could potentially provide information relevant to assessing the risk of  improper payments.

According  to DOE officials, for the purposes of IPERA reporting, cognizant DOE field  offices\u2014which are themselves payment sites\u2014are now responsible for  assessing risk for all non-M&O contracts. In addition, DOE\u2019s fiscal year  2012 and 2013 guidance did not direct sites to submit risk assessments.  Instead, the guidance directed sites to (1) prepare an overall risk  assessment rating for the site of high, medium, or low based on the eight  risk factors and the amount of actual improper payments identified  through the normal course of business; (2) submit the overall risk rating  and known improper payment information to DOE headquarters CFO;  and (3) maintain any detailed risk assessment support or other detailed  support for the known improper payments data. DOE\u2019s guidance included  a reporting template listing the eight risk factors and a place for payment  sites to indicate their overall risk rating, which DOE prepopulated with a  low risk rating. The template also included tables to report information on  known improper payments.

In addition, we found that the  overall risk assessment rating for each payment site provides limited  insight into DOE\u2019s risk for improper payments. Although DOE\u2019s 2012 and  2013 guidance directed sites to maintain support for their overall risk  assessments rating, it did not require sites to submit supporting  documentation for their risk ratings. The low risk designation that all of the  sites provided in both years without supporting documentation did not  provide information on how those sites considered the eight risk factors,  how they weighed each factor against the others, or how they considered  the eight factors in relation to their improper payments data to arrive at  their overall risk rating.", "We also found that DOE\u2019s reporting of a program\u2019s amount of improper  payments for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 also provided limited insight into  DOE\u2019s risk of improper payments. IPERA and OMB guidance do not  require DOE to report total known improper payments and, although not  required to, DOE reports its total known improper payments annually in its  Agency Financial Report. DOE cites this reporting as evidence in  determining that its programs, and the department as a whole, are at low  risk for improper payments. For example, in its Fiscal Year 2013 Agency  Financial Report, DOE reported that it had identified $21.8 million in  improper payments made in fiscal year 2012 out of $46.5 billion in total  outlays. In reporting this number, DOE did not report the full extent of its  improper payments as it did not disclose information on prior year  improper payments. In addition, DOE did not disclose information on  settled costs, as shown in the following:", "Prior year improper payments. According to DOE officials, the  amount of DOE\u2019s total known improper payments does not include  known improper payments identified in prior years. This means that  improper payments that occurred in prior fiscal years but were not  identified until a later reporting year are not included. Thus, the $21.8  million in improper payments that DOE reported in its Fiscal Year  2013 Agency Financial Report only includes improper payments made  and identified during fiscal year 2012. Therefore, DOE\u2019s reporting  does not provide the full extent of DOE\u2019s total improper payments.  Specifically, DOE pays contractors throughout the year for services  performed, and those charges are subject to incurred cost audits to  ensure that they are allowable under the terms of the contract. If  charges are ultimately found to be unallowable by DOE, those  charges are considered improper payments under IPERA. The  process for ultimately determining that costs are unallowable can take  a considerable amount of time, and the amount of money involved  can be significant. For example, in April 2012 and October 2012, the  IG reported about $4.4 million in disallowed costs identified in fiscal  year 2012 related to prior year payments. However, this $4.4 million  was not included when DOE reported its known improper payments  for fiscal year 2012 in DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2013 Agency Financial  Report.", "Settled costs. DOE\u2019s IG and contractor internal auditors have the  ability to question costs they find to be potentially unallowable under  the terms of a contract. Once costs have been questioned, DOE must  ultimately make a determination whether to allow or disallow those  costs. Before disallowing costs, the Federal Acquisition Regulation  requires agencies to \u201cmake every reasonable effort\u201d to reach a  satisfactory settlement with the contractor. In one settlement  agreement we reviewed, the contractor agreed to reimburse DOE for  $10 million in questioned costs, referring to them as \u201cpotential  unallowable costs.\u201d Because those costs are not explicitly identified as  unallowable in the settlement agreement, DOE does not consider  them improper under IPERA and therefore does not disclose them in  its reporting.", "DOE officials told us that their reporting of current year known improper  payments in their Agency Financial Report is consistent with OMB  guidance. We recognize that DOE is reporting more information than is  required. However, citing an amount of improper payments without further  explanation is potentially misleading to external stakeholders, including  Congress and the public. According to federal standards for internal  control, effective communications should occur in a broad sense with  information flowing down, across, and up the organization.should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and  obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have a  significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. By not disclosing  more information in its IPERA reporting about total known improper  payments, DOE does not allow readers, including congressional and  public stakeholders, to fully understand what the total known improper  payments amount represents and the extent to which this improper  payments total could potentially be more pervasive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the importance of assessing the risks of improper payments,  DOE issued new guidance in 2014 to address payment processes  involving non-M&O contractors, to clarify the way payment sites address  risk factors, and to consider inherent risks of improper payments due to  the nature of the agency\u2019s programs/operations. These are positive steps,  but further efforts could help to more fully assess DOE\u2019s risk of improper  payments and make more effective use of DOE and contractor resources.  Specifically, DOE\u2019s 2014 guidance directs DOE field sites to consider the  payment processes of the non-M&O contractors they oversee when  completing required risk assessments. However, the guidance does not  specify that those sites should address the eight risk factors as they relate  to the non-M&O sites. We found that risk assessments for non-M&O  payment sites were not always conducted in fiscal year 2011.

Without providing specific  examples in guidance of other risk factors that present inherent risks  likely to contribute to improper payments and directing payment sites to  consider those other factors when performing their improper payment risk  assessments, DOE will not have reasonable assurance that its payment  sites consistently consider other relevant risk factors. Finally, DOE  annually reports the amount of its total known improper payments and  cites this amount as a key reason why its programs and the department  as a whole are low risk. However, this amount provides limited insight on  the extent of improper payments and is potentially misleading. By  disclosing additional information in its IPERA reporting, DOE could better  position readers, including congressional and public stakeholders, to fully  understand what the total known improper payments amount represents  and the extent to which improper payments could potentially be more  pervasive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve its ability to assess the risk of improper payments and  make more effective use of DOE and contractor resources, we  recommend the Secretary of Energy direct the department\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer to take the following four actions to revise the  department\u2019s IPERA guidance: direct field office sites with responsibility for non-M&O contractor risk  assessments to address risk factors as they relate to those sites and  take steps to ensure sites implement it;  clarify how payment sites are to address risk factors and document  the basis for their risk rating determinations and take steps to ensure  sites implement it;  clarify who is responsible at DOE for reviewing and approving risk  assessments for consistency across sites and take steps to ensure  those entities implement it; and provide specific examples of other risk factors that present inherent  risks likely to contribute to significant improper payments, in addition  to the eight risk factors, direct payment sites to consider those when  performing their improper payment risk assessments, and take steps  to ensure sites implement it.", "To provide better transparency regarding its total known improper  payments reported under IPERA, we recommend the Secretary of Energy  direct the department\u2019s Chief Financial Officer to improve public reporting  on the amount of total known improper payments by disclosing additional  information regarding this amount and the extent to which improper  payments could be occurring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOE for comment. In its initial  comments, DOE had concerns with our recommendation to disclose more  information on its total known improper payments number included in its  Agency Financial Report. In reviewing DOE\u2019s initial comments, it was  clear there was a misunderstanding about the intent of the  recommendation. Subsequently, we discussed the recommendation with  DOE officials, clarified our intent, and modified the recommendation to  ensure that DOE discloses information on the extent of improper  payments that could be occurring. In its final comments, reproduced in  appendix II, DOE concurred with all five of our recommendations. DOE  also provided technical comments that were incorporated, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Department of Energy, and other  interested parties.

To determine  this, we reviewed the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act  of 2010 (IPERA). For additional context, we also reviewed the Improper  Payments Information Act of 2002 and the Improper Payments  Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012. We examined the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) and DOE\u2019s IPERA guidance.  We reviewed relevant effective practices for conducting risk assessments  as described in our executive guide on strategies for managing improper  payments. Given the relevance and stated importance of DOE\u2019s  Cooperative Audit Strategy, we analyzed the strategy and related  documents, including the DOE Office of Inspector General (IG) Audit  Manual, the DOE Financial Management Handbook, contractor incurred  cost audits, and IG reviews of those audits.", "We interviewed key officials with the DOE headquarters Office of the  Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Specifically, we met with officials from the  Office of Financial Control and Reporting within the Office of the CFO,  which carries out DOE\u2019s efforts to comply with IPERA by issuing guidance  and consolidating and reporting information annually in DOE\u2019s Agency  Financial Report. We discussed DOE\u2019s process for implementing IPERA,  including how payment site risk assessments were reviewed and  approved by DOE and how headquarters conducted risk assessments on  the grant and loan programs. We interviewed IG officials to discuss their  role in overseeing DOE\u2019s IPERA implementation and DOE\u2019s strategy to  oversee the auditing of its contractors\u2019 incurred costs. We reviewed the  IG\u2019s fiscal year 2011, 2012, and 2013 IPERA compliance audits, including  how they were conducted and their findings, conclusions, and  recommendations. We determined that these reports were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of using them to support our results.", "For fiscal years 2011 through 2013, we analyzed DOE\u2019s IPERA reporting,  including qualitative risk assessments and quantitative information. We  choose to review fiscal years 2011 through 2013 because those were the  years subject to IPERA requirements for which we had available  documentation. We reviewed each risk assessment to determine if it (1)  contained narrative responses specifically taking into account the eight  factors; (2) provided a basis for the risk determination; and (3) if it was a  DOE field office, whether it specifically addressed the eight risk factors  with regard to any non-M&O contractors they oversee. We also  determined if the risk assessment documented consideration of  evaluations conducted pursuant to OMB Circular A-123. To assess the  reliability of financial data used in DOE\u2019s payment site risk assessments,  we compared the figures reported in all payment site risk assessments  associated with known improper payments and outlays with the  aggregated figures contained in DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2011 Agency  Financial Report. Where applicable and appropriate, we also compared  the figures reported in payment site risk assessments with the back-up  documentation provided by various specific DOE payment sites (or  \u201cprograms\u201d). We assessed the reliability of financial data used in DOE\u2019s  payment site risk assessments. To gain additional context related to  documenting these analyses, we also reviewed our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.", "We visited two DOE field CFOs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and  Albuquerque, New Mexico, and with officials from DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge  Financial Service Center. We chose these two locations because they  oversee IPERA reporting for M&O and non-M&O contracts that  accounted for about 28 percent of DOE\u2019s IPERA reported outlays in fiscal  year 2013. In addition, we selected the Oak Ridge Financial Services  Center to visit because it handles all payments made to non-M&O  contracts. DOE\u2019s 11 field CFO\u2019s, in cooperation with site-located  contracting officers, oversee contactor and other activities in the field and  assist DOE headquarters in carrying out IPERA. We discussed how DOE  payment sites were implementing IPERA and how payment site risk  assessments were reviewed by DOE. During these trips, we also met with  six contractor site locations overseen by these field CFOs. These six  contractor locations include the following:", "East Tennessee Technology Park;", "Los Alamos National Laboratory;", "Oak Ridge Associated Universities;", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory;", "Sandia National Laboratory; and", "Y-12 National Security Complex.", "We choose to visit these payment sites because they represent a cross  section of the types of contractor payments made at DOE and because  they accounted for about 38 percent of DOE\u2019s total outlays in fiscal year  2013. At each payment site, we met with contractor CFO and internal  audit officials, as well as the cognizant DOE contracting officer. During  our meetings, we obtained perspectives from over 70 DOE and contractor  officials involved with IPERA reporting, including those that had prepared  or reviewed improper payment risk assessments. We also discussed the  guidance and direction provided by DOE to payment sites in  implementing IPERA, as well as consistency across DOE payment sites  in preparing risk assessments.", "We reviewed prior GAO and IG reports that identified deficiencies in DOE  internal controls, such as subcontract audits and annual incurred cost  audits, including how they were conducted and their findings,  conclusions, and recommendations.
