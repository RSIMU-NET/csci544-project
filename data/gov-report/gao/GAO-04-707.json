Fraudulent and abusive billing practices committed by providers include billing for services, drugs, equipment, or supplies not provided or not needed. Providers have also been found to bill for more expensive procedures than actually provided. In recent cases, 15 clinical laboratories in one state billed Medicaid $20 million for services that had not been ordered, an optical store falsely claimed $3 million for eyeglass replacements, and a medical supply company agreed to repay states nearly $50 million because of fraudulent marketing practices. States report that their Medicaid program integrity activities generated cost savings by applying certain measures to providers considered to be at high risk for inappropriate billing and by generally strengthening their program controls for all providers. Thirty-four of the 47 states that completed our inventory reported using one or more enrollment controls with their high-risk providers, such as on-site inspections of the applicant's facility, criminal background checks, or probationary or time-limited enrollment. States also reported using information technology to integrate databases containing provider, beneficiary, and claims information and conduct more efficient utilization reviews. For example, 34 states reported conducting targeted claims reviews to identify unusual patterns that might indicate provider abuse. In addition, states cited legislation that directed the use of certain preventive or detection controls or authorized enhanced enforcement powers as lending support to their Medicaid program integrity efforts. At the federal level, CMS is engaged in several initiatives designed to support states' program integrity efforts; however, its oversight of these state efforts is limited. CMS initiatives include two pilots, one to measure the accuracy of each state's Medicaid claims payments and another to identify aberrant provider billing by linking Medicaid and Medicare claims information. CMS also provides technical assistance to states by sponsoring monthly teleconferences where states can discuss emerging issues and propose policy changes. To monitor Medicaid program integrity activities, CMS teams conduct on-site reviews of states' compliance with federal requirements, such as referring certain cases to the state agency responsible for investigating Medicaid fraud. In fiscal year 2004, CMS allocated $26,000 and eight staff positions nationally for overseeing the states' Medicaid program integrity activities, including the cost of compliance reviews. With this level of resources, CMS aims to review 8 states each year until all 50 states and the District of Columbia have been covered. From January 2000 through December 2003, CMS has conducted reviews of 29 states and, at its current pace, would not begin a second round of reviews before fiscal year 2007. This level of effort suggests that CMS's oversight of the states' Medicaid program integrity efforts may be disproportionately small relative to the risk of serious financial loss."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2002, Medicaid\u2014a program jointly funded by the federal  government and the states\u2014provided health care coverage for about   51 million low-income Americans, most of whom were children, elderly,  blind, or disabled.

Such payments  include those made for services not covered by program rules, not  medically necessary, or billed but never actually provided. Improper  payments can result from inadvertent errors as well as fraud and abuse.  Inadvertent errors are typically due to clerical mistakes or a  misunderstanding of program rules, whereas fraud is an intentional act of  deception to benefit the provider or another person. Abuse typically  involves actions that are inconsistent with acceptable business and  medical practices.

Although it is  one federal program, Medicaid consists of 56 distinct state-level programs  created within broad federal guidelines and administered by state  Medicaid agencies. Each state develops its own Medicaid administrative  structure for carrying out the program. It also establishes eligibility  standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of covered  services; and sets payment rates. Each state is required to describe the  nature and scope of its program in a comprehensive plan submitted to  CMS, with federal funding depending on CMS\u2019s approval of the plan.", "In general, the federal government matches state Medicaid spending for  medical assistance according to a formula based on each state\u2019s per capita  income. The federal contribution ranges from 50 to 77 cents of every state  dollar spent on medical assistance in fiscal year 2004. For most state  Medicaid administrative costs, the federal match rate is 50 percent. For  skilled professional medical personnel engaged in program integrity  activities, such as those who review medical records, 75 percent federal  matching is available.", "States and CMS share responsibility for protecting the integrity of the  Medicaid program.

CMS requires that states collect and  verify basic information on potential providers, including whether they  meet state licensure requirements and are not prohibited from  participating in federal health care programs. CMS also requires that each  state Medicaid agency have certain information processing capabilities,  including a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and a  Surveillance and Utilization Review Subsystem (SURS). The SURS staff  use claims data to develop statistical profiles on services, providers, and  beneficiaries to identify potential improper payments. They refer  suspected overpayments or overutilization cases to other units in the  Medicaid agency for corrective action and potential fraud cases to their  state\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for investigation and prosecution.

Of the 47 states that completed our inventory, 34 reported  targeting their reviews to claims from high-risk providers. These reviews  entail verifying the appropriateness of the services billed by, and payments  made to, a provider within a certain period. Twenty-one of the 34 states  reported using advanced information technology to more effectively  pinpoint aberrant billing patterns. These states developed data  warehouses to store several years of information on claims, providers, and  beneficiaries in integrated databases, and they use data-mining software to  look for unusual patterns that might indicate provider abuse. Additional  software detects claims with incongruous billing code combinations. For  example, a state can link related service claims, such as emergency  transportation invoices and hospital emergency department claims for the  same client. States that use these technologies to enhance their targeted  reviews include the following:    New York officials reported that targeted reviews of claims submitted by  part-time clinics, mobile radiology service providers, midwives, and  physician assistants saved an estimated $24.9 million in state fiscal years  2002 through 2003.", "Ohio officials reported that targeted reviews by Ohio\u2019s in-house utilization  review staff saved an estimated $14 million in state fiscal years 2000  through 2002.", "Texas officials reported recouping over $18.9 million in state fiscal year  2003.

This level of funding represents a $14,000, or   35 percent, decline from the previous year. At the peak of its funding in  fiscal year 2002, CMS\u2019s operating budget for these activities was about  $80,000. According to agency officials, the size of the federal Medicaid  program integrity group relative to its responsibilities has resulted in its  use of Medicare\u2019s program integrity resources to help implement pilot  projects and conduct technical assistance activities.", "From the states\u2019 perspective, compliance reviews have provided useful  information for identifying needed areas of improvement and potential  best practices. For example, Michigan officials told us that after CMS\u2019s  review, they took steps to strengthen their provider enrollment activities.  In another state, CMS discovered numerous areas of noncompliance. The  state agency\u2019s provider enrollment processes did not require applicants to  disclose prior criminal convictions or business ownership and control. The  state agency also did not investigate potential instances of fraud and abuse  identified by its SURS unit or beneficiary complaints, or make the required  referrals to the state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. As a result of these  findings, CMS required the state to develop a corrective action plan. About  a year later, the review team revisited the state and learned that it had  begun to implement corrective actions.", "CMS has pointed to its compliance reviews of the states\u2019 program integrity  activities as providing the agency with information on the states\u2019 strengths  and vulnerabilities to improper payments. However, as we reported in  February 2002, these structured site reviews focus on state compliance  and do not evaluate the effectiveness of the states\u2019 fraud and abuse  prevention and detection activities for reducing improper payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The varied and substantial cases of Medicaid fraud or abuse that have  been uncovered around the country reaffirm the need for Medicaid  agencies to safeguard program dollars. Such losses have prompted  program integrity units and legislatures in many states to take active roles  in prevention and detection efforts. In their attempts to limit improper  payments, states have pursued a broad range of methods, such as  tightened provider enrollment and advanced claims review techniques. As  some states report identifying substantial cost savings, further  enhancements in program integrity activities are likely to generate positive  returns on such investments.", "At the same time, there may be a disparity between the level of CMS  resources devoted to Medicaid program integrity and the program\u2019s  vulnerability to financial losses. On its current schedule for conducting  state program integrity compliance reviews, CMS will not obtain a  programwide picture of states\u2019 prevention and detection activities more  than once every 6 years. Moreover, because these reviews are limited in  scope, CMS does not evaluate states\u2019 effectiveness in addressing improper  payments. In addition, findings from the payment accuracy pilot indicate a  need for CMS to further enhance state efforts to prevent and detect  payment errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, CMS officials took issue  with our observation that the level of resources devoted to federal  oversight of states\u2019 program integrity activities may be inconsistent with  the financial risks to the program. They pointed out that the agency\u2019s  program integrity work should be viewed as part of its broader financial  management of state Medicaid programs. Officials noted that 65 financial  management staff in CMS regional offices review Medicaid expenditures,  conduct financial management reviews, provide technical assistance to  states on financial policy issues, and analyze state cost allocation and  administrative claiming plans. Officials also stated that the agency expects  to hire 100 new Medicaid financial management staff this fiscal year and  has contracted with HHS OIG to perform additional auditing. (See app. II.)", "We commend CMS for the actions it has begun to take to address its  Medicaid financial management challenges. As we have reported in recent  years, CMS had fallen short in providing the level of oversight required to  ensure states\u2019 Medicaid financial responsibility. When fully implemented,  CMS\u2019s efforts to increase the number of staff dedicated to reviewing the  states\u2019 financial management reports should help it strengthen the fiscal  integrity of Medicaid\u2019s state and federal partnership.", "However, financial management and program integrity, while related  functions, are not interchangeable. Financial management focuses on the  propriety of states\u2019 claims for federal reimbursement, such as the  matching, administrative, and disproportionate share funds that CMS  provides the states. In contrast, program integrity\u2014the focus of this  report\u2014addresses federal and state efforts to ensure the propriety of  payments made to providers. Unlike the commitment to expand resources  for Medicaid financial management activities, CMS has not indicated a  similar commitment to enhancing its support and oversight of states\u2019  program integrity efforts.", "CMS officials also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  into the report where appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after its  date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary of  HHS, Administrator of CMS, appropriate congressional committees, and  other interested parties.
