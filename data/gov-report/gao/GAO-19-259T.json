Yet, concerns have been raised about the availability of such examiners. The Department of Justice administers grant programs that can be used by states and other eligible entities to train and fund examiners.", "This statement summarizes GAO's findings from its March 2016 report ( GAO-16-334 ) describing (1) what was known in 2016 about the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners nationally and in selected states and (2) the challenges selected states faced in maintaining a supply of sexual assault forensic examiners. For that report, GAO reviewed literature on the availability of examiners and challenges training and retaining them. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials, including recipients of federal sexual assault examiner related grants and officials from sexual assault coalitions in six states (Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin) selected to achieve variation in factors such as population and geographic location."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's March 2016 report examining the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners found that only limited nationwide data existed on the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners\u2014both the number of practicing examiners and health care facilities that had examiner programs. At the state level, GAO found that, in three of the six states it selected to review, grant administrators or officials from sexual assault coalitions were able to provide estimates of the number of practicing examiners and, in all six states, they were able to provide information on the estimated number of examiner program locations in their state. However, officials in all six selected states told GAO that the number of examiners available in their state did not meet the need for exams, especially in rural areas. For example, officials in Wisconsin explained that nearly half of all counties in the state did not have any sexual assault examiner programs available and officials in Nebraska told GAO that most counties in the state did not have examiner programs available. As a consequence, officials said victims may need to travel long distances to be examined by a trained examiner. In health care facilities where examiners were available, they were typically available in hospitals on an on-call basis, though the number available varied by facility and may not provide enough capacity to offer examiner coverage 24 hours, 7 days a week.", "GAO's March 2016 report also found there were multiple challenges to maintaining a supply of examiners, according to its review of the literature and interviews with officials in the six selected states. These challenges include:", "Limited availability of training . Officials in five of the six selected states reported that the limited availability of classroom, clinical, and continuing education training opportunities is a challenge to maintaining a supply of trained examiners. For example, officials told us that there is a need for qualified instructors to run training sessions.", "Weak stakeholder support for examiners. Officials in five of the six selected states reported that obtaining support from stakeholders, such as hospitals, was a challenge. For example, hospitals may be reluctant to cover the costs of training examiners or pay for examiners to be on call.", "Low examiner retention rates. The above-mentioned and other challenges, including the emotional and physical demands on examiners, contribute to low examiner retention rates. Officials in one of the selected states estimated that while the state trained 540 examiners over a two-year period, only 42 of those examiners were still practicing in the state at the end of those 2 years.", "Officials described a variety of strategies they have employed that can help address these challenges, such as implementing web-based training courses, clinical practice labs, mentorship programs, and multidisciplinary teams that respond to cases of sexual assault."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the availability of  sexual assault forensic examiners. An estimated 323,450 individuals age  12 or older were victims of rape or other sexual assault in 2016,  according to the most recently available data from the Bureau of Justice  Statistics. When victims of sexual assault receive a medical forensic  examination, the exam may be provided by either a trained sexual assault  forensic examiner\u2014that is, a medical provider who has received  specialized training in properly collecting and preserving forensic  evidence\u2014or a medical provider who has not received such specialized  training. Studies have shown that exams performed by trained sexual  assault forensic examiners may result in shortened exam time, higher  quality health care delivered to victims, higher quality forensic evidence  collection, as well as better collaboration with the legal system and higher  prosecution rates. However, concerns have been raised about the  availability of examiners to meet victims\u2019 needs for exams.", "To help inform today\u2019s discussion, my testimony will focus on findings  from our March 2016 report examining information on the training,  funding, and availability of sexual assault forensic examiners. In  particular, this statement will address:  1.  what was known about the availability of sexual assault forensic  examiners nationally and in selected states as of 2016, and  2.  the challenges selected states faced in maintaining a supply of sexual  assault forensic examiners.", "For our March 2016 report, we conducted a literature review to identify  studies that measured the availability of sexual assault forensic  examiners, examined challenges to training and retaining examiners, and  strategies that could be used to address these challenges. We  interviewed experts, recipients of federal grants to train sexual assault  forensic examiners, and state sexual assault coalition officials in six  selected states about data on the availability of examiners or examiner programs; the extent to which examiner availability meets the need for  exams; challenges they experienced in training or retaining examiners;  and strategies that could be used to overcome these challenges. We  also interviewed officials from the International Association of Forensic  Nurses (IAFN) about these issues. Our March 2016 report includes a full  description of our scope and methodology. We conducted the work on  which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Victims of sexual assault may receive a sexual assault forensic  examination by a medical provider who may or may not be a trained  sexual assault forensic examiner. Medical providers assess victims\u2019  clinical conditions; provide appropriate treatment and medical referrals;  and, given consent by the victim, collect forensic evidence through a  sexual assault forensic examination that may follow steps and use  supplies from a sexual assault evidence collection kit. Under its protocol  for sexual assault forensic examinations, the Department of Justice (DOJ)  recommends that medical providers collect a range of physical evidence.  In addition, sexual assault forensic exams typically include documenting  biological and physical findings such as cuts or bruises and a victim\u2019s  medical forensic history, such as the time and nature of the assault. Once  the exam is complete, medical providers preserve the collected evidence,  which may include packaging, labeling, and sealing evidence collection  kits and storing kits in a secure location. Medical providers typically perform such exams only for acute cases of sexual assault, such as in  cases where the assault occurred within the previous 72 to 96 hours,  when the physical and biological evidence on a person\u2019s body or clothes  is considered most viable.", "DOJ, IAFN, and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)  recommend that sexual assault forensic exams be performed by specially  trained medical providers\u2014known as sexual assault forensic examiners  (examiners). These examiners include physicians, physician assistants,  nurse practitioners, and other registered nurses who have been specially  educated and have completed clinical requirements to perform sexual  assault forensic exams. Sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) \u2014a  particular type of sexual assault forensic examiner\u2014are registered  nurses, including nurse midwives and other advanced practice nurses,  who have received specialized education and have fulfilled clinical  requirements to perform sexual assault forensic exams. Examiner  programs have been created in hospital or non-hospital settings whereby  specially trained examiners are available to provide first-response care  and exams to sexual assault victims. DOJ, IAFN, and some states have  issued guidelines pertaining to the minimum level of training examiners  should receive in order to properly collect and preserve evidence, identify  victims\u2019 medical and emotional health care needs, and provide counseling  and referrals for victims. These guidelines include recommendations of  objectives and topics that training programs should cover.", "DOJ administers several grant programs that aim to, among other things,  improve response to and recovery from four broad categories of  victimization\u2014domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and  stalking. In our March 2016 report we describe three key grant programs  administered by DOJ\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women that could be  used by grant recipients\u2014including states or other eligible entities\u2014to  fund or train sexual assault forensic examiners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nationwide Data on the Availability of Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners Are Limited; Officials in Selected States Reported a Need for Additional Examiners", "paragraphs": ["In our March 2016 report examining the availability of sexual assault  forensic examiners, we found that only limited nationwide data exist on  the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners\u2014that is, both the  number of practicing examiners and health care facilities that have  examiner programs. While IAFN reported that, as of September 2015,  there were 1,182 nurses with an active IAFN SANE certification in the  United States, such data do not represent all practicing examiners  nationwide. For example, the data do not account for examiners who  completed training through an IAFN or a state training program but never  became certified or were certified through another entity, such as a state  board of nursing. IAFN also collects data on examiner programs  nationwide\u2014that is, data on hospitals, clinics, and other sites where  examiners practice. Such data provide an indication of the availability of  examiners, but the data are also limited. While 703 examiner programs  nationwide voluntarily reported to IAFN\u2019s examiner program database, as  of September 2015, IAFN officials noted that the database is often not up  to date; and some health care settings where sexual assault forensic  exams are conducted, such as child advocacy centers, are not  represented. In addition, data collected on staffing characteristics of  examiner programs are often unavailable in the IAFN examiner program  database. For example, only about one-third of the examiner programs  reported on the number of examiners practicing in their program, and  about one-third reported on whether examiners were available on-site  versus on-call.", "In three of the six selected states we reviewed in our March 2016 report,  grant administrators or officials from sexual assault coalitions were able to  provide estimates of the number of practicing examiners, and, in all six  states, they were able to provide information on the estimated number of  examiner program locations in their state. Of states that reported, the  number of practicing examiners and examiner programs varied by state.  (See table 1.) However, such data may also present an incomplete  picture of the availability of examiners. For example, only one of the six  selected states has a system in place to formally track the number and  location of examiners. Instead, officials generally reported on the  estimated number of examiners or examiner locations that were part of a  statewide examiner program or were identified through an ad hoc data  collection effort.", "Although data are limited, grant administrators and sexual assault  coalition officials in all six selected states nevertheless told us that the  number of examiners available does not meet the need for exams within  their states. For example, coalition officials in Wisconsin told us that  nearly half of all counties in the state do not have any examiner programs  available, and coalition officials in Nebraska told us that most counties in  the state do not have examiner programs available. In addition, in four of  the six selected states\u2014Colorado, Florida, Nebraska, and Wisconsin\u2014 state grant administrators and coalition officials told us that few or some  health care facilities in their state have examiners available. As a  consequence, officials said victims may need to travel long distances to  be examined by a trained examiner or be examined by a medical  professional without specialized training. While in the other two selected  states\u2014Massachusetts and Oregon\u2014state grant administrators and  coalition officials stated that some or most facilities have examiners  available, they noted that there is still a need for additional capacity to  reduce the burden on those examiners who are available, or to make  examiners available in a number of areas where examiners are currently  unavailable.", "In health care facilities where examiners are available, they are typically  available through hospitals on an on-call basis, according to literature we  reviewed as well as all grant administrators and coalition officials we  interviewed for our report. In addition, among facilities that have  examiners available, the number of examiners available varies and may  not provide enough capacity for facilities to offer examiner coverage 24  hours, 7 days a week, according to state grant administrators and  coalition officials we interviewed. Nebraska coalition officials, for example,  told us that while one hospital in Omaha has a team of 26 examiners  available, other facilities in the state may have as few as three examiners  available. Further, officials from Florida and Colorado told us that there  are few facilities in their states able to offer full coverage with examiners  available 24 hours, 7 days a week."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Faced Challenges Training Examiners, Maintaining Stakeholder Support, and Retaining Examiners", "paragraphs": ["In our March 2016 report, we found that maintaining a supply of trained  examiners that meets communities\u2019 needs for exams is challenging for  multiple reasons, and that state officials have employed a variety of  strategies to address these challenges, as described below.", "Limited availability of training. Officials in five of the six selected states  told us that the limited availability of classroom, clinical, or continuing  education training is a barrier to maintaining a supply of trained  examiners. Regarding classroom training, some officials told us that  training may only be offered once per year in their states. Additionally,  officials from both Florida and IAFN told us that there is a need for  qualified instructors to run training sessions. Experts and officials from  Colorado, Nebraska, and Oregon also told us that medical professionals  in rural areas may have difficulty completing the clinical training  necessary to become an examiner. Obtaining clinical experience, such as  performing exams under the supervision of a trained examiner, is a  particular challenge in rural areas where hospitals may treat only a few  sexual assault cases per year. One official in Nebraska told us that  trained examiners in rural areas might not feel competent to perform  exams due to the low number of cases they treat. A lack of continuing  education opportunities may also pose a challenge for examiners in  maintaining the skills necessary to perform exams. For example, the  National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC) reported that\u2014 based on common challenges identified through a survey of, and group  discussions among, examiner program coordinators\u2014maintaining  competency may be difficult for nurses in rural areas due to a low volume  of patients presenting in need of exams and limited access to ongoing  and advanced training.", "Officials told us they have been able to increase the availability of  examiner training through alternative training methods such as web- based training courses and simulated clinical training. For example,  officials in Colorado told us their state\u2019s web-based examiner training  program has made training less expensive and has increased examiner  recruitment. Officials in Wisconsin told us they developed a clinical  training lab that allows examiners to gain hands-on experience by  performing elements of exams on experienced teaching assistants hired  for the purpose of training new examiners. Further, in 2014, a DOJ- funded evaluation of examiner training programs found that a web-based  training course may help increase the availability of trained examiners;  the study also found that implementing web-based training had benefits  such as decreasing the costs associated with attending in-person training,  expanding training opportunities to remote areas, and allowing examiners  to be trained by national experts.", "Lack of technical assistance and other supportive resources.  Officials in four of the six selected states told us that the limited  availability of technical assistance and other supportive resources for  examiners poses a challenge to maintaining a supply of trained  examiners. For example, officials in Florida, Nebraska, Oregon, and  Wisconsin explained that, in general, there is a lack of mentorship  opportunities and leadership within the examiner community. Officials  also noted that the sustainability of examiner programs may be  threatened by a lack of internal capacity, such as not having a full-time,  paid examiner program coordinator available. Further, in its survey of and  group discussions with examiner program coordinators, NSVRC found  that examiners and examiner programs needed technical assistance and  support in the following areas: aspects of performing exams, training,  leadership development and policy issues, and examiner program  sustainability.", "Officials we spoke to told us about strategies that can be used to increase  support for examiners and examiner programs, such as offering web- based technical assistance. For example, officials in Massachusetts told  us that, through their National Sexual Assault TeleNursing Center, trained  SANEs provide remote clinical guidance to two hospitals in the state that  do not have trained examiners available. In addition, officials from  Colorado told us an examiner program coordinator in an urban hospital in  the state provides volunteer on-call technical assistance and clinical  guidance to examiners in rural parts of the state, where those resources  are not otherwise available. Further, one study we reviewed found several  states were engaged in promising practices to increase support for  examiners, such as implementing state-wide mentorship programs,  developing regional examiner list-serves and online discussion boards,  creating formal leadership positions within the examiner community, and  requiring examiner program evaluations.", "Weak stakeholder support for examiners. Officials in five of the six  selected states told us that limited stakeholder support for examiners and  examiner programs, such as from hospitals and law enforcement, is a  challenge to maintaining a supply of trained examiners. Some officials  told us that hospitals may be reluctant to support examiners and  examiner programs due to a low number of sexual assault cases treated  each year. One official told us that hospitals may be reluctant to send  nurses to examiner training, as it takes away from their regular shift  availability. Additionally, some hospitals do not pay examiners to be on  call. Officials in three states told us that hospitals typically either do not  pay examiners to be on call or pay on-call examiners significantly less  than other on-call medical professionals.", "Apart from hospital support, officials in Colorado and Oregon explained  there is a need for more multidisciplinary support for examiners, such as  increased law enforcement, prosecutor, and first-responder  understanding of examiners\u2019 role. The literature we reviewed also shows  that ambiguity around the role of the examiner in responding to sexual  assault may be a source of conflict between examiners and other  professionals. For example, examiners were found to have experienced  instances where victim advocates or law enforcement questioned  examiners\u2019 medical decisions, speed of evidence collection, or asked  examiners to comment on the credibility of a victim\u2019s case. One nationally  representative survey of examiner programs found that examiner program  coordinators felt ongoing education of community stakeholders on sexual  assault and examiner programs was needed due to the high turnover in  staff at relevant community institutions and agencies, such as law  enforcement officers, victim advocates, and prosecutors.", "Through our interviews with officials, we learned of strategies selected  states have used to increase or mitigate limited stakeholder support for  examiners and examiner programs. For example, officials in Colorado,  Florida, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin told us that sexual assault  response teams have been developed in their states to help community  stakeholders to understand examiners\u2019 role and better coordinate to meet  the medical and legal needs of sexual assault victims.", "Low examiner retention rates. Officials in four of the six selected states  told us that low examiner retention rates can be an impediment to  maintaining a supply of trained examiners. In addition to the challenges of  limited training opportunities, technical assistance and other supportive  resources, and stakeholder support for examiners, the physically and  emotionally demanding nature of examiner work contributes to low  examiner retention rates. Further, studies have indicated that  dissatisfaction with compensation, long work hours, and lack of support,  among other things, may contribute to examiner burnout. Examiners  typically work on call in addition to their full time jobs as, for example,  emergency department nurses. Officials in Florida told us that examiners  may be on call for 6-hour, 12-hour, or even 24-hour shifts. Further, one  survey of examiner programs in Maryland found that examiners were  required to be on call for an average of 159 hours per month. Wisconsin  officials estimated that, although 540 SANEs were trained over a 2-year  period, only 42 (less than 8 percent) were still practicing in the state at the  end of those 2 years.", "Chairman Harper, Ranking Member DeGette, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
