However, Bank Group management does not include an assertion on internal control over operations and compliance matters, and it has not asked the external auditor to give an opinion on those internal controls. During our review, we were told that the Bank Group does not yet have plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of those controls. The Bank Group's external financial statement audits do not, and are not intended to, provide specific assurance about the internal control over the Bank Group's operations and whether the funds are spent for their intended purposes. Given the inherent risks in the banks' activities, additional assurance on these other categories of internal control--operations and compliance--would provide an added level of assurance to the Bank Group and its member countries that funds were used for their intended purposes. The Bank Group has established an audit committee that provides oversight of external financial statement audits and internal control. A major function of the committee is to nominate an external auditor and determine the scope of the auditor's work and the reports to be submitted by the auditor. The audit committee also has the external auditor give an opinion, in conjunction with the financial statement audit, on management's assertion on the Bank Group's internal control over external financial reporting. The audit committee has the authority to expand the external audits to include the auditor giving opinions on internal control over operations and compliance matters.

Members also provide support through subscriptions of callable capital.  Because of the significant proportion of callable capital that is subscribed  by members with strong credit ratings, including the United States, IBRD is  able to use callable capital as backing to obtain more favorable financing  terms when borrowing from world capital markets than would otherwise  be available.

Monitoring\u2014a  process that assesses the quality of an internal control system\u2019s  performance over time\u2014is an essential element of internal control and is  particularly relevant for carrying out the fiduciary responsibilities that are  integral to the Bank Group\u2019s operations. Annual reporting on internal  control is now common practice both in the public and private sector and is  often performed in conjunction with annual financial statement audits.", "Treasury pointed out that our draft report documents the sufficiency of the  Bank Group\u2019s current external audits. Although our report provides  information about the results of the external financial statement audits at  the Bank Group, our report also makes it clear that, by design, the objective  of a financial statement audit is not to provide assurance on internal  control. The current financial statement audits cover only the banks\u2019  financial position at a point in time and the financial results of operations  and cash flows for a given fiscal year. Given that the Bank Group\u2019s external  auditor\u2019s opinion on internal control extends only to management\u2019s  assertions on the effectiveness of internal control over external financial  reporting, many facets of internal control would not be covered. The scope  of the financial statement audits of the Bank Group entities and the  separate assessment of controls over external financial reporting are not  intended to and do not provide specific assurance about the effectiveness  of the internal control over operations and compliance with bank charters  and key policies.", "Considering the Bank Group\u2019s reforms to strengthen internal control over  operations and compliance, we emphasize the need for annual assessments  of those controls. As acknowledged in comments from the Bank Group,  internal control is a \u201cdynamic process,\u201d and reforms are under way in the  Bank Group to strengthen its control framework. As the Bank Group  develops and institutes these reforms, monitoring is needed to help ensure  that controls are functioning as intended in preventing misuse of funds and  ensuring compliance with key provisions of bank charters and policies.  Annual reporting to provide accountability and transparency over lending,  equity investment, and guarantee operations carries additional importance  for the Bank Group because the international organization\u2019s mission  requires it, as stated in its comments, \u201cto be active in countries where  controls are weak.\u201d As acknowledged by the Bank Group, \u201cmonitoring  exposure against defined benchmarks\u201d is one of several changes that will  provide the banks with \u201csignificantly improved controls over lending,  equity investment, and guarantee operations.\u201d As stated in our  recommendations, the evaluation and reporting on internal control over  operations and compliance could be carried out in several ways, including  through the internal audit function; by the external auditor, in conjunction  with the financial statement audit; by another entity within the Bank  Group; or by an external party, such as a consultant.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the  president of the World Bank Group, and other interested parties.

Under the COSO framework, there are five interrelated  components of internal control that define the minimum level of quality  acceptable for internal control in an organization and provide the basis  against which internal control is to be evaluated. The five components are  used as the criteria to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the internal  controls and to identify actions that can be taken to improve controls. All  five components must be present and effective in order for management to  have reasonable assurance that risks are managed to ensure the  achievement of the organization\u2019s objectives. At the Bank Group,  management is responsible for developing the detailed policies,  procedures, and practices to fit its organization\u2019s operations and to ensure  that they are built into and are an integral part of its operations. The five  internal control components, which apply to all aspects of an organization\u2019s  operations, including programmatic, financial, and compliance, include the  following: Control environment. The control environment reflects management\u2019s  commitment and attitude to the implementation and maintenance of an  effective internal control structure. The control environment which  management promulgates through the organization will strongly influence  the design and operation of control policies and procedures. It will also  determine how effective they are in mitigating risks and achieving  objectives.", "Risk assessment. All organizations, regardless of size or nature, encounter  some form of risk that can adversely impact the achievement of its  objectives. Assessing risk is a major component of an effective control  structure. It involves the identification, analysis, assessment, and  prioritization of risks that need to be treated by control activities.", "Control activities. Control activities are the tailored policies and  procedures that ensure (1) the mitigation of risks, (2) irregularities are  prevented or detected and corrected, (3) assets are safeguarded from  unauthorized use or disposal, and (4) financial records and other relevant  databases are complete and accurately reflect the entire operational  activities of the organization, and assist in timely preparation of accurate  financial statements.", "Information and communication. Information and communication are  critical for performance reporting, decision making, both within the  organization and externally, and the achievement of strategic objectives.", "Monitoring. Monitoring is the final component of an effective internal  control structure and is closely linked to information and communication.  In addition to performance monitoring, the effectiveness of the control  structure itself also needs to be monitored and reviewed. Control  monitoring can be undertaken in two ways, by ongoing monitoring and by  separate reviews and evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency International\u2019s 2002 Corruption Perception Index", "paragraphs": ["Transparency International is an organization dedicated to curbing both  international and national corruption.

The goal of the CPI is to provide data on extensive perceptions of  corruption within countries. The 2002 CPI shows that the Bank Group  entities function in environments that are perceived to have high levels of  corruption, underscoring the importance of internal control over  operations and compliance within the Bank Group entities that are  providing loans to those countries.", "The CPI serves as an important indicator of the image a country conveys to  investors and potential business partners. Because the CPI is derived from  15 different surveys that garner the perceptions of both residents and  expatriates, both business people and risk analysts, the index provides a  snapshot of the views of the people who make key decisions on investment  and trade.
