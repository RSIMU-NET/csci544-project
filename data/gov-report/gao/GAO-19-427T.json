At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity.", "In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach\u2014direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy.

Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited.", "Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility.

The United States does not have a comprehensive  data privacy law at the federal level and instead relies in part on a  sectoral approach with industry-specific laws enforced by various  agencies governing areas such as healthcare and financial services. In  addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in  overseeing Internet privacy across all industries, with some exceptions.  Specifically, FTC addresses consumer concerns about Internet privacy  using its broad authority to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive  trade practices.

These  types of incidents have raised public concern because Internet-based  services and products, which are essential for everyday social and  economic purposes, often collect and use various forms of personal  information that could cause users harm if released.", "The federal privacy framework for private-sector companies is comprised  of a set of tailored laws that govern the use and protection of personal  information for specific purposes, in certain situations, or by certain  sectors or types of entities. Such laws protect consumers\u2019 personal  information related to their eligibility for credit, financial transactions, and  personal health, among other areas.", "We reported in 2013 that no overarching federal privacy law governs the  collection and sale of personal information among private-sector  companies, including information resellers\u2014companies that collect and  resell information on individuals. We found that gaps exist in the federal  privacy framework, which does not fully address changes in technology  and the marketplace. We recommended that Congress consider  legislation to strengthen the consumer privacy framework to reflect the  effects of changes in technology and the marketplace.

It does so using its general authority under section 5 of  the FTC Act, which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or  affecting commerce.\u201d", "Even though the FTC Act does not speak in explicit terms about  protecting consumer privacy, the Act authorizes such protection to the  extent it involves practices FTC defines as unfair or deceptive. According  to FTC, an act or practice is \u201cunfair\u201d if it causes, or is likely to cause,  substantial injury not reasonably avoidable by consumers and not  outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition as a  result of the practice. FTC has used this \u201cunfairness\u201d authority to address  situations where a company has allegedly failed to properly protect  consumers\u2019 data, for example. According to FTC, a representation or  omission is \u201cdeceptive\u201d if it is material and is likely to mislead consumers  acting reasonably under the circumstances. FTC has applied this  \u201cdeceptiveness\u201d authority to address deceptions related to violations of  written privacy policies and representations concerning data security, for  example.", "FTC staff investigate Internet privacy complaints from various sources  and also initiate investigations on their own. If FTC staff have reason to  believe that an entity is engaging in an unfair or deceptive practice, they  may forward an enforcement recommendation to the commission. The  commission then determines whether to pursue an enforcement action.  With certain exceptions, FTC generally cannot directly impose civil  monetary penalties for Internet privacy cases. Instead, FTC typically  addresses Internet privacy cases by entering into settlement agreements  requiring companies to take actions such as implementing reasonable  privacy and security programs. If a company then violates its settlement  agreement with FTC, the agency can request civil monetary penalties in  court for the violations. In addition, FTC can seek to impose civil  monetary penalties directly for violations of certain statutes and their  implementing regulations, such as the statute pertaining to the Internet  privacy of children and its corresponding regulations.", "FTC has not promulgated rules under section 5 specific to Internet  privacy. According to FTC staff, the process the agency must use to issue  such rules\u2014known as the Magnuson-Moss procedures\u2014includes steps  that add time and complexity to the rulemaking process. FTC has not  promulgated any regulations using the Magnuson-Moss procedures since  1980. Although FTC has not implemented its section 5 authority by  issuing regulations regarding internet privacy, it has issued regulations  when directed and authorized by Congress to implement other statutory  authorities using a different set of rulemaking procedures. These  procedures, spelled out in section 553 of the Administrative Procedures  Act (APA), are those that most federal agencies typically use to develop  and issue regulations.", "APA section 553 establishes procedures and requirements for what is  known as \u201cinformal\u201d rulemaking, also known as notice-and-comment  rulemaking. Among other things, section 553 generally requires agencies  to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. After  giving interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposal by  providing \u201cdata, views, or arguments,\u201d the statute then requires the  agency to publish the final rule in the Federal Register.", "In contrast, the rulemaking procedures that FTC generally must follow to  issue rules under the FTC Act are the Magnuson-Moss procedures noted  above. These are required by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act  amendments to the FTC Act and impose additional rulemaking steps  beyond APA section 553. These steps include providing the public and  certain congressional committees with an advance notice of proposed  rulemaking (in addition to the notice of proposed rulemaking). FTC\u2019s  rulemaking under Magnuson-Moss also calls for, among other things, oral  hearings, if requested, presided over by an independent hearing officer,  and preparation of a staff report after the conclusion of public hearings,  giving the public the opportunity to comment on the report.", "FTC has promulgated regulations using the APA section 553 notice-and- comment rulemaking procedures when authorized or directed by specific  statutes. For example, the 1998 Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act  (COPPA) required FTC to issue regulations concerning children\u2019s online  privacy; promulgate these regulations using the APA section 553 process;  and, in determining how to treat a violation of the rules, to treat it as an  unfair or deceptive act or practice in most cases. COPPA governs the  online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13  by operators of websites or online services, including mobile applications.  COPPA contained a number of specific requirements that FTC was  directed to implement by regulation, such as requiring websites to post a  complete privacy policy, to notify parents directly about their information  collection practices, and to obtain verifiable parental consent before  collecting personal information from their children or sharing it with others.", "Laws and regulations may be enforced in various ways, for example, by  seeking civil monetary penalties for non-compliance. As mentioned, FTC  has authority to seek civil monetary penalties when a company violates a  settlement agreement or certain statutes or regulations. For example, in  March 2018, FTC announced that it is investigating whether Facebook\u2019s  current privacy practices violate a settlement agreement that the  company entered into with FTC. In the case that resulted in the 2012  settlement, FTC had charged Facebook with deceiving consumers by  telling them they could keep their information private, but then allowing it  to be shared and made public. FTC also has authority to seek civil  monetary penalties for violations of the COPPA statute as well as FTC\u2019s  COPPA regulations.", "In our January 2019 Internet privacy report, we found that during the last  decade, FTC filed 101 Internet privacy enforcement actions to address  practices that the agency alleged were unfair, deceptive, a violation of  COPPA, a violation of a settlement agreement, or a combination of those  reasons. Most of these actions pertained to first-time violations of the FTC  Act for which FTC does not have authority to levy civil monetary  penalties.

Some stakeholders  suggested that such a framework could either designate an existing  agency (such as FTC) as responsible for privacy oversight or create a  new agency. For example, in Canada, the Office of the Privacy  Commissioner, an independent body that reports directly to the  Parliament, was established to protect and promote individuals\u2019 privacy  rights.", "Some stakeholders also stated that the absence of a comprehensive  Internet privacy statute affects FTC\u2019s enforcement. For example, a former  federal enforcement official from another oversight agency said that FTC  is limited in how it can use its authority to take action against companies\u2019  unfair and deceptive trade practices for problematic Internet privacy  practices. Similarly, another former federal enforcement official from  another agency said that FTC is limited in how and against whom it can  use its unfair and deceptive practices authority noting, for example, that it  cannot pursue Internet privacy enforcement against exempted industries.", "In addition, some stakeholders said FTC\u2019s section 5 unfair and deceptive  practices authority may not enable it to fully protect consumers\u2019 Internet  privacy because it can be difficult for FTC to establish that Internet  privacy practices are legally unfair. Because of this difficulty, some  stakeholders said that FTC relies more heavily on its authority to take  enforcement action against deceptive trade practices compared with the  agency\u2019s unfair trade practices authority. This is consistent with the  results of our analysis of FTC cases, which showed that in a majority of  the actions FTC settled, FTC alleged that companies engaged in  practices that were deceptive. Furthermore, a recently decided federal  appeals court case illustrates potential limits on FTC\u2019s enforcement  remedies. The court found that FTC could not direct the company, which  was accused of unfair practices, to create and implement comprehensive  data security measures for the personal information the company stored  on its computer networks as a remedy for the practices alleged.

For example, the breach of an  Equifax online dispute portal from May to July 2017 resulted in the  compromise of records containing the personally identifiable information  of at least 145.5 million consumers in the United States and nearly 1  million consumers outside the United States. We reported in August 2018  that Equifax\u2019s investigation of the breach identified four major factors\u2014  identification, detection, segmenting of access to databases, and data  governance\u2014that allowed the attacker to gain access to its network and  extract information from databases containing personally identifiable  information.

Comprehensive legislation addressing Internet privacy that  establishes specific standards and includes APA notice-and-comment  rulemaking and first-time violation civil penalty authorities could enhance  the federal government\u2019s ability to protect consumer privacy, provide  more certainty in the marketplace as companies innovate and develop  new products using consumer data, and provide better assurance to  consumers that their privacy will be protected. In our January 2019 report,  we recommended that Congress consider developing comprehensive  legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections  and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment.  Issues that should be considered include: which agency or agencies should oversee Internet privacy; what authorities an agency or agencies should have to oversee  Internet privacy, including notice-and-comment rulemaking authority  and first-time violation civil penalty authority; and how to balance consumers\u2019 need for Internet privacy with industry\u2019s  ability to provide services and innovate.", "Chairman Portman, Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
