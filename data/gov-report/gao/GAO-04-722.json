For example, the revisions include the requirement that acquisitions be economically justified on the basis of costs, benefits, and risks. However, the revisions generally do not incorporate 8 best practices relating to the acquisition of commercial component-based systems. For example, they do not address basing any decision to modify commercial components on a thorough analysis of the impact of doing so or on preparing system users for the business process and job roles and responsibilities changes that are embedded in the functionality of commercial IT products. In total, GAO found that DOD's acquisition policies and guidance fully incorporate 8 of the 18 best practices that they were evaluated against, partially incorporate 5 practices, and do not incorporate the remaining 5 practices. DOD intends to expand its acquisition guidance to incorporate additional best practices by September 30, 2004, but department officials cite other priorities as a reason why they have not been able to complete this effort and could not provide a plan specifying how this will be accomplished. Until DOD's revised policies and guidance incorporate key systems acquisition best practices, the risk that system investments will not consistently deliver promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget is increased. DOD's revised policies also do not contain sufficient controls to ensure that DOD components appropriately follow the best practices that are incorporated in its policies and guidance. According to acquisition best practices experts, as well as GAO's internal control guidance, controls are effective if they are backed by measurements that are verified. Although the revised policies and guidance require acquisition managers to examine and, as appropriate, adopt best practices, they do not cite what that examination entails. DOD believes existing controls are sufficient, even though these controls do not provide for measuring and validating the practices' use. Without specific requirements to measure and validate the use of best practices, the risk that they will not be followed increases, which, in turn, increases the risk that system investments will not meet expectations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we assess the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) recently revised policies and guidance for acquiring  business systems for incorporation of acquisition best practices.

In addition, our research shows that best  practices are a significant factor in successful acquisition outcomes,  including increasing the likelihood that programs and projects will be  executed within cost and schedule estimates.", "DOD, GAO, and the Congress have all advocated the use of best practices.  For example, in September 2000, DOD established a steering group to  promote the use of systems acquisition best practices and lessons learned.  Further, our 2001 report cited the benefits of DOD adoption of best  practices and provided recommendations for establishing a mechanism for  sharing best practices throughout DOD. In the fiscal year 2003 Defense  Authorization Act, the Congress used our recommendations in directing  DOD to expand its use of best practices. Specifically, it required the Under  Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L)) and  the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications,  and Intelligence\u2014now called Networks and Information Integration  (NII))\u2014to identify and serve as a clearinghouse for information regarding  software acquisition best practices in the public and private sectors.

Most recently, in  October 2002, the Deputy Secretary of Defense determined that the  existing versions of these three documents required further revisions to  improve acquisition efficiency, flexibility, creativity, and innovation. As a  result, the Deputy Secretary canceled the existing versions of each  document and instructed the Under Secretary for AT&L; the Assistant  Secretary for NII; and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation  (OT&E) to jointly revise the documents.

Examples of  best practices relevant to any business systems acquisition include  ensuring that (1) reasonable planning for all parts of the acquisition occur,  (2) a clear understanding of system requirements exists, and (3) risks are  proactively identified and systematically mitigated. Examples of best  practices relevant to commercial component-based systems acquisitions  include ensuring that (1) commercial product modification is effectively  controlled, (2) relationships among commercial products are understood  before acquisition decisions are made, and (3) the organizational impact of  using new system functionality is proactively managed.

With regard to the 5 practices, DOD stated that it  needed to review each practice further and determine the need for its  emphasis or endorsement in the 5000 series. We understand DOD\u2019s desire  to carefully consider changes to its acquisition policies and guidance, and  believe that such careful deliberation is consistent with the spirit of our  recommendations.", "With regard to the remaining 4 practices that DOD partially agreed with, we  do not agree with the department\u2019s comment that these best practices  adequately exist in the 5000 series. For example, DOD commented that  because its existing policies and guidance provide for the use of integrated  product teams, which, according to DOD, are a means for promoting  collaboration and facilitating communication among stakeholders, its  policies and guidance therefore already provide for communicating  information about management of a given acquisition project to all relevant  project stakeholders. While we do not question the use of integrated  product teams as a way to communicate information, the point of our  recommendation is that there needs to be an explicit recognition in policy  or guidance of the type of information to be communicated and with whom  it is to be communicated. Restated, our recommendation for incorporating  the best practice of communicating acquisition management activities to all  stakeholders is intended to permit communication vehicles, such as  integrated product teams, to be more effective by explicitly providing for  this best practice in relevant policies and guidance. As another example,  we do not agree with DOD\u2019s comment that 2 of the best practices that we  recommended for incorporation in its policies and guidance\u2014preparing  users for the impact that business process changes embedded in  commercial components will have on their roles and responsibilities, and  actively managing changes in how users will use new systems\u2014are already  sufficiently contained in the 5000 series. In particular, while we agree that  the series references an acquisition management toolkit that addresses  these 2 best practices, this reference is provided only once in the 5000  series, and this reference is only in relation to one phase of the acquisition  cycle (the technology development phase). Given the importance and  relevance of these practices to successful implementation of commercial  component-based systems, our position, and thus the basis for our  recommendations, is that the practices\u2019 implementation would be more  likely to occur if the practices were visible and better recognized in all  relevant stages of DOD\u2019s acquisition cycle.", "Also in its comments, DOD did not agree with our recommendations to  develop and implement an explicit plan to govern its ongoing and future  policy and guidance revision activities, specifically stating that the  recommendation was inappropriate and offering updated information on  the status of and associated milestone for completing its activities. While  we have updated our report to include the revised status and milestone  information, we do not agree with DOD that a plan governing these efforts  is not needed. Given the importance of DOD's acquisition policies and  guidance, and the need for their continuous review and update to reflect  new acquisition best practices, we believe that having an explicit plan that  defines how and when these policies and guidance will be incorporated is  essential.

Next, we researched prior GAO  reports; the work of federally funded research and development  organizations, such as the Software Engineering Institute and The  Aerospace Corporation; and other authoritative sources to identify  business systems acquisition best practices. Our research produced 18 best  practices, including associated activities, that we placed into two  categories\u2014one category for the practices that are relevant to any business  systems acquisition and one category for the practices that are relevant to  commercial component-based business systems acquisitions. In particular,  we drew extensively from the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Software  Acquisition Capability Maturity Model.  In doing so, we selected practices  from the model\u2019s repeatable level of process maturity, which is level two on  the model\u2019s five-level scale. We used the repeatable level of process  maturity because it is intended to provide the necessary process discipline  to allow an organization to repeat earlier successes on similar projects. In  addition, we included one Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model  level-three process area\u2014risk management\u2014because many experts  consider it to be one of the most important process areas. We did not  attempt to develop an exhaustive list of best practices and, in fact, fully  recognize that additional best practices exist, such as ensuring that the  appropriate level of human capital knowledge, skills, and abilities are  employed, as well as that additional activities for the practices that we have  identified exist, such as those configuration management activities  associated with identifying, controlling, reporting on, and auditing  configuration items and components. For the purposes of this report, we  identified those practices that are embodied, recognized, and accepted  acquisition models or frameworks, as well as those practices that are now  being recognized as being unique to commercial component-based systems  and for which there appears to be general agreement, including agreement  with DOD officials responsible for revising the 5000 series, that the  practices are relevant and important. Last, we analyzed each of the DOD  5000 series documents to determine whether the documents addressed,  either directly or indirectly by reference to another authoritative  document, the 18 best practices that we identified. Based on this analysis,  we judged whether the 5000 series documents fully, partially, or did not  incorporate each best practice. In making these judgments, we used the  following criteria:  To fully incorporate the practice, the 5000 series addressed all of the  practice\u2019s activities.", "To partially incorporate the practice, the 5000 series addressed some,  but not all, of the practice\u2019s activities.", "To not incorporate the practice, the 5000 series did not address any of  the practice\u2019s activities.", "Additionally, we provided the DOD officials responsible for revising the  5000 series with the 18 practices that we identified to obtain their views on  whether the practices were relevant to DOD business systems acquisitions.  The officials agreed that they were. We also requested that these officials  perform their own assessment of the 5000 series against these practices,  and we used these officials\u2019 assessment in making our judgments as to  whether the practices were fully, partially, or not incorporated into DOD\u2019s  acquisition policies and guidance. For a number of the activities, DOD  identified the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement as evidence that the activity was  being performed within a particular practice. We accepted that as proof  that the activity was being covered within DOD\u2019s business systems  acquisition policy.", "To address our second objective, we researched federal internal control  standards and controls inherent in the business systems acquisition best  practices that we identified. In particular, we reviewed the Software  Engineering Institute\u2019s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model  framework and GAO\u2019s internal control standards. We then analyzed DOD\u2019s  revised acquisition policies and guidance to identify whether these controls  were cited and to provide assurance that relevant best practices were being  followed. We also interviewed DOD officials responsible for revising the  5000 series to determine reasons why controls were addressed or not  addressed in the policies and guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Additional information on each of the 18 best practices that we identified is  provided in this appendix."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Best Practices Relevant to Any IT Business Systems Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["Purpose: To ensure that reasonable planning for all parts of the acquisition  is conducted.", "Description:  Acquisition planning is the process for conducting and  documenting acquisition planning activities beginning early and covering  all parts of the project.

Such alignment is needed to ensure that acquired systems can  interoperate and are not unnecessarily duplicative of one another.  Exceptions to this alignment requirement are permitted, but only when  justified and only when granted an explicit waiver from the architecture. A  particular architectural consideration is whether requirements that extend  beyond the specific system being acquired should be considered when  selecting system components.

It involves recognizing  that the logical and physical relationships among products impact one  another. This is necessary because commercial products are built around  each vendor\u2019s functional and architectural assumptions and paradigms,  such as approaches to error handling and data access, and these  assumptions and paradigms are likely to be different among products from  different sources. Such differences complicate product integration.  Further, some commercial products have built-in dependencies with other  products that, if not known, can further complicate integration.", "Activity: (1) Decisions about the acquisition of commercial components  are based on deliberate and thorough research, analysis, and evaluation of  the components\u2019 interdependencies.4.  Legacy Systems Integration Planning Purpose: To ensure reasonable planning for integration of commercial  products with existing systems.", "Description:  Legacy systems integration planning is the process for  ensuring that the time and resources needed to integrate existing systems  with the system being acquired are identified and provided for. It involves  identifying which legacy systems will interact with the system being  acquired and what kinds and levels of testing are required.

Organization Change Management Purpose: To ensure that the organizational impact of using new system  functionality is proactively managed.", "Description: Organization change management relative to commercial  component-based systems is the process for preparing system users for the  business process changes that will accompany implementation of the  system. It involves engaging users and communicating the nature of  anticipated changes to system users through training on how jobs will  change.

It involves planning and executing  acquisitions in a manner that recognizes four competing interests: defined  system requirements, the architectural environment (current and future) in  which the system needs to operate, acquisition cost and schedule  constraints, and the availability of products in the commercial marketplace  (current and future). This analysis should be performed early and  continuously throughout an acquisition\u2019s life cycle.", "Activity: (1) Investment decisions throughout a system\u2019s life cycle are  based on tradeoffs among the availability of commercial products (current  and future), the architectural environment in which the system is to operate (current and future), defined system requirements, and acquisition  cost/schedule constraints.8. Vendor and Product Research and Evaluation Purpose: To ensure that vendor and product characteristics are understood  before acquisition decisions are made.", "Description: Vendor and product research and evaluation relative to  commercial component-based systems is the process for obtaining reliable  information about both the product being considered and the vendor  offering the product. It involves taking additional steps beyond vendor  representations, such as obtaining information about the vendor\u2019s history,  obtaining information on the vendor\u2019s business strategy relative to  evolution and support of the product, and evaluating copies of the product  in a test environment.", "Activities: (1) Commercial component and vendor options are researched,  evaluated/tested, and understood, both early and continuously.

We disagree. While we have updated our report to reflect the additional  information provided in DOD\u2019s comments on the status of its efforts  and the associated milestone, the importance of revising and  maintaining DOD's acquisition policies and guidance, and their  incorporation of acquisition best practices, makes it essential to have  an explicit plan. Among other things, a plan would highlight the  resource constraints that this revision effort has been subject to, would  allow measurement against defined milestones, and would allow  disclosure of progress and impediments.  2. See comment 1. 3. We do not question DOD\u2019s statement that it has an initial repository of  custom software components that can help adapt commercial  components to defense use and reuse. However, this repository does  not satisfy the product line requirements in this best practice and our  recommendation. According to the Software Engineering Institute, the  product line requirements best practice involves more than just reuse.  Under the approach described in DOD\u2019s comments, reuse generally  involves items, such as software modules or components, that  developers are encouraged to use. However, the product line  requirements best practice is not simply encouraging reuse of items in a  repository. Rather, it is planned, enabled, and enforced reuse of such  assets as requirements, models, and architectures that have been  designed and optimized for use in multiple systems. In short, it is  proactive rather than reactive reuse.  4. We have modified our recommendation to use the terminology  \u201cacquisition project management activities\u201d instead of \u201cacquisition  management activities\u201d to eliminate any confusion. Further, we do not  question DOD\u2019s use of integrated product teams as a way to  communicate information. Further, the point of our recommendation is  that there needs to be an explicit recognition in policy and guidance of  the type of information to be communicated and to whom.  Incorporating this best practice is based on the need to ensure that  communication vehicles, such as integrated product teams, are  effective.  5. We agree that the 5000 series contains information on acquisition risk  management, as we state in our report, and that one of the purposes of  DOD\u2019s acquisition framework is to reduce risks. However, there is no  provision in DOD\u2019s acquisition policy or guidelines to ensure that the  status of identified risks are discussed at key decision points. For  example, DOD policy states that a criterion for passing milestone A is  \u201cmanagement and mitigation of technology risk.\u201d However, it does not  provide for what is to be done to manage and mitigate risks, and it does  not provide for reviewing risk status at milestones B or C.  6. While we agree that the toolkit provides relevant change management  information, the toolkit is referenced only once in the 5000 series; and  the reference is only in relation to one phase of the acquisition cycle  (the technology development phase). Given the importance and  relevance of this practice to the successful implementation of  commercial component-based systems, our position, and thus the basis  for our recommendation, is that the best practice\u2019s implementation  would more likely occur if it was visible and recognized in all relevant  stages of DOD\u2019s acquisition cycle.  7.", "See comment 6. 8. While the regulations and guidance that DOD cited and referenced in its  acquisition policies discuss the use of information on contractors\u2019 past  performance, they do not discuss evaluating systems integration  contractors on their ability to implement commercial components,  which is the point of the best practice. Further, DOD\u2019s objection to  incorporating this best practice is not consistent with its own  comments. Specifically, DOD commented that it has already taken  steps, through its enterprise systems initiative, to establish blanket  agreements with five contractors who were evaluated on, among other  things, \u201cexplicitly proven abilities to implement commercial systems  solutions.\u201d Additionally, while we appreciate DOD\u2019s concern that  incorporation of this best practice can have unintended consequences,  it is important to also recognize that our recommendation is not  intended to restrict a contracting officer\u2019s options. Rather, it is intended  to be one of the many factors considered in the source selection  process when it is relevant.  9. We support the Defense Acquisition Executive\u2019s decision to add more  specifics on systems engineering to the 5000 series, including  provisions that address this best practice and recommendation.  10. See comment 8.  11. We disagree. While we do not question that statutory and regulatory  compliance are referenced in DOD\u2019s integrated process team and  milestone decision point processes, we do not believe that these  reviews are adequately defined with respect to implementation of best  practices because DOD\u2019s policy does not require that the practices\u2019 use  be measured and verified. Rather, it leaves these reviews to the  discretion of the program manager and investment decision authority.  As we state in our report, not requiring that the use of best practices be  measured and verified increases the chance that the practices will not  be followed. Therefore, our position remains that DOD\u2019s policies do not  provide effective controls for ensuring that best practices are  appropriately followed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Carl L.
