Estimates suggest that a significant portion of these children had one or more special needs, such as a medical condition or membership in a minority group, that may discourage or delay their adoption. Federal support in the form of adoption subsidies and incentive payments to states is available to promote special needs adoption. This report (1) identifies the major challenges to placing and keeping special needs children in adoptive homes, (2) examines what states and HHS have done to facilitate special needs adoptions, and (3) assesses how well the Adoption Assistance Program and the Adoption Incentives Program have worked to facilitate special needs adoptions, and determines if changes might be needed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to state child welfare officials, limited resources, court processes, and delays in completing interstate placements challenged the adoption of children with special needs by hindering recruitment of adoptive families and delaying the adoption process. In particular, adoptive parents in many states received lower subsidies and fewer services than foster parents. In addition, child welfare officials, court staff, and judges said that the adoption process can take months to complete because hearings to terminate parents' rights are hard to schedule and may involve appeals. Further, officials said that interstate placements are often hampered by delays in completing home studies of prospective families, although no data exist to assess the timeliness of such placements. States and HHS have developed and implemented strategies and programs to promote special needs adoptions, but few evaluations measure their effectiveness. Four of the 5 states we visited sponsored post adoption resource centers. However, only 9 of 49 states responding to a relevant question in our survey indicated that they had evaluated the effectiveness of their services. At the federal level, HHS supported and promoted local innovation, provided technical assistance, and disseminated information, but the agency has done little to assess the effectiveness of the programs it has funded. When HHS has taken steps to have states assess funded projects, the agency has not ensured sufficient rigor to assess effectiveness. The Adoption Assistance and Adoption Incentives Programs have provided support for special needs adoptions, but data are lacking to determine if changes are needed to better facilitate adoption. The former uses an income eligibility threshold that is more restrictive than other cash assistance programs' standards of need and may not include all who might otherwise qualify. Since 1998, the Adoption Incentives Program has provided financial awards to almost all states for increasing adoptions, but does not provide a specific inducement for interstate placements. Data to track and credit states for collaborating on interstate placements are not available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On September 30, 2002, the most recent date for which these data were  available, about 126,000 foster children were reported by the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) to be waiting for adoption. These  children, on average, were 8 years old, had been in foster care for nearly  half their lives, and 55 percent were living with an unrelated foster care  provider. According to federal program officials, a significant portion of  these children had at least one special need, such as a medical condition  or membership in a minority group that might make adoptive placements  challenging. Further, in some cases, the most appropriate adoptive  families reside in one state while waiting children reside in another.  Therefore, interstate placements, which require child welfare agencies in  both states to work together, are critical to finalizing their adoption.", "In an effort to promote the adoption of children with special needs,  Congress authorized the Adoption Assistance Program in 1980 under Title  IV-E of the Social Security Act. Through this program, the federal  government partially reimburses states for subsidies they provide to  adoptive parents of eligible special needs children to assist them with  related caretaking expenses. The act defines children as having special  needs if the state has determined that the child should not or could not be  returned to the home of his or her parents, and certain factors, such as  age; membership in a sibling unit or minority group; or emotional, mental,  or physical conditions would make finding an appropriate adoptive home  difficult.", "In order to qualify for the federal subsidy reimbursement, children must  meet the special needs definition and one of several eligibility criteria.  These criteria include having been removed from the home pursuant to a  judicial determination and being eligible for the Aid to Families with  Dependent Children (AFDC) program, as it existed in 1996. In each of the  fiscal years 2001 through 2003, the federal adoption assistance subsidy  reimbursement, including related administrative and training expenses,  exceeded $1 billion. In fiscal year 2002, the latest year for which HHS  could provide figures, the federal government partially reimbursed states  for adoptive families\u2019 subsidies for about 66 percent of foster children  adopted.", "In addition to the adoption subsidy reimbursement, the Adoption  Incentives Program, created by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997  (ASFA) and amended in 2003, provides rewards for states that increase the  number of foster care adoptions, special needs adoptions, or adoptions of  children age 9 and older. Since the program\u2019s inception through 2003, the  most recent year for which data are available, the federal government has  awarded nearly $178 million to states in adoption incentive payments.", "To better understand the issues related to the placement and adoption of  special needs children, we (1) identified the major challenges to placing  and keeping special needs children in adoptive homes, (2) examined what  states and the Department of Health and Human Services have done to  facilitate special needs adoptions, and (3) assessed how well the Adoption  Assistance Program and the Adoption Incentives Program have worked to  facilitate special needs adoptions and what changes, if any, might be  needed to further facilitate adoptions.", "To conduct our work, we gathered and analyzed data from several  sources. We developed and conducted a nationwide survey of adoption  directors in all 50 states, as well as those in Washington, D.C., and  Puerto Rico, and we received 50 responses. We visited 5 states \u2014Georgia,  Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, and Oregon\u2014where we spoke  with child welfare agency officials, caseworkers, parents, court personnel,  and private adoption agency officials to better understand states\u2019  strategies for placing children with appropriate adoptive families. We  selected these states for diversity in the size of their foster care  populations, location, and program administration, and for the different  degree of success they have had in finalizing adoptions. In addition, we  selected and reviewed 10 states\u2019 Child and Family Services Plans and  Annual Progress and Services Reports\u2014documents that HHS requires as  part of its ongoing child welfare oversight\u2014in order to obtain information  on how states were using the adoption incentive funds. Further, we  reviewed federal adoption assistance and adoption incentive laws and  regulations, as well as additional adoption-related research and  evaluations conducted by HHS, the states, and nongovernmental  organizations. We also interviewed HHS officials and staff from  independent child welfare organizations, and we conducted discussion  groups with adoptive parents and adoption program managers from  around the country at two national conferences. We conducted our work  between May 2004 and April 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. A more detailed discussion of our scope  and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Most children enter foster care when the state\u2019s child welfare agency  determines that they have been subjected to abuse or neglect and it is not  in their best interest to immediately return home. On September 30,  2002\u2014the latest date for which HHS figures were available for our review,  532,000 children were in foster care in the United States. Generally, after  investigating the circumstances that contributed to the abuse or neglect,  state child welfare agency staff develop a plan to help the parent make  improvements and create a safe and stable family environment. ASFA  requires that states hold a permanency planning hearing at least once  every 12 months to determine, among other things, when and if  reunification with the child\u2019s family is a safe and practical option. HHS  estimated that just over 50 percent of the 281,000 children who exited  foster care during fiscal year 2002 were reunified with a parent or  principal caretaker.", "If the parent has not followed child welfare agency plans or has failed to  change behaviors to make reunification safe, the state may identify an  alternative goal to establish a permanent home for the child. These goals  include adoption, independence, or legal guardianship. Independent living  arrangements may be attained once children reach the age of 18\u2014or 21 in  some jurisdictions\u2014and have not been reunified with their families or  adopted and for whom federal reimbursement for foster care expenditures  is no longer available. Legal guardianship is a judicially created  relationship between a child and a caretaker whereby the caretaker is  awarded custody and decision-making rights with respect to the child. An  October 2004 report indicated that 35 states and the District of Columbia  had established subsidized guardianship programs to help ensure  permanent families for children. The federal government typically does  not reimburse states for costs associated with subsidized guardianship.  However, 7 states have operated or are currently operating federally  funded guardianship projects through their participation in the Title IV-E  waiver program. HHS data show that 4 percent of children exited foster  care through guardianship in fiscal year 2002.", "HHS reports that in fiscal year 2002, 17 percent of children exited foster  care through adoption. Unless a parent voluntarily relinquishes his or her  rights, states must petition the court for a termination of parental rights  (TPR) before a foster child can be adopted. ASFA requires, with few  exceptions, that states file a TPR petition when a child has been in foster  care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, but ASFA does not address the  length of time needed to grant the petition to terminate. Before the  termination is completed, states can begin to recruit for an adoptive family  and even place a child in a pre-adoptive home with an interested family  after this family has been approved. The adoptive family approval process  generally involves background checks and a home study\u2014a detailed  examination of a family\u2019s circumstances, including its employment and  finances and family medical history\u2014to ensure that the family will provide  a safe and suitable placement. The key steps in the process for adopting  children from state child welfare agencies are summarized in figure 1.", "In order to be eligible to receive federal funding, ASFA requires that states  do not delay or deny the placement of a child for adoption when an  approved family is available outside the jurisdiction that currently handles  the child\u2019s case and requires states to facilitate the timely adoptive  placement of children through the effective use of cross jurisdictional  resources. States govern the placement of children across state lines  through a compact known as the Interstate Compact on the Placement of  Children (ICPC). At the time of publication, the compact was being  rewritten to improve the process of placing children across state lines.", "Families who adopt children with special needs can receive monthly  subsidies. The Adoption Assistance Program, under Title IV-E of the Social  Security Act, authorizes the federal government to partially reimburse the  states for the subsidies they provide to families who adopt special needs  children. Payments to the parents of an eligible child with special needs  can include both one-time adoption assistance for expenses such as  attorney fees and ongoing monthly assistance, which is used for any  identifiable needs of the child. Special needs children must meet at least  one criterion from the following list: (1) the child is a dependent child who  would have been eligible for AFDC, as it existed in 1996; (2) the child is  eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI); (3) the child is a child of  a minor parent who is in foster care already and receiving foster care  maintenance payments under Title IV-E; or (4) the child received adoption  assistance previously, but the adoption dissolved or the adoptive parents  died. If the child does not meet these eligibility criteria, but still meets the  state\u2019s definition of special needs, the state can provide a subsidy to the  child\u2019s adoptive family, but cannot claim federal reimbursement.", "The amount of the subsidy is determined through negotiations between  the adoptive parents and a representative of the state agency based on the  needs of the child and circumstances of the adoptive family. The subsidies  are intended to help adoptive families manage the cost of caring for their  special needs children. Adopted children often have difficulties with issues  of loss, attachment, and identity formation that can lead to behavioral and  developmental problems and require professional treatment. In addition,  special needs children with physical and other mental disabilities may  require specialized care and treatment. Adoption subsidies are available to  families until children reach age 18 but may be extended to age 21 if a  mental or physical disability necessitates continuation.", "In addition to reimbursing states for the adoption subsidies, the federal  government pays adoption incentive funds to qualifying states. Under the  Adoption Promotion Act of 2003, (Pub. L. No. 108-145), which amended  the Adoption Incentives Program, a state is eligible for an award if the  number of adoptions from the foster care system for the fiscal year under  review exceeds the state\u2019s baseline year, the highest number of adoptions  in any previous year, beginning with fiscal year 2002. States may also  receive an incentive payment based on the adoptions of children having  special needs or children older than age 9. Specifically, when a state  exceeds its baseline year in each category, it will receive an incentive  payment of $4,000 for each child adopted from foster care, $2,000 for the  adoption of each special needs child younger than age 9, and $4,000 for the  adoption of each child aged 9 or older. Thus, the program encourages  adoption generally while emphasizing the adoption of children with  special needs. In fiscal year 2003, the federal government paid states more  than $17 million in incentive payments through this program.", "Title IV-E adoption subsidies and adoption incentive awards are not the  only federal assistance available to support adoption. Funds authorized  under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, the Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families program (TANF), and the Social Services Block Grant  (SSBG) have also been used to facilitate and sustain adoptions. We  reported that in fiscal year 2002 states used more than $5 million in Title  IV-B funds on adoption subsidy payments, more than $9 million on  recruitment and training for foster and adoptive parents, and nearly  $29 million on adoption support and preservation services. A recent  survey on states\u2019 fiscal year 2002 allocations of federal funds for child  welfare found that states reported spending $56 million in TANF funds,  $44 million in Title IV-B funds, and $22 million in SSBG funds on adoption  and support services for adopted children.", "HHS\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau administers and oversees federal funding to  states for child welfare services under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social  Security Act, and states provide these child welfare services, either  directly or indirectly through contracts with private agencies. Among  other activities, HHS staff are responsible for developing appropriate  policies and procedures for states to follow and conducting administrative  reviews to ensure that states are in compliance with established policies.  HHS staff from its 10 regional offices provide technical assistance to  states, review state planning documents, assist with state data system  reviews, and assess states\u2019 use of funds for foster care maintenance  payments. Between 2001 and 2004, HHS completed its first round of Child  and Family Services Reviews (CFSR), which assessed child welfare  outcomes in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These  reviews assessed states\u2019 progress and achievement in many areas and  found weaknesses related to adoption. For example, HHS reported that at  least 27 states experienced challenges seeking terminations of parental  rights in accordance with ASFA. In addition, HHS also reported that 37 of  the 52 states failed to meet the national standard of finalizing adoptions  within 24 months of the child\u2019s most recent entry into foster care.", "To evaluate states\u2019 performance on child welfare indicators, such as timely  adoptions, HHS relies, in part, on its Adoption and Foster Care Analysis  and Reporting System (AFCARS) to capture, report, and analyze  information collected by the states. In addition, AFCARS is used to  generate annual reports on foster care and adoption programs nationwide,  and it is the primary source of data for the Adoption Incentives Program.  We reported that the AFCARS data were not reliable and recommended  that HHS make improvements. HHS officials agreed with our findings and  stated that several data definitions in AFCARS would be updated and  revised. In June 2004, HHS officials stated that the regulations related to  making these changes were being drafted. As of April 2005, the regulations  had not been issued, and HHS officials said they did not have a specific  planned release date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Reported That Limited Resources, Court-Related Processes, and Interstate Placement Delays Impede the Adoption of Special Needs Children", "paragraphs": ["States we visited reported that limited resources, court-related processes,  and delays in completing interstate placements were the major challenges  to special needs adoption.

Officials also reported that  delays in completing home studies hindered adoptions that involved  interstate placements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Adoption Officials Report That Limited Resources Impede Adoptions", "paragraphs": ["In part because of resource limitations, adoptive parents in many states  received lower subsidies and fewer services than foster parents. Officials  in 4 of the 5 states we visited told us that budget issues in their states have  caused reductions in or eliminations of adoption services. States are  prohibited by statute from providing monthly adoption assistance  payments that exceed the foster care maintenance payments that would  have been paid if the child had been in a foster home. Officials in 4 of the  states we visited said that most special needs children are adopted by their  foster parents, and a 2002 report found that nearly two-thirds of children  adopted from the child welfare system are adopted by their foster  parents. In responding to a question in our survey, 31 of 49 states  reported that adoption assistance payments were lower than foster care  maintenance payments in those states, and more than half of the 31 states  viewed lower adoption payments as a moderate to very great hindrance to  the adoption of special needs children. According to an official in one of  the states we visited, adoption subsidies are critical to helping families  who adopt special needs children pay for the care and services these  children need. Families adopting special needs children may face  substantial costs for medical care and mental health services, and several  of the experts we interviewed explained that prospective adoptive families  may hesitate to adopt special needs children because they are concerned  about the costs of providing services to meet their needs. In addition,  services, such as respite care, provided by the state for foster children may  be provided to a lesser degree or not at all to adopted children or to  children being cared for by legal guardians. Our survey asked states about  13 types of services. For 9 of the 13 services, fewer states reported  providing the services to adopted children than to foster children; for  every service, the fewest number of states extended these services to  children in guardianship arrangements. (See fig. 2.) Further, officials in 4  of the 5 states we visited confirmed that subsidies and services declined  when foster parents became adoptive parents.", "THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK  In addition, many states reported that it was difficult to recruit families  and limited resources affected their efforts. Nearly half of the 49 states  responding to a relevant question in our survey indicated that difficulty  recruiting families was a great or very great challenge to the adoption of  special needs children. In 4 of the 5 states we visited, child welfare staff  we interviewed told us that high caseloads limited the time caseworkers  could spend recruiting families and placing children. In some cases, tight  budgets led officials to make personnel decisions that made fewer  experienced staff available to recruit adoptive parents. In Georgia, officials  explained that because of budget and staffing constraints, instead of  having workers who could specialize in various processes, such as  recruiting adoptive parents, child welfare workers had to handle multiple  aspects of each case. Further, in Michigan, officials explained that a  budget saving plan to encourage early retirement led many experienced  child welfare staff to retire. While the child welfare agency hired new  workers, nearly all of them were inexperienced and needed both formal  and on-the-job training. As a result, according to the foster and adoptive  parents we interviewed in that state, these inexperienced workers were  less effective than experienced workers at meeting families\u2019 needs.", "Additionally, in part because of staffing and resource constraints, there are  concerns about how long it takes to place children with families. Both a  home study and a background check are required for adoptive families,  but according to adoptive and waiting parents in one state, high caseloads  limited the time caseworkers could spend completing these studies, and  frequently it was several months from the time families indicated interest  in adopting until their home studies were completed. In addition, states  typically provide adoptive families with an orientation to the adoption  process and relevant training, but caseworkers in one of the states we  visited told us that because of resource constraints, training of prospective  adoptive parents is limited, particularly in the rural areas.", "After home studies are completed and the families have been approved,  families often wait for suitable placements. One study found that the  matching and placement phase involved more uncertainty and  misunderstanding for prospective adoptive families than any other step in  the adoption process. The same study also found that one-quarter of  potential adoptive parents felt that they were not given an accurate  estimate of the time it would take for a placement. Another report noted  that infrequent contact between caregivers\u2014foster parents and  guardians\u2014and case managers resulted in caregivers leaving the foster  care system and not pursuing adoption. In 3 of the states we visited,  foster, adoptive, and pre-adoptive parents told us that because of staff  shortages, high caseloads, and other duties, caseworkers did not give them  the attention they needed. As a result, some adoptive and pre-adoptive  parents who were trained lost interest or sought children through other  means, such as private placements. In New Mexico, almost all of the  potential adoptive families we talked with in one rural area had been  waiting for more than a year to adopt. They expressed frustration over the  lack of contact from the child welfare agency while they knew that there  were many children waiting for placements. Correspondingly, 20 of 46  states responding to an open-ended question in our survey reported that  high caseloads or insufficient staff were among the three greatest  challenges to facilitating or finalizing the adoption of special needs  children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Cited Court Delays as a Challenge to the Adoption of Special Needs Children", "paragraphs": ["Court-related delays were also cited as a challenge to the adoption of  special needs children. Twenty-two of the 46 states responding to a  relevant question in our survey indicated that court-related delays were  among the three greatest challenges to the adoption of special needs  children. In 3 of the states we visited, judges told us that it was hard to  schedule termination of parental rights hearings because court dockets  were full and because of the many parties involved in some hearings. In  some cases, the participants include the judge, biological parents, foster  parents, the caseworker, and multiple attorneys\u2014one for each child in a  sibling group, one for each biological parent, and one for the caseworker  or child welfare department. Scheduling a hearing date that fits everyone\u2019s  schedule and allows all parties to attend can be difficult.", "In addition to difficulties in scheduling hearings, termination proceedings  can last months. Many judges want to be sure that the biological parents  have had sufficient opportunity to remedy the problems that led to their  children being removed. If a parent seems to be making progress, even if  the parent is not yet ready to resume custody of his or her child, the judge  may postpone a decision. Even in cases in which the likelihood for  reunification is low, attorneys in 3 of the 5 states we visited told us that  some courts hesitate to terminate parental rights until adoptive families  are found for children. According to HHS\u2019s analysis of its Child and Family  Services Reviews, in over half of the states reviewed between 2002 and  2004, many judges were reluctant to terminate parental rights either  because adequate services had not been provided to parents or because an  adoptive family had not been identified. Yet while some judges may not  want to create a legal orphan before an adoptive placement is identified,  judges we spoke with in 3 of the 5 states we visited said that the  identification of prospective adoptive families did not play a role in their  decision to terminate parental rights. Furthermore, the termination  process can be delayed if an appeal is filed by a biological parent or a  relative raises an objection. In Michigan, court officials told us that  children\u2019s relatives may come forward to protest when such a decision is  imminent. Relatives\u2019 objections can create delays because the child  welfare agency must determine whether the relatives can be involved in  the children\u2019s care, and the court may also schedule further hearings  concerning the details of their objections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays Completing Home Studies Have Hindered Some Interstate Adoptive Placements", "paragraphs": ["Delays in completing home studies impeded the interstate placement of  children and therefore delayed the adoption process. Of the 49 states  responding to our survey, 26 cited the lengthy process to place children  across state lines as a moderate to very great hindrance to the adoption of  special needs children. In the course of seeking an adoptive placement,  sometimes a child welfare agency in the state where the child resides finds  a suitable family in another state. The agency in the state with the child,  known as the sending state, seeks a placement in the state where a  potential adoptive family lives\u2014the receiving state. Generally,  caseworkers from the sending state request that a receiving state complete  a home study of the prospective family. However, caseworkers in the  receiving state may assign this request a low priority because conducting  the home study would take time away from their own caseloads.  According to a survey of state officials conducted by the American Public  Human Services Association (APHSA), 32 of the 45 respondents cited  staffing and workload issues as the leading cause for delay in completing  home studies requested by other states. Another frequently cited cause of  delay was the low priority assigned to interstate placements by local  workers. According to current interstate compact guidelines, 6 weeks or  30 working days is the recommended processing time from the date the  receiving state gets notice from the sending state until the placement  request is approved or denied. However, APHSA notes that sometimes the  receiving state does not complete home studies for many months. In some  cases, therefore, children linger in foster care when interstate placements  are delayed.", "While the Adoption and Safe Families Act includes a provision that directs  states to develop plans to facilitate the timely adoptive placement of  children through the effective use of cross-jurisdictional resources, there  are no national data to assess the timeliness of these placements. Data  from AFCARS can show whether or not children were adopted outside  their home state, and they also can be used to track the length of time  from entry into foster care to termination of parental rights and adoption.  However the system does not capture which states were involved or when  placement requests were made or completed. Without such specific data,  HHS does not know the extent to which states are cooperating, which  states may need to improve their processes, or whether certain states are  burdened by high numbers of requests for home studies in support of  interstate placement. APHSA has developed a database for tracking  interstate adoptions. Unlike HHS\u2019s system, this database tracks the total  number of children any participating state sent out of state or received for  adoption and the total number of finalized adoptions a state made after  receiving requests from other states.

Many states have  observed and participated in National Adoption Awareness Month each  November, and some states have promoted adoptions by designating other  special days. For example, officials in Massachusetts told us that they  finalized 32 adoptions on a single day in May 2004. According to the  National Adoption Day organization, more than 3,100 adoptions were  finalized during National Adoption Awareness Month in 2003.", "To help facilitate adoption, states have contracted with private adoption  agencies to recruit and train prospective families, developed Web sites,  and partnered with adoption exchanges. Of the 49 states responding to our  survey, 40 indicated that contracts with private agencies were an essential  or very important recruitment method. In addition, all 5 of our site visit  states, as well as others, operated Web sites that include photo listings of  children awaiting adoption as well as information on adoption procedures  and resources for prospective adoptive families. Also, 4 of the 5 states we  visited, as well as other states, partnered with adoption exchanges\u2014 information and referral services for prospective adoptive families\u2014to  operate electronic registries of waiting children. For example, Michigan\u2019s  adoption resource exchange operates a Web site containing a calendar of  training opportunities and events, a searchable database of children  awaiting adoptive families, and general information on the adoption  process.", "In addition, most states used targeted recruitment strategies that focused  on a specific group of children. Of the 49 states responding to a question in  our survey on methods for recruiting adoptive families for special needs  children, 37 reported that television advertisements and stories were  essential or very important, 35 states reported that advertisements in  magazines and other periodicals were essential or very important, and 22  responded similarly regarding mass mailings or flyer distribution. For  example, Kentucky officials noted in our survey that they created a special  television public service announcement to recruit adoptive families for  special needs children. The advertisement was filmed at the Governor\u2019s  home and included children with special needs. Another state, Georgia,  issued a photo listing book, entitled \u201cMy Turn Now,\u201d that includes those  children who have been awaiting adoption for the longest period of time.", "Many states also hosted adoption promotion events throughout the year  that targeted certain children, such as minorities or those in sibling  groups. In Massachusetts, for example, the state agency has partnered  with a local furniture store to host several adoption parties. The goal of  the event is to help match prospective families with those children in  attendance. State officials credit this business partnership with a number  of successful adoptive matches. Another targeted strategy, known as the  Heart Gallery, has been under way in New Mexico since 2001 and has also  been implemented by a number of other states. This event has showcased  professional photographs of children waiting to be adopted. Though the  organizers in New Mexico have not collected data to track matches  resulting from participation in the gallery event, one organizing official  told us that several children who were showcased at the events have been  adopted.  Further, a Massachusetts official stated that within 2 months of  implementing the Heart Gallery in that state, placements were found for  half of the children showcased.  In addition, some states are working with  local community organizations and churches to help recruit and place  particular children in adoptive homes. According to a National Governor\u2019s  Association report, 30 states and the District of Columbia have  participated in an adoption program called One Church One Child, since  1980. The program seeks to recruit one family from each African-American  church to adopt an African-American child."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Provided Some Services and Resources to Help Sustain Adoptions", "paragraphs": ["As indicated earlier in figure 2, states are providing some post-adoption  services and resources, which many experts have said are critical to  helping families sustain adoptions. Generally, post-adoption services are  provided with the recognition that parents adopting children often face  challenges they did not anticipate and for which they are not fully  prepared, especially when the children have special needs. These services  are intended to help reduce the number of adoptions that are dissolved.  As previously noted, states generally provide fewer services to adoptive  families than to foster families. However, 4 of the 5 states we visited have  established centers to assist families after their adoptions were finalized\u2014 see table 1.", "However, according to state adoption officials, caseworkers, and adoptive  parents we met during our site visits, better post adoptive mental health  services are needed. In addition, several of the experts we interviewed  expressed the opinion that many mental heath providers needed to  develop and improve their competencies in adoption-related topics such  as trust, abandonment, and attachment. Some states have established  programs to do just this. For example, New Jersey\u2019s Adoption Certificate  Program, in coordination with Rutgers University School of Social Work  and Continuing Education Department, developed a 45-hour postgraduate  training program leading to an adoption certificate for mental health  clinicians. The certificate program is intended to increase the knowledge  of mental health practitioners regarding the core issues facing adoptive  families, and to expand their clinical skills in attachment-based, family- focused therapeutic interventions. Oregon\u2019s efforts present another  example. Portland State University, in collaboration with Oregon\u2019s  Department of Human Services and Oregon\u2019s Post Adoption Resource  Center, has also developed a postgraduate training certificate program for  mental health providers working with adoptive families. The training  program includes hands-on strategies for coaching and working with  adoptive parents to address their children\u2019s challenging behaviors.  According to program officials, the program has trained 27 therapists, and  15 more are expected to complete the program by June of 2005.  The  names of these therapists have been or will be forwarded to Oregon\u2019s  adoptions resource center to be included in referral information sent to  adoptive families in need of mental health therapists.", "Most states have not conducted evaluations of their post adoption  services. In responding to our survey, 9 states indicated that they have  completed evaluations of post adoption services; 8 states said that they  had evaluations under way, and 30 informed us that they had not  conducted any evaluations prior to their completion of our survey.  Evaluations play an important role in improving program operations. They  can identify which services are most important to families, as well as help  managers determine whether the services are achieving desired goals and  if they can be provided more efficiently. Evaluation results can help  individual states improve their programs and, if shared, can provide other  states with valuable information to help avoid costly mistakes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Administered Many Programs to Help States\u2019 Adoption Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Various HHS activities have helped states\u2019 adoption efforts.  Over the  years, HHS has administered programs, sponsored campaigns, funded a  resource center, and taken steps to disseminate information about  adoptions.  According to HHS officials, special needs children constitute  the majority of children waiting for adoptive homes, and as such, they are  the beneficiaries of the agency\u2019s efforts to support adoption.", "HHS has promoted innovation for many years through the Adoption  Opportunities Program and the Title IV-E Child Welfare Demonstration  Program. The Adoption Opportunities Program, authorized by the Child  Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978, as  amended, generally provides 3-to 5-year grants and contracts to public and  private adoption agencies. These grants and contracts have been used to  support states\u2019 efforts, such as increasing placement of minority children,  recruiting minority adoptive families, and providing post adoption services  for families with special needs children. Since the program\u2019s inception,  Congress has obligated more than $300 million for the Adoption  Opportunities Program. In 2003, HHS administered about $7.3 million in  first-year funding for 20 projects and in 2004 awarded $4.4 million in first- year funding for 13 projects. Also, to promote innovation, HHS has  administered the Title IV-E Child Welfare Demonstration Program since  1994. Among other things, this program allows states to waive certain  restrictions on the use of Title IV-E funds that heretofore have prevented  states from providing support to guardians. Since 1996, 7 states have  operated or are currently operating waiver projects that have provided  monthly payments to relatives and other caregivers who agree to become  a child\u2019s legal guardian. The objective is to test whether providing monthly  support to guardians, which is generally less than payments made to foster  parents, can help reduce a state\u2019s overall foster care costs and improve  permanency outcomes for children.", "Since 2002, HHS has supported local efforts to recruit and support  adoptive families and increase public awareness about adoption by  sponsoring AdoptUSKids\u2014a national initiative promoting adoption that is  operated by a coalition under contract with HHS. AdoptUSKids has  partnered with the Ad Council\u2014a provider of public service  announcements to raise awareness about social issues\u2014to develop a  national campaign to recruit adoptive families, and HHS has contributed  more than $4.1 million to the effort. The campaign is expected to run for  3 years and feature a variety of public service announcements on  television and radio, and in print media. Of this amount, AdoptUSKids has  allocated $2 million to support state recruitment response teams to handle  the anticipated interest the campaign is designed to generate. Members of  these state-based teams are expected to respond to calls and e-mails from  prospective parents, link them with the appropriate state agencies, keep  prospective parents engaged in the adoption process by providing a point  of contact, and help parents overcome the barriers they may face in  pursuing adoption. Response teams are also expected to encourage local  media stations to run AdoptUSKids ads and to network with local  politicians and community leaders.", "The AdoptUSKids initiative also helps fund adoptive parent organizations  around the country to recruit prospective adoptive families and support  existing ones. As of October 2004, AdoptUSKids had awarded a total of  $420,000 to 105 parent groups in 44 states. To recruit prospective adoptive  parents, AdoptUSKids operates a national database of children waiting to  be adopted and has established a Web site that includes photos;  demographic profiles; and brief descriptions of interests, special needs,  and the types of adoptive families that would be the most appropriate for  the children. The site is available to the public, although prospective  adoptive families can inquire about specific children only after their state  has approved them for adoption. According to AdoptUSKids, as of April  2005, about 41 percent of the children featured on the Web site had been  placed with families in pre-adoptive homes.", "Further, HHS has also dedicated the resources of one of its seven federally  funded national resource centers to specifically address special needs  adoption. Based in Michigan, the National Child Welfare Resource Center  for Adoption provides training and technical assistance to states to help  them achieve timely adoptions and develop program improvement plans to  correct weaknesses identified through federal reviews. HHS has provided  about $1 million annually to support this resource center.", "HHS also has acknowledged the work of others to promote adoption and  has disseminated adoption-related information. HHS established the  Adoption Excellence Awards in 1997 and since then has presented the  award to public and private organizations, courts, and individuals. In 2004,  HHS acknowledged the efforts of 17 groups and individuals who had a role  in increasing the number of foster children placed in permanent homes.  According to agency officials, the nonmonetary awards aim to raise  awareness about adoption and publicly acknowledge best practices. To  disseminate information about its programs and other activities  concerning adoption, HHS has sponsored conferences devoted to adoption  issues and sends a monthly electronic newsletter, the Children\u2019s Bureau  Express, to more than 9,700 readers. This newsletter highlights new  developments in the adoption field, as well as provides readers  information on conferences and funding opportunities. The agency also  maintains an e-mail distribution list of states\u2019 adoption and foster care  program managers to help disseminate information on policies,  procedures, and practices to the states and also maintains a Web site,  operated by the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse, which  collects and disseminates information concerning all aspects of adoption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Done Little to Assess the Effectiveness of Its Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although HHS has administered demonstration programs for many years,  the agency has done little to evaluate the projects funded through these  programs and therefore does not know which ones have been most  successful. For example, the Adoption Opportunities Program has been  under way since the late 1970s, but HHS did not require evaluations from  the grantees until 2002. In the absence of evaluations, the agency has  published summaries of grantees\u2019 final reports. For example, a document  provided by HHS staff in 2002 and disseminated by the Clearinghouse  synthesized the findings from 8 of 19 projects funded under this program.  The document contains some information on the projects\u2019 challenges,  lessons learned, and accomplishments, as well as recommendations from  the grantees. However, HHS has prefaced this material with a disclaimer,  noting that it does not represent the official views of the agency. Although  evaluations have been required for the last several years, HHS\u2019s program  staff told us they were still in the early stages of identifying criteria to help  ensure that future evaluations from grantees will be done with sufficient  rigor to help assess effectiveness.", "HHS has also required evaluations from Title IV-E waiver recipients, but  little is known about the effectiveness of these projects, even though HHS  has provided staff and technical assistance to help state grantees design,  implement, and evaluate their projects. Rigorous design is an essential  component to incorporate when evaluations are intended to develop  conclusions about the effectiveness of a project. Such design could  include random assignment or controlled quasi-experimental design.  Of  the seven state evaluations submitted between 2002 and 2004 that  addressed guardianship, two were designed in a manner that allowed for  comparisons between experimental and control groups.  For example, the  evaluation in selected regions of Illinois was the most methodologically  rigorous of the seven, and its design incorporated random assignment,  which allowed for reliable comparison between the control and  experimental groups. The Illinois evaluation\u2019s findings suggest that  children for whom subsidized guardianship was an option experienced a 6  percent higher permanency rate than those in the control group and  guardianship was also comparable with adoption in terms of safety and  ensuring a child\u2019s well being. The evaluations from the other 5 states were  less rigorous in their design or implementation. For example, comparison  groups used to evaluate guardianships in Oregon and New Mexico were  not necessarily comparable in composition or makeup with the  guardianship population supported by the project. Consequently, the  difference in outcomes for those in guardianships could be due to internal  differences or characteristics, rather than to the treatment (i.e.,  guardianship) itself. Other project evaluations were limited by reliance on  group numbers too small for generalization and by poor response rates to  assessment surveys and interviews. While the size of the project and the  costs associated with measuring outcomes and collecting data should be  considered in conducting evaluations, HHS officials acknowledged the  weaknesses of the current work conducted by grantees and said they have  learned more about the need for greater rigor as evaluations have been  submitted. They also indicated that evaluations are managed by the states  and HHS has very little control over how they are completed. Meanwhile,  HHS has posted summaries of projects undertaken through the waiver  program, and according to agency officials, they have drafted a synthesis  of findings reported by grantees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Adoption Promotion Programs Have Supported Special Needs Adoption, but Data Are Lacking to Determine if Changes Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["The adoption assistance and adoption incentive programs have supported  the adoption of special needs children, but data are lacking to determine if  changes are needed to better facilitate adoption.

However, the income measure used to assess the standards of need in the  AFDC program, as it existed in 1996, is outdated and in many states more  restrictive than other programs\u2019 standards of need, such as the measure  used for TANF cash assistance eligibility. For example, in Massachusetts,  a family of three could earn up to $633 per month and qualify for TANF,  but this family would not qualify for AFDC unless the earnings were no  more than $579\u2014a difference of $54 per month. According to an HHS  official, eligibility for AFDC and TANF is governed by complex rules,  which therefore complicate comparison. Nonetheless, more than one-third  of the 39 states responding to an open-ended question in our survey, as  well as officials in 4 of the 5 states we visited, expressed the view that Title  IV-E income eligibility criteria\u2014based on AFDC eligibility\u2014should be less  restrictive.", "Further, making the income determinations has presented problems for  some states. We asked officials in each of our 5 site visit states to  comment on the administrative burden associated with the income  eligibility criteria. Officials in 4 states said that determining whether  children met the income requirements, by virtue of the parents\u2019 income,  was time-consuming and challenging, particularly if their incomes were  not readily available through a state-maintained database. Between fiscal  years 2000 and 2004, HHS found that nearly all states had made errors in  applying the income criteria and determining the income eligibility for  foster care maintenance determinations. Since states must also base  adoption assistance income eligibility on parents\u2019 income, similar mistakes  are likely. HHS fined 50 of the 52 states it reviewed between 2000 and 2004  more than $14 million for claiming foster care maintenance payments for  ineligible cases, and one of the most frequent reasons for fines, according  to HHS officials, was the inappropriate application of the AFDC income  criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Are Lacking to Estimate the Cost of Changing or Eliminating the Income Requirement", "paragraphs": ["While members of Congress, the Administration, and others have  proposed changing or eliminating income requirements, HHS lacks data to  assess the likely cost to the federal government of doing so.

The Pew Commission on Children in Foster  Care\u2014a national nonpartisan group formed in 2003 and composed of  legislators, judges, child welfare administrators, and others\u2014has  estimated that eliminating the AFDC criteria from the foster care and  adoption programs would cost the federal government $1.6 billion  annually. The commission based its figure on fiscal year 2002 expenditure  data as well as estimated projections of the percentage of children who  qualify under current regulations. A more reliable estimate cannot be  made because HHS does not maintain critical data on those children and  their families who are not eligible. Specifically, for those children deemed  ineligible, HHS does not maintain family income data or data on the  presence or absence of special needs. As a result, no one can determine  how many families just missed the eligibility criteria and how many of  these children had special needs. According to an HHS official, the agency  has not done a formal cost estimate of expanding Title IV-E eligibility  criteria, but it has been developing an approach in support of proposals  that the administration has made since 2004.  According to one agency  official, these proposals would eliminate income eligibility determinations  for foster care.

The number of states  receiving the award has fluctuated from year to year, however, as figure 4  illustrates. In 1999, 44 states earned the award\u2014a reflection, perhaps, of  states\u2019 implementation of ASFA and their pursuit of permanency through  adoption. By 2001, though, the number of states receiving the award  dropped to 24, which may have been due to states\u2019 inability to sustain high  levels of adoptions. Since 2001, the number of states receiving the award  has been on the rise.

Some states reported that they focused on adoption prior to the  implementation of the program but have since seen declines in the rate at  which children enter foster care, and thus have been unable to finalize  enough adoptions to claim the reward. According to officials from  Massachusetts, while the state has continued to focus on adoption, it does  not perceive the program to be an appropriate incentive because it simply  rewards states for exceeding baselines rather than for other improvements  such as placing children who have been in care the longest.

Although states and HHS have  developed strategies and innovative programs to promote and support  special needs adoptions, HHS has done little to assess the effectiveness of  its programs and funded projects. As a consequence, HHS does not know  which projects have been most successful and cannot be assured that  federal funds used to support state projects have been used wisely. While  Title IV-E Adoption Assistance has supported special needs adoption, it is  unclear how many more children would qualify for the program if income  standards were adjusted to today\u2019s income standards of need.
