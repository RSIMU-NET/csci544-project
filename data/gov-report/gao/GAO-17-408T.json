Without such an estimate, VBA  management and the department\u2019s stakeholders had a limited view of  the system\u2019s future resource needs, and the program risked not  having sufficient funding to complete development and  implementation of the system.", "System availability: Although VBA had improved its performance  regarding system availability to users, it had not established system  response time goals. Without such goals, users did not have an  expectation of the system response times they could anticipate and  management did not have an indication of how well the system  performed relative to performance goals.", "System defects: While the program had actively managed system  defects, a recent system release had included unresolved defects that  impacted system performance and users\u2019 experiences. Continuing to  deploy releases with large numbers of defects that reduced system  functionality could have adversely affected users\u2019 ability to process  disability claims in an efficient manner.", "We also noted in the report that VBA had not conducted a customer  satisfaction survey that would allow the department to compile data on  how users viewed the system\u2019s performance, and ultimately, to develop  goals for improving the system. Our survey of VBMS users in 2014 found  that a majority of them were satisfied with the system, but that decision  review officers were considerably less satisfied.", "However, while the results of our survey provided VBA with data about  users\u2019 satisfaction with the system, the absence of user satisfaction goals  limited the utility of the survey results. Specifically, without having  established goals to define user satisfaction, VBA did not have a basis for  gauging the success of its efforts to promote satisfaction with the system,  or for identifying areas where its efforts to complete development and  implementation of the system might need attention.", "We recommended, among other actions, that the department develop a  plan with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing VBMS,  establish goals for system response time, assess user satisfaction, and  establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement. While all of our  recommendations currently remain open, the department indicated that it  has begun taking steps to address them. For example, the department  informed us of its plans to distribute its own survey to measure users\u2019  satisfaction with VBMS and to have the results of this survey analyzed by  May 2017. In addition, the department has developed draft metrics for  measuring the performance of the most commonly executed transactions  within VBMS. Continued attention to these important areas can improve  VA\u2019s efforts to effectively complete the development and implementation  of VBMS and, in turn, more effectively support the department\u2019s  processing of disability benefit claims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Progress on Data Center Consolidation Lags Behind Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that VA was among the agencies that had  collectively made progress on their data center closure efforts;  nevertheless, it had fallen short of OMB\u2019s goal for agencies to close 40  percent of all non-core centers by the end of fiscal year 2015.", "VA\u2019s progress toward closing data centers, and realizing the associated  cost savings, lagged behind that of most other covered agencies.  Specifically, we reported that VA\u2019s closure of 20 out of its total of 356 data  centers gave the department a 6 percent closure rate through fiscal year  2015\u2014ranking its closure rate 19th lowest out of the 24 agencies we  studied. Further, when we took into account the data centers that the  department planned to close through fiscal year 2019, VA\u2019s 8 percent  closure rate ranked 21st lowest out of 24.", "With regard to cost savings and avoidance resulting from data center  consolidation, our analysis of the department\u2019s data identified a total of  $19.1 million in reported cost savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2011  though fiscal year 2015. This equated to only about 0.7 percent of the  total of approximately $2.8 billion that all 24 agencies reported saving or  avoiding during the same time period. Also, when we reported on this  matter in March 2016, the department had not yet estimated any planned  cost savings or avoidances from further data center consolidation during  fiscal years 2017 through 2019.", "VA also lagged behind other agencies in making progress toward  addressing data center optimization metrics established by OMB in  2014. These metrics, which applied only to core data centers,  addressed several data center optimization areas, including cost per  operating system, energy, facility, labor, storage, and virtualization.  Further, OMB established a target value for nine metrics that agencies  were expected to achieve by the end of fiscal year 2015. As we  previously reported, 20 of 22 agencies with core data centers met at least  one of OMB\u2019s optimization targets. VA was the only agency that reported  meeting none of the nine targets.", "Accordingly, we recommended that VA take action to improve its  progress in the data center optimization areas that we reported as not  meeting OMB\u2019s established targets. The department agreed with our  recommendation and has since stated that approximately 70 data centers  have been tentatively identified for potential consolidation by the end of  fiscal year 2019. VA is anticipating that, upon completion, these  consolidations will improve its performance on OMB\u2019s optimization  metrics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Plans to Retire Two Legacy Systems That Are Over 50 Years Old", "paragraphs": ["The federal government spent more than 75 percent of the total amount  budgeted for IT for fiscal year 2015 on operations and maintenance,  including for the use of legacy IT systems that are becoming increasingly  obsolete. VA is among a handful of departments with one or more archaic  legacy systems. Specifically, our recent report on legacy systems used by  federal agencies identified 2 of the department\u2019s systems as being over  50 years old, and among the 10 oldest investments and/or systems that  were reported by 12 selected agencies.", "Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID)\u2014This 53-year old  system automates time and attendance for employees, timekeepers,  payroll, and supervisors. It is written in Common Business Oriented  Language (COBOL), a programming language developed in the late  1950s and early 1960s, and runs on IBM mainframes. VA plans to  replace this system with the Human Resources Information System  Shared Service Center in 2017.", "Benefits Delivery Network (BDN)\u2014This 51-year old system tracks  claims filed by veterans for benefits, eligibility, and dates of death. It is  a suite of COBOL mainframe applications. VA has general plans to  roll the capabilities of BDN into another system, but has not  established a firm date doing so.", "Ongoing use of antiquated systems such as PAID and BDN contributes to  agencies spending a large, and increasing, proportion of their IT budgets  on operations and maintenance of systems that have outlived their  effectiveness and are consuming resources that outweigh their benefits.  Accordingly, we recommended that VA identify and plan to modernize or  replace its legacy systems. VA concurred with our recommendation and  stated that it plans to retire PAID in 2017 and to retire BDN in 2018.", "In conclusion, effective IT management is critical to the performance of  VA\u2019s mission. However, the department faces challenges in several key  areas, including its approach to pursuing electronic health record  interoperability with DOD. Specifically, VA\u2019s reconsideration of its  approach to modernizing VistA raises uncertainty about how it intends to  accomplish this important endeavor. VA has not yet defined the extent of  interoperability it needs to provide the highest possible quality of care to  its patients, as well as how and when the department intends to achieve  this extent of interoperability with DOD. Further, VA has not justified the  development and operation of an electronic health record system that is  separate from DOD\u2019s system, even though the departments have  common system needs.", "The department also faces challenges in modernizing its approximately  30-year old outpatient appointment scheduling system and improving its  development and implementation of VBMS. Further, the department has  not yet demonstrated expected progress toward consolidating and  optimizing the performance of its data centers. In addition, VA\u2019s continued  operation of two of the oldest legacy IT systems in the federal  government raises concern about the extent to which the department  continues to spend funds on IT systems that are no longer effective or  cost beneficial. While we recognize that VA has initiated steps to mitigate  the IT management weaknesses we have identified, sustained  management attention and organizational commitment will be essential to  ensuring that the transformation is successful and that the weaknesses  are fully addressed.", "Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members of the Committee,  this completes my prepared statement.
