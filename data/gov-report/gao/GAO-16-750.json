OFCCP relies on compliance evaluations to detect equal employment violations by federal contractors and conducts evaluations for about 2 percent of federal contractor establishments annually. Since 2010, about 78 percent of evaluations found no violations and about 2 percent had discrimination findings (see figure). However, when it selects contractors for evaluations, OFCCP does not use a generalizable sample that would allow for conclusions about the federal contractor population. Therefore, it does not have reasonable assurance that it is focusing its compliance efforts on those contractors with the greatest risk of noncompliance. During evaluations, OFCCP requested and reviewed documents related to contractors' equal employment efforts, including their Affirmative Action Program (AAP), which outlines contractors' compliance efforts. In 2015, close to 85 percent of evaluated contractor establishments did not submit their AAP within 30 days of OFCCP's request and were granted extensions in some cases. This suggests that OFCCP processes do not ensure that all contractors are complying with their obligation to complete and annually update an AAP.", "Figure: Findings of Federal Contractor Nondiscrimination Compliance Evaluations From Fiscal Years 2010-2015", "Since 2012, OFCCP's outreach and compliance assistance activities to assist contractors and other stakeholders, such as protected workers and industry groups, have declined as the agency refocused its activities on enforcement, and some stakeholders said guidance could be clearer. Outreach activities, such as community group presentations and job fair participation, decreased more than 80 percent from 2012 to 2014. Some stakeholders told GAO that workers, applicants, and contractors may benefit from more outreach activities. OFCCP's compliance assistance activities, such as seminars, for contractors\u2014are down 30 percent since 2012. Many contractors told GAO they do not feel comfortable contacting OFCCP for assistance and hire third party support to help comply with federal nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements. While contractors generally found OFCCP guidance helpful, both stakeholders and contractors said the guidance could be clearer to help them understand the requirements. Without clear guidance, contractors may not be able to understand their equal employment obligations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to DOL, including that OFCCP develop a contractor selection process that reflects contractor noncompliance risk, develop a mechanism to monitor contractors' compliance with AAP requirements, and review and assess the clarity of its contractor guidance.

President Johnson expanded these  obligations in 1965 when he issued Executive Order 11246, which  required a broader range of federal contractors and subcontractors to  refrain from discrimination and to take affirmative action to provide equal  employment opportunity to all employees and job applicants, regardless  of race, creed, color, or national origin. Executive Order 11246, which  generally applies to federal contracts and subcontracts of over $10,000,  has been amended several times over the years and now includes sex,  sexual orientation, and gender identity. In the early 1970s, federal  contractors\u2019 equal employment responsibilities were expanded by statute  to include persons with disabilities by Section 503 of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973 (Section 503), and certain veterans by the Vietnam Era  Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (VEVRAA). The  Section 503 requirements generally apply to federal contracts and  subcontracts that exceed $15,000, while the VEVRAA requirements  generally apply to federal contracts and subcontracts in the amount of  $150,000 or more. Contractors\u2019 compliance with these requirements is  currently overseen by the DOL\u2019s OFCCP, which has issued a number of  regulations to implement Executive Order 11246, Section 503, and  VEVRAA.

In  general, OFCCP\u2019s regulations require covered contractors to comply with  certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements (see fig. 1 for selected  examples of such requirements under Executive Order 11246). For  example, among other things, OFCCP\u2019s regulations generally require that  covered contractors:", "Prepare and maintain an Affirmative Action Program (AAP).", "Generally, covered non-construction contractors that have 50 or more  employees and a contract above a certain threshold amount are  required to prepare an AAP within 120 days of the commencement of  the contract, and annually review and update the AAP.", "Maintain personnel or employment records.", "Post certain equal employment opportunity notices.", "Allow OFCCP access to their premises during normal business hours  for the purpose of conducting on-site investigations, and to permit  OFCCP to inspect any records relevant to the matter under  investigation.", "In addition, OFCCP\u2019s Executive Order 11246 regulations generally  require contractors with 50 or more employees and one or more contracts  of $50,000 or more to annually submit an Employer Information Report  EEO-1 (EEO-1 Report).

Since OFCCP can only evaluate a small fraction of federal  contractors each year, the agency also carries out compliance assistance  efforts, which generally include outreach, compliance assistance to  contractors, and guidance.", "During its compliance evaluations, OFCCP reviews the selected  contractor\u2019s hiring, promotion, compensation, termination, and other  employment practices. OFCCP conducts evaluations at the federal  contractor establishment level\u2014the facility or unit which produces the  goods or services, such as a factory, office, or store for the federal  contractor. If OFCCP determines that a business is subject to OFCCP\u2019s  jurisdiction because of a federal contract, it may determine that all of the  business\u2019s establishments or facilities are subject to the federal  nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements, regardless of  where the federal contract is held. However, a business that is  determined to be a separate corporate entity from the federal contractor  would not be subject to OFCCP\u2019s jurisdiction. OFCCP selects contractor  establishments for evaluations by developing, on a regular basis, a  scheduling list using federal and commercial business databases, and  other factors. The total number of contractors to be reviewed each year  is determined based on OFCCP\u2019s region and district office staffing levels.  The final scheduling list is typically distributed to each district office based  on the contractor establishments\u2019 physical location within the district  office\u2019s jurisdiction and is sorted using any of a number of neutrally  applied factors, such as alphabetical order, employee count at the  establishment, contract value, or contract expiration date. When a  contractor establishment is selected for evaluation, OFCCP typically  provides a courtesy advance notice through a Corporate Scheduling  Announcement Letter (CSAL) informing the establishment that they have  been selected to undergo a compliance evaluation during the upcoming  selection cycle. Once a contractor is scheduled for an evaluation, a  \u201cscheduling letter\u201d is sent requesting the AAP\u2014which outlines the  contractor\u2019s compliance plan\u2014and supporting data. Then, a compliance  officer conducts a comprehensive desk audit, which is an off-site review  of the submitted materials. If necessary, the compliance officer conducts  an on-site review and further off-site analysis to make a final  determination as to whether the contractor has committed any violations.  (see fig. 2).", "As part of its enforcement efforts, OFCCP changed its compliance  evaluations process in December 2010 from what it called Active Case  Management (ACM) to Active Case Enforcement (ACE). According to the  OFCCP directive outlining ACE procedures for conducting compliance  evaluations, ACM proved to be of limited utility because it did not allow  OFCCP to effectively use all of its investigative tools, such as offsite  review of records. To address this limitation, OFCCP implemented the  new ACE process, which requires evaluations of each selected contractor  that are more comprehensive. This more comprehensive evaluation  process includes, among other things, a determination of whether there  are indicators of potential discrimination or violations that will require an  onsite investigation. In addition to statistical and anecdotal evidence of  discrimination, indicators of potential discrimination or other violations  also include, but are not limited to: patterns of individual discrimination,  patterns of systemic discrimination, patterns of major technical violations  such as recordkeeping deficiencies, or failure to maintain an AAP.", "OFCCP is only one of the federal agencies responsible for enforcing  equal opportunity laws and regulations. The EEOC enforces Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which prohibits employment  discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  EEOC also is responsible for enforcing other federal laws that prohibit  discrimination in employment based on age and disability, among other  characteristics. EEOC and OFCCP have some shared activities and  have established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and  coordination regulations to minimize any duplication of effort. For  example, under the MOU, individual complaints filed with OFCCP alleging  discrimination under Title VII are generally referred to EEOC. In  addition, when EEOC receives a complaint not within its purview, but over  which it believes OFCCP has jurisdiction, it will refer the complaint to  OFCCP.

Instead, OFCCP relies on federal  contractors to voluntarily comply with equal employment opportunity  requirements, and some contractors may not be completing certain  required activities. Further, the way OFCCP assigns compliance  evaluations to district or area offices may result in geographic  imbalances. Some industry groups and contractors we spoke with also  reported variation in how OFCCP conducts compliance evaluations.

OFCCP\u2019s contractor selection process is  nonrandom and does not produce a generalizable sample of contractors  for evaluation. As a result, OFCCP is not able to draw conclusions  about noncompliance risk in the overall federal contractor population.  While the selection process includes consideration of a number of  neutrally applied factors, such as alphabetical order, employee count at  the establishment, contract value, or contract expiration date, OFCCP is  not able to identify which of these factors, or any factors, are associated  with risk of noncompliance due to the use of nonrandom selection of  contractors for review. Given these limitations, OFCCP is unable to  quantify the extent to which federal contractors in its jurisdiction are  noncompliant, and does not have reasonable assurance that it is focusing  its efforts on those contractors at greatest risk of not following equal  employment opportunity or affirmative action requirements. Standards for  internal control in the federal government state that internal controls  should provide for an assessment of the risks the agency faces from both  external and internal sources. Past efforts by OFCCP to develop a  model for identifying factors associated with noncompliance did not prove  useful when put into practice, according to agency officials, in part  because the model was developed with a nonrandom set of contractor  establishments selected from prior OFCCP compliance reviews.

OFCCP typically provides  establishments selected for a compliance evaluation with a courtesy  advance notice through a CSAL before providing them with a scheduling  letter when their evaluation has been initiated. The scheduling letter  includes a request for the establishment to submit data, including the  AAP, within 30 days. However, according to OFCCP compliance  evaluation data, in 2015, close to 85 percent of contractor establishments  did not submit an AAP within 30 days of receiving a scheduling letter, as  requested, and OFCCP officials said that it was not unusual for  establishments to request an extension. By signing a qualifying federal  contract, covered contractors are required to develop an AAP within 120  days of contract commencement and update it annually. However,  OFCCP has no process for ensuring that the tens of thousands of  establishments that have signed a qualifying federal contract have  developed an AAP within 120 days of the commencement of the contract,  or updated it annually.

In fiscal year  2015, there were approximately 433 compliance officers spread across  OFCCP\u2019s 48 district and area offices (see figure 3). In accordance with  OFCCP\u2019s distribution method, the physical address of each establishment  determines which OFCCP district or area office conducts the evaluation.  OFCCP officials said they do this to minimize potential travel costs in the  event that a compliance evaluation should require an onsite visit from a  compliance officer. However, agency officials have not updated the way  they distribute the scheduling list to reflect a steadily declining percentage  of evaluations that require onsite visits. Specifically, in 2015, 25 percent  of evaluations required onsite visits, according to agency officials.  OFCCP officials told us that they have had success in assigning most  specialized evaluations examining a contractor\u2019s functional or business  unit to district or area offices irrespective of geographic location.", "Further, OFCCP officials acknowledge that they have not aligned the  current geographic distribution of compliance officers across district and  area offices with the national distribution of contractors.

For  example, one contractor we interviewed said there was uncertainty in the  compliance evaluation process due to inconsistency among the regions.  Specifically, the contractor described a situation where different OFCCP  district offices interpreted nondiscrimination language on identical  purchase orders used nationally by the contractor\u2019s establishments as  noncompliant for different reasons. The contractor, who implemented  many of its nondiscrimination policies and practices nationally, told us he  finds understanding how to ensure uniform compliance untenable under  such conditions. Similarly, a contractor that responded to a 2015 OFCCP  customer experience survey observed that while OFCCP\u2019s regulatory  language is the same nationwide, the interpretations vary depending on  the region or district office. OFCCP officials noted that while a contractor  may have identical policies and practices across its establishments, the  specific activities and circumstances at each establishment, such as  significant hiring or promotion activity at one establishment, might result in  different compliance evaluation findings.", "OFCCP has taken recent steps to improve the quality and consistency of  compliance evaluations across its offices. In 2014, OFCCP issued a  revised Federal Contract Compliance Manual to provide both new and  experienced compliance officers with the procedural framework for  executing quality and timely compliance evaluations and complaint  investigations. OFCCP implemented the revisions to the manual to  support the more comprehensive compliance evaluation process under  ACE and with the intent of creating a greater level of consistency across  regions. However, the manual acknowledges that there may be minor and  infrequent differences between regions and offices because some  discretion remains with compliance officers and their supervisors. In  2015, OFCCP created a work group to propose additional changes and  updates to the manual, according to agency officials. OFCCP is currently  updating the manual to incorporate recent regulatory and procedural  changes. OFCCP also reported that its internal quality assurance  program, which audits 10 percent of closed cases quarterly, showed  measurable improvement in the consistency of its casework and the  ability to systematically identify areas for improvement and training. Since  fiscal year 2012, OFCCP reported reducing compliance evaluation major  deficiencies\u2014errors impacting the ability to identify discrimination\u2014from  26 to 2 percent. Similarly, OFCCP reported reducing technical  deficiencies\u2014procedural errors not impacting the ability to identify  discrimination\u2014from over 40 to 22 percent. OFCCP field office staff may  also coordinate across district offices to improve compliance evaluation  consistency, according to agency officials. For example, in one region,  district offices hold conference calls to share information across offices to  improve the consistency of the evaluation process.", "Lack of training to help compliance officers maintain the skills needed to  conduct compliance evaluations could also lead to inconsistent practices  across offices. Beginning in 2013, OFCCP began focusing its compliance  officer professional training primarily on building knowledge about and  skills related to recent regulatory changes. OFCCP officials have  developed a multiyear training plan that includes resuming a more  general training schedule once the agency is past building the necessary  knowledge and skills for compliance officers related to recent regulatory  changes. In the interim, without access to essential professional training,  some compliance officers may not have the skills to address the range of  issues and topics that are part of compliance evaluations, which could  result in inconsistent practices. For example, compliance officers we  spoke to in one district office were concerned that the lack of ongoing  professional training limited their ability to correctly and consistently  conduct compliance evaluations. In some regions we visited,  management addressed this challenge by pairing compliance officers with  less expertise in particular issues with more experienced compliance  officers. GAO guidance on assessing federal strategic training and  development efforts also recommends that in planning training and  development efforts, agencies address employees\u2019 career development  issues as well as skill-specific training needs. In addition, standards for  internal control in the federal government state effective management of  human capital is essential to ensuring that management\u2019s directives are  carried out and that training should be aimed at developing and retaining  employee skills.", "OFCCP also may not be providing timely training for new compliance  officers. Since 2010, OFCCP has provided new compliance officers with  its Basic Compliance Officer Training package, which consists of 16  courses covering the entire compliance evaluation process. However,  according to agency officials, budget constraints have made it difficult to  hold timely centralized training for new compliance officers. In half of the  regions we visited, compliance officers or management officials we spoke  with noted that this training is not provided in a timely manner after being  hired. For example, one compliance officer told us he or she worked for 8  months before receiving formal training.

In one  district office, compliance officers we spoke with explained that the lack of  uniform, timely training made compliance officers feel unprepared when  they began their job. Before receiving formal training, the compliance  officer told us newly hired compliance officers may rely on informal, non- standardized, on-the-job training led by the regional or district office  management that may promote inconsistent practices. While structured  on-the-job learning experiences can be an appropriate means of staff  development, the content of these experiences may vary across regions  and district offices and lead some compliance officers to feel unprepared  to do their jobs, potentially further exacerbating any inconsistencies in  compliance evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Violations Are Resolved Through Conciliation Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, OFCCP resolved 99 percent of  violations with conciliation agreements\u2014agreements between OFCCP  and the contractor\u2014that outline remedial action that contractors agree to  take to correct violations.

For example, in one case file we reviewed, a  social services organization that failed to implement a tracking system  for applicants, hires, promotions, and terminations, was required as  part of the conciliation agreement to implement such a tracking  system and retain support data for at least two years.", "The conciliation agreements also may include monetary and other  relief, including back pay, job offers, promotion, and retroactive  seniority designed to make the victims of employment discrimination  whole (see table 2). For example, in one case file we reviewed, a  veterans\u2019 health care services company that OFCCP found to have  discriminated against applicants based on their race was required to  extend job opportunities to affected Black applicants currently  interested in employment and provide financial remuneration to all  Black applicants identified as victims of discrimination.", "OFCCP compliance officers are responsible for monitoring the  implementation of these remedies during the monitoring and reporting  period set forth in the conciliation agreement to demonstrate progress  toward rectifying the violation.

Additionally,  OFCCP may refer a case to the Office of the Solicitor in certain other  circumstances, such as when an establishment has denied compliance  officers access to information or their facilities. When referred a case, the  Office of the Solicitor generally reviews the case and may take further  action through administrative enforcement procedures.", "One of the sanctions that may be imposed through administrative  enforcement proceedings is debarment, meaning the companies or  individuals are declared ineligible to receive future federal contracts.  According to OFCCP officials, debarments are infrequent because they  view them as a last resort. There was an average of fewer than one  debarment per year since fiscal year 2010. OFCCP officials told us they  prefer to obtain compliance through conciliation agreements over  debarment because contractors who are debarred are no longer under  OFCCP\u2019s jurisdiction and not subject to the worker protection  requirements the agency oversees. Although rare, OFCCP can also  bypass the administrative enforcement procedures and refer cases to the  Department of Justice for litigation.", "OFCCP\u2019s operating plan emphasizes the importance of timely completion  of compliance evaluations to effectively obtain relief for affected  employees and applicants, although compliance evaluation processing  times are lengthy. In 2015, OFCCP\u2019s average processing days for cases  without violations was well over 6 months at 247 days (median was 172).  The average processing days for cases with nondiscrimination violations  was over a year at 402 days (median was 309), and the average  processing days for cases with findings of discrimination were 1,487  (median was 1,188). Some contractors and industry groups we spoke  with noted concerns with the resources devoted to lengthy and expansive  compliance evaluations. For example, one contractor told us an ongoing  yearlong evaluation was consuming a great deal of company resources  and was uncertain as to when OFCCP would close the evaluation.  OFCCP officials told us contractors\u2019 delays in providing AAPs extends the  length of compliance evaluations. OFFCP\u2019s 2015 timeliness measures for  case closure were based on case type: 120 days for cases with no  violations, 180 days for cases with violations but no findings of  discrimination, and 900 days for cases with findings of discrimination. In  fiscal year 2015, OFCCP closed 32 percent of cases without violations  within 120 days, and 16 percent of cases with violations but no finding of  discrimination within 180 days.

DOL\u2019s 2014-2018 Strategic  Plan states that strengthening enforcement is part of a multi-year effort to  restore OFCCP as a premier civil rights agency. Officials also noted  budget constraints as an additional factor contributing to the decrease in  events. Under the agency\u2019s new focus, for example, OFCCP now  considers efforts to work closely and strategically with community-based  organizations to identify workers who were harmed by discrimination as  community outreach, in addition to typical outreach activities.", "Stakeholders we spoke with identified areas where OFCCP outreach  activities could be improved.

Another industry  group official said that it would be helpful if OFCCP worked with unions to  improve hiring of women and minorities.

Of these, 9 stakeholders said that they would like  OFCCP to provide more opportunities for their involvement and input in  the policy process. For example, one industry group official told us that  when OFCCP was updating the VEVRAA and Section 503 regulations,  the listening sessions were held too late.

Compliance assistance includes  seminars, one-on-one meetings, and webinars designed specifically for  contractors. For example, OFCCP recently conducted three webinars for  contractors related to the final rule prohibiting pay secrecy policies and  actions, and it plans to conduct other webinars on new regulatory  changes and policies.

Stakeholders and contractors also  identified various reasons for not using OFCCP compliance assistance,  including:  fear that asking OFCCP for assistance would call attention to them  and possibly make them a target for future OFCCP enforcement  actions, such as compliance evaluations; and having their own resources, such as third party assistance, or not  needing OFCCP assistance.", "OFCCP officials noted that while some contractors may be hesitant to  contact them, there are no ramifications for contacting OFCCP to ask  questions.

To comply with these  requirements, some contractors we spoke with said they needed to  update their human resource information systems, forms, and  practices. However, OFCCP officials told us that the collection of data  required by the Section 503 and VEVRAA regulations is needed by  contractors to review and assess their effectiveness at recruiting  protected workers, as well as create accountability. Further, they said  parts of the regulations as originally proposed were scaled back or  eliminated to address cost and burden concerns. In OFCCP\u2019s fiscal  year 2017 budget justification, OFCCP states that focusing on  providing access to compliance assistance and resources to help  minimize burden and support contractor compliance is one of its  priorities.", "Some industry groups and a few contractors we spoke with find  compliance activities overly burdensome and challenging.

One industry group  official said its members struggle with managing a compliance  program with hundreds of locations, tens of thousands of employees,  and multiple OFCCP evaluations each year. Another industry group  official spoke of the burden for a small company, which may have only  one person devoted to human resources management as a small part  of their overall responsibilities.", "Some industry groups and a few contractors we spoke with reported  that compliance costs and resources are significant or have increased  due in part to the cost of additional data collection requirements and  the need to hire additional staff or consultants. Thirteen industry  groups and four contractors we spoke with had concerns with  increasing costs and resources required to comply with OFCCP  requirements. One industry group official said that while a large  federal contractor may have in-house expertise to handle most  compliance evaluations, it may need outside legal counsel for a  particular evaluation if it does not have experience in a particular area.  This official also said other contractors rely on outside counsel for all  of their OFCCP compliance work. Charges for these types of services  are significant, according to this official. For example, the official told  us that an economic consultant may charge $200-400 per hour, and  legal counsel may charge $600-700 per hour. In another example, an  official of an industry group representing contractors said that the cost  of complying with data requests can reach from the thousands to tens  of thousands of dollars. OFCCP officials estimate that the cost of  developing a new AAP is between $3,000 and $4,000.", "OFCCP\u2019s operating plan states that providing compliance assistance to  contractors to educate them about their nondiscrimination and affirmative  action obligations is needed to achieve its mission.

One contractor found FAQs, webinars, and Powerpoints helpful, but said  that sometimes the materials were too general and ambiguous. For  example, another contractor said that under the new regulations the  contractor is required to revise its Equal Employment Opportunity \u201ctag  line.\u201d This contractor said that OFCCP eventually provided a sample tag  line, but initially only provided FAQs that were not illustrative. Another  contractor said that OFCCP guidance is sometimes open to interpretation  and does not always provide a clear answer.

For  example, one contractor had questions for OFCCP on its guidance  related to protected veterans. OFCCP initially provided a response but  later offered a different response from the original one. Another official  representing a contractor said that the guidance is written for an audience  familiar with the materials and well steeped in the issues, and noted that  the materials are not written for human resource generalists typically  employed by small contractors. Nine stakeholders and three contractors  told us they needed more guidance. For example, one stakeholder said  that contractors would like to see guidance that is more specific to certain  industries or situations.

The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum providing guidance on  implementing the act states that plain writing avoids jargon, redundancy,  ambiguity, and obscurity and can assist the public in complying with  applicable requirements simply because people better understand what  they are supposed to do. Plain writing can be essential to the successful  achievement of legislative and administrative goals, and it promotes the  rule of law, according to the OMB guidance. OFCCP officials told us they  recently spent 2 years updating the agency\u2019s FAQs and directives to be  more consistent with the OMB guidance after stakeholders complained  that they contained excessive jargon.", "We tested 24 available OFCCP FAQ documents with an automated  grade-level readability test. According to the test, the reading level  required for these guidance materials ranged from that of a high school  12th-grader to that of someone with a post-graduate degree, which  demonstrates there is variation in the readability and complexity of  OFCCP guidance.

The  process OFCCP uses to select contractors for compliance evaluations, its  primary tool for enforcement, is not designed to focus on contractors with  the greatest risk of noncompliance. OFCCP also lacks a mechanism to  ensure contractors are voluntarily complying with nondiscrimination  requirements by annually updating their Affirmative Action Plans (AAP).

Regulatory requirements regarding contractors\u2019 nondiscrimination  obligations have changed, but OFCCP has reduced the outreach and  compliance assistance efforts that can help contractors understand these  changes and workers understand their protections. Given that these  recent regulatory updates may require contractors to significantly adjust  their policies, practices, and data collection systems in order to comply  with nondiscrimination requirements, it is essential that OFCCP provides  effective outreach and compliance assistance, and that contractors  receive clear guidance. While enforcement has been the agency\u2019s  predominant approach to achieving its mission, outreach, compliance  assistance, and guidance in support of voluntary compliance provide  important opportunities to extend the agency\u2019s influence beyond the few  contractors that are evaluated and help OFCCP better achieve its  mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that federal contractors are complying with equal employment  opportunity requirements, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor  direct the Director of OFCCP to take the following six actions:  1.
