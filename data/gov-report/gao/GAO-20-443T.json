NNSA is also managing numerous, multi-billion-dollar construction projects to modernize the infrastructure it uses to produce components and materials needed for its weapon programs. GAO has reported on challenges NNSA faces in managing these efforts. For example, GAO's February 2020 report on the W87-1 warhead program found that NNSA's past challenges in managing plutonium activities cast doubt on NNSA's ability to produce the required number of plutonium weapon cores on schedule. GAO also found in June 2019 that future weapon programs will require newly produced explosives, including some that NNSA has not produced at scale since 1993.", "NNSA has improved its management of weapon programs and related projects in some respects. For example, NNSA has established requirements for independent cost estimates in weapon programs and has made progress in revising plans for the Uranium Processing Facility project. However, GAO has identified additional actions that could further improve NNSA's management of weapon programs and projects. For example, in September 2017, GAO reported that NNSA had not developed a complete scope of work, a life-cycle cost estimate, or an integrated master schedule for its overall uranium program. GAO recommended that NNSA set a time frame for developing these plans. GAO expects to issue a report on NNSA's uranium program plans in March 2020.", "GAO concluded in April 2017 that NNSA had not addressed a potential mismatch between funding needs and funding availability. GAO recommended that NNSA assess its portfolio of modernization programs\u2014for example, by presenting options to align programs to potential future budgets, such as potentially deferring the start of or cancelling specific programs. NNSA did not explicitly agree or disagree with GAO's recommendation. NNSA included an affordability analysis in July 2019 planning documents, but the analysis does not fully respond to GAO's recommendation because it does not state how potential misalignment between program costs and budget projections may be addressed. GAO continues to believe that presenting options to align its portfolio of programs to potential future budgets could help Congress and NNSA better understand NNSA's priorities and trade-offs that may need to be undertaken in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made numerous recommendations to NNSA, including that it assess its portfolio of modernization programs to present options to align programs and budgets.

NNSA\u2019s work comprises two simultaneous, interdependent  efforts: modernizing the stockpile of nuclear bombs and warheads, and  modernizing the research and production infrastructure on which stockpile  programs depend. NNSA manages these efforts in coordination with the  Department of Defense (DOD), which undertakes related work to  modernize nuclear weapon delivery systems, including heavy bombers,  intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic  missiles and the submarines that carry them. According to NNSA\u2019s Fiscal  Year 2020 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, the nuclear  security enterprise is experiencing its busiest time since the Cold War  era.", "In an April 2017 report, we concluded that NNSA\u2019s assessment on the  affordability of the agency\u2019s nuclear modernization programs was  predicated on optimistic assumptions about future-year costs, particularly  for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. In particular, we reported that,  according to NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget materials and agency  officials, work deferred by NNSA contributed to a significant bow wave of  funding needs in future years as the agency made plans to undertake  multiple, simultaneous life extension programs (LEP) and other weapon  programs. A funding bow wave\u2014that is, an impending and significant  increase in the requirements for additional funds\u2014occurs when agencies  defer costs of their programs to the future, beyond their programming  periods, and often occurs when agencies are undertaking more programs  than their resources can support.", "At the time of our April 2017 report, NNSA had concluded that its nuclear  modernization program plan was generally affordable because it  assumed that future budgets would meet or exceed the low range of  NNSA\u2019s cost estimates for its programs. However, we found that,  particularly in the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, NNSA\u2019s  budget estimates may have exceeded funding projections in the  President\u2019s budget for those same years. We recommended that NNSA  include an assessment of its portfolio of modernization programs in future  versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan\u2014for  example, by presenting options NNSA could consider to bring its  estimates of modernization funding needs into alignment with potential  future budgets. This could include potentially deferring the start of or  canceling specific modernization programs if program budgets fell short of  program estimates.", "Less than 1 year later, in February 2018, DOD issued the 2018 Nuclear  Posture Review, which outlined plans for starting several additional  nuclear weapon modernization programs while accelerating an existing  program. DOD and DOE cost estimates show that nuclear weapon  programs and related efforts are expected to cost hundreds of billions of  dollars over the next decade, but neither agency has yet released long- term budget estimates that fully reflect implementation of the 2018  Nuclear Posture Review\u2019s priorities. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2021  budget request includes a 25 percent increase for NNSA\u2019s modernization  program, suggesting the bow wave has arrived.", "My testimony today discusses (1) NNSA\u2019s ongoing and planned programs  and projects to modernize the nuclear stockpile and related production  infrastructure and any challenges they present; (2) improvements in  NNSA\u2019s management of weapon programs and related capital asset  projects, and additional steps NNSA could take to make further  improvements; and (3) our prior recommendation to NNSA on assessing  the affordability of its portfolio of modernization programs.", "My statement is based primarily on our work from 18 GAO reports issued  from July 2003 to February 2020 and selected updates. Detailed  information about the scope and methodology we used to conduct our  prior work can be found in each of our issued reports. For the updates,  we interviewed NNSA officials to assess any actions NNSA has taken in  response to our April 2017 recommendation and included updated  information on the status of other recommendations based on  documentation NNSA provides to us periodically. In addition, we reviewed  several documents to provide selected updates to information on program  schedules, cost estimates, and budgets on which we had previously  reported. Specifically, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2020 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan; the testimony of an NNSA official  from a September 2019 hearing on the status of two LEPs; the DOE  Office of Project Management\u2019s January 2020 Monthly DOE Project  Portfolio Status Report; and the President\u2019s DOE budget request for fiscal  year 2021.

First,  NNSA is currently conducting four weapon modernization programs: the  B61-12 LEP, the W88 Alteration 370, the W80-4 LEP, and the W87-1  Modification program. Table 1 provides more information on each of  these programs based on our prior work, with selected updates on  program schedules, cost estimates, and budgets from the Fiscal Year  2020 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan and NNSA testimony.", "In addition to these four ongoing programs, the 2018 Nuclear Posture  Review calls for NNSA to consider additional weapon programs\u2014 specifically, a program to develop a modern nuclear-armed sea-launched  cruise missile, and another to develop a new submarine-launched ballistic  missile warhead (now being referred to as the W93). The Nuclear Posture  Review also instructs NNSA to maintain the B83-1 bomb until a suitable  replacement can be found.", "To support and enable ongoing and planned weapon programs, NNSA  also plans to spend billions of dollars over the next 2 decades on capital  asset projects and other infrastructure risk reduction and recapitalization  efforts to modernize the production infrastructure NNSA uses to produce  components and materials needed for its weapon programs. Table 2  provides more information on selected NNSA capital asset projects  discussed in our recent reports, with selected updates on program  schedules and cost estimates from the DOE Office of Project  Management\u2019s January 2020 Monthly DOE Project Portfolio Status  Report.", "According to NNSA\u2019s plans, the agency must carry out many of its  weapon programs while simultaneously modernizing the very  infrastructure on which these weapon programs rely for components and  other materials. Therefore, any delays or technical challenges that affect  NNSA\u2019s plans for its production facilities may be expected to result in  delays and challenges to the weapon programs. Figure 1 shows the  estimated schedules for the weapon programs and related capital asset  projects described in tables 1 and 2 and reported on in our prior work,  with updated information as presented in the Fiscal Year 2020 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan.", "We have reported on the potential effects on NNSA\u2019s weapon programs  of delays or technical challenges in modernizing its production facilities.  For example:", "The W87-1 Modification program\u2019s schedule may be particularly  vulnerable to production challenges, including pit production  challenges, because, as we reported in November 2018, it will require  all newly-made components, including pits. In our most recent report  on the W87-1 program, a classified report issued in February 2020,  we found that NNSA\u2019s past challenges in managing plutonium  activities at Los Alamos and in executing projects of this size cast  doubt on NNSA\u2019s ability to produce 80 pits per year in 2030. As we  note in that report, an independent assessment of NNSA\u2019s pit  production strategy in March 2019 concluded that no options  evaluated by NNSA could be expected to produce 80 pits per year by  2030. The independent assessment further stated that NNSA had  no precedent for major projects costing more than $700 million dollars  that had been completed in fewer than 16 years, and that many  similar projects were eventually cancelled.", "Future weapon programs will require newly produced explosives,  including some that NNSA has not produced at scale since 1993. As  we reported in June 2019, NNSA officials stated that producing these  materials will pose challenges that include replicating decades-old  recipes for the materials and preparing for their full-scale production in  aging facilities. As we noted in that report, similar problems  restarting dormant production capabilities have delayed past weapon  programs\u2014notably, the W76-1 LEP, which NNSA completed in  December 2018. As we reported in March 2009, NNSA had to delay  first production of the W76-1 from September 2007 to September  2008 when it encountered problems restarting production of a key  material, known as Fogbank. NNSA is working to reconstitute its  high explosives capabilities, as we reported in June 2019.", "Nonnuclear parts and components comprise over 80 percent of the  items in a nuclear weapon, and NNSA\u2019s Kansas City National Security  Campus procures or produces most of these. In April 2019, we found  that work on the B61-12 LEP and W88 Alteration 370 was expected to  double at the Kansas City site during fiscal years 2020 through  2022. Our April 2019 report also identified challenges that could  complicate work at the site. For example, disruption to the established  supply chain for externally supplied parts\u2014which comprise about 65  percent of the nonnuclear parts used at the Kansas City site\u2014could  result in production delays, and the site needs hundreds of thousands  of additional square feet of manufacturing space to meet workload  demands.", "We have also recently completed work in which we reported on  challenges integrating the schedules of NNSA\u2019s weapon programs with  the schedules for DOD\u2019s modernized delivery systems. For example, the  W87-1 warhead will need to be integrated on a delivery system that is  under development, an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the  Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. We have ongoing work examining  DOD and DOE plans to modernize and integrate warheads and delivery  vehicles and expect to issue a classified report in spring 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Taken Steps to Improve Its Management of Weapon Programs and Enabling Capital Asset Projects, but Additional Improvements Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["As we have recently reported, NNSA has made improvements in its  management of some weapon modernization programs and enabling  capital asset projects. We have concluded that NNSA\u2019s federal program  and project management capacity is improving, as are the controls it has  developed for program and project performance. For example:", "We found in January 2018 that NNSA has established and  strengthened management requirements for LEPs. Specifically, in  January 2016, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs issued a program  management directive that designates risk-based program execution  requirements that all programs must follow. The directive places  LEPs in one of the highest-risk categories, meaning these programs  are required to apply more rigorous management controls specified in  the directive, including using earned value management. Further, in  January 2017, NNSA issued two directives implementing  requirements for NNSA\u2019s Office of Cost Estimating and Program  Evaluation to conduct independent cost estimates. In May 2018, we  found that the program cost estimate for the B61-12 LEP substantially  met the criteria for all four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable  cost estimate, in part because it was the first LEP to undergo an  independent cost estimate.", "We reported in our February 2017 high-risk update that DOE  demonstrated a strong commitment and top leadership support for  improving project management. For example, DOE made changes  to its revised project management order, issued in May 2016, in  response to recommendations we made in prior years, such as  requiring that projects develop cost estimates and analyses of  alternatives according to best practices we identified.", "In September 2017, we found that NNSA had made progress in  developing a revised scope of work, cost estimate, and schedule for  the Uranium Processing Facility project, which is to modernize  uranium production efforts at the Y-12 National Security Complex.  We reported at that time that these improvements may help NNSA  stabilize escalating project costs and technical risks experienced  under the previous strategy.", "In November 2017, we found that NNSA had established programs to  manage strategic materials\u2014specifically, uranium, plutonium, tritium,  and lithium\u2014and had defined requirements and managerial roles for  program managers. Since that time, NNSA has taken steps to  implement a new enterprise-wide approach for managing explosives  activities, as we found in our June 2019 report on those activities.", "However, we have identified additional actions NNSA could take to further  improve its management of weapon modernization programs and related  projects. As NNSA\u2019s workload increases, additional management rigor  will help ensure that programs and projects are executed consistent with  cost and schedule estimates, and that risk is effectively managed and  communicated. For example:", "We found in our January 2018 report that NNSA had not adopted the  best practice of having an independent team validate its earned value  management systems against the national standard for such systems,  which could help the agency better manage risk in its LEPs. We also  found that NNSA had not established specific benchmarks for  technology readiness at LEP decision points, consistent with best  practices. We recommended that NNSA require an independent team  to validate contractor earned value management systems for LEPs  and establish technology readiness requirements at LEP decision  points. According to an update NNSA provided to us in September  2019, the agency has not taken action to address these  recommendations. We continue to believe that it should do so.", "We found in our September 2017 report that NNSA had not  developed a complete scope of work, a life-cycle cost estimate, or an  integrated master schedule for its overall uranium program\u2014of which  the Uranium Processing Facility is only one part\u2014and had no time  frame for doing so. We recommended that NNSA should set a time  frame for when the agency would develop a complete scope of work,  a life-cycle cost estimate, and an integrated master schedule for the  overall uranium program. NNSA generally agreed with our  recommendation and has taken actions to respond to it. We expect to  issue a report on the Uranium Processing Facility and NNSA\u2019s plans  for its uranium program in March 2020.", "As we reported in February 2020, the plutonium program has begun  to develop a schedule for pit production. However, NNSA allows  strategic materials programs such as the plutonium program to tailor  their approach to developing schedules and does not require that they  meet best practices for schedule estimating. We recommended that  NNSA ensure that the plutonium program develop a schedule for pit  production consistent with best practices for schedule development.  NNSA agreed with our recommendation.", "Our ongoing work includes reviews of NNSA\u2019s management of other  efforts essential to ongoing weapon modernization programs, such as the  production of radiation-hardened microelectronics at Sandia National  Laboratories in New Mexico and of depleted uranium at the Y-12 National  Security Complex in Tennessee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Needs a Portfolio-based Approach to Managing Its Weapon Modernization Programs and Related Efforts", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s weapon modernization programs and enabling infrastructure  efforts have significant interdependencies that require integrated  management across the portfolio of programs to effectively manage cost,  schedule, and risk. Portfolio management best practices developed by  the Project Management Institute state that organizations can optimize  their portfolios of programs and projects by assessing their capability and  capacity to finance specific portfolio components; determining which  portfolio components should receive the highest priority; and identifying  components to be suspended, reprioritized, or terminated. In our April  2017 report on NNSA\u2019s budget materials and modernization plans, we  found that NNSA did not clearly identify the extent to which its long-range  budget estimates for its overall modernization program fell short of  specific annual budget requests anticipated in this plan. We concluded  that NNSA had not addressed the projected bow wave of future funding  needs and the mismatch between those needs and the potential funding  available in the years in question. By not addressing the risks associated  with the potential funding shortfall, we concluded, NNSA raised questions  about its ability to achieve its modernization program goals at cost and on  schedule. As a result, as discussed above, we recommended that NNSA  include an assessment of the affordability of its portfolio of modernization  programs in future versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan\u2014for example, by presenting options NNSA could  consider to bring its estimates of modernization funding needs into  alignment with potential future budgets, such as potentially deferring the  start of or canceling specific modernization programs. NNSA did not  explicitly agree or disagree with our recommendation. The President\u2019s  fiscal year 2021 budget request for NNSA indicates that the bow wave  has arrived, requesting an increase of about $3.1 billion over the funding  enacted for Weapons Activities in fiscal year 2020\u2014a year-to-year  increase of over 25 percent.", "The Fiscal Year 2020 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan,  issued in July 2019, includes a new section on affordability analysis and  states that the section was added in response to our April 2017  recommendation. However, our review of this section indicates that it  does not fully respond to our recommendation because it does not  provide information about how potential misalignment between NNSA\u2019s  modernization budget estimates and projections of the President\u2019s  modernization budgets may be addressed, or about the potential impacts  of adjusting program schedules or cost or schedule overruns. Since the  issuance of the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, NNSA\u2019s portfolio of  planned programs has only grown more extensive and complex. We  continue to believe that NNSA, by assessing its portfolio of modernization  programs in future versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan\u2014for example, by presenting options NNSA could  consider to bring its estimates of modernization funding needs into  alignment with potential future budgets, such as potentially deferring the  start of or canceling specific modernization programs\u2014could help  congressional and NNSA decision makers better understand NNSA\u2019s  priorities and trade-offs that it may need to undertake in the future,  depending on funding and program performance.", "Chairman Cooper, Ranking Member Turner, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
