GAO surveyed civilian federal agencies, identified through their membership in the Emergency Communications Preparedness Center (57 agencies fully responded to the survey and one agency provided a partial response); reviewed Department of Homeland Security planning documents related to interoperability; and interviewed federal agency officials with responsibilities related to emergency communications and procurement of LMR equipment. GAO also reviewed OMB initiatives to improve federal procurement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies GAO surveyed generally use land mobile radio (LMR) equipment to meet their core missions, such as public safety, emergency management, or firefighting. More than two-thirds of the 57 agencies GAO surveyed reported using equipment from the same manufacturer because, for example, they believe doing so will help ensure compatibility of new LMR equipment with existing system requirements. Most agencies GAO surveyed were consistent in identifying each other as agencies with which they have or have not needed LMR interoperability over the past 5 years. Of the agencies that identified the need to communicate with each other, about two-thirds reported generally having a good or excellent level of LMR interoperability.", "The use of standards-based and multi-band LMR equipment has helped to enhance interoperability among agencies, but the use of proprietary features and other factors continue to hinder interoperability. Almost all of the agencies that GAO surveyed reported using LMR equipment that meets voluntary technical standards, which have improved interoperability. Further, almost half of these agencies reported using multiband radios, which operate on multiple public-safety radio bands, to enhance interoperability. However, agencies reported several factors continue to limit their progress in achieving interoperability with other federal agencies. These factors include the use of proprietary features and encryption in devices and limited investments in LMR systems and devices. For example, about half of the agencies surveyed reported that the use of proprietary features within LMR devices has hindered interoperability.", "Nearly half of the agencies GAO surveyed reported using pre-approved vendors with established prices to acquire LMR equipment, mainly through contracts sponsored by the Departments of Homeland Security and the Interior. While this approach can facilitate cost savings and interoperability, many of these agencies reported purchasing equipment through multiple agreements, a practice that can reduce these benefits. About 40 percent of agencies GAO surveyed reported using sole-source procurement or independent approaches. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in general, agencies often purchase and manage items in a fragmented and inefficient manner. This approach can result in duplication of effort, which imposes significant costs on federal agencies. OMB has directed agencies to implement \u201ccategory management\u201d as an improved way to manage spending across government for commonly purchased goods and services. This approach enables the government to leverage its purchasing power and realize cost savings. However, OMB\u2019s category management initiative does not include LMR equipment even though federal agencies spend millions of dollars annually purchasing such equipment. By including LMR equipment in OMB\u2019s category management initiative, the government could more fully leverage its aggregate buying power to obtain the most advantageous terms and conditions for LMR procurements. OMB officials agreed that a category management approach to LMR procurement might save the government money while supporting the goal of enhanced interoperability among agencies that require it, but OMB has not examined the feasibility of applying this approach to the procurement of LMR equipment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB examine the feasibility of including LMR in its category management initiative.

Although LMR systems have similar components\u2014 including handheld portable radios and mobile radios mounted in  vehicles, as well as base stations to transmit signals or audio\u2014 interoperable LMR communications remains a challenge for various  technical and non-technical reasons. Legislation enacted over the past  10 years, such as the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act  of 2006 and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Interoperable  Communications Act of 2015, highlighted the critical importance of  effective, interoperable communication systems for federal agencies with  law-enforcement and emergency-response missions. For example, the  Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act established the  Emergency Communications Preparedness Center (ECPC) to improve  coordination and information sharing among federal emergency  communications programs in support of interoperability and continued  communications during disasters and incidents. According to DHS,  advancements in LMR technology\u2014including further development of  standards-based equipment and multi-band radios capable of operating  on several different channels across multiple radio bands\u2014may help  address some interoperability challenges. However, there is no single  operational authority for emergency response among federal departments  and questions remain regarding the ability of federal agencies to achieve  interoperable LMR communications.", "Amid continuing questions about LMR interoperability among federal  agencies and in light of advancements in LMR technology, we were  asked to examine aspects of this interoperability as well as LMR  procurement practices. In this report, we examine: (1) LMR systems and  devices used by selected federal agencies and the state of LMR  interoperability among these agencies; (2) factors that help and hinder  interoperability among agencies that use LMR; and (3) selected agencies\u2019  practices for procuring LMR systems.", "To address these objectives, we conducted a web-based survey of  civilian federal agencies, identified through their membership in the  ECPC. We screened an initial set of 74 agencies to determine which  agencies use LMR technologies to communicate with at least one other  federal agency for daily operations, planned events, such as Presidential  inaugurations, or emergency incidents. All 74 agencies responded to our  screening question. Agencies that met this criterion\u201458 federal LMR  users in all\u2014were further surveyed about the types of equipment they  use, interoperability needs, and procurement practices, among other  topics. Fifty-seven of the 58 agencies that we identified as federal LMR  users responded to the full survey. The Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) did not respond to the full survey but provided responses to a  limited set of survey questions related to our first objective, identifying  agencies with which they require LMR interoperability. Therefore, for the  first objective we include information from the 57 agency responses and  the FBI; for the other two objectives we only include information from the  57 agencies. Throughout this report, we provide survey results based on  the number of respondents to each question because not all respondents  answered every question. Therefore the number of respondents may be  fewer than 57 for some results.

A network is  required to connect base stations to the same communication system.", "Repeaters increase the effective communication range of handheld  portable radios, mobile radios, and base station radios by  retransmitting received radio signals.", "LMR networks connect different base stations to the same  communications system and operate by transmitting voice and data  through radio waves at specific frequencies and channels within the radio  frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. According to DHS,  the shortage of available channels within a single radio band resulted in  the expansion of public safety systems into multiple radio frequency  bands within the radio frequency spectrum. In the United States, NTIA  administers spectrum for federal government use and FCC administers  spectrum for non-federal use (e.g., state and local government, and  commercial use). Federal agencies generally operate on different radio  frequency bands than those used by state and local agencies, as shown  in figure 2.", "LMR systems that operate on different radio frequency bands are not  always interoperable, making it potentially difficult for different  jurisdictions to communicate with one another. To address this issue,  NTIA has designated specific radio frequencies, known as federal  interoperability channels, for use among federal agencies and between  federal agencies and non-federal entities with which federal agencies  require interoperability. Similarly, FCC designated national interoperability  channels for use by the public safety community at the state and local  levels. FCC licensees of other Public Safety and Industrial/Business  Pool frequencies may also share their facilities with federal users.  According to FCC, interoperability channels licensed by FCC are  reserved specifically for different agencies or jurisdictions to coordinate  and resolve initial interoperability issues when responding to an incident.  Federal users may use the national interoperability channels only for  interoperability with (and at the invitation of) a non-federal entity.", "Technology solutions have been developed to enhance interoperability  across different radio frequency bands and equipment. According to FCC,  advancements in LMR technology\u2014including software-defined radios,  multi-band radios, and interoperable gateways\u2014have enhanced  interoperability among different LMR devices. Software-defined radios  use reconfigurable software that can be changed to alter the radio\u2019s  operating parameters without making any changes to the hardware  components. Multi-band radios can operate on more than one radio  frequency band, with the goal of allowing emergency responders to  communicate with partner agencies regardless of the radio frequency  band on which they operate. Interoperable gateways use \u201cbridging\u201d or  network approaches to enhance interoperability, by using radio network  bridges or \u201cgateways\u201d that provide a direct interface between separate  radio networks.", "In addition to these and other technology solutions, a suite of voluntary  national standards, known as Project 25 (P25) standards, is intended to  facilitate interoperability among different manufacturers\u2019 LMR  communications products. The goal of P25 is to specify formal  standards for interfaces among the various components of an LMR  system commonly used by emergency responders.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department of Homeland  Security, and within the department, a Directorate of Emergency  Preparedness and Response responsible for, among other things,  \u201cdeveloping comprehensive programs for developing interoperative  communications technology, and helping to ensure that emergency  response providers acquire such technology.\u201d The Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 was enacted to address  various shortcomings identified in the preparation for and response to  Hurricane Katrina and included legislative reforms related to emergency  management. For example, the act required DHS, among other things,  to develop the National Emergency Communications Plan and created  the Office of Emergency Communications within DHS to improve first  responder communications. More recently, the DHS Interoperable  Communications Act was enacted in 2015 with the goal to achieve and  maintain interoperable communications capabilities among DHS  agencies.", "The Office of Emergency Communications administers the ECPC, which  serves as a focal point to improve coordination and share information  among 14 federal agencies in support of enhanced interoperability and  the ability to provide emergency responders and officials with continued  communications during disasters and incidents. According to a 2013  report prepared by the ECPC Research and Development focus group,  federal agencies plan to continue to rely on existing LMR systems to  support mission-critical emergency communications needs. The Office of  Emergency Communications also worked with federal, state, local, and  tribal jurisdictions to create its 2014 National Emergency Communications  Plan, which it views as the nation\u2019s strategic plan for emergency  communications.

To help ensure that LMR equipment is truly compliant with  the P25 standards, DHS\u2019s Office for Interoperability and Compatibility has  partnered with the Department of Commerce Public Safety  Communications Research program to develop the P25 Compliance  Assessment Program.

LMR users  who have not pre-programmed their devices or are unfamiliar using the  channels may be slow to respond or experience interoperability difficulties  during an emergency event. For example, during the 2013 Boston  Marathon bombings, when traditional communications systems\u2014 including radio networks and protocols, and some of the radio channels  designated for the Marathon under the communications plan\u2014were  overloaded, Boston\u2019s police, fire, and public and private emergency  medical service personnel used a dedicated radio channel to  communicate and quickly summon aid to the scene. By comparison,  some regional specialized weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams from  state and local police departments and law enforcement councils  experienced difficulty communicating because their radios were not  programmed to the interoperable channels. Similarly, the after-action  report for the 2012 Navy Yard shooting noted that officers from federal  and local law enforcement agencies were communicating on separate  channels while searching for the gunman, resulting in gaps in  communications and increased risk to fellow officers.", "Although more than two-thirds of the federal agencies responding to our  survey reported that their radios are pre-programmed to the federal and  national interoperability channels, 11 of the 57 agencies reported that  their radios are not pre-programmed to use these NTIA-regulated federal  emergency channels, and 17 of the 57 federal agencies reported that  their devices are not pre-programmed to use FCC-regulated national  interoperability channels. In written responses related to this survey  question, some of these agencies explained that they did not see the  need to do so or were unaware that the channels existed. However, as  mentioned previously, DHS views these channels as providing greater  flexibility to agencies in the event of an emergency. About one-fourth of  the agencies responding to our survey reported that training related to  accessing federal and national interoperability channels was a medium or  high priority for their agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Standard Operating Procedures", "paragraphs": ["DHS SAFECOM guidance states that interoperability requires not only the  technical ability to communicate through the use of compatible LMR  equipment but also formalized agreement among federal agencies, state  and local entities, and other emergency service organizations to  communicate and cooperatively respond to emergencies and disaster  events.

DHS\u2019s SAFECOM recommends that partner agencies that  need to use LMR to communicate develop SOPs and engage in training  for daily operations, planned events, and unplanned or emergency  events.", "We analyzed survey results for agencies that identified the need for LMR  interoperability with other agencies, particularly regarding whether the  agencies have SOPs related to interoperability. Based on survey  responses, when an agency identified the need for LMR interoperability  with another agency, the agency also reported having SOPs with the  identified agency in about 48 percent of the cases. Furthermore, the  quality of interoperability tended to be higher when SOPs were in place  than when they were not. In cases where an agency reported requiring  LMR interoperability with another agency and having SOPs with that  agency, the quality of interoperability was rated as excellent for 40  percent of the cases; good for 45 percent of the cases; and fair, poor, or  nonexistent for 15 percent of the cases.

To encourage  agencies requiring LMR interoperability to develop SOPs, DHS has  published and distributed guidance on its website and via the ECPC  clearinghouse for information on www.max.gov.

Agencies using  preapproved contracts to purchase LMR equipment reported similar  benefits, including cost savings, reduced administrative burden,  enhanced interoperability, and standardized equipment. Among the 27  federal agencies that reported using preapproved contracts to procure  LMR systems and devices, most reported using contracts sponsored by  the DHS or the Department of the Interior, although several other contract  vehicles were used by a smaller number of agencies (see fig. 6).", "Among the agencies that used preapproved contracts, many reported that  they have used multiple contract vehicles to purchase LMR equipment in  the past 5 years. For example, 13 agencies reported using two or more  different vehicles, and three agencies reported using four different  vehicles. We have reported that agencies\u2019 use of potentially duplicative  contracts to purchase similar goods and services can potentially reduce  their benefits by imposing significant costs to the agencies. That is,  agencies may miss an opportunity to leverage their buying power, if  purchasing under many different agreements.", "Twenty-three agencies we surveyed also have used a sole source or  other procurement mechanisms to acquire LMR systems and devices  within the past 5 years, whereby agencies contract with one specific  manufacturer, without competition, to acquire systems and devices when  it is believed to be in the best interest of the agency. In written comments  on the survey, some agencies reported using sole source procurements  to ensure that all the LMR devices they purchased would work with their  existing systems. For example, one agency reported that using a sole  source procurement allows it to obtain additional equipment from the  same manufacturer as its current LMR system. Another noted that a sole  source procurement allows the agency to replace existing equipment with  similar equipment, which reduces the cost of training for LMR users and  technicians who maintain and repair the equipment.

We have previously identified using a coordinated  procurement approach as a key practice that can reduce procurement  costs to agencies. According to GSA, a structured and collaborative  approach to procurement can help agencies save money and improve  overall performance by better leveraging their purchasing power.", "However, in response to our survey, nearly 40 percent of agencies (22 of  57) reported that they have not coordinated procurement activities of LMR  devices and related equipment with other federal agencies within the past  5 years, such as by identifying common technical requirements before  purchasing new LMR equipment. In written comments on the survey,  some of these agencies provided the following reasons for not  coordinating LMR procurements:", "Difference in mission: for example, one agency reported that its  mission does not overlap with that of other federal agencies, a  circumstance that made it difficult to coordinate procurements with  them.", "Lack of common technical requirements: for example, one agency  reported that its radio system needs to have maritime capabilities that  most other federal agencies do not need.", "Low quantity of LMR devices: for example, one agency reported that it  needs only about 100 LMR devices and trying to coordinate the  purchase of such a small quantity would be more burdensome than  helpful.", "Timing of procurement: for example, one agency reported that it tried  to execute a contract for LMR purchases with another agency in the  past, but the timing of the cycles by which the two agencies\u2019  purchased new LMR equipment was difficult to coordinate due to their  having two different contract-performance periods.", "According to OMB officials, agencies had noted similar reasons for not  coordinating other commonly purchased goods, such as IT hardware and  software. In particular, OMB officials told us that although agencies may  initially struggle to identify common technical requirements, agencies can  typically identify and agree to a limited number of standard technical  configurations to meet the needs of about 80 percent of common IT  requirements, such as those for laptops and desktops. These items make  up more than half of the federal government\u2019s overall expenditures and  agencies often purchase and manage these items in a fragmented and  inefficient manner, according to OMB. In response, in 2014, OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy announced its category  management initiative, an approach based on leading practices to  manage entire categories of spending across government for commonly  purchased goods and services, such as IT hardware and software. The  initiative is designed to allow the federal government to buy goods and  services more like a single enterprise, leveraging its purchasing power as  the world\u2019s largest consumer. OMB identified three critical steps  departments and agencies could take to improve procurement practices  and achieve cost savings: (1) reduce administrative costs by  consolidating acquisitions through fewer high-performing contract  vehicles; (2) standardize configurations for common requirements to drive  savings; and (3) implement smarter business practices, such as jointly  purchasing replacement IT equipment on a regular cycle, to achieve  strategic and predictable budget requirements and optimize price and  performance.", "At the time of our review, OMB had not yet considered LMR equipment  within its category management initiative, in part because the initial  strategic plan for IT focused on implementing OMB policy related to  laptops and desktops, software, and mobile devices and services.  However, OMB officials acknowledged that a category management  approach to LMR procurement may save the government money while  also supporting the goal of enhanced LMR interoperability among  agencies, largely because it would require agencies to identify their  common technical requirements and purchase equipment in larger  quantities through fewer transactions. OMB officials said that LMR  equipment could be a focus of future efforts once data analysis is  conducted to understand how many agencies use LMR equipment, which  contract vehicles are used to purchase LMR equipment, and overall LMR  expenditures. In our discussion with OMB officials, they noted the  widespread use of LMR equipment and the large number of contract  vehicles currently being used to purchase LMR equipment as reasons for  pursuing a consolidated procurement of LMR equipment through a  category management approach. Including LMR equipment in OMB\u2019s  category management initiative may enable the federal government to  more fully leverage its aggregate buying power to obtain the most  advantageous terms and conditions for LMR procurements and realize  cost savings. Although the exact amount of federal funds spent each  year on LMR equipment government-wide is unknown, we estimate it is  likely hundreds of millions of dollars, given the known costs to DHS, a  single department. Specifically, DHS has reported that its agencies spent  almost $526 million on LMR infrastructure, equipment, and personnel in  fiscal year 2016, with plans to continue spending approximately $450  million for each of the next 5 years, on average.", "According to OMB officials, the coordination required for a category  management approach includes discussions to standardize  configurations for common requirements and establish a shared vision  through common policies, processes, and procedures. Agencies\u2019 subject  matter experts must first identify the common technical standards and  features required for a category management approach, according to  OMB officials. For example, to develop such standards for the IT goods  and services category management initiative, OMB convened IT and  procurement professionals from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, the General Services Administration, and the National  Institutes of Health to work with industry partners and representatives  from 20 federal agencies to develop a government-wide solution for  purchasing IT products and services. As a result of this initiative, three  existing contract vehicles were identified as high-performance, and OMB  began requiring civilian agencies to use those vehicles to purchase from  among six standard configurations of laptops and desktops.", "Our survey results suggest that such coordination, if applied to LMR  procurement, could enhance interoperability among partner agencies.  For example, many of the agencies that engage in coordinated  procurement also reported a better general level of LMR interoperability.  Based on survey responses, when an agency identified the need for LMR  interoperability with another agency and coordinated with that agency on  technical requirements before purchasing new equipment, the quality of  interoperability was reported as: excellent in 50 percent of the cases;  good in 39 percent of the cases; and worse (fair, poor, nonexistent) in 11  percent of the cases. In cases when an agency identified the need for  LMR interoperability with another agency but did not coordinate on  technical requirements before purchasing new equipment, a much lower  quality of interoperability was reported\u2014that is, LMR interoperability was  rated excellent for 13 percent of the cases; good for 55 percent of the  cases; and worse (fair, poor, nonexistent) for the remaining 32 percent of  the cases.

As a result, the agencies may be limited in their ability to exert buying  power with manufacturers to obtain quantity discounts. This duplication of  procurement efforts for similar goods and services imposes significant  costs to agencies. OMB recognizes that agencies often purchase and  manage items in a fragmented and inefficient manner, through tens of  thousands of contracts and delivery orders. To address this issue, OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy directs agencies to implement  category management as a way to manage spending across government  for commonly purchased goods and services. This approach enables the  federal government to leverage its purchasing power and realize cost  savings and may also help to enhance interoperability, particularly if taken  in combination with inter-agency agreements, and training and exercises.  Although OMB\u2019s category management approach includes many IT  goods and services, it does not include LMR equipment.

We were interested in agencies  that have used LMR to communicate with at least one other federal  agency for daily operations, planned events like presidential  inaugurations or unplanned/emergency incidents within the past 5 years.  The initial list of federal agencies was identified by the civilian  participating members of the Emergency Communications Preparedness  Center (ECPC) and confirmed by e-mail; we did not survey agencies  from the Department of Defense. These agencies were sent a web-based  survey that included questions related to LMR technology used,  procurement practices, and technical and non-technical factors that  helped or hindered agencies\u2019 ability to achieve interoperability.

All 74 agencies responded to the screening question. Agencies that met  this criterion\u201458 federal LMR users in all\u2014were further surveyed about  the type of equipment they use, interoperability needs, and procurement  practices, among other topics. Fifty-seven of the 58 agencies that we  identified as federal LMR users responded to the full survey. The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not respond to the full survey but  provided responses to a limited set of survey questions related to our first  objective, identifying agencies with which they require LMR  interoperability. Specifically, the FBI provided a list of civilian federal  agencies that it required LMR to communicate with within the past 5  years, which we included in the partner agency network analysis. Sixteen  agencies that confirmed that they did not use LMR for communication in  the first question did not continue with the survey. To ensure that our  survey questions and skip pattern were clear and logical and that  respondents could answer the questions without undue burden, we pre- tested our survey with five agencies: the Office of the Chief Information  Officer at the Department of Interior, the Office of the Chief Information  Officer at the Department of Homeland Security; the Forest Service at the  Department of Agriculture; the Office of the Inspector General for Tax  Administration at the Department of the Treasury; and the Bureau of  Diplomatic Security at the Department of State.

For example, we asked agencies to indicate whether they have  standard operating procedures related to their LMR interoperability with  their partner agencies. For each factor that the agencies have  implemented, we asked how much the factor helped, if at all, and for  factors that they have not implemented fully, we asked if the factor is a  priority for the agency to implement.

We reviewed literature to identify category  management as a potential procurement practice that can leverage the  buying power of the federal government to increase cost saving and  reduce redundancy. To understand the feasibility of using category  management to procure LMR equipment, we asked officials from the  Office of Management and Budget what factors they consider when  deciding whether a particular technology makes a good candidate for its  category management initiative.
