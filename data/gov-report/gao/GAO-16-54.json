GAO found that DOD leadership and its Defense COE Oversight Board established and refined the definition and criteria for designating entities as Defense COEs. DOD's criteria require its Defense COEs, for example, to achieve improvements in clinical care outcomes and produce optimal value for servicemembers. The Oversight Board developed these criteria in order to have a consistent basis for designating entities as Defense COEs and to limit entities from self-identifying as Defense COEs without meeting the criteria. DOD also developed a uniform process for designating COEs. VHA service offices use a peer review process to designate their COEs. However, unlike DOD, VHA has not developed criteria for designating its COEs. Federal internal control standards provide that management should have a control environment that provides management's framework for planning, directing, and controlling operations to achieve agency objectives, such as VHA's objectives for how COEs are to operate and what COEs are supposed to achieve. Without defined criteria, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that its COEs are meeting the agency's intended objectives for COEs.", "The Defense COE Oversight Board and most service offices responsible for overseeing VHA COEs lack written procedures for documenting oversight activities related to their COEs, including requirements for documenting identified problems and their resolution. GAO found that the Oversight Board's charter does not explain how (1) the board will provide and document its feedback, (2) the Defense COEs will respond to this feedback, and (3) the board will document resolution of identified issues. The Oversight Board's acting chairman told GAO the charter gives the board its authority to conduct oversight of Defense COEs and if these types of procedures are needed, the Oversight Board's charter and meeting minutes will serve this purpose. However, GAO's review of the charter and minutes found that they do not contain these types of procedures. Likewise, GAO found that five of six VHA service offices have no written procedures for documenting their findings and the corrective actions taken by COEs. VHA officials told GAO that they do not see a need to develop specific written procedures for documenting oversight of their COEs. Federal internal control standards state that transactions and events should be promptly documented to maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling their operations. Further, significant events, such as the identification of problems and the actions taken to correct them, need to be clearly documented, and these events should appear in management directives, policies or operating manuals to help ensure management's directives are carried out as intended.

Some providers of  care proclaim to be COEs without reference to specific criteria that would  demonstrate excellence in research, education, or clinical services.  Various groups have raised concerns about the definition of this term  because it is applied broadly and inconsistently by hospitals and health  care systems. These groups believe the term can cause confusion among  consumers of health care because they may believe the entity classified  as a COE has undergone some type of rigorous review or certification.

The charter lists the Oversight Board\u2019s  responsibilities and activities, and the quarterly meeting minutes provide  documentation of the Oversight Board\u2019s activities, procedures, and  decisions. For example, the Oversight Board\u2019s charter requires the Board  to conduct periodic reviews of Defense COEs\u2019 performance and to review  and recommend applicants for Defense COE designation. The charter  was originally signed in September 2011 by the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, and updated and signed again in May 2015.

In 2011, following our study  of one of DOD\u2019s statutorily mandated COEs, DOD leadership determined  that it needed to conduct a review of all existing COEs and develop a  definition that would be used as criteria for designating entities as  Defense COEs. MHS leadership developed a definition for Defense  COEs, and the COE Oversight Board members refined and approved the  criteria contained in this definition. Only entities that meet the criteria in  the Oversight Board-approved definition can be given the designation of a  Defense COE.", "The definition approved by the Oversight Board states that Defense  COEs will focus on an associated group of clinical conditions and achieve  improvement in outcomes through clinical, educational, and research  activities. The criteria require Defense COEs to provide the entire clinical  spectrum of care for a patient\u2014from the prevention of diseases and  treatment of clinical conditions through rehabilitation and transition to  civilian life; for example, by developing clinical practice guidelines and  educational materials and identifying research priorities and strategies for  improving access to care. In addition, the Oversight Board developed  other criteria that entities applying for Defense COE designation have to  meet, such as clearly defining their mission, developing metrics to  quantitatively assess their progress in meeting their mission, and  determining whether the research they plan to conduct is needed  because of existing research gaps.", "The Oversight Board acting chairman said the board developed criteria  for a Defense COE because it is important for the board, as well as MHS  leadership, to apply consistent criteria when designating entities as  Defense COEs. The acting chairman said not having clear and consistent  criteria could make it easier for entities to self-identify as a Defense COE  without meeting rigorous requirements. In addition, the criteria may  facilitate coordination among COEs to meet the agency\u2019s intended  objectives for them\u2014which is to improve the health of servicemembers,  veterans, their families, and ultimately the military readiness of  servicemembers.", "Approval process for Defense COEs. The Oversight Board established  a uniform process that requires applicants to present consistent  information when applying for Defense COE designation. Applicants are  required to describe why the designation as a Defense COE is important  to them and how they meet the criteria of a Defense COE. The Oversight  Board, after considering the applications from potential COEs,  subsequently determines whether a Defense COE applicant passes the  preliminary review. Applicants that do not pass the preliminary review are  instructed to provide additional information or clarify the information  presented for reconsideration. There is no limit on the number of times  they can resubmit their application. Those that pass this preliminary  review are instructed to develop a concept of operations (CONOPS) and  a briefing for the Oversight Board. A CONOPS is a document that is  designed to give an overall picture of the operation of the proposed  Defense COE, explaining what the applicant intends to accomplish and  how it will be done using available resources. The CONOPS includes a  description of the value that the applicant brings to the MHS and a brief  description of MHS needs and gaps that the applicant will address. The  Oversight Board developed a CONOPS template to ensure that during  required briefings information is consistently presented to the Board by  applicants seeking Defense COE status. The applicant\u2019s briefing to the  Oversight Board is intended to provide an overview of the mission and  goals of the applicant COE, including how the applicant meets the  Defense COE criteria, as established by the Oversight Board.", "After reviewing documentation from applicants, Oversight Board  members make recommendations about Defense COE designation to the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, who makes the final  decision. According to DOD officials, in 2012, after the Oversight Board  reviewed the briefings and CONOPS for the four statutorily mandated  COEs and made its recommendations, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs designated these applicants as Defense COEs.  Subsequently, the Oversight Board reviewed and approved three other  applicants as Defense COEs, according to these officials.

A  good internal control environment requires that the agency\u2019s  organizational structure clearly define key areas of authority and  responsibility for operating activities. The organizational structure  encompasses the operational processes needed to achieve  management\u2019s objectives.

VHA officials  reported to us that the agency has 70 COEs, with the largest number  located within VHA\u2019s Office of Patient Care Services. The Office of  Patient Care Services reported that it has 49 COEs\u201439 statutorily  mandated and 10 VHA designated. The Rehabilitation Research and  Development Service, under VHA\u2019s Office of Research and  Development, reported it has 13 VHA-designated COEs, and VHA\u2019s  Office of Academic Affiliations reported 8 VHA-designated COEs.  However, VHA\u2019s Office of Patient Care Services Chief of Financial  Operations could not confirm this number, telling us he could not  provide us with a definite number of COEs because there were no  criteria for him to use to identify entities designated as COEs. Other  VHA officials have also had difficulty identifying the universe of VHA\u2019s  COEs. For example, VHA officials initially omitted listing the 20  Geriatric Research Education Clinical Centers (GRECC) as VHA  COEs until we told these officials that GRECC officials told us they  were designated as VHA COEs.", "In addition, confusion exists within VHA about statutorily mandated COEs  because of the lack of criteria. For the COEs that VHA officials said were  statutorily mandated, the statutory language often uses the term \u201ccenter.\u201d  VHA decided to designate some of these centers as COEs, even though  the statutory language was the same or similar for many centers that VHA  did not designate as COEs. For example, the National Center for  Preventive Health has statutory language similar to the language  establishing the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD); however, the National Center for PTSD is considered a VHA  COE while the National Center for Preventive Health is not. Officials  from VHA and VA\u2019s Office of General Counsel were unable to explain  why some centers listed in statutory language are designated as COEs,  while other centers with similar language are not designated as COEs. In  addition, these officials could not provide the criteria that were used to  designate these centers as COEs.", "Process for designating entities as VHA COEs. VHA service offices  use a peer review process to designate entities as VHA COEs. In  general, a peer review process is often used by government agencies to  determine the merit of proposals submitted by researchers applying for  grants or some type of funding.", "VHA service offices typically solicit applications or proposals from entities  interested in being designated a COE, and interested entities complete an  application or submit a proposal. Each application or proposal for COE  designation may differ depending on the condition, disease, or specific  health-related area being studied. For example, applications or proposals  for a mental health COE designation may require applicants to address  how their research will focus on bipolar disorder, borderline personality  disorder, or schizophrenia, while applications or proposals for an  educational COE may require applicants to address how they will develop  and test innovative approaches for curricula related to patient-centered  care or study new approaches and models of collaboration among health  care professionals.", "Within each of the six service offices, applications or proposals are  reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts who prioritize the  applications based on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals or  on the proposals with the highest merit rating. The service office peer  review panel may be made up of experts from VHA entities or from  entities external to VHA, according to VHA officials. Generally, the  experts review information such as the focus of the planned research and  available staffing and funding. Once the experts identify the best  applicants, they forward this information to the appropriate service office  officials. If the service office staff agrees with the list of best applicants,  some service offices forward this list to the Under Secretary for Health,  who ultimately makes the final decision with respect to designating an  entity as a VHA COE, while other service offices forward the list to their  program director, who makes the final decision.", "While all six service offices use a peer review process to review, approve,  and designate entities as COEs, the processes may differ in several  respects. First, the content of submitted applications or proposals may  differ among service offices. This is due, in part, to the lack of consistent  and standard criteria within VHA that applicants must meet to be  designated a VHA COE, such as how the applicant will meet the needs of  veterans and their families and ensure that pertinent research is  conducted to meet these needs\u2014VHA\u2019s intended objectives for its COEs,  according to VHA officials. Second, the types and levels of review within  service offices vary. For example, to help prioritize the best applicants,  two VHA service offices developed a numerical scoring system to rate  each application based on scientific and technical merit, typically based  on the requirements contained in the solicitation for applications or  proposals. For instance, if the solicitation for applications or proposals  requires an evaluation plan that contains specific evaluation criteria, such  as proposed outcome measurements, reporting methodology, expected  findings, and potential implications for VHA and the community,  applicants can be awarded up to 10 points for including these items.  Other service offices do not include a scoring system as part of their  approval process. Third, four of VHA\u2019s six service offices conduct a site  visit to the highest rated applicants\u2019 facilities as part of their approval  process; the other two do not, according to VHA officials. An official from  one service office told us the staff members that conduct the visits have  seen many potential COEs, and such on-site inspections can help to  determine the applicant\u2019s potential viability as a COE."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Both DOD and VHA Lack Written Procedures for Documenting Activities to Oversee COEs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense COE Oversight Board Does Not Have Written Procedures for Documenting Oversight Activities", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the Oversight Board\u2019s charter found that it does not contain  procedures for how oversight of Defense COEs will be documented.
