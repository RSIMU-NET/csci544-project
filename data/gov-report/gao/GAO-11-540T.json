To do this, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed six foreign tax administrators as well as tax experts, tax practitioners, taxpayers, and trade group representatives.

These practices, although common to each system, have important differences. Although differences in laws, culture, or other factors likely would affect the transferability of foreign tax practices to the U.S., these practices may provide useful insights for policymakers and the IRS. For example, New Zealand integrates evaluations of its tax and discretionary spending programs. The evaluation of its Working For Families tax benefits and discretionary spending, which together financially assist low- and middle-income families to promote employment, found that its programs aided the transition to employment but that it still had an underserved population; these findings likely would not have emerged from separate evaluations. GAO previously has reported that the U.S. lacks clarity on evaluating tax expenditures and related discretionary spending programs and does not generally undertake integrated evaluations. In Finland, electronic tax administration is part of a government policy to use electronic services to lower the cost of government and encourage private-sector growth. Overall, according to Finnish officials, electronic services have helped to reduce Tax Administration staff by over 11 percent from 2003 to 2009 while improving taxpayer service. IRS officials learn about these practices based on interactions with other tax administrators and participation in international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In turn, IRS may adopt new practices based on the needs of the U.S. tax system. For example, in 2009, IRS formed the Global High Wealth Industry program.

Our work includes selected practices of New  Zealand, Finland, European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), Australia,  and Hong Kong.  Our report, to be issued in May 2011, will provide our  detailed descriptions of those tax administration practices and their  differences from U.S. practices.", "We based our selection of these practices on several factors, including  whether the tax administrators had advanced economies and tax systems,  tax information was available in English, and the foreign tax  administrator\u2019s approach differed from how the U.S. approaches similar  issues. We reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 6 foreign  tax administrations. We primarily used documentation from each  government\u2019s reports that are publicly available. When possible, we  confirmed additional information provided to us by officials and held  meetings with experts, public interest groups, and trade groups to identify  their views about these systems.

Being responsible  for collecting sensitive taxpayer information, IRD must maintain tax  privacy and protect the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. MSD  administers the WFF\u2019s program funds and is responsible for collecting  data that includes monthly income received by its beneficiaries. This  required that IRD and MSD keep separate datasets, making it difficult to  assess the cumulative effect of the WFF program.", "To understand the cumulative effect of changes made to the WFF program  and ensure that eligible participants were using it, New Zealand created a  joint research program between IRD and MSD from October 2004 to April  2010. The joint research program created linked datasets between IRD and  MSD. Access to sensitive taxpayer information was restricted to IRD  employees on the joint research program and to authorized MSD  employees only after they were sworn in as IRD employees.", "The research provided information on key outcomes that could only be  tracked through the linked datasets. The research found that the WFF  program aided the transition from relying on government benefits to  employment, as intended. It also found that a disproportionate number of  those not participating in the program were from an indigenous  population, which faced barriers to taking advantage of the WFF. Barriers  included the perceived stigma from receiving government aid, the  transaction costs of too many rules and regulations, and the small amounts  of aid for some participants. Changes made by Parliament to WFF based  on these findings provided an additional NZ$1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) per  year in increased financial entitlements and in-work support to low- to  middle-income families.", "While economic differences exist between the New Zealand and U.S. tax  systems, both systems use tax expenditures (i.e., tax credits in New  Zealand).

New Zealand did so while protecting confidential tax data from  unauthorized disclosure.", "In 2005, we reported that the U.S. had substantial tax expenditures but  lacked clarity on the roles of the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), Department of the Treasury, IRS, and federal agencies with  discretionary spending programs responsibilities to evaluate the tax  expenditures.  Consequently, the U.S. lacked information on how effective  tax expenditures were in achieving their intended objectives, how cost- effective benefits were achieved, and whether tax expenditures or  discretionary spending programs worked well together to accomplish  federal objectives.  At that time, OMB disagreed with our  recommendations to incorporate tax expenditures into federal  performance management and budget review processes, citing  methodological and conceptual issues.

However, the current  directive does not require paying agents to record a TIN. Using names has  caused problems when other EU member states tried to access the data.

PAYE makes it unnecessary  for wage earners to file a yearly tax return, unless special circumstances  apply. For example, wage earners do not need to file a return unless  income from interest, dividends, or capital gains exceeds certain  thresholds or if deductions need to be reported. Therefore, a tax return  may not be required because most individuals do not earn enough of these  income types to trigger self-reporting. For example, the first \u00a310,100  (US$16,239) of capital gains income is exempt from being reported on tax  returns.  Even so, payers of interest or dividend income withhold tax  before payments are made.", "PAYE also facilitates the payment of tax liabilities by periodic withholding  at source for wages under the PAYE system.

In  the first step, individual tax returns are reviewed for inherent compliance  risks because of the taxpayers\u2019 income level and complexity of the tax  return. For example, wealthy taxpayers with complex business income are  considered to have a higher compliance risk than a wage earner. In the  second step, information compiled from various sources\u2014including  information returns and public sources\u2014is analyzed to identify returns  with a high compliance risk. According to HMRC officials, these  assessments have allowed HMRC to look at national and regional trends.

Matching is done using a unique identifier TIN.  HMRC officials told us that they have no automated document-matching  process and the UK does not use TINs as a universal identifier, which is  needed for wide-scale document matching.
