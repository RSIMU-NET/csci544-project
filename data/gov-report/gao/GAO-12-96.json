In the explanatory statement accompanying the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, GAO was directed to examine the FBI's headquarters facilities. In response, GAO examined the extent to which (1) these facilities support the FBI's security, space, and building condition requirements and (2) the FBI and the General Services Administration (GSA)--the real property steward for the Hoover Building--have followed leading capital decision-making practices in identifying alternatives for meeting the FBI's facility needs. GAO reviewed security, space, and condition assessments and planning studies; visited FBI facilities; and interviewed FBI and GSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to FBI and GSA assessments, the FBI's headquarters facilities--the Hoover Building and the headquarters annexes--do not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. The FBI has addressed many security concerns at the Hoover Building by implementing protective measures. Furthermore, in response to a recommendation GAO made in a law enforcement sensitive version of this report issued in July 2011, the FBI has updated its security assessment of the Hoover Building in accordance with security standards issued in 2010. The assessment includes recommendations but does not indicate whether recommended actions will be implemented. While this is reasonable given the short period of time since GAO's July 2011 report, documentation of decisions on the recommendations and tracking implementation is important because of facility planning and budget implications--for both the Hoover Building and a new headquarters--and time needed to coordinate with GSA. FBI officials told GAO that the annexes will be assessed against the 2010 security standards. The officials noted, though, that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges. The Hoover Building's original design is inefficient, according to GSA assessments, making it difficult to reconfigure space to promote staff collaboration. Staff dispersion across annexes likewise hampers collaboration and the performance of some classified work. Furthermore, the condition of the Hoover Building is deteriorating, and GSA assessments have identified significant recapitalization needs. However, GSA has decided to limit investments in the Hoover Building to those necessary to protect health and safety and keep building systems functioning while GSA assesses the FBI's facility needs. This decision increases the potential for building system failures and disruption to the FBI's operations. Through studies conducted over the past decade, the FBI and GSA have considered three broad alternatives, each with variations, to try to meet the FBI's facility needs--(1) modernize the Hoover Building, (2) demolish the Hoover Building and construct a new headquarters on the existing site, and (3) acquire a new headquarters on a new site. In doing so, the FBI and GSA thus far have generally followed leading practices for capital decision making. To varying degrees, these alternatives would improve security, space, and building conditions, but each would take several years to implement. Estimates of the alternatives' costs, developed in the studies, are not comparable because they were prepared at different times and for different purposes. The FBI and GSA plan to discuss the FBI's facility needs with the Office of Management and Budget, and GSA and the FBI will need to present a business case, including current, comparable cost estimates, to support the choice of a preferred alternative and financing strategy. The FBI's 2011 security assessment of the Hoover Building, as well as information on any security improvements that may be needed at the annexes, could inform the agencies' decisions and help ensure that limited budgetary resources are allocated effectively. This is a public version of a law enforcement sensitive report that GAO issued in July 2011, which has been updated, including a modification to a recommendation, to reflect recent FBI actions. Information that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security deemed sensitive has been omitted. The FBI should document decisions about, and track its implementation of, all security recommendations for the Hoover Building and the FBI's headquarters annexes. GSA should reassess its decision to limit recapitalization investments in the Hoover Building, since the FBI is likely to stay in it for several more years while its long-term facility needs are being planned. The FBI agreed with these recommendations. GSA indicated it is working to implement GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), within the Department of  Justice, acts to protect and defend the United States against crime,  terrorism, and foreign intelligence threats. Since September 11, 2001, the  FBI\u2019s antiterrorism mission has greatly expanded and its efforts in other  areas\u2014such as cyber crime\u2014have also grown. The agency\u2019s total  headquarters workforce has increased by approximately 5 percent  annually since 2001. As a result, the FBI has outgrown its main  headquarters facility, the J. Edgar Hoover Building (Hoover Building) in  Washington, D.C. Headquarters staff who cannot be accommodated in  the Hoover Building are dispersed in over 40 leased annexes (annexes),  the majority of which are located in the National Capital Region. FBI  officials report that the dispersion of staff, combined with condition  deficiencies at the Hoover Building and site, affects security and creates  operational inefficiencies. In addition, these security, space, and building  condition issues have raised congressional concerns about how well the  Hoover Building and annexes meet the FBI\u2019s security requirements and  operational needs. In its 2005 Asset Management Plan, the FBI identified  the need for a new headquarters facility to support its strategic objectives,  which include providing security for personnel and information in an  efficient and cost-effective workspace. To meet these objectives, the FBI  has taken steps to document its headquarters facility requirements and, in  collaboration with the General Services Administration (GSA), the  government\u2019s real property steward, has studied a number of alternatives  for meeting its needs.", "Congress directed us, in the explanatory statement accompanying the  2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, to review the Hoover Building and  associated off-site locations in light of its concerns about the security  posture of the Hoover Building and its inability to house the current FBI  Headquarters workforce.  We examined (1) the extent to which the  Hoover Building and annexes support the FBI\u2019s operational requirements  for security, space, and building condition and (2) the extent to which the  FBI and GSA have followed leading capital decision-making practices in  identifying alternatives for meeting the FBI\u2019s operational requirements and  the extent to which each alternative would address these requirements.", "This report is a public version of a law enforcement sensitive report that  we issued in July 2011. It communicates the publicly releasable aspects  of our findings while omitting information that the FBI and DHS  considered sensitive about the FBI\u2019s operations, the security posture of  the FBI\u2019s facilities, and measures the FBI has put in place to protect its  workforce. The overall methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To determine the extent to which the Hoover Building and annexes  support the FBI\u2019s operational requirements for security, space, and  building condition, we visited the Hoover Building and five annexes\u2014 which we selected to illustrate different facility security levels and degrees  of staff fragmentation\u2014to examine conditions firsthand and interview on- site representatives from FBI divisions (programs) and security officials  about those conditions. More specifically:  \uf0b7  For security, we compared past site-specific facility security  assessments (security assessments) for the Hoover Building and 15  of the annexes to federal security standards. For the Hoover Building,  we also assessed whether recommendations to improve security were  implemented. We spoke with agency security officials about the  security assessments, risks, and challenges resulting from dispersed  operations. Following our issuance of the law enforcement sensitive  version of this report in July 2011, the FBI updated its security  assessment of the Hoover Building, which we reviewed.   \uf0b7  For space, we reviewed the size and location of current facilities and  programs, and we interviewed FBI program officials to understand the  effects on operations of having different programs housed in several  locations. We also compared attributes of the Hoover Building\u2014such  as its efficiency (how much of its space is usable for mission needs)\u2014 to GSA standards and guidance.  \uf0b7  For building condition, we analyzed assessments of the Hoover  Building\u2019s physical condition and compared this information to GSA  policies for building condition. In addition, we examined GSA\u2019s asset  business plan for the building and other studies to identify completed  maintenance projects, deferred maintenance, and planned major  repair and recapitalization projects, and we asked FBI and GSA  officials about their assessments of the Hoover Building\u2019s condition.", "To determine the extent to which the FBI and GSA have followed leading  capital decision-making practices in identifying alternatives for meeting  the FBI\u2019s operational requirements, we compared the FBI\u2019s and GSA\u2019s  planning actions against leading practices we have reported on in this  area. In addition, we reviewed FBI and GSA studies of the FBI\u2019s facilities  and operational requirements and identified the alternatives discussed in  these studies for meeting the requirements. We determined that the  alternatives fell into three broad categories\u2014(1) modernize the Hoover  Building, (2) demolish the Hoover Building and construct a new  headquarters on the existing site, and (3) construct a new headquarters  on a new site\u2014each of which included a number of variations. For our  analysis, we focused on the categories, since the appropriateness of the  variations could not be determined without further study and would  depend on site-specific conditions. We then assessed the extent to which  each alternative would address the FBI\u2019s security, space, and building  condition requirements.", "We did not independently analyze the FBI\u2019s requirements for security,  which are based on its assessments of the threats it faces and their  probability of occurrence; its requirements for space, which are based on  its projections of each FBI program\u2019s future staffing and space needs,  such as the need for secure conference rooms; or its process for deciding  which programs to house in a new consolidated facility. In our view, such  analyses were outside the scope of our review and would require  extensive reviews of classified intelligence on threats and hostile groups,  as well as of programmatic mission justifications for FBI branches and  their associated staffing levels. We did, however, determine that the FBI  senior leadership was involved in deciding which FBI programs should be  colocated. Furthermore, because the FBI and GSA are still in the early  stages of the facility planning process and had not finalized cost  estimates for budgetary purposes at the time of our review, we did not  validate cost estimates for new construction or past cost estimates for  modernizing or redeveloping the Hoover Building and site. Appendix I  contains a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to November 2011,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1964, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved the  design concept for FBI headquarters. Construction started in 1967, and in  1974, FBI personnel began moving into the new building, which was  named for the FBI\u2019s first director, J. Edgar Hoover (see fig. 1). Situated on  one entire city block in downtown Washington, D.C., and containing  approximately 2.4 million gross square feet of space, the building is  bounded by four major city streets\u20149th, 10th, and E Streets and  Pennsylvania Avenue\u2014all of which are open to public traffic (see fig. 2).  The building is a concrete structure, 7 stories high on its Pennsylvania  Avenue side and 11 stories high on its E Street side. A dry moat protects  the building in addition to numerous antivehicular barriers.", "When the FBI first occupied the Hoover Building, it was primarily a law  enforcement organization. Since then, its mission has grown in response  to evolving threats and now includes counterterrorism,  counterintelligence, weapons of mass destruction deterrence, and cyber  security. Accordingly, use of the Hoover Building has changed to support  new programs in these areas. For example, the Hoover Building originally  housed a crime laboratory, and more space was dedicated to records  storage. These functions have since been transferred to off-site locations,  making space available for new programs in the Hoover Building.", "The FBI\u2019s headquarters workforce has grown as the agency has assumed  new mission responsibilities. In 2001, the FBI had 9,700 headquarters  staff, working in 7 locations. Today, the FBI has 17,300 headquarters  staff, including those housed in more than 40 annexes, the majority of  which are located within the National Capital Region. According to the  FBI, programs in 21 of these off-site locations and in the Hoover Building  should be colocated to meet the agency\u2019s mission requirements. In  projecting its staffing levels from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year  2018, the FBI estimated that its headquarters workforce will grow by a  total of 7 percent during that period.", "The FBI\u2019s headquarters facilities, like all facilities in the United States  occupied by federal employees for nonmilitary activities, are subject to the  Interagency Security Committee\u2019s (ISC) baseline facility security  standards. The ISC, chaired by the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) and composed of representatives from all major federal  departments and agencies, is tasked with coordinating federal agencies\u2019  facility protection efforts, developing security standards, and overseeing  the implementation of security measures. In 2004, the ISC issued  security criteria for federally owned facilities and space leased by  agencies (hereafter referred to as the 2004 ISC standards), establishing  facility security standards for space owned or leased by the federal  government. In 2010, the ISC issued new standards that superseded the  2004 standards. The new security criteria (hereafter referred to as the  2010 ISC standards) were intended to make security an integral part of  the operations, planning, design, construction, renovation, or acquisition  of federal facilities\u2014whether in owned or leased space. The 2010 ISC  standards establish a baseline set of protective measures  (countermeasures) to be applied at each facility according to its security  level and outline a risk management process for agencies to follow as  they assess the security of their facilities.", "To determine the security level of a federal facility, the ISC uses criteria  that it issued in 2008. Factors considered in determining the facility  security level (FSL) include the criticality of an agency\u2019s mission, the  symbolism of the facility, and the building\u2019s size and population. The  Hoover Building is categorized at the same FSL applied to the  headquarters facilities of other agencies with national security missions,  such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense.  The FSLs of the FBI\u2019s annexes in the National Capital Region vary.", "In meeting its needs for office space, the FBI generally works through  GSA, although it has received direct appropriations to construct  specialized facilities, such as the FBI laboratory and academy training  facilities, and has entered into leases on its own. GSA can use  government-owned or leased facilities to meet an agency\u2019s space  needs. If a facility is not available to meet the agency\u2019s needs and the  estimated cost of a new facility exceeds a defined dollar threshold, GSA  can request congressional authorization to construct or lease a new  facility by submitting a project prospectus. GSA typically funds new  federal construction and the acquisition of leased space from the Federal  Buildings Fund (FBF). Agencies occupying GSA-controlled space  (owned or leased) pay rent to GSA, which GSA deposits into the FBF.  GSA then pays the landlord from the FBF for those buildings it leases.  In addition to federal construction or leasing, GSA has the authority to  enter into a sale-leaseback or a ground lease and leaseback  arrangement through which GSA sells or leases federal land to a  developer that builds a facility on the site and leases it back to GSA. We  have previously reported that the FBF is not large enough to meet GSA\u2019s  construction and major repair needs and that alternative financing  strategies may be viable options for GSA to meet agencies\u2019 facilities  needs.", "GSA has generally provided space in leased facilities for the FBI\u2019s  expanded headquarters staff. We have also reported that GSA has used  operating leases extensively to meet agencies\u2019 long-term space needs,  even though building ownership is generally less costly. Both GSA and  the FBI have generally concluded that the FBI has long-term space needs  and that its operations should be consolidated to achieve greater security  and efficiency.

We found that planning for the FBI\u2019s  headquarters security requirements has evolved over time. A 2005 GSA  study and a 2009 FBI study cited different planning assumptions about  the security requirements for a new FBI headquarters. The 2010 ISC  standards do not prescribe security requirements for federal facilities like  the Hoover Building or new facilities that an agency proposes to construct  or lease. Instead, the 2010 standards indicate that, in establishing  requirements for existing or new facilities, agencies should determine  what combination of countermeasures would provide an appropriate level  of protection against identified threat scenarios that the ISC refers to as  the \u201cdesign-basis threat.\u201d Furthermore, the 2010 ISC standards indicate  that whenever an agency-determined threat level deviates from the ISC  design-basis threat baseline, the factors that influenced the agency\u2019s  threat assessment must be documented and fully supported by detailed  information as part of the assessment.", "In addition to the Hoover Building not meeting the FBI\u2019s long-term security  requirements, FBI security officials told us on our site visits that they have  some security concerns\u2014to varying degrees\u2014about some of the  headquarters annexes, including the following:  \uf0b7  Proximity of non-FBI tenants to FBI employees performing  sensitive operations. At least nine annexes are located in multitenant  buildings, where some space is leased by the FBI and other space is  leased by nonfederal tenants. While this arrangement does not  automatically put FBI operations at risk, it heightens security concerns.  \uf0b7  Lack of control over common areas. FBI security officials also cited a  lack of control over common areas in multitenant buildings. For  example, at one annex we visited, FBI officials told us that the  building\u2019s landlord denied the FBI\u2019s request to implement some  recommended countermeasures made in 2007 and in 2009 by DHS\u2019s  Federal Protective Service (FPS), which conducts security  assessments of facilities under the control or custody of GSA. The  landlord chose not to implement the countermeasures, citing costs and  concerns about inconveniencing nonfederal tenants in the building.  \uf0b7  FBI Police response. According to FBI officials, security at the  annexes is primarily handled by contract guards, local police, or the  FBI\u2019s internal police force, the FBI Police, depending on the location  and circumstances. The FBI Police does not physically station its  personnel at the annexes; rather, it periodically conducts patrols of  annexes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Has Implemented Several Countermeasures to Improve the Security of the Hoover Building", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, the FBI has implemented countermeasures  at the Hoover Building to improve security, including  \uf0b7  upgrading the building\u2019s exterior windows;  \uf0b7  moving and upgrading the security of the FBI business visitor center  so that it now provides internal queuing for identification checks, an X- ray screening area, a badge office, and a secure waiting area;  strengthening barriers to prevent unauthorized access;  installing new doors to the building to meet the FBI\u2019s requirements for  protection against forced entry;  securing air intakes to keep airborne contaminants out of the building;  and  \uf0b7  paying the District of Columbia government to restrict public metered  parking along one side of the building in order to prevent unscreened  vehicles from parking or idling near the building.", "Although the FBI has implemented these countermeasures, others have  yet to be implemented, and FBI officials did not provide historical  documentation of the agency\u2019s rationale for not implementing them. FBI  security officials we spoke with were not part of the earlier decision  making, but suggested that some past recommendations were not  implemented because of their high cost and potential impact on  operations. A 2005 GSA study concluded that some of the  recommendations would have been costly and disruptive to the FBI\u2019s  operations within the building. Because FBI officials did not provide  historical documentation of the FBI\u2019s rationale for not implementing some  recommendations, it is difficult for us to determine why the FBI and GSA  did not pursue them. More recently, in 2008, the FBI received approval  from NCPC for one security project at the Hoover Building, but FBI  officials reported they were unsuccessful in obtaining funding for the  project before NCPC\u2019s approval expired. The FBI said it intends to  resubmit its request for NCPC approval at the end of fiscal year 2011,  and if the request is approved, it may attempt to obtain funding in fiscal  year 2012.", "While implementing recommended countermeasures may not always be  feasible\u2014because of physical limitations or budgetary restrictions, for  example\u2014the 2010 ISC standards require agencies to document any  decision to reject or defer the countermeasures\u2019 implementation, including  whether the agency is willing to accept risk and whether there are any  alternative strategies to meet the agency\u2019s required level of protection.

For federal buildings under the control or  custody of GSA, such as the Hoover Building, FPS normally conducts  periodic security assessments unless the tenant agency waives the  requirement for FPS to do so. The FBI waived the requirement for FPS to  conduct security assessments of the Hoover Building, acknowledging that  it would assume responsibility for conducting the assessments itself.  However, the FBI did not conduct a comprehensive assessment of the  Hoover Building from 2002 until 2011 because, according to FBI officials,  the FBI had concluded that an updated assessment would be unlikely to  yield new information.", "Under the current ISC standards, agencies are to conduct security  assessments of their facilities at regular intervals, depending on the  building\u2019s FSL. The requirement for the Hoover Building is every 3 years.  The ISC also requires agencies to document their security assessment  findings in a report, including the threats and vulnerabilities they have  identified and the specific countermeasures they have recommended  based on their building\u2019s FSL. Conducting regular security assessments  is also an important component of one of our key practices in protecting  federal facilities\u2014allocating resources using a risk management  approach. This practice emphasizes the need to identify threats and  assess vulnerabilities in order to develop countermeasures and to  prioritize the allocation of resources as conditions change.", "In July 2011, we reported that an updated security assessment would  allow the FBI to fully assess the building against the 2010 ISC standards,  evaluate if additional security technologies could be implemented, and  document decisions about whether to implement certain  recommendations or accept risk going forward. We also noted that an  updated security assessment would provide the FBI with current  information to help prioritize its allocation of security-related resources  across all of its facilities. We recommended that the FBI update the  Hoover Building\u2019s security assessment using the 2010 ISC standards,  including (1) documenting threats, (2) analyzing the building security  requirements, and (3) indicating whether recommendations would be  implemented.", "Subsequent to our July 2011 law enforcement sensitive report, the FBI  completed a security assessment of the Hoover Building. This security  assessment was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Physical Security Unit and  coordinated with the FBI Police and the FBI\u2019s Facilities and Logistics  Services Division. FBI security staff evaluated security conditions against  specific criteria outlined in the 2010 ISC standards. According to our  analysis, the assessment covered some areas that were not covered in  the 2002 assessment. Moreover, the assessment documented both the  security posture of the Hoover Building and the FBI\u2019s building security  requirements in relation to baseline ISC requirements. Where  appropriate, the assessment included recommendations, and those  recommendations were recently forwarded to the FBI\u2019s executive  management for consideration. Currently, the FBI is in the process of  determining its response to these recommendations, some of which  would require capital investments in the building. FBI needs time to make  final decisions on some recommendations and may need to reach  agreement with GSA as the federal steward for the building.

Tracking the implementation status of all  countermeasures recommended in FPS or FBI security assessments will  provide the FBI with complete, current information on any security  vulnerabilities at its annexes, and help it determine the extent to which the  annexes meet the 2010 ISC standards and the FBI\u2019s security  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Hoover Building\u2019s Design Limits Space Efficiencies and Hampers Collaboration; Dispersion of Staff Causes Operational and Logistical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although the Hoover Building is large, occupying an entire city block,  much of its approximately 2.4 million gross square feet of space is  unusable, and the remaining usable space\u2014according to a 2007 study  conducted for GSA and the FBI\u2014is not designed to meet the needs of  today\u2019s FBI. According to a 2008 GSA market appraisal of the building,  its design is inefficient and functionally obsolete. According to the FBI,  the space is laid out as efficiently as possible, but the original design of  the building\u2019s floor plates is inefficient. For example, the building  provides a lower percentage of usable square footage for office and  mission functions than a federal office building built to current design  standards. In its 2010 facilities standards, GSA established a space  efficiency target of 75 percent for new federal office buildings, based on  the ratio of usable to gross square footage.

Renovations were implemented reactively as the agency\u2019s mission grew.  Some areas could not be renovated as open spaces, as desired, because  the building\u2019s original design hampered such changes. While converting  building support space has provided the FBI with some additional offices  in the Hoover Building, GSA\u2019s facility condition assessment indicates  that those offices may not be adequately ventilated and cooled. As a  result, some space may provide an uncomfortable working environment  for staff. GSA has a project planned to address ventilation requirements.  While the project was proposed as early as 2004, we found that GSA has  been unable to get the design approvals needed to implement the  project. FBI officials we spoke with also indicated that the building lost  some functionality\u2014for example, they said less space was available for  meetings\u2014after those spaces were converted to offices to accommodate  the agency\u2019s rapid growth.", "The FBI and GSA have concluded that the Hoover Building\u2019s interior  design remains a significant barrier to staff collaboration and information  sharing across teams. Furthermore, GSA has concluded that the  building\u2019s structure constrains further increases in its efficiency. For  example, a 2007 study for GSA and the FBI found that the Hoover  Building\u2019s long corridors and closed office suites result in significant  fragmentation among working groups that hampers communication and  collaboration and that the building\u2019s inflexible design is incompatible with  changing mission needs. FBI officials told us that whereas newer office  buildings with modular designs can be quickly and cost-efficiently  reconfigured to accommodate new missions or staff growth, the Hoover  Building would likely require months of modernization work to achieve  similar results. According to senior FBI and GSA officials, space  restrictions at the Hoover Building limit the FBI\u2019s ability to meet two GSA  workplace goals for the next decade\u2014to improve collaboration and  communication and to make more efficient use of space.", "Because the Hoover Building cannot readily be modified to accommodate  new mission needs and staff growth, and because core headquarters  staff are therefore dispersed among multiple annexes, the FBI now faces  several operational and logistical challenges. According to FBI officials,  space constraints at the Hoover Building and the resulting dispersion of  staff sometimes prevent the FBI from physically locating certain types of  analysts and specialists together. For example, according to an FBI  report, one FBI division within the Hoover Building is not able to embed  analysts within other offices\u2014to facilitate greater collaboration\u2014because  of the lack of available space. During our site visits, FBI officials reported  logistical challenges as well, including a lack of facilities at a few annexes  for discussing some classified information, known as sensitive  compartmented information facilities (SCIF). As a result, some FBI  personnel told us they have to travel to meetings in different locations  across the National Capital Region, resulting in inefficient use of their time  and the FBI\u2019s transportation resources. Furthermore, FBI officials at three  annexes we visited reported that the private landlords responsible for  building maintenance at their sites were often slow to respond to  maintenance requests from the FBI, such as requests for repairs to  malfunctioning heating and cooling systems.", "To mitigate the operational and logistical challenges of dispersion and to  avoid further complications as its workforce continues to grow, the FBI  has centralized its real property management functions for headquarters  and has begun to take a more focused approach to managing its space  needs. In 2005, the FBI established a central Space Management Unit  and started assessing its headquarters space needs twice a year.

For example, since 2004, GSA has spent approximately $22  million to upgrade components and systems in the Hoover Building.  Nevertheless, a 2009 GSA physical condition survey estimated that the  building requires about $80.5 million in further repairs and upgrades. The  condition survey identifies repair needs to the building\u2019s air-handling  distribution systems and ductwork ($44.2 million), electrical switchgear  ($23.3 million), and elevators ($2.3 million), among other systems. GSA  officials told us these repairs have been deferred. GSA also has plans to  repair the building\u2019s concrete fa\u00e7ade ($8.9 million) and to replace the  entire fire alarm system ($22 million), but has not yet obtained funding for  either project. GSA officials indicated that the fire alarm system  replacement would most likely be included in any future renovation of the  Hoover Building.", "During a tour of the Hoover Building given by FBI officials, we observed  several signs of exterior and interior deterioration. One FBI official stated  that some areas of the upper-level exterior fa\u00e7ade have deteriorated over  time, heightening the risk that pieces of concrete could fall and strike  pedestrians below. As a precautionary measure, GSA and the FBI have  installed netting around the upper level of the building to catch any falling  debris. In addition, water infiltration from the courtyard has corroded parts  of the parking garage ceiling. The basement is also prone to flooding from  the interior courtyard during periods of rain. Figure 4 depicts conditions  we observed during our tour.", "At the time of our review, the Hoover Building was categorized as a \u201ccore  asset\u201d in GSA\u2019s asset business plan. However, this categorization was  inconsistent with GSA\u2019s decision to limit major repair and recapitalization  investments in the building. GSA core assets generally have a long-term  holding period of at least 15 years. For buildings with a long-term holding  period, GSA policy states that reinvestment will be funded to ensure  maintenance of the building\u2019s quality and condition at levels appropriate  to meet continuing mission and customer needs. This includes all  preventative maintenance, necessary upgrades, and enhancements to  the building and its systems to maintain the asset in appropriate  condition. GSA\u2019s near-term maintenance policy for the Hoover Building is  more consistent with GSA\u2019s policy for a \u201ctransition asset.\u201d A transition  asset typically has a 6- to 15-year holding period as its tenant prepares  for relocation to a new federal building or a leased building. For such an  asset, GSA funds projects that meet basic needs in transition, but avoids  any major reinvestment. In its technical comments on our draft law  enforcement sensitive report, GSA reported that it has recently  recategorized the Hoover Building as a transition asset to reflect the FBI\u2019s  concerns about the building\u2019s security, condition, and efficiency, as well  as GSA\u2019s own decision to limit investments in the building. GSA further  reported that its categorization of the building may change again if the FBI  moves or further study of the asset points to a change. Regardless of how  the building is categorized, it will likely be used for several more years,  and its large backlog of deferred maintenance, major repairs, and  recapitalization requirements increases the potential for systems or  components to fail and potentially disrupt FBI operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consistent with Leading Practices Thus Far, the FBI and GSA Have Identified Alternatives for Better Meeting the FBI\u2019s Facility Needs and Are Developing an Approach for Moving Forward", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FBI and GSA Planning Actions Have Been Generally Consistent with Applicable Leading Practices in Capital Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the FBI and GSA have conducted a number of  studies (see fig. 5) to assess the FBI headquarters facilities\u2019 strategic and  mission needs. Through these studies, they have determined the  condition of the FBI\u2019s current assets and identified gaps between current  and needed capabilities, as well as studied a range of alternatives to  meet the FBI\u2019s requirements. (See app. II for more detail on the studies  undertaken by the FBI and GSA.) These activities are consistent with  applicable GAO leading practices in capital decision making.", "Consistent with our first two leading practices in capital decision making\u2014 to conduct a comprehensive assessment of needs to meet an agency\u2019s  mission goals and objectives and to identify the current capabilities and  condition of existing assets (i.e., facilities) to meet those needs\u2014the FBI  and GSA conducted facility condition and security assessments of the  Hoover Building in 2001 and 2002 and identified recommendations in  both areas. For example, the poor condition of the Hoover Building was  identified as a gap in the FBI\u2019s need for a functional headquarters. In  addition, as noted, the FBI\u2019s 2005 Asset Management Plan identified  the need for a new headquarters facility to safeguard personnel and  information within efficient and cost-effective workspace, and the FBI has  worked with GSA to identify its strategic facility and space requirements.  Also in 2005, the FBI Director and a Deputy FBI Director\u2014with input from  assistant directors\u2014decided which FBI programs should be colocated in  a headquarters facility to meet the agency\u2019s strategic and mission  requirements. According to their analysis, the FBI Director; the National  Security Branch, including its counterterrorism and intelligence divisions;  the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch; and other FBI  headquarters functions, such as the Information Technologies Branch,  would need to be colocated. Throughout the decision-making process,  FBI senior officials have consulted with senior GSA regional and national  officials to discuss the FBI\u2019s requirements and the range of alternatives to  meet the FBI\u2019s needs. In 2007, GSA and the FBI found that the need to  colocate certain FBI programs\u2014to better enable collaboration and  facilitate information sharing\u2014could not be met in the Hoover Building  and the annexes and that the FBI\u2019s operations in the Hoover Building and  21 of its annexes in the National Capital Region should be consolidated.  This decision to consolidate is also consistent with a 2010 presidential  memorandum directing federal agencies to eliminate lease arrangements  that are not cost-effective, pursue consolidation opportunities, and identify  reductions when new space is acquired, as the FBI pointed out in its 2010  consolidation report.", "In the studies they conducted from 2005 through 2009, the FBI and GSA  identified security requirements for a consolidated FBI headquarters facility.  Our previously issued law enforcement sensitive report describes these  security requirements. The 2005 through 2009 planning studies also  identified space requirements for an FBI headquarters facility. For example,  a formal space programming study performed by the FBI\u2019s architectural  consultant established space requirements for approximately 11,600  personnel and for support headquarters spaces, such as conference rooms  and SCIF space. This personnel figure was based on current staffing levels  for the functions that the FBI had determined should be colocated in a  headquarters facility, adjusted to allow for limited future growth. To further  identify the FBI\u2019s headquarters space requirements, the architectural  consultant and staff from the FBI\u2019s Facilities and Logistics Services Division  met with representatives from the FBI\u2019s branches and their divisions to  assess their operational needs, such as access to SCIF space or proximity  to another organization or function. In addition, the FBI Facilities and  Logistics Services Division established space standards for staff after  reviewing GSA and industry benchmarks. According to the FBI, it requires  modern, open-plan office space for its operations and shared team spaces  to promote collaboration and information sharing across mission teams  and to permit easy reconfiguration to meet changing needs, such as space  for newly formed internal and interagency task forces. The FBI also  identified requirements for large SCIFs to fully support its divisions\u2019  classified discussion and processing needs.", "Consistent with our third leading practice in capital decision making\u2014 decide how best to meet a gap by identifying and evaluating alternative  approaches\u2014the FBI and GSA, in their 2005 through 2009 planning  studies, identified and analyzed a range of alternatives, together with their  estimated costs and benefits, for meeting the gap between the FBI\u2019s  current and needed space. These alternatives fall into three categories:   (1) modernizing the Hoover Building; (2) demolishing the building and  constructing a new facility on the existing site; and (3) acquiring a new  consolidated headquarters facility\u2014through federal construction or lease\u2014 on a new site. Figures 6 and 7 provide summary information about these  three alternatives and the status quo, which we include because the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to submit baseline  information when they propose a major capital acquisition.", "The cost estimates in figures 6 and 7 cannot be compared because the  studies and estimates were completed at different times, for different  purposes, by different consultants, using different methodologies and  facility specifications.", "As the FBI and GSA continue to advance through the capital planning  process, our leading practices in capital decision making can help guide  their efforts, as well as inform decision makers\u2019 evaluations of any  preferred alternative and other alternatives considered.

OMB\u2019s guidance requires GSA\u2014if GSA constructs or  leases a headquarters facility for the FBI\u2019s use\u2014to submit a capital asset  business case in support of the project. According to OMB\u2019s guidance,  the FBI and GSA need to partner to develop the business case\u2014 providing input on the estimated project costs and financing strategies\u2014 but the design and construction budget request would be part of GSA\u2019s  annual budget submission to OMB if the construction is to be funded  through the FBF.

This business  case should include the total estimated life-cycle costs\u2014for the preferred  alternative and the other alternatives the agencies considered\u2014 including the costs of acquisition, operations, maintenance, and  disposal. In addition, GSA\u2019s guide directs GSA to conduct a variety of  reviews, such as site feasibility studies and environmental analyses,  designed to ensure that projects are feasible and in compliance with all  federal construction requirements.", "As GSA develops a capital asset business case for OMB with input from  the FBI, it will have to rank the alternatives the agencies considered and  select a preferred alternative. This ranking, when weighed against other  relative priorities that the FBI and GSA will have to evaluate, would be  consistent with our fifth capital decision-making practice\u2014rank and select  projects based on established criteria. FBI officials have preliminarily  concluded that their security and space requirements can be met only  through the construction of a new headquarters facility on a new site.  GSA officials have thus far generally concluded that the FBI has long- term space needs and that FBI operations should be consolidated to  achieve greater security and efficiency, but have not finalized their  construction cost estimates. According to GSA officials, the FBI and GSA  will discuss the FBI\u2019s needs with OMB, and a final decision will be based  on the results of a more comprehensive analysis that GSA will complete  with FBI input for OMB. For the preferred alternative, GSA officials said  they will need to undertake a final due diligence process to revalidate the  FBI\u2019s program requirements, update costs, and initiate feasibility  studies\u2014such as an assessment of the likelihood that sites are available  in the National Capital Region\u2014so as to develop a detailed prospectus  for formal OMB approval and congressional consideration.", "Our leading practices state that prudent decision makers also should  consider various funding options available to them. In the case of real  property, that means considering other funding alternatives in comparison  to funding new construction or a modernization through the FBF. In  separate interviews, both GSA\u2019s Deputy Administrator and Director of the  Office of Real Property Asset Management indicated that GSA will  undertake a thorough analysis of a range of financing strategies as part  its due diligence. (See app. III for a description of some of the financing  strategies that GSA may consider.) According to GSA, it almost always  recommends federal construction using the FBF because this is usually  the lowest cost alternative. However, GSA reports that in the current  budgetary environment, it believes that alternative strategies such as the  ground lease and leaseback arrangement\u2014providing for eventual  ownership of the building by the government\u2014may need to be  considered.", "After GSA and the FBI identify a preferred alternative and financing  strategy, and if the alternative entails constructing a new federal facility  through the FBF, GSA will have to rank the need for any FBI  headquarters capital project against other FBI and governmentwide  facility needs. GSA ranks projects from all agencies that have identified  requirements\u2014first by GSA region and then nationally. The GSA  Administrator decides which major prospectus projects to propose within  GSA\u2019s budget based on recommendations and input from the  Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, among others. While GSA  has general criteria for prioritizing capital construction and major  modernization needs, it does not specifically include security among its  ranking criteria. Instead, according to a GSA official, the agency relies on  its customers to convey their mission-critical needs in a way that reflects  which issues, such as security, are critical to them. At this time, GSA  officials could not indicate how a new FBI headquarters facility\u2014or a  major modernization of the Hoover Building\u2014might be ranked in relation  to other competing federal asset needs. FBI staff we spoke with indicated  that a new headquarters project has the support of the FBI Director, but it  is unclear whether a new headquarters is the most important facility need  for the FBI or whether regional field office facility needs may be more  important.", "The FBI and GSA plan to continue working together to reach a decision  with OMB on how best to meet the FBI\u2019s needs. GSA reports that fiscal  year 2014 is likely the earliest that any budget request and prospectus  might be put forth for congressional consideration.

It is therefore important that the choice of an alternative be based  on up-to-date assessments of the FBI\u2019s security, space, and building  condition needs. In the interim, the FBI and GSA may have opportunities  to further enhance security and address condition deficiencies at the  FBI\u2019s current facilities.", "For the next several years or more, the FBI\u2019s headquarters workforce will  be dispersed between the Hoover Building and the headquarters  annexes. During this time, it is important that the FBI and FPS conduct  security assessments of the annexes, as required by the 2010 ISC  standards, and that the FBI track the implementation status of  recommended countermeasures for all its headquarters facilities. For the  FBI, documentation of decisions to implement recommendations\u2014 whether made in its 2011 security assessment of the Hoover Building or  in future assessments of its headquarters annexes against the 2010 ISC  standards\u2014could inform decisions on how best to meet the FBI\u2019s long- term headquarters facility needs.

The  deferred maintenance, repairs, and recapitalization projects that have  accumulated under this strategy could lead to system or component  failures and potentially disrupt FBI operations. Allowing the building to  deteriorate further could also make it difficult to house another agency in  the Hoover Building if the FBI moves to a different location.", "Ultimately, decisions about the future of the FBI\u2019s headquarters facilities  will require careful consideration of policy matters related to the FBI\u2019s  mission and security needs and competing budget priorities, as well as  other factors, such as the availability of a suitably sized site in the  National Capital Region where the FBI\u2019s headquarters operations could  be colocated.

The study concluded the building was in poor  condition. The contractor prepared three funding scenarios to provide  GSA with insight into how the condition of the building would be affected  based on various investment assumptions over 20 years. One scenario  included improving the building condition to an industry-acceptable level.  2.  Security assessment, 2002  In 2002, the FBI conducted a security assessment of the building, and  with the assistance of two consultants, identified recommendations to  further improve the building\u2019s security.   3.  Headquarters housing strategy, 2005  In 2005, a real estate services consultant contracted by GSA studied the  FBI\u2019s facility needs. According to the consultant, the FBI\u2019s mission was  impaired by a fragmented headquarters organization that caused staff to  be dispersed across the Hoover Building and 16 annexes at that time in  the National Capital Region. In addition, the consultant documented  space inefficiencies in the Hoover Building. To address these  deficiencies, the consultant developed a strategic housing plan and  facility requirements for FBI headquarters. These requirements included  \uf0b7  meeting ISC security standards,   \uf0b7  making maximum use of open-plan office space,  \uf0b7  providing enough secure space for handling classified information,  \uf0b7  planning building systems to support current and future information  \uf0b7  providing extensive emergency backup power as well as state-of-the- art air filtration systems.", "The consultant developed three consolidation alternatives for addressing  identified deficiencies and meeting the FBI\u2019s headquarters facility needs  based on projected 2011 staffing levels:  \uf0b7  one-site consolidation with both headquarters national security and  law enforcement located together;  two-site consolidation (option A) with national security functions at one  site and law enforcement functions at a second site; and  two-site consolidation (option B) with a more even distribution of FBI  headquarters elements (compared to option A) and no split between  national security and law enforcement functions.", "A preliminary financial analysis, which estimated the net present value of  savings for each alternative over 30 years, showed that each alternative  was more economically beneficial than the status quo. The savings were  largely due to the planned consolidation of 3.1 million rentable square feet  into 2.3 million rentable square feet.", "According to a draft timeline, it would take nearly 3 years for GSA to  complete its analysis, develop a project prospectus for congressional  authorization, and identify a site. Another 3 years was estimated for  design, construction, and move-in.", "Citing detailed cost estimates for a project of similar size for another  intelligence agency, the consultant predicted a total project cost of over  $1.5 billion.  4.  Site study, 2006  In 2006, another real estate services consultant hired by GSA studied a  range of scenarios for use of the Hoover Building and site. This study was  intended to inform GSA management decisions on optimizing the value of  the Hoover Building as a GSA real property asset and was not  necessarily performed to identify alternatives for meeting the FBI\u2019s  headquarters facility needs. The study did, however, consider the impact  on operations if the FBI remained as the building tenant. The consultant  identified five scenarios:  \uf0b7  maintain and operate the building \u201cas is,\u201d  vacate the building and sell the asset,  \uf0b7  modernize the building,  vacate and demolish the building and redevelop the site, and  \uf0b7  partially demolish the building to redevelop the front side facing  Pennsylvania Avenue and renovate the back portion that faces E  Street.", "Estimated costs to modernize the Hoover Building ranged from $850  million to $1.1 billion. Estimated costs to demolish the Hoover Building  and redevelop the site ranged from $853 million to $1.4 billion.", "The study concluded that no alternative was a definite best option for  GSA.", "The study reported that a modernization, in general, would not improve  the building\u2019s gross and rentable square footage. In addition, this  alternative would create a demand for swing space and could adversely  affect the FBI\u2019s operations if the FBI remained as the building\u2019s tenant  during the modernization. According to the study, the modernization  would be least costly if the FBI vacated the entire building to give the  construction contractor unrestricted access.", "According to the study, redeveloping the site with a new building or  buildings would not meet GSA\u2019s required rate of return on investment,  and constructing a new secure facility would sacrifice tremendous value  associated with a highly marketable location.  5.  Space study, 2007  In 2007, GSA hired an architectural design and planning consultant to  assess the condition of the Hoover Building and determine the extent to  which it supports the FBI\u2019s mission. The consultant assessed the Hoover  Building\u2019s design and use of space against industry standards and  compared the Hoover Building to facilities used by other intelligence  agencies.", "According to the report, the FBI\u2019s work process is dynamic, requiring  intelligence gathered by one team to be shared with multiple teams for  whom the intelligence may also be relevant. To respond to the FBI\u2019s work  process and mission, the consultant determined that the FBI\u2019s workplace  should promote collaboration and communication among staff and be  easily reconfigured. The study found that the Hoover Building does not  generally meet these criteria because of its structural characteristics and  inherent inefficiencies. For example, the study found that aspects of the  building\u2014including the location of structural elements and hard wall  partitions\u2014result in an inherently inefficient use of space. According to  the consultant, these characteristics limit the degree to which the FBI can  reconfigure space to optimize its operations and respond to mission  changes. The consultant concluded that the Hoover Building is a  significant barrier to the FBI\u2019s performance and operational effectiveness  and no longer effectively supports the FBI\u2019s mission.", "The consultant also indicated that the renovations necessary to make the  Hoover Building viable, feasible, and desirable may be unjustifiable given  the costs and disruption they would entail. The consultant concluded that  relocating the FBI to a new facility would likely lead to a significant  improvement in performance at a lower cost.  6.  Real estate appraisal, 2008  In 2008, GSA hired a real estate appraisal firm to develop a market-value  opinion of the Hoover Building and site to inform GSA\u2019s asset  management strategy. The appraisal firm considered three valuation  approaches: (1) a cost approach; (2) a sales comparison approach; and  (3) an income capitalization approach.", "The appraisal firm described the construction quality of the existing  building as average and the condition of the building as below average. It  also found the building inferior to other office buildings constructed during  the same period. In particular, the consultant reported the building  windows are very small compared to modern office building windows and  that larger windows are generally required to attract tenants to higher- priced leased space. The firm reported that GSA had estimated a cost of  over $200 million to modify the structure and replace its windows.", "GSA provided the appraisal firm with a list of planned recapitalization  projects totaling over $460 million, to be implemented over 10 years;  however, the appraiser reported that GSA\u2019s Property Manager had  indicated that, for lack of funds, none of the planned capital expenditures  would likely be made. Therefore, the appraiser did not consider the value  of any planned recapitalization projects in the estimated value. However,  the appraiser reported that even if the planned capital expenditures were  made, the Hoover Building would not be considered a Class A office  building.", "The appraiser reported that the site was zoned to permit retail, office,  housing, mixed, and public uses, and the appraiser concluded that no  reasonably probable use of the site would be likely to generate a higher  value than office use. Accordingly, the appraiser identified office use,  developed to the level permitted by the zoning, as the highest and best  use of the property.", "The appraiser reported that the site, if redeveloped, could accommodate  a building area of approximately 2.5 million gross square feet based on  the current zoning regulations. The appraiser also noted that the existing  Hoover Building is 2.4 million gross square feet and therefore a building  on the redevelopment site would likely be similar in size. The appraiser  noted that the existing building is set back farther from Pennsylvania  Avenue greater than is typical for a commercial office building downtown  but not far enough where demolishing the building to capture the space  would be cost-effective. Redevelopment would enable a developer to  construct a new Class A office building.  7.  Relocation study, 2009  In 2009, the FBI contracted with an architectural and planning firm to  develop a housing plan, space requirements program, and conceptual  site plans for consolidating its headquarters in a new facility onto a single  site. While the 2005 GSA study examined space requirements at a macro  level, it did not provide a detailed housing plan and space requirements  program. Thus, to more fully define its requirements, the FBI established  goals for the 2009 study. These goals were to  \uf0b7  develop a housing plan that identified the FBI branches and divisions  to be located on-site;  summarize staffing levels by branch and division, including both FBI  personnel and contractors;  summarize future staffing growth factors;  \uf0b7  develop space-planning standards and workspace types;  \uf0b7  develop a space requirements program for branches and divisions  based on those staffing and space standards;  \uf0b7  outline common shared support spaces and special space  requirements;  recommend an ideal floor plate size for a new building that would  maximize future flexibility;  identify circulation factors for the building;  calculate total gross and usable square footage of a new facility;  \uf0b7  develop conceptual site plans; and  identify design criteria, including Leadership in Energy and  Environmental Design, security, and building code requirements.", "The consultant collected data by walking through the FBI\u2019s headquarters  spaces, using a space requirements questionnaire, and interviewing FBI  personnel in the facilities, security, and information technology groups to  verify information from the questionnaire. Each FBI branch and division  reviewed the consultant\u2019s data.", "Using FBI personnel counts from 2008 with projections for future growth  through 2013 and 2018, the consultant derived overall square footage  tabulations. FBI\u2019s Resource Planning Office provided the personnel  counts and growth projections.", "Based on the space and security requirements for the main headquarters  building, the consultant developed planning estimates for the site acreage  required.", "The consultant developed two site concepts: (1) a suburban office  campus and (2) a more urban site located near the Washington beltway.  Preliminary cost estimates for a new headquarters were developed based  on the consultant\u2019s analyses of space and security requirements. FBI  costs for special security equipment, communications and information  systems, modular systems furniture, and moving were not included in the  construction-related costs but were separately estimated and are not  considered GSA project costs.", "Land costs were estimated on the basis of comparable land sales over  the past several years in a variety of locations inside and outside the  beltway. The suburban and beltway property costs were each averaged  to determine average expected prices. The land costs were added to the  GSA project cost summary and increased by 10 percent to reflect  potential increases in land value, which may occur before a property is  acquired.", "The study identified a need for a headquarters facility containing an  estimated 2.6 million gross square feet\u2014including 2.1 million useable  square feet\u2014to house nearly 11,600 personnel. Required site sizes were  estimated at between 55 and 65 acres based on zoning assumptions for  suburban and more urban locations.  8.  Consolidation report (Final Draft), 2010  In 2010, the FBI\u2019s Facilities and Logistic Services Division prepared an  executive-level report to summarize past FBI and GSA findings and  conclusions about the Hoover Building and both agencies\u2019 studies of the  need for a new headquarters facility. The report was intended to update  FBI leadership on the current headquarters planning, costs, and  recommendations prior to discussions with GSA and OMB. The report  outlines a range of acquisition strategies that GSA and the FBI could use  to acquire a new consolidated headquarters and identifies the FBI\u2019s  preferred strategy.", "According to the report, the FBI\u2019s mission-critical headquarters operations  are dispersed in 22 separate locations including the Hoover Building, up  from 17 when GSA first studied the issue in 2005. Citing space and  staffing requirements, the report identifies the need for a facility with 2.5  million gross square feet, 2.2 million rentable square feet, and 1.9 million  usable square feet to house an estimated 11,500 personnel. The report  further anticipates a reduction of approximately 873,400 rentable square  feet when the 22 current locations are consolidated, as well as an  estimated annual savings of at least $30 million in leased housing costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Financing Strategies Available for Capital Projects", "paragraphs": ["This appendix describes potential financing strategies that may be  considered in acquiring a new headquarters for the FBI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Construction Using the Federal Buildings Fund", "paragraphs": ["\uf0b7  Construction or modernization is funded through GSA\u2019s Federal  Buildings Fund (FBF).  \uf0b7  We have previously reported that although ownership through federal  construction is often the most cost-effective option, pursuant to  budget scoring rules, the full cost of construction of a capital project is  recorded up front in the budget.  \uf0b7  The FBF is the primary means of financing the operating and capital  costs associated with federal space owned or managed by GSA.  GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service charges federal agencies rent, the  receipts of which are deposited in the FBF.

The title to  the parcel never leaves government ownership, and at the expiration  of the lease, the title to the building passes to the United States.  \uf0b7  Section 412 provides GSA with new, additional authorities to dispose  of and use its real property inventory by sale, lease, exchange, and  leaseback arrangements. Section 412 does not specify any limit on  the term of the lease.  \uf0b7  According to GSA, it has attempted to use 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 585(c) only  once as a development authority, and it ultimately did not complete  the project using this authority. GSA has never used Section 412 as a  development authority.  \uf0b7  Section 412 also authorizes GSA to retain the net proceeds from its  real property disposals. Section 412 might enable GSA to use the  proceeds of a sale\u2014if the existing Hoover Building or site were sold\u2014 to pay for some of a new project\u2019s costs.  \uf0b7  How a leaseback is structured will determine how it is scored, and it  may be treated as a capital lease with the amount equal to the asset  cost recorded up front in the budget.  \uf0b7  Given the current budgetary environment, this type of arrangement  may be more feasible now than in the past. Furthermore, even though  GSA told us that it almost always recommends the traditional funding  strategy\u2014federal construction\u2014it has said that in the current  budgetary environment, it believes that alternative strategies such as  a ground lease and leaseback arrangement may need to be  considered.  \uf0b7  FBI officials believe that if a ground lease and leaseback arrangement  were to be pursued, the agency may be able to move into a new  consolidated facility 2 or 3 years earlier than it could with a direct  federal appropriation for design and construction, given the demands  on the FBF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lease Construction (i.e., Leasing)", "paragraphs": ["\uf0b7  The government acquires space through an operating lease.  \uf0b7  The government has no ownership of the land or the facility at any  time.  \uf0b7  We have previously reported that operating leases tend to be the  most expensive approach to meeting long-term federal space needs  and that over the last decade, GSA has relied heavily on operating  leases to meet new long-term needs because it lacks funds to pursue  ownership.
