To provide information for its potential extension or reauthorization, this testimony draws primarily on previous GAO work to focus on (1) the key features of the state MOE requirements and (2) how the role of state MOE spending has changed over time. To address these issues, GAO relied on its prior work on TANF block grant and state MOE spending issued between 2001 and 2010, including the May 2010 report examining how state MOE spending affects state TANF programs\u0092 work participation rates. To develop the spending-related findings in this body of work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, state TANF data reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and related financial data from selected states. GAO also interviewed relevant officials from HHS and selected states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant\u0092s maintenance of effort (MOE) provisions include specified state spending levels and general requirements on the use of funds. For example, these provisions generally require that each state spend at least 80 percent (75 percent if the state meets certain performance standards) of the amount it spent on welfare and related programs in fiscal year 1994, before TANF was created. If a state does not meet its MOE requirements in any fiscal year, the federal government will reduce dollar-for-dollar the state\u0092s federal TANF grant in the following year. In order to count state spending as MOE, funds must be spent on benefits and services to families with children that have incomes and resources below certain state-defined limits. Such benefits and services must generally further one of TANF\u0092s purposes, which broadly focus on providing financial assistance to needy families; promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; reducing out-of-wedlock births; and encouraging the formation of two-parent families. Within these broad goals, states have significant flexibility to design programs and spend their funds to meet families\u0092 needs.", "Total MOE spending reported by states remained relatively stable around the required minimum spending level of $11 billion through fiscal year 2005, and then increased to about $4 billion higher than this minimum in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Several reasons likely accounted for these increases, including states\u0092 reliance on MOE spending to help them meet TANF work participation rates. Work participation rates identify the proportion of families receiving monthly cash assistance that participate in allowable work activities for a specified number of hours each week. Federal law generally requires that at least 50 percent of families meet the work requirements; however, most states have engaged less than 50 percent of families in required activities in each year since TANF was created, according to HHS data. Various policy and funding options in federal law and regulations, including credit for state MOE expenditures that exceed required spending levels, have allowed most states to meet the rate requirements even with smaller percentages of families participating. States generally began relying on MOE spending to get credit toward meeting TANF work participation rates in fiscal year 2007 because of statutory changes to the rate requirements enacted in 2006. For example, for fiscal year 2009, the most recent data available, 16 of the 45 states that met the TANF work participation rate would not have done so without the credit they received for excess state MOE spending.", "The expanded role of MOE in state TANF programs highlights the importance of having reasonable assurance that MOE spending reflects the intended commitment to low-income families and efficient use of federal funds. GAO\u0092s previous work makes clear that MOE provisions are often difficult to administer and oversee, but can be important tools for helping ensure that federal spending achieves its intended effect. This work also points out that with appropriate attention to design, implementation, and monitoring issues, such provisions are one way to help strike a balance between the potentially conflicting objectives of increasing state and local flexibility while attaining certain national objectives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s discussion  of state spending related to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  (TANF) block grant, which is one of the key federal funding streams  targeted to assist low-income families. State spending represents about  40 percent of the $406 billion in total TANF and related state spending for  the past 15 years since TANF was created in 1996. As you know, the  federal government significantly changed federal welfare policy in 1996  when it created TANF, a $16.5 billion annual block grant provided to  states to operate their own welfare programs within federal guidelines.  While the block grant provides states with a fixed amount of federal  dollars annually, it also includes state maintenance-of-effort (MOE)  requirements, which require states to maintain a significant portion of their  historic financial commitment to welfare-related programs. At the same  time, TANF gives states the authority and flexibility to make key decisions  about how to design programs and allocate federal and state funds to  assist low-income families. Over the last 15 years, this funding  partnership has undergone multiple program and fiscal changes,  including a dramatic drop in the number of families receiving monthly  cash assistance benefits, as well as two economic recessions.", "My remarks today are based primarily on our past work on state MOE  spending, including our May 2010 report examining how state MOE  spending affects state TANF programs\u2019 work participation rates. I will  focus on (1) the key features of the state MOE requirements and (2) how  the role of state MOE spending has changed over time. To develop our  MOE-related findings for our May 2010 report on work participation, we  conducted our work from August 2009 to May 2010. In addition, in July  2011, we obtained more recent data on MOE and work participation from  the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and we  reported on those data in our September 2011 testimony before this  subcommittee. For today\u2019s statement we also drew on our prior reports  on TANF block grant spending issued between 2001 and 2006 as well as  earlier reports on grant design and accountability generally. To develop  findings for all of these reports, we used a variety of approaches,  including interviewing officials from the HHS and selected states and  reviewing state TANF data reported to HHS; related financial data from  selected states; relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and  literature reviews. For more details on our methodologies, see the related  reports cited throughout. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this testimony. We conducted our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards required that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

TANF  has four broad goals: (1) provide assistance to needy families so that  children may be cared for in their own homes or homes of relatives; (2)  end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting  job preparation, work, and marriage; (3) prevent and reduce out-of- wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encourage two-parent families. Within  these goals, states have responsibility for designing, implementing, and  administering their welfare programs to comply with federal guidelines, as  defined by federal law and HHS.", "In creating TANF, the federal government significantly changed its role in  financing welfare programs in states. PRWORA ended low-income  families\u2019 entitlement to cash assistance by replacing the Aid to Families  with Dependent Children (AFDC) program\u2014 for which the federal grant  amount was based on the amount of state spending\u2014with the TANF  block grant, a $16.5 billion per year fixed federal funding stream to states.  PRWORA coupled the block grant with an MOE provision, which requires  states to maintain a significant portion of their own historic financial  commitment to their welfare programs as a condition of receiving their full  federal TANF allotments. Importantly, with the fixed federal funding  stream, states assume greater fiscal risks in the event of a recession or  increased program costs. However, in acknowledgment of these risks,  PRWORA also created a TANF Contingency Fund that states could  access in times of economic distress. Similarly, during the recent  economic recession, the federal government created a $5 billion  Emergency Contingency Fund for state TANF programs through the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, available in fiscal  years 2009 and 2010.", "The most recent data available, for fiscal year 2010, show that the federal  government and states spent almost $36 billion  on benefits and services  meeting one or more of the TANF goals. In that year, states provided, on  average, about 1.9 million families per month with ongoing cash  assistance, including about 800,000 families in which the children alone  received benefits. This represents a significant drop from the more than  3 million families receiving cash assistance when states implemented  TANF in fiscal year 1997. In addition, states provide a broad range of  services to other families in need not included in the welfare caseload  data. The total number of families assisted is not known, as we have  noted in our previous work. These allowable services under TANF can  generally include any spending reasonably deemed to meet one or more  of the four broad goals of TANF, and can include one-time cash  payments, work and training activities, work supports such as child care  and transportation, efforts to promote two-parent families or marriage,  and child welfare services, among others. When TANF began, cash  assistance represented the largest spending category (73 percent in fiscal  year 1997). In contrast, cash assistance spending in fiscal year 2010  accounted for 30 percent of total TANF spending.", "Reducing dependence on government benefits through job preparation  and employment is a key goal of TANF, and PRWORA identified the work  participation rate as one of the federal measures of state TANF programs\u2019  performance. This rate is generally calculated as the proportion of work- eligible TANF cash assistance recipients engaged in allowable work  activities. for ensuring that generally at least 50 percent of all families receiving  TANF cash assistance benefits participate in one or more of the allowable  work activities for a specified number of hours each week.

Generally, states are held  accountable for ensuring that at least 50 percent of all families receiving  TANF cash assistance and considered work-eligible participate in one or  more of the federally defined work activities for a specified number of  hours each week. However, most states have not engaged that many  recipients in work activities on an annual basis. For example, in fiscal  year 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, less than 50  percent of TANF cash assistance families participated in work activities  for the specified number of hours each week in 44 states, according to  HHS. However, various policy and funding options in federal law and  regulations allowed most of these states to meet their work participation  rates. Factors that influenced states\u2019 abilities to meet the work  participation rates included not only the number of families receiving  TANF cash assistance who participated in work activities, but also  decreases in the number of families receiving TANF cash assistance, and  state MOE spending beyond what is required, for example.", "Since TANF was created, the factor that states have commonly relied on  to help them meet their required work participation rates is the caseload  reduction credit. Specifically, decreases in the numbers of families  receiving TANF cash assistance over a specified period are accounted for  in each state\u2019s caseload reduction credit, which essentially lowers the  states\u2019 required work participation rate from 50 percent. For example, if  a state\u2019s caseload decreases by 20 percent during the relevant time  period, the state receives a caseload reduction credit equal to 20  percentage points, which results in the state work participation rate  requirement being adjusted from 50 to 30 percent. In each year since  TANF was created, many states have used caseload declines to help  them lower the required work participation rates. For example, in fiscal  year 2009, 38 of the 45 states that met their required work participation  rates for all TANF families did so in part because of their caseload  decreases (see fig. 3).", "However, in recent years, the Congress updated the base year for  assessing the caseload reduction credit, and as a result, some states also began to rely on state MOE expenditures to increase their caseload  reduction credit, which lowers their required work participation rates.  Under federal regulations, if states spend in excess of their required MOE  amount, they are allowed to correspondingly increase their caseload  reduction credits. By doing so, a state reduces its required work  participation rate. In fiscal year 2009, 32 of the 45 states that met their  required work participation rates for all TANF families claimed excess  state MOE spending toward their caseload reduction credits. Sixteen of  these states would not have met their rates without claiming these  expenditures (see fig. 3). Among the states that needed to rely on excess  state MOE spending to meet their work participation rates, most relied on  these expenditures to add between 1 and 20 percentage points to their  caseload reduction credits (see fig. 4).", "MOE is now playing an expanded role in TANF programs, as many  states\u2019 excess MOE spending has helped them meet work participation  rates. While one state had used MOE expenditures toward its caseload  reduction credit before fiscal year 2007, over half of the states (27) relied  on these expenditures to increase their credits and help them meet their  required work participation rates in one or more years between fiscal  years 2007 and 2009.", "States may be making programmatic and budgetary decisions to use  excess MOE to help them avoid penalties for failure to meet participation  rates and possibly losing funds. In our previous work, states have cited  concerns about difficulties in engaging a sufficient number of cash  recipients in required activities for the required number of hours for  several reasons, including limits on the types of activities that count,  limited resources for developing and providing appropriate work activities,  a lack of jobs particularly during tough economic times, and the  characteristics of some cash assistance recipients that make it difficult for  them to engage in countable work activities.", "However, this greater emphasis on the use of MOE increases the  importance of understanding whether effective accountability measures  are in place to ensure MOE funds are in keeping with requirements. In  our 2001 report, some states expressed concerns that this MOE provision  could become difficult to enforce. In doing that work, we spoke to many  auditors who were in the midst of developing audit plans to address  compliance with the new spending test. Several told us that developing  these plans was relatively straightforward: the auditor should simply be  able to establish a baseline for all the MOE expenditures the state was  using and then trace those programs back to 1995 and certify that  spending used for MOE was indeed new spending. However, we also  noted that these plans could become more complex if states frequently  changed the expenditures they were counting from one year to the next  (i.e., changed the programs for which they needed baselines). In one  state at that time, we were told that all expenditure data were archived  after 5 years, and that auditing the annual certification would be  especially difficult and time consuming if the state changes the programs  it uses to meet its MOE requirement from year to year. We expect that  several factors, such as changes in what MOE expenditures states may  count, growth in some particular spending areas, as well as the growth in  MOE spending overall may have greatly increased the complexities  involved in tracking MOE.", "HHS provided information related to  In its final rule published in 1999,its plans for monitoring state MOE and noted that states recognize that  they are ultimately accountable for their expenditure claims. HHS stated  that states are audited annually or biennially and compliance with the  basic MOE provisions is part of the audit. HHS added that it would use  the results of the audits, together with its own analysis of state-provided  data\u2014required state quarterly expenditure reports and annual descriptive  reports on MOE activities\u2014to assess states\u2019 compliance. It also said it  might undertake additional state reviews based on complaints that arise  or requests from the Congress.", "We have not reviewed existing efforts to monitor MOE and cannot  comment on their effectiveness. However, the extent to which states have  relied on these expenditures to help them meet work participation rates  as well as meeting MOE generally highlights the importance of having  reasonable assurances that current oversight is working.
