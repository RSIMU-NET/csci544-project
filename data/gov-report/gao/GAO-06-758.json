SES are provided outside of the regular school day by a state-approved provider, with responsibility for implementation shared by states and districts. GAO examined (1) how SES participation changed between school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005; (2) how SES providers are working with districts to deliver SES; (3) how states are monitoring and evaluating SES; and (4) how the Department of Education (Education) monitors and supports state implementation of SES. To collect data on SES, GAO surveyed all states and a nationally representative sample of districts with schools required to offer SES. We also visited 4 school districts, interviewed 22 SES providers, reviewed SES-related research, and interviewed Education staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SES participation among eligible students increased from 12 to 19 percent between school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, and the number of recipients also increased, due in part to a rise in the number of schools required to offer services. Districts have used some promising practices to inform parents and encourage participation, such as offering services on school campuses and at various times. However, challenges remain, including timely and effective notification of parents and attracting providers to serve certain areas and students, such as rural districts or students with disabilities. To promote improved student academic achievement, SES providers took steps to align their curriculum with district instruction and communicate with teachers and parents, though the extent of their efforts varied. A majority of the 22 providers we interviewed worked to align SES and district curriculum by hiring teachers familiar with the district curriculum as tutors. However, at least some providers did not have any contact with teachers in about 40 percent of districts. Both providers and district officials experienced challenges related to contracting and coordination of service delivery. Providers, districts, and schools reported that greater involvement of schools would improve SES delivery and coordination, as it has in some places where this is occurring. While state monitoring of district and provider efforts to implement SES has been limited in past years, more states reported conducting on-site reviews and other monitoring activities during 2005-2006. In addition, districts have taken a direct role in monitoring providers, and their monitoring efforts have similarly increased. Although states are required to withdraw approval from providers that fail to increase student academic achievement for 2 years, many states struggle to develop meaningful SES evaluations. While a few states have completed evaluations, none provides a conclusive assessment of SES providers' effect on student academic achievement. Several Education offices monitor SES activity across the country and provide SES support to states and districts through written guidance, grants, and technical assistance. However, states and districts reported needing additional SES evaluation support and technical assistance. For example, 85 percent of states reported needing assistance with methods for evaluating SES. Many also voiced interest in Education's pilot programs that increase SES flexibility, including the one that allowed certain districts identified as in need of improvement to act as providers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) supports the academic  Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) supports the academic  achievement of 16.5 million low-income students nationwide by providing  achievement of 16.5 million low-income students nationwide by providing  them with additional opportunities, such as supplemental educational  them with additional opportunities, such as supplemental educational  services (SES), if their schools are low performing.

Further, research suggests that many face challenges to  increasing student participation, working with providers to ensure  students receive quality services, and monitoring and evaluating these  services. In response to congressional interest in these and other issues  related to early implementation of SES, and in anticipation of  reauthorization of the ESEA, we agreed to answer the following questions:  (1) How has SES participation changed between school years 2003-2004  and 2004-2005, and what actions have been taken to increase  participation? (2) How are providers working with districts and schools to  provide services that increase student achievement? (3) To what extent  are states monitoring and evaluating SES implementation? (4) How does  Education monitor state SES implementation and assist state and district  efforts?", "To answer our four research questions, we collected data through several  methods. First, to gather state-level information on SES, we collected  information through a Web-based survey of state SES coordinators in all  50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Further, to gather  district-level information on SES, we conducted a mail survey of district  SES coordinators from a nationally representative sample of districts with  schools required to offer SES. To ensure that we obtained information  from the largest districts with schools required to offer SES, we included  all 21 districts with 100,000 or more enrolled students in our sample. In  designing our surveys, we reviewed survey questions used by Education.  The district and state surveys were both administered between January  and March 2006. Seventy-seven percent of district SES coordinators,  including all coordinators from districts with 100,000 or more enrolled  students, and all state SES coordinators responded to the surveys. All  percentage estimates presented from the district survey have margins of  error of plus or minus 8 percentage points, unless otherwise noted. While  we did not validate specific information that states and districts reported  through our surveys, we reviewed the information to determine that their  responses were complete and reasonable and found the information to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To gather federal-level  information on SES implementation, we interviewed Education officials  and analyzed Education\u2019s data on SES available from state reports and  ongoing studies.", "To collect additional information from states and districts, as well as  information from schools and providers, we conducted site visits to four  school districts that had experience with SES implementation (Woodburn,  Ore.; Newark, N.J.; Chicago, Ill.; and Hamilton County, Tenn.). During the  visits, we spoke with state and district officials, as well as officials from a  total of 12 schools and 15 providers. When viewed as a group, the site visit  districts provided variation across characteristics such as geographic  location, district size, student ethnicity, and the percentage of students  with limited English proficiency or disabilities. In addition to the   15 providers we spoke with during the site visits, we also interviewed   7 for-profit SES providers operating in multiple states, for a total of   22 providers. In our surveys and other data collection efforts, we asked  questions about SES implementation during specific school years, and,  therefore, all years cited refer to school years.", "See appendix I for detailed information on both of our surveys as well as  our other data collection methods.

Title I is the largest federal program  supporting education in kindergarten through 12th grade, supplying   $12.7 billion in federal funds in fiscal year 2006. According to Education,  during the 2005-06 school year, nearly all U.S. school districts and  approximately half of public schools received some Title I funding. In  addition, the latest national data available from Education counted   16.5 million students as Title I participants in the 2002-2003 school year.", "Title I funds are distributed by formula to state education agencies, which  retain a share for administration and school improvement activities before  passing most of the funds on to school districts. Districts are required to  distribute Title I funds first to schools with poverty rates over 75 percent,  with any remaining funds distributed at their discretion to schools in rank  order of poverty either districtwide or within grade spans. A school\u2019s Title  I status can change from year to year because school enrollment numbers  and demographics may vary over time.", "Enactment of NCLBA strengthened accountability by requiring states and  schools to improve the academic performance of their students so that all  students are proficient in reading and math by 2014. Under NCLBA, each  state creates its own content standards, academic achievement tests, and  proficiency levels. In 2005-2006, states were required to test all children for  reading and mathematics achievement annually in grades 3-8 and once in  high school to determine whether schools are making adequate yearly  progress (AYP).", "In addition to meeting the state\u2019s performance goals by grade, subject, and  overall student population, schools are responsible for meeting those  goals for designated groups. These groups are students who (1) are  economically disadvantaged, (2) are part of a racial or ethnic group that  represents a significant proportion of a school\u2019s student population,   (3) have disabilities, or (4) have limited English proficiency. To make AYP,  each school must also show that each of these groups met the state  proficiency goals for both reading and math. In addition, schools must  show that at least 95 percent of students in grades required to take the test  have done so. Schools must also demonstrate that they have met state  targets for at least one other academic indicator, including graduation rate  in high schools and a state-selected measure in elementary or middle  schools.", "For Title I schools that do not meet state AYP goals, NCLBA requires the  implementation of specific interventions, and these interventions must  continue until the school has met AYP for 2 consecutive years. Table 1  outlines the interventions applied after each year a Title I school misses  state performance goals. At their discretion, states may also implement  interventions for public schools that do not receive Title I funds and do  not make AYP. Although districts are not required to offer SES until a Title  I school has missed performance goals for 3 years, because some schools  had not met state goals set under ESEA before the enactment of NCLBA,  some Title I schools were first required to offer SES in 2002-2003, the first  year of NCLBA implementation.", "States are also required to establish and implement AYP standards for  school districts based on the performance of all of the schools in the  district. If districts fail to meet these standards for 2 consecutive years,  states may classify districts as needing improvement. A district identified  for improvement must develop and implement an improvement plan and  remain in this status until it meets AYP standards for 2 consecutive years.  If a district remains in improvement status for 2 or more years, it may be  identified for corrective action as deemed necessary by the state.", "Students are eligible for SES if they attend Title I schools that have missed  AYP for 3 consecutive years and are from low-income families. School  districts must determine family income on the same basis they use to  make allocations to schools under Title I, for which many have historically  used National School Lunch Program (NSLP) data. The NSLP is a federally  funded program that annually collects family income data from students\u2019  parents to determine student eligibility for free and reduced-priced lunch.  A student\u2019s state assessment scores, grades, and other academic  achievement information are generally not considered when determining  SES eligibility. However, if sufficient funds are not available to provide  SES to all eligible children, school districts must give priority to the  lowest-achieving eligible students.", "SES providers may include nonprofit entities, for-profit entities, school  districts, public schools, public charter schools, private schools, public or  private institutions of higher education, educational service agencies, and  faith-based organizations. Under the Title I regulations that govern SES, a  district identified as in need of improvement or corrective action may not  be an SES provider, though its schools that are not identified as needing  improvement may. In addition, individual teachers who work in a school  or district identified as in need of improvement may be hired by any state- approved provider to serve as a tutor in its program.", "A district must set aside an amount equal to 20 percent of its Title I  allocation to fund both SES and transportation for students who elect to  attend other schools under school choice. This set-aside cannot be spent  on administrative costs for these activities, and the district may reallocate  any unused set-aside funds to other Title I activities after ensuring all  eligible students have had adequate time to opt to transfer to another  school or apply for SES. Funding available for SES is, therefore, somewhat  dependent on costs for choice-related transportation, though as we found  in our 2004 report on NCLBA\u2019s school choice provisions, few students are  participating in the school choice option. If a district does not incur any  choice-related transportation costs, it must use the full 20 percent set- aside amount to pay for SES if sufficient demand for services exists. In  addition, if the Title I set-aside is not sufficient to fund SES for interested  students, both states and districts may direct other funds for these  services at their discretion. For each student receiving SES, a district must  spend an amount equal to its Title I per-pupil allocation or the actual cost  of provider services, whichever is less.", "Education oversees SES implementation by monitoring states and  providing technical assistance and support. OII leads SES policy  development and coordinates the publication of SES guidance, and OESE  oversees and monitors Title I, including SES. NCLBA and the Title I  regulations and SES guidance outline the roles and responsibilities states,  school districts, parents, and service providers have in ensuring that  eligible students receive additional academic assistance through SES   (see table 2).", "During the 2005-2006 school year, Education announced the  implementation of two pilot programs intended to increase the number of  eligible students receiving SES and generate additional information about  the effectiveness of SES on students\u2019 academic achievement. In the first,  Education permitted four districts in Virginia to offer SES instead of  school choice in schools that are in their first year of needs improvement.", "In the second, Education entered into flexibility agreements with the  Boston and Chicago school districts, enabling them to act as SES  providers while in improvement status.

This increase may be due in part to the increase in the number of schools  required to offer SES over that time period. Specifically, between 2004- 2005 and 2005-2006 the number of schools required to offer SES increased  from an estimated 4,509 to 6,584.", "Although nationally SES participation is increasing, some districts  required to offer SES have no students receiving services. Specifically, we  estimate that no students received services in about 20 percent of the  approximately 1,000 districts required to offer SES in 2004-2005. A  majority of these districts were rural or had a total enrollment of fewer  than 2,500 students. Our survey did not provide sufficient information to  explain why these districts had no students receiving services in 2004- 2005; therefore, it is unclear whether their lack of participation was related  to district SES implementation or other issues.", "Nationwide, we estimate that districts required to offer SES spent   the equivalent of 5 percent of their total Title I funds for SES in 2004-2005  excluding administrative expenditures. Districts set aside an amount equal  to 20 percent of their Title I funds for SES and choice-related  transportation at the beginning of the school year, and the proportion of  the set-aside spent on SES varied by district. Specifically, in 2004-2005,  about 40 percent of districts spent 20 percent or less of the set-aside to  provide SES and almost one-fifth of districts spent over 80 percent.  Nationwide, of the total amount districts set-aside for SES, we estimate  they spent 42 percent on SES, excluding administrative expenditures.", "Further, an estimated 16 percent of districts reported that the required  Title I set-aside was not sufficient to fund SES for all eligible students  whose parents requested services. For example, during our site visit to  Newark, N.J., district officials reported budgeting the entire 20 percent  Title I set-aside to fund SES in 2004-2005, but with this amount of funding,  the district was only able to fund SES for 17 percent of the students  eligible for services. In addition, according to Chicago, Ill., district  officials, the district budgeted the entire 20 percent Title I set-aside to fund  SES in 2005-2006, and because parents\u2019 demand for services significantly  exceeded the amount of funding available, the district also allocated   $5 million in local funds to provide SES.", "While approximately 1,000 of the over 14,000 districts nationwide were  required to offer SES in 2004-2005, SES recipients are concentrated in a  small group of large districts, as 56 percent of recipients attended school  in the 21 districts required to offer SES with more than 100,000 total  enrolled students (see fig. 2). Further, states ranged from having 0 districts  to 257 districts required to offer SES in 2004-2005, with most states having  fewer than 10 districts required to offer SES. State differences in the  number of districts required to offer SES may have resulted from  differences in performance or differences in state proficiency standards  and methods used to measure adequate yearly progress.", "Students receiving SES in 2004-2005 shared certain characteristics, as  districts reported that most students receiving services were among the  lower achieving students in school. Specifically, an estimated 91 percent  of the districts that reviewed the academic records of students receiving  SES classified most or all of the students receiving SES as academically  low achieving. For example, Hamilton County, Tenn., school officials said  that students receiving SES are frequently behind grade level in their skills  and require special attention to increase their academic achievement.", "Further, we estimate that over half of SES recipients were elementary  school students in the majority of districts and about 60 percent of schools  required to offer SES in 2004-2005 were elementary schools. Districts  varied in the percentage of students with limited English proficiency  receiving services. In about one-third of districts, less than 5 percent of  SES recipients were students with limited English proficiency; however, in  about one-fifth of districts, over half of SES recipients were students with  limited English proficiency. Students with disabilities made up less than   20 percent of students receiving services in about two-thirds of districts.  Finally, in some districts, the majority of SES recipients were African- American or Hispanic. In about 40 percent of districts, over half of SES  recipients were African-American, and in about 30 percent of districts,  over half of SES recipients were Hispanic.

In line with the federal statutory requirement that districts  notify parents in an understandable format of the availability of SES, over  90 percent of districts provided written information in English, held  individual meetings with parents, and encouraged school staff to talk with  parents about SES. Some districts collaborated with providers to notify  parents. For example, during our site visit, Illinois state officials described  a provider and district sharing administrative resources to increase  participation, which involved the provider printing promotional materials  and the district addressing and mailing the materials to parents. In  addition, we estimate that over 70 percent of districts lengthened the  period of time for parents to turn in SES applications, held informational  events for parents to learn about providers, and provided written  information to parents in languages other than English. During our site  visit to Woodburn, Ore., district officials reported extending the time  parents had to sign up their children for SES and hosting an event where  providers presented their programs to parents in English and Spanish.  Further, Newark, N.J., district officials told us during our site visit that the  district provided transportation for parents to attend informational events  to increase participation. Also to encourage participation, an estimated   90 percent of districts offered services at locations easily accessible to  students, such as on or near the school campus, and almost 80 percent of  districts offered services at a variety of times, such as before and after  school or on weekends. For example, Hamilton County, Tenn., worked  with providers to offer an early morning tutoring program located at the  school site in addition to providing services after school. Providers also  reported delivering SES on school campuses and at various times.  Specifically, over three-fourths of the 22 providers we interviewed  reported delivering services at the school site, although providers also  offered services off-site, such as in the home, online, or at the provider\u2019s  facility. In addition, providers generally delivered SES after school and  some also offered SES at alternative times, such as before school, on  weekends, or during the summer. Finally, about one-third of districts  provided or arranged for transportation for participating students or  worked with a local community partner to raise awareness of the services.  For example, in Newark, N.J., the district worked with a local community  organization to inform parents and students living in public housing and  homeless shelters about SES.", "States also reported taking actions to increase participation in 2005-2006,  as shown in table 4.

An estimated 58 percent of districts did not notify parents that  their children may be eligible to receive SES before the beginning of the  2005-2006 school year, which may be due in part to delays in states  reporting which schools were identified for improvement. Specifically,  about half of districts that did not notify parents before the beginning of  the 2005-2006 school year did not receive notification from the state of the  schools identified for improvement by that time. Moreover, district  officials in three of the states we visited experienced delays in receiving  school improvement information, and state officials agreed that providing  timely information about whether schools have met state performance  goals has been a challenge. Almost all of the districts that did not notify  parents before the beginning of the 2005-2006 school year did so within the  first 2 months of the year.", "Effectively notifying parents is also a challenge for some districts. For  example, officials in all four districts we visited reported difficulties  contacting parents to inform them about SES in part because some  families frequently move and do not always update their mailing address  with districts. In addition, some providers we interviewed indicated that  confusing parental notification letters do not effectively encourage SES  participation. For example, some of the providers we interviewed said  some districts use confusing and poorly written letters to inform parents  of SES or send letters to parents of eligible children but conduct no further  outreach to encourage participation in SES. Four of the providers we  interviewed also indicated that complicated district enrollment processes  can discourage participation. For example, one provider said certain  districts send parents multiple documents to complete in order for their  child to receive SES, such as an enrollment form to select an SES provider  and a separate contract and learning plan.", "Another challenge to increasing SES participation is attracting more SES  providers for certain areas. Some rural districts surveyed indicated that no  students received services last year because of a lack of providers in the  area. We estimate that the availability of transportation for students  attending supplemental services was a moderate, great or very great  challenge for about half of rural districts. For example, one rural district  commented in our survey that there are no approved providers within   200 miles of its schools. A few other rural districts commented in our  survey that it was difficult to attract providers to their area because there  were few students to serve or providers had trouble finding staff to serve  as tutors.", "In addition, ensuring there are providers to serve students with limited  English proficiency or disabilities has been a challenge for some districts.  There were not enough providers to meet the needs of students with  limited English proficiency in an estimated one-third of districts, and not  enough providers to meet the needs of students with disabilities in an  estimated one-quarter of districts. Many states also indicated that the  number of providers available to serve these groups of students was  inadequate. While over half of the providers we interviewed reported  serving students with limited English proficiency or disabilities, some  providers served these students on a limited basis and reported difficulties  meeting their needs. For example, one provider reported serving few  students with limited English proficiency and disabilities because the  amount of funding the provider receives for SES was not sufficient to pay  for specialized tutors to serve these students. Another provider said it was  difficult to find tutors to meet the needs of students with limited English  proficiency and its program was not designed for students with  disabilities. Another provider said that it was difficult to serve students  with disabilities because it required significantly modifying the tutoring  lessons to meet their needs.", "Encouraging student attendance has also been a challenge, in part because  students may participate in other afterschool activities, such as sports or  work. Low parent and student demand for SES has been a challenge in  about two-thirds of districts. For example, about one-quarter of districts  reported that both competition from other afterschool programs and the  availability of services that are engaging to students were challenges to  implementing SES. In addition, providers, district and school officials in all  four districts we visited told us that SES is competing for students with  extracurricular and other activities. For example, a Chicago, Ill., high  school official indicated that student attendance at SES sessions declined  significantly as the school year progressed. To address this problem,  providers sometimes offer students incentives for participation. For  example, while 2 of the 22 providers we interviewed offered incentives for  students to sign up for services, 19 providers used incentives to encourage  student attendance, such as school supplies and gift certificates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Providers Have Taken Steps to Deliver Quality Services, but Contracting and Coordination Remain Challenges to Working with Districts and Schools", "paragraphs": ["To promote improved student academic achievement, providers aligned  their curriculum with district instruction primarily by hiring district  teachers and communicating with the teachers of participating students.

In addition, both providers and  districts experienced contracting and coordination difficulties. In part  because SES is often delivered in school facilities, providers and officials  in the districts and schools we visited reported that involvement of school  administrators and teachers can improve SES delivery and coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providers Worked to Align Curriculum and Communicate with Parents, though the Extent of Their Efforts Varied", "paragraphs": ["In order to increase student academic achievement, providers took steps  to align their curriculum with school instruction by hiring and  communicating with teachers, though the extent of their efforts varied. A  majority of the 22 providers we interviewed hired certified teachers in the  district as tutors. Some providers said hiring district teachers promoted  curriculum alignment, in part because district teachers were apt to draw  on district curriculum during tutoring sessions. School officials in three of  our site visits also said providers\u2019 use of district teachers as tutors helped  to align the tutoring program with what the student learned in the  classroom. In addition, some providers reported aligning curriculum by  communicating with the teachers of participating students to identify  student needs and discuss progress. The frequency of contact between  tutors and teachers ranged from mailing teachers information once prior  to the beginning of the program to contacting teachers at least weekly,  according to the providers we interviewed. A few providers also used  other methods to align their curriculum with district instruction, such as  using the same tests to evaluate student progress and allowing principals  to choose components of the tutoring curriculum for students receiving  SES in their schools. However, not all providers worked with schools to  align curriculum, as we estimate that some, most, or all providers did not  contact teachers to align curriculum with school instruction in almost 40  percent of districts in 2004-2005. For example, Woodburn, Ore., district  and school officials indicated during our site visit that instead of aligning  their services with the district curriculum, certain providers openly  questioned the district\u2019s curriculum and teaching methods, which caused  confusion among some parents and students.", "Providers reported mailing information as well as meeting with parents  over the phone and in-person to communicate about student needs and  progress; however, the frequency of communication with parents varied  by provider. A majority of the providers we interviewed communicated  with parents about student progress repeatedly, sometimes by sending  home progress reports on a monthly basis or holding parent-tutor  conferences. The frequency of contact between tutors and parents  reported by the 22 providers we interviewed ranged from meeting with  parents twice during the tutoring program to giving parents a weekly  progress report. A few providers also reported communicating with  parents by holding workshops for parents to learn about the SES program  and in some cases having the parents sign their students\u2019 learning plans.  For example, one provider conducted workshops where parents received  reading materials to share with their children and a parent guide in English  and Spanish that explained the program and how to use the materials to  enhance student learning. Some providers also reported hiring staff  dedicated in part to maintaining communication with parents. However,  some providers faced difficulties when communicating with parents about  SES, such as language barriers or incorrect contact information. Districts  confirmed that the degree to which providers communicated with parents  varied, as we estimate that some, most, or all providers did not contact  parents to discuss student needs and progress in about 30 percent of  districts in 2004-2005.", "Despite these challenges, most districts had positive relationships with  providers. Specifically, an estimated 90 percent of districts indicated that  their working relationships with providers during 2004-2005 were good,  very good, or excellent. In addition, many of the providers we interviewed  during our site visits also reported having positive working relationships  with district officials. Although other studies have found that districts  reported certain difficulties working with providers, relatively few districts  reported that their providers signed up ineligible students or billed for  services not performed in 2004-2005, as shown in figure 3.", "Generally, states did not hear about these provider issues very often.  Almost half of states said the issue of providers not showing up for SES  sessions was rarely brought to their attention. Similarly, half of states  said the issue of providers billing the district for services not performed  was rarely brought to their attention. In addition, about 40 percent of  states said the issue of providers using excessive incentives was rarely  brought to their attention. Further, about 40 percent of states said the  issue of providers signing up ineligible students rarely arose. Almost      one-third of states heard about each of these issues sometimes, while few  states had these issues brought to their attention very often. For example,  during our site visits, state officials provided examples of issues that had  been brought to their attention regarding provider practices, but these  issues were often isolated incidents particular to one or a few providers in  certain districts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providers and Districts Experienced Contracting and Coordination Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["While providers have taken steps to deliver quality services, both  providers and districts reported experiencing difficulties during the  contracting process. For example, some of the providers we interviewed  said certain districts imposed burdensome contract requirements, such as  requiring substantial documentation to be submitted with invoices,  limiting the marketing they could do to parents and students, or restricting  the use of school facilities to deliver services. Specifically, 7 of the   22 providers we interviewed experienced difficulties with districts  restricting provider access to school facilities, by for example, not  allowing providers to deliver services in school buildings or by charging  providers substantial fees to do so. A few providers also said contracting  with districts was a resource-intensive process, in part because contract  requirements vary by district and state. Some of the multi-state providers  we interviewed reported dedicating a team of staff to help them finalize  and manage contracts with districts. These providers commented that,  while they have the administrative capacity to manage this process,  smaller providers may not have such capacity. In addition, one provider  that delivered services exclusively online commented that contracting  with districts across the country was a challenge, particularly because  some states and districts require provider representatives to attend  meetings in-person and be fingerprinted in their states.", "Contracting with providers was also a challenge for some districts.  Specifically, negotiating contracts with providers was a moderate, great, or  very great challenge in about 40 percent of districts nationwide. For  example, Woodburn, Ore., district officials described having contractual  discussions with providers around whether the district would charge fees  for the use of school facilities, the types of incentives providers could use  to encourage students to sign up, and whether the district would pay for  services when students did not attend SES sessions. While states may  review and define program design parameters as part of the provider  approval process, district officials in three of our site visits expressed  concern about their lack of authority to set parameters in provider  contracts around costs and program design, such as tutor-to-student ratios  and total hours of instruction. For example, during our site visit, a  Hamilton County, Tenn., district official expressed frustration with  providers that charged the maximum per-pupil amount but varied in the  level of services provided, such as the number of instructional hours and  tutor-to-student ratio. Chicago, Ill., district officials also expressed  concern about the variation among providers in the hours of instruction  and cost of services because the district does not have sufficient funds to  serve all eligible students and officials would like to maximize the number  of students they can serve. In part to help address district concerns, in  2005-2006, Illinois required approved providers to submit information on  the cost of providing services in each of the districts they served and made  this information available to districts and the public in order to improve  transparency and accountability. While Tennessee state officials told us  they were hesitant to set restrictions on providers and would like more  federal direction on this issue, other states have set restrictions on the  cost and design of SES programs. For example, Georgia set a maximum  tutor-to-student ratio of 1:8 for non-computer based instruction and   1:10 for computer based instruction, and New Mexico adopted a sliding fee  scale based on the educational level of tutors.", "Coordination of service delivery has also been a challenge for providers,  districts, and schools. About 70 percent of states reported that the level of  coordination between providers, districts, and schools implementing SES  was a moderate to very great challenge. Sometimes these coordination  difficulties have resulted in service delays. For example, services were  delayed or withdrawn in three of the districts we visited because not  enough students signed up to meet the providers\u2019 enrollment targets and  districts were not aware of these targets. In one district we visited,  services were delayed because school teachers hired to be tutors did not  provide evidence of their background checks and teaching certificates to  providers in a timely manner. Coordination difficulties also occurred  during the enrollment process. Though districts are responsible for  arranging SES for eligible students, in two districts we visited, both the  district and providers sent parents enrollment forms, which caused  confusion among parents as well as additional work for the district staff  processing the forms. In addition, a few providers told us they do not  know how many students they will serve until enrollment forms are  returned to district officials, which hinders planning and may delay  services since they do not know how many tutors they will need to hire  and train to deliver SES in each district."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providers, District and School Officials Reported That a Greater Role for Schools Would Improve Local SES Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In part because SES can be delivered in school facilities, providers and  officials in the districts and schools we visited reported that involvement  of school administrators and other staff improves SES implementation.  Although schools do not have federally-defined responsibilities for  administering SES, many officials said SES implementation is hindered  when school officials are not involved. Some providers we interviewed  said that a lack of involvement of school principals can make it difficult  for them to coordinate with schools to encourage student participation. In  addition, a few providers said certain districts contributed to this problem  by restricting communication with school officials or not defining a role  for schools in SES implementation. Officials in one of the districts we  visited also told us that encouraging participation and administering the  program was more difficult when they did not designate school staff to  assist the district with SES implementation. School officials from all four  of our site visits also said the lack of a clear role for school officials,  including principals, in administering SES has been a challenge. For  example, Illinois and Oregon school principals told us they found it  difficult to manage afterschool activities because they didn\u2019t have  sufficient authority to oversee SES tutors operating in their buildings at  that time. Further, problems can arise when school officials are not fully  informed about the SES program. For example, Woodburn, Ore., school  officials told us that although the school was not provided SES tutoring  schedules for students, parents and students have come to school officials  for help when they were unclear about the schedule or when tutors failed  to show up.", "A majority of the providers we interviewed told us that involvement of  school principals can improve participation and make it easier to deliver  services, in part because principals are familiar with the students and  manage school staff. For example, certain providers reported providing  principals with information about the tutoring program so that school staff  can assist with the enrollment process, involving principals in selecting the  curriculum used in their schools, and sending principals student progress  reports. In addition, all four districts we visited had school site  coordinators to assist with SES, such as helping with the enrollment  process and assisting with the day-to-day administration of the SES  program in the schools. For example, Woodburn, Ore., district officials  told us implementation improved when the district designated school site  coordinators to assist with parental notification and events where  providers present their programs, and meet with parents and providers to  help them complete individual student learning plans. A few providers we  interviewed also assigned a staff person at the school site to communicate  with teachers and parents.

However, although almost all states reported that they are collecting  information on district SES expenditures as part of their oversight,  Education does not require states to submit information on the percent or  amount of Title I funds districts spent for SES through the CSPR or other  means. Therefore, while Education tracks the extent to which states are  providing SES to eligible students, the department does not collect data on  the relative costs of serving them.

During three of our site  visits, officials also expressed some concern about the lack of clarity in  the SES guidance with regards to student eligibility requirements and how  to craft a parental SES notification letter that is both complete and easy  for parents to understand.", "Regarding parental notification letters, though both OESE and OIG found  many states and districts to be non-compliant with the federal requirement  that district SES parental notification letters include several specific  elements, Education\u2019s SES guidance, which is coordinated by OII,  provides a sample that does not clearly specify all of the key elements  required by SES law and regulations. For example, the sample letter does  not include information on provider services, qualifications, and  effectiveness. Furthermore, a few state and district officials commented  that, when followed, the Title I regulations governing SES yield a letter  that is unreasonably long and complex, which may be difficult for parents  to understand.", "Many states and districts expressed interest in the flexibility offered  through two pilot programs that Education implemented during 2005-2006.  The department designed these pilots to increase the number of eligible  students receiving SES and to generate additional information about the  effect of SES on student academic achievement. For example, several  state and district SES coordinators expressed interest in Education\u2019s pilot  program that allowed two districts in needs improvement status to act as  SES providers in exchange for their expansion of student access to SES  providers and collection of achievement data to determine SES program  effectiveness. During three of our four site visits, state and district officials  expressed concern that districts identified for needs improvement are  excluded from delivering SES, and one state official noted that removing  districts from the state approved provider list may result in lower SES  participation. Further, in our surveys, three state SES coordinators and   17 district SES coordinators wrote in comments that permitting districts in  needs improvement status to provide services would assist their efforts.  Through both our surveys and site visits, officials suggested that allowing  districts to act as providers may ease student access to SES for rural  districts that do not have providers located nearby, allow more students to  participate in SES because district costs to provide services are sometimes  lower than other providers\u2019 costs, and enable districts to continue their  existing tutoring programs that they feel are effective and meet the same  goals as SES. Overall, we estimate that 15 percent of districts were state- approved providers in 2004-2005. However, another national survey  recently found the percentage of urban and suburban districts that are  state-approved SES providers is declining.", "The other SES pilot allowed four districts in Virginia to offer SES instead  of school choice in schools that have missed state performance goals for   2 years and are in their first year of needs improvement. During our site  visits and through our surveys, many states and districts expressed  interest in adjusting the order of the SES and school choice interventions.  Specifically, half of states and over 60 percent of districts suggested that  SES should be made available before school choice (see table 7). Further,  approximately three-quarters of both states and districts indicated that  SES should be offered either before or simultaneously with choice. As we  found through our previous work on school choice, few students are  opting to transfer schools in the first year of needs improvement, and  therefore this change would provide students with another option to  receive additional academic support in that year. Further, in a recent  national study, district and school officials noted that parents and students  are often not interested in changing schools, in part because of potential  long commutes and satisfaction with their current schools, which suggests  that parents and students would likely prefer to receive SES in their own  schools and neighborhoods rather than school choice. In line with  interest in increased flexibility with these interventions, in May 2006,  Education announced that due to the positive results in Virginia districts  under the pilot, the department plans to extend and expand this pilot in  2006-2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the last few years, almost all states and approximately 1,000 districts  have been required to implement SES across the country and, if current  trends continue, more schools will be required to offer services in the  future. Although some states and districts are beginning to gain experience  in implementing SES and use promising approaches to increase SES  participation, many students are still not receiving services, in part  because providers are sometimes not available to serve certain areas and  groups. In addition, some districts are unsure how to involve school  officials in facilitating local coordination of SES implementation and  providing effective parental notification. While Education has provided  support to states and districts through guidance and technical assistance,  many report needing additional assistance to address these challenges.  Further, the lack of clarity between policy guidance issued by OII and  criteria used by OESE in their compliance reviews of states\u2019  implementation efforts creates additional challenges in meeting the federal  requirements for parental notification letters. Providing states with clear  guidance that has been coordinated across Education offices is especially  important now that the department has announced plans to take  significant enforcement actions to ensure states comply with federal SES  requirements.", "While some districts do not have any students receiving services and,  therefore, are not spending any Title I funds for SES, other districts are  spending more than their entire set-aside and still have students on waiting  lists to receive services. Two districts have been able to participate in  Education\u2019s pilot program waiving federal regulations that preclude  districts in need of improvement from providing SES, which may help  them provide services to more students at a lower cost. However,  extending this flexibility to more districts depends on the evaluation of the  quality of these services to determine if SES is having a positive impact on  student academic achievement. In addition, the absence of strategies that  states can use to set parameters around program design and costs further  hinders their ability to stretch available funding to serve more students.  Federal and state oversight of district efficiency in using federal funds to  provide SES services is hindered by incomplete reporting requirements  that require states to report on the number of eligible children receiving  SES, but not the data they collect on the amount of Title I funding used to  serve them. This information gap limits Education\u2019s ability to track state  and district compliance in spending funds for SES. Further, Education\u2019s  ability to ensure that federal dollars are effectively spent to improve  student academic achievement is limited until states increase their  capacity to monitor and evaluate provider performance. In the absence of  additional federal technical assistance and access to information about  state and district promising practices, some states may continue to  struggle with implementation and evaluation of SES."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help states and districts implement SES more effectively, we  recommend that the Secretary of Education use the department\u2019s Web site  and the Center on Innovation and Improvement, as well as other means of  communication, to:    Provide federal guidance on SES parental notification letters that is  clear and has been coordinated internally between OII and OESE to  provide additional assistance to states and districts to help them  comply with federal requirements and ensure that letters are easy for  parents to understand.

On the basis of the pre-tests, the Web  instrument underwent some slight revisions. A second step we took to  minimize nonsampling errors was using a Web-based survey.
