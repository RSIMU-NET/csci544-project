In March 2015, GAO identified the cost of disasters as a key source of federal fiscal exposure. GAO and others have advocated hazard mitigation to help limit the nation's fiscal exposure.", "GAO was asked to review federal efforts to strengthen disaster resilience during Hurricane Sandy recovery. This report addresses (1) how federal recovery funds were used to enhance resilience, (2) the extent to which states and localities were able to maximize federal funding to enhance resilience; and (3) actions that could enhance resilience for future disasters.", "To conduct this work, GAO reviewed key federal documents such as the National Mitigation Framework , interviewed federal officials responsible for programs that fund disaster resilience, and administered structured interviews and surveys to all 12 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City in the Sandy affected-region."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During the Hurricane Sandy Recovery, five federal programs\u2014the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Federal Transit Administration's Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Hurricane Sandy program\u2014helped enhance disaster resilience\u2014the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to disasters. These programs funded a number of disaster-resilience measures, for example, acquiring and demolishing at-risk properties, elevating flood-prone structures, and erecting physical flood barriers.", "State and local officials from the states affected by Hurricane Sandy GAO contacted reported that they were able to effectively leverage federal programs to enhance disaster resilience, but also experienced challenges that could result in missed opportunities. The challenges fell into three categories:", "implementation challenges with PA and HMGP\u2014for example, officials reported that FEMA officials did not always help them pursue opportunities to incorporate mitigation into permanent construction recovery projects;", "limitations on comprehensive risk reduction approaches in a postdisaster environment\u2014for example, officials reported difficulties with navigating multiple funding streams and various regulations of the different federal programs funded after Hurricane Sandy; and", "local ability and willingness to participate\u2014for example, officials reported that some home and business owners were unwilling or unable to bear the required personal cost share for a home-elevation or other mitigation project.", "FEMA officials told us that they were aware of some of these challenges and recognize the need to further assess them. Assessing the challenges and taking corrective actions, as needed, could help enhance disaster resilience.", "There is no comprehensive, strategic approach to identifying, prioritizing and implementing investments for disaster resilience, which increases the risk that the federal government and nonfederal partners will experience lower returns on investments or lost opportunities to strengthen key critical infrastructure and lifelines. Most federal funding for hazard mitigation is available after a disaster. For example, from fiscal years 2011-2014, FEMA obligated more than $3.2 billion for HMGP postdisaster hazard mitigation while the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program obligated approximately $222 million. There are benefits to investing in resilience postdisaster. Individuals and communities affected by a disaster may be more likely to invest their own resources while recovering. However, there are also challenges. Specifically, the emphasis on the postdisaster environment can create a reactionary and fragmented approach where disasters determine when and for what purpose the federal government invests in disaster resilience. The Mitigation Framework Leadership Group (MitFLG) was created to help coordinate hazard mitigation efforts of relevant local, state, tribal, and federal organizations. A comprehensive investment strategy, coordinated by MitFLG, could help address some challenges state and local officials experienced."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) FEMA assess the challenges state and local officials reported and implement corrective actions as needed and (2) MitFLG establish an investment strategy to identify, prioritize, and implement federal investments in disaster resilience.

We have recognized  the rise in the number\u2014and the increase in severity\u2014of disasters as a  key source of federal fiscal exposure. Similarly, managing fiscal  exposure due to climate change has been on our high risk list since 2013,  in part, because of concerns about the increasing costs of disaster  response and recovery efforts. We and others have recommended  building disaster resilience\u2014by taking actions to mitigate vulnerabilities to  the effects of severe weather and to adapt to effects of climate change\u2014 as one strategy to help to limit the nation\u2019s fiscal exposure.", "You expressed interest in whether and how federal funds used to help the  region affected by Hurricane Sandy are contributing to the recovery  process and enhancing disaster resilience to help reduce the potential for  future losses. This report addresses the following questions:   1.   How have states and localities in the Sandy-affected area used  federal funds to help enhance resilience during disaster recovery?   2.   To what extent did state officials report being able to use federal  programs to maximize resilience-building during disaster recovery?   3.   What actions did the federal government take to promote disaster  resilience in the recovery effort, and what, if any, improvements could  be made for future large-scale disasters?", "To address our first objective, we reviewed program documentation\u2014 such as grant guidance and federal rules\u2014and discussed program  purposes with key agency officials to determine whether and how  administered programs and activities facilitate community and regional  disaster resilience as part of rebuilding. We obtained information on  appropriations from the Sandy Supplemental and information related to  the purposes of programs and activities from the Sandy Supplemental  and federal agency documents. We focused on describing five federal  programs that have the ability to support disaster resilience-building  efforts that are administered by four federal agencies that received 92  percent of the Sandy Supplemental. We collected and analyzed  information from the District of Columbia, New York City, and each of the  12 states that had a major disaster declaration about the types of projects  for which they used federal funds to enhance disaster resilience as part of  the Hurricane Sandy recovery effort. We also reviewed state hazard  mitigation plans and local hazard mitigation plans and guidance. In  addition we reviewed information about large-scale state projects  provided by FEMA headquarters, FEMA\u2019s Sandy Recovery Office and  state officials. During a site visit to New Jersey, 1 of the 2 states that  sustained the most damage, we also toured damaged areas and projects  in progress to observe and discuss planned resilience-building efforts.", "We requested that State Hazard Mitigation Officers, in coordination with other  knowledgeable state officials, identify the federal and state funding streams that were  available for hazard mitigation projects and those that were used for projects during the  Sandy recovery. We also requested a comprehensive list or selected examples of hazard  mitigation projects their states had planned or underway. Additionally, we asked officials to  discuss their opinions of the successes and challenges of FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance and  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s  (HUD) Community Development Block Grant- Disaster Recovery program, and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program.", "Hazard Mitigation Officers were joined by their state counterparts or  supervisors in state emergency management departments with  responsibility for managing other aspects of recovery efforts.  We also  administered the structured interview and survey to New York City\u2019s  Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which administers some streams of  federal funds and oversees strategic planning for disaster resilience  efforts. In addition, we interviewed the New York Governor\u2019s Office of  Storm Recovery, which is largely responsible for administering certain  non-FEMA federal funds and the New Jersey Governor\u2019s Office of  Recovery and Rebuilding, which coordinates the state\u2019s recovery effort,  including overseeing disaster resilience priorities. In New York and New  Jersey, the governors\u2019 offices collaborated with the state emergency  management offices (particularly the State Hazard Mitigation Officers) to  complete the survey.", "We compared information we learned from interviews with federal, state,  and local officials and from federal documents with the goals stated in the  National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) and National Mitigation  Framework (NMF). Specifically, these policies call for the government to  integrate hazard mitigation and risk reduction opportunities into all major  decisions and reinvestments during the recovery process and to  capitalize on opportunities during the recovery building process to further  reduce vulnerability. In this respect, we considered the extent to which the  reported experiences of the state and local officials using these federal  programs were consistent governmentwide and reflected agency  management priorities for disaster resilience. The documentation and  information requests, structured interviews, and follow-up surveys were  administered in a selected group of states and are not generalizable to  the nation as a whole. However, they represent the entire population of  states involved in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The states span 4  of 10 FEMA regions and multiple geographic regions of the eastern  United States. In interviews and the follow-up survey, we discussed the  Hurricane Sandy recovery effort, as well as recovery from smaller  disasters that occurred since 2011. Accordingly, the results of the  interviews and surveys offer insights into the recent experiences  nonfederal users have building resilience during disaster recovery. The  overall response rate for the surveys was 92 percent.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed federal statutes, regulations,  executive orders, and studies related to hazard mitigation and disaster  resilience. These included the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013  (Sandy Supplemental), the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013  (SRIA), the President\u2019s Executive Order (EO) 13632\u2014Establishing the  Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, and the 2013 Hurricane Sandy  Rebuilding Strategy: Stronger Communities, A Resilient Region. We also  analyzed the recommendations of the Hurricane Sandy Task Force report  that were intended to help facilitate or remove obstacles to disaster  resilience. We obtained information about the status of implementing the  recommendations in the task force report from FEMA, the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of  Transportation (DOT) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) via  documents and interviews with officials involved in the Hurricane Sandy  recovery. In addition, we obtained information on the status of  implementing disaster resilience-building related provisions of SRIA from  FEMA officials. We interviewed officials representing HUD, FEMA, and  the interdepartmental Mitigation Framework Leadership Group (MitFLG)  to discuss the challenges state officials reported to us and challenges  experienced at the federal level. As evidenced by the various recipients  of federal appropriations in the Sandy Supplemental, both disaster  recovery and building disaster resilience to reduce the federal fiscal  exposure to future disaster losses are missions that cut across federal  departments. Therefore, we compared the challenges reported by state  and federal officials to elements of a national strategy that we have  previously recommended to help support such efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to July 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

For example, 19 agencies were appropriated funds for  more than 60 programs for Hurricane Sandy recovery in the Sandy  Supplemental, some of which provide opportunities to incorporate hazard  mitigation and other disaster resilience-building activities into disaster  recovery efforts. These programs include the (1) FEMA Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program (HMGP), (2) FEMA Public Assistance (PA), (3) HUD  Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR), (4)  the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Transit Administration (FTA)  Emergency Relief Program (ERP), and (5) USACE\u2019s Sandy Program.

The  NMF explains that building widespread disaster resilience throughout  communities is a national priority and is a responsibility that is shared by  individuals; businesses; non-profit organizations; and federal, state, local,  tribal, and territorial governments. The NMF also established MitFLG to  help coordinate hazard mitigation efforts of relevant local, state, tribal,  and federal organizations. MitFLG is an intergovernmental coordinating  body that was created to integrate federal efforts and promote a national  culture shift that incorporates risk management and hazard mitigation in  all planning, decision making, and development to the extent practicable.  Although federal agencies play a critical role in promoting disaster  resilience through the use of federal resources, a large part of disaster  resilience-building efforts and decision-making also occurs at the state  and local level.

For example, the  officials stated that among the reasons why FEMA returned the two plans  were that they did not contain a definition of \u201churricane,\u201d did not follow the  agency\u2019s formatting guidelines, or because they included hazard  mitigation activities that were not eligible for FEMA funding but may have  been of benefit to the local jurisdictions. A senior FEMA official told us  that they require the plans to be detailed so that they result in  preidentified hazard mitigation projects that can be implemented quickly  after a disaster.", "Ten of the 13 states and cities responding to our follow up survey  reported that turnover among either PA or HMGP staff at joint field offices  or recovery offices was a challenge that limited their ability to maximize  disaster resilience as part of the recovery, as illustrated by figure 8.state official said that the high rate of turnover at FEMA causes  discontinuity in grant staff expertise, which hinders the state\u2019s ability to  efficiently submit applications. Another said that the rate of turnover  among project specialists for FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program was a  frequent complaint of applicants and led to inconsistent guidance and  repetition of project formulation processes. For example, 1 state reported  that what had been acceptable to one FEMA reviewer may not be to the  standards of the reviewer\u2019s successor, requiring the state to go back to  square one and re-visit everything that was previously agreed upon. The  state reported that changes in FEMA personnel resulted in the need to  \u201cretread ground long-since covered\u201d and resulted in inconsistent guidance   One  from FEMA personnel. FEMA officials acknowledged that staff turnover in  joint field offices and recovery offices has been a long standing challenge.", "State and city officials in the Sandy-affected region that we interviewed  and surveyed reported that they were not always able to capitalize on  federal recovery assistance to strengthen resilience because the kind of  projects they thought would be most useful were not eligible. Figure 9  shows that 7 of 13 states and cities responding to our follow-up survey  reported that the type of projects eligible for HMGP limited their ability to  maximize resilience during the recovery effort, and 8 of 13 said the same  for PA. Concerns about eligibility generally centered on unique  attributes of a locality or region that did not align with HMGP regulations  and guidance designed for broad national characteristics. For example,  one hazard mitigation official suggested that more needed to be done to  address the needs of dense urban areas, including hazard mitigation  projects suited to those environments. In particular, elevation is not  feasible for historic row homes in these urban areas, and the property  values in some areas may make it difficult to demonstrate cost- effectiveness of the acquisition of homes in flood prone areas.", "Although law, regulation, and grant guidance prescribe the types of  projects eligible for these programs, there is sometimes flexibility in  interpreting those criteria to be responsive to state and local needs. State  Hazard Mitigation Officers we interviewed reported that they frequently  communicate with their counterparts in other states to share information  and ideas, and discovered inconsistent application of flexibility in making  eligibility determinations across states and regions. As shown in figure 10,  7 of 13 states and cities responding to our survey said that FEMA officials  in their region had not applied discretion, under the current regulations  and guidance, in a way that maximizes hazard mitigation opportunities  under the HMGP program. For example, in interviews officials from 1  state told us that their regional FEMA officials determined HMGP could be  used only to elevate utilities, such as water heaters, to the first floor,  because elevation was to be to base flood elevation plus 1 foot, and any  other floor would be higher than that, and therefore not considered a  \u201creasonable cost.\u201d According to state officials, for practical and aesthetic  reasons, homeowners declined to participate unless they could elevate  utilities to the attic level. When we described this scenario to a senior  official from the FEMA Mitigation Directorate, the official said that  elevation of utilities to an attic generally could be determined eligible, and  the small additional cost in that situation should not be a barrier to  mitigating their risk from future disasters. The official later followed up and  found that FEMA employees in that region had misunderstood FEMA\u2019s  authority to allow the additional cost for utilities.", "Another factor states reported affecting HMGP and PA eligibility is the  benefit-cost calculation. For both HMGP and PA, FEMA typically requires  a benefit cost analysis to compare the cost of a hazard mitigation project  with its future benefits. Eight of 13 states and cities responding to our  follow up survey reported that they experienced challenges with the  consideration of appropriate benefits (e.g., environmental) in at least one  of these programs, as shown in figure 11. For example, acquisition  projects, which result in open space, can enhance environmental quality  in a community. According to a senior official in FEMA\u2019s Mitigation  Directorate, the goal of HMGP is to protect against damages from future  severe weather, and it would not be appropriate to consider benefits that  do not relate directly to that purpose. However, FEMA has already taken  some action that may help to address this problem. FEMA issued a policy  in 2013 describing additional environmental benefits that could be  considered for property acquisitions. In addition, on the basis of an  analysis by the agency\u2019s Risk Reduction Division, FEMA issued guidance  in 2013 that the acquisition or elevation of structures located within the  100-year floodplain will be considered cost-effective as long as the total  project costs are under $276,000 for acquisitions and $175,000 for  elevations. For projects meeting these guidelines, applicants are not  required to submit a benefit cost analysis. During our interviews, officials  from multiple states praised this practice, in part because it reduced the  burden for them and their local partners and in part because it recognized  the overall benefit of elevation, even when some elevation projects may  not have been determined to be cost-effective under the previous  guidelines because of variations in construction costs across regions.  Multiple state officials told us during interviews that they appreciated  FEMA\u2019s decision to establish a standard benefit cost analysis threshold  for these hazard mitigation activities. On the other hand, some state  officials cautioned that by making more projects eligible without a benefit  cost analysis requirement, predetermined benefits can lead to more strain  on limited resources and make the prioritization process more difficult for  state decision-makers.", "Identifying PA Hazard Mitigation Projects  Generally, when applicants wish to be  considered for Public Assistance funding, they  work directly with FEMA Project Specialists.  Project Specialists are primarily responsible  for collecting information about potential  projects and for assessing and determining  project eligibility. The formal documentation of  this process is called a project worksheet.  Project worksheet guidance states that project  specialists should complete a hazard  mitigation proposal if the applicant requests  hazard mitigation measures, and in such  cases, a justification for the proposed  mitigation measures must be provided.", "Specialists had avoided writing or had inadequately prepared hazard  mitigation proposals prior to Hurricane Sandy. In addition, a seventh  respondent reported that the state did not experience Project Specialists  actively discouraging hazard mitigation, but not encouraging it when  working with locals to identify projects had been a challenge.", "FEMA\u2019s Project Worksheet Development Guide, the internal guidance for  completing project worksheets, directs project specialists to ask  applicants if they would like to pursue hazard mitigation activities but does  not direct the employees to actively identify opportunities for hazard  mitigation during the process of scoping a project. On the contrary, the  guidance categorizes hazard mitigation within a class of \u201cspecial  considerations,\u201d which can result in additional processes or layers of  review. Although the guidance notes that hazard mitigation is a priority for  FEMA and suggests that project specialists should sometimes consider  providing an explanation when it is not implemented, the agency\u2019s  position to make hazard mitigation a priority is not fully emphasized  throughout the guidance.", "Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s  (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance  FEMA has multiple programs to help states  and localities enhance disaster resilience. The  primary programs for mitigation against all  hazards are Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  (HMGP) and the Pre-Disaster Mitigation  Program (PDM). In addition, the Flood  Mitigation Assistance Program is available  through the National Flood Insurance Fund for  flood hazard mitigation projects.   Generally, PDM receives annual  appropriations that are small, compared with  the amount of funding typically provided  following a disaster. In fiscal year 2014, for  example, the total appropriation for the entire  nation was $25 million. Each of the 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories  automatically receives at least either 1  percent of PDM allocations or $575,000,  whichever is less. Each of these entities is  eligible for additional PDM awards on a  competitive project basis, regardless of  disaster history.   HMGP, by contrast, is funded through FEMA\u2019s  Disaster Relief Fund, and is available only in  the wake of a presidentially-declared  disaster\u2014generally 15 percent of the first $2  billion in disaster assistance awarded in  association with a declared disaster. As a  result, nationwide annual HMGP spending  tends to be significantly higher than annual  PDM allocations, but the size of any individual  award will vary. In addition, in any given year,  some states and other nonfederal  governments may not be eligible for HMGP. is not documented in FEMA\u2019s current internal guidance for completing  project worksheets. In addition, FEMA officials told us that making  adjustments to project specialists\u2019 roles in identifying hazard mitigation  opportunities during the project worksheet formulation process could help  to further integrate disaster resilience into the recovery process.", "Given the challenges state and local officials experienced during the  Hurricane Sandy recovery, evaluating the extent that corrective actions  are needed to help ensure FEMA consistently reinforces its resilience  goals in the NDRF and NMF could better position FEMA to assist state  and locals in maximizing opportunities to enhance disaster resilience.  According to FEMA officials, the agency has launched a reengineering  initiative to develop a new operating model for PA that is intended to  enable greater efficiency and improve the delivery of disaster assistance.  FEMA plans to test the new model during 2015 and then begin full  implementation during 2016 or 2017, depending on how many disasters  occur during that time. In addition, according to officials, FEMA is  exploring the effect of and potential solutions to staff turnover as part of  this effort. Whether as part of the PA review or outside of it, identifying  corrective actions that respond to the experiences of state officials with  responsibility for resilience during recovery from the most recent multi- billion dollar disaster could enhance FEMA\u2019s ability to meet the goal of  integrating hazard mitigation into the recovery process. For example,  FEMA could enhance communication, guidance, training, or  documentation of decision making to address issues arising from staff  turnover, promote maximum flexibility within the law to meet local needs,  and ensure that PA project specialists appropriately identify hazard  mitigation opportunities. FEMA officials acknowledged the importance of  reviewing the challenges identified by state and local officials and told us  that they appreciated us bringing these challenges\u2014which they have not  necessarily already planned to address in their review\u2014to their attention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and Local Officials Experienced Challenges Enhancing Resilience in the Postdisaster Recovery Environment", "paragraphs": ["The bulk of federal disaster resilience funding, such as PA and HMGP,  that is provided to states and localities comes after they have  experienced a disaster, particularly a large or catastrophic disaster.

As demonstrated in figure 13, PDM spending has  historically been a fraction of HMGP spending. In addition, PDM grants  limit states to a certain number of applications per year\u2014for instance, in  fiscal year 2014, states could submit a maximum of 11 applications, of  which only 2 could be for projects, as opposed to hazard mitigation  planning or management costs, which according to officials, limits the  states\u2019 capacities to implement \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d hazard mitigation  projects with the pre-disaster grant funds.", "As demonstrated by the Sandy Supplemental and the associated  recovery effort, in the wake of a catastrophic disaster, affected areas can  receive substantial sums to enhance disaster resilience. For example,  HMGP provided approximately $1.7 billion to New York and New Jersey  following Hurricane Sandy. In addition, other programs like CDBG-DR  and FTA\u2019s ERP provided billions of disaster resilience dollars that are not  available on an annual basis. There are advantages to making funds  available in the postdisaster environment. For example, the recent and  tangible experience with the disaster can help motivate individuals and  communities to focus on mitigating their risk, because they do not want to  relive the losses they have just experienced or to incur losses they  observe in their neighbors\u2019 experience.", "State officials we interviewed confirmed that, in their experience, local  applicants were more likely to invest their own resources in hazard  mitigation activities following a disaster. In some states, state officials  reported Hurricane Sandy was a catalyst to strengthen the state\u2019s culture  of resilience. Officials in the most severely affected states\u2014for example,  New York and New Jersey\u2014told us that disaster resilience is now a point  of discussion across sectors and throughout communities that had not  previously pursued hazard mitigation. Of the six officials who said their  state\u2019s culture of resilience had not changed as a result of Sandy, three  attributed the lack of change to the less severe impact experienced by  their states, relative to the impact on other states that had been affected,  and one official reported that seeing the damage sustained in New York  and New Jersey made citizens and leaders more aware of their own risk.

Of the 7 that said hazard mitigation should be  integrated in days to weeks (rather than hours to days) some also  expressed skepticism about the feasibility of focusing on future disaster  resilience activities while life-saving activities were in progress. For  example, one State Hazard Mitigation Officer told us that it is more  important to restore power to the affected area quickly than it is to ensure  that the power grid is repaired in a manner that mitigates future disaster  risk.", "During our discussions about how soon after a disaster hazard mitigation  and disaster resilience planning should be integrated into recovery,  officials noted that a more effective approach to disaster resilience would  be to plan and implement hazard mitigation before a disaster occurs. In  this regard, 12 of 13 states and cities responding to our survey reported  that the emphasis of federal resources on the postdisaster environment  challenged their ability to maximize federal disaster resilience  investments, as illustrated in figure 14.", "A related challenge that state and city officials we interviewed discussed  stems from the general structure of HMGP funding. Although, outside the  recent response to Hurricane Sandy, HMGP is generally the primary  vehicle through which the federal government has invested in disaster  resilience, state and local officials noted that the (1) amounts, (2) political  context, and (3) timing and uncertainty associated with the program can  lead to a less coherent approach to reducing overall risk.", "In terms of amounts, a senior FEMA official said that when HMGP is  awarded for most disasters, the total award is generally not enough to  address larger critical infrastructure needs, and as a result, states and  localities tend to focus on smaller projects to the exclusion of those that  have more potential to reduce their most critical risks. One state official  said that localities tend to avoid including those larger needs in hazard  mitigation planning, because they did not even think it was feasible to  consider addressing them.", "State officials also described a delicate political environment in the wake  of disasters where decisions about what hazard mitigation projects to  fund can be challenging. A senior MitFLG official stated that political  pressure can often dictate how and where states and localities spend  resilience funding in the wake of a disaster. For example, elected officials  can direct the use of disaster resilience funding to one or a few large- scale infrastructure projects or spread the funds throughout the state for  numerous small projects across multiple communities. The official said it  has been his experience that the state officials often choose to distribute  the funds throughout multiple communities in a way that makes a positive  impact on individuals and sometimes communities, but not in a way that  necessarily changes the overall risk profile of the state.", "Officials in one state we visited described an example where they had  initially planned to use HMGP funds for flood control measures in the  economic center of a small town that regularly floods\u2014a project they had  determined was the best path to enhancing the state\u2019s overall disaster  resilience. However, in the wake of the disaster, political considerations  trumped their experience and professional judgment, and the funds were  used instead to elevate beachfront properties.", "Estimating Hazard Mitigation Grant  Program Awards  The Federal Emergency Management  Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Office of the Chief Financial  Officer (OCFO) calculates Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program (HMGP) allocations using  estimates from FEMA program managers,  which reflect expended and projected costs.  Pursuant to FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation  Assistance Guidance, the OCFO is to provide  preliminary estimates to states at the 35-day  and 6-month marks post-declaration. At 12  months post-declaration, the OCFO is to  provide recipients with a \u201clock-in\u201d figure, which  is the maximum that FEMA can obligate to the  state for eligible HMGP activities.", "Finally, in terms of timing and uncertainty, officials reported being  challenged by the manner in which FEMA estimates and finalizes HMGP  awards. Because HMGP, by statute, is awarded as a portion of all other  FEMA disaster assistance awarded in association with a given disaster,  there is lag and uncertainty in the process of estimating and finalizing  awards. States and localities typically receive the final estimate for HMGP  awards 12 months after a major disaster declaration, which coincides with  the deadline for states to submit their HMGP project applications.  Moreover, in the wake of catastrophic disasters like Hurricane Sandy,  FEMA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer is not always able to provide  \u201clock-in\u201d figures at the 12-month mark. FEMA officials stated that in  catastrophic disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy, a prolonged focus on  projects such as debris removal, emergency protective measures, and  providing survivor assistance can delay their capacity to provide  estimates of the amount of HMGP funding that is available. In addition,  when states are approved for additional PA funding after the 12-month  mark, states can request adjustments to the amount of HMGP funding  available.", "Although states can get approved extensions\u2014something that has  happened in 75 percent of recent disasters, according to FEMA officials\u2014 state officials still reported challenges with the timing of final estimates. In  interviews, state officials said they experienced delays in receiving their  final estimates after Hurricane Sandy, and one state reported that it did  not receive the final estimate until the summer of 2014. Shown in figure  15, 11 of 13 officials responding to our follow-up survey reported that they  experienced challenges in the ability to plan, develop, or prioritize HMGP  project applications prior to knowing how much funding they are going to  receive for HMGP projects. A senior FEMA official told us that they  encourage states to submit HMGP applications early, prior to receiving  their lock-in estimates, because localities should have already identified  their priority projects through the hazard mitigation planning process.", "However, state officials told us that they seek to optimize the projects  based on the funds available, which could mean the difference between  allocating all the funds to one larger project or deferring that project and  allocating to multiple smaller projects depending on the total amount, and  this optimization cannot occur when the amounts are unknown before  applications are due. In addition, 1 official reported that projects identified  in local hazard mitigation plans are generally not developed to the level  required for an HMGP application, because few communities have the  resources to dedicate to this effort without knowing whether the project  will ultimately be funded.", "When disaster resilience funds, such as in the Sandy Supplemental, are  appropriated in response to catastrophic events, multiple federal  departments and programs share responsibility for enhancing disaster  resilience during recovery efforts, and the risk of fragmentation across the  multiple funding streams increases. As a result of the postdisaster  response, different programs are initiated at different points in the wake of  the disaster, making it more difficult for state and local officials to plan to  use federal funds in a way that comprehensively addresses overall risk  reduction. For example, states become eligible for PA once the President  grants the state a major disaster declaration, but HUD CDBG-DR funds  become available only if Congress makes a special appropriation as a  result of a catastrophic disaster, such as Hurricane Sandy. More  specifically, following Hurricane Sandy, FEMA Public Assistance funding  became available to most states within days to weeks, while HUD CDBG- DR funding was not available for several months, because the Sandy  Supplemental was enacted 3 months after the storm occurred. In  addition, other funds that can be used for disaster resilience\u2014related  construction, such as FTA\u2019s Emergency Relief Program, were  appropriated in the Sandy Supplemental and could be obligated only after  FTA was able to publish regulations governing the use of the funds  because it was standing up a newly created program. In response to our  follow up survey, 12 of 13 states and cities reported that navigating the  multiple funding streams and various regulations is a challenge that  affected their ability to maximize disaster resilience opportunities, shown  in figure 16.", "State officials we interviewed said there is no focal point in their state with  the time, responsibility, and authority to ensure a holistic approach to  reducing risk and increasing disaster resilience. Although state hazard  mitigation plans are to identify funding sources to pursue disaster  resilience, we found variation in the extent to which these plans actively  identified multiple funding streams. In addition, especially in the wake of a  large disaster like Sandy, State Hazard Mitigation Officers do not always  have visibility over all federal funding streams available for hazard  mitigation. For example, all of the 13 State Hazard Mitigation Officers we  interviewed said that they had little or no involvement with coordinating  hazard mitigation activities with FTA\u2019s ERP and most had minimal  visibility over CDBG-DR disaster resilience-related projects, apart from  the program\u2019s ability to be used to cover the required applicant\u2019s share of  HMGP and PA projects. Figure 17 illustrates the multiple timeframes and  program regulations that confronted state officials in the wake of  Hurricane Sandy.", "With the multiple rules, regulations, and timelines, state officials  responsible for enhancing disaster resilience who we interviewed  reported that it is difficult to navigate and leverage the multiple programs  available during recovery efforts. As illustrated by figure 18, 11 of the 13  states and cities that responded to our survey reported that the  timeliness, availability, or usefulness of the federal government\u2019s  guidance about what type of federal assistance is available after a  disaster, and how it can be used to most effectively pursue disaster  resilience, was a challenge that reduced their state\u2019s ability to maximize  resilience opportunities. For example, one state official who responded to  our survey said that key stakeholders, including state and local officials  and representatives from other federal disaster recovery programs, were  not adequately represented in discussions that occur at FEMA joint field  offices and disaster recovery centers, which are often the state\u2019s focal  point for guidance during the recovery effort. Other officials stated that the  available guidance could be variously incomplete, overwhelming,  contradictory, or require numerous clarifications. For example, officials in  1 state interpreted guidance to mean that moving critical infrastructure out  of the floodplain was an activity eligible for PA funding, but they were later  told by FEMA officials that the guidance did not apply to their specific  circumstance. Officials in another state said that agency guidance  sometimes seemed inconsistent with applicable portions of the Code of  Federal Regulations.", "The multiple federal regulations, if they are not harmonized, can also  create inefficiency or the appearance of inefficiency for the states and  localities. For example, officials from 10 of the 13 states and cities cited  challenges due to inefficiencies in the implementation of environmental  planning and historic preservation (EHP) reviews that prolonged work on  projects, shown in figure 19. EHP reviews are required for many  disaster recovery projects that receive federal funding, because of  requirements that the agencies comply with certain federal environmental  protection laws including the National Environmental Policy Act. State  officials told us that these reviews were often time-and resource- consuming, which could dissuade individuals from pursuing hazard  mitigation projects. For example, one state official state said that  managers of a marina damaged by Sandy chose not to pursue PA  funding because of concerns that the required EHP review would delay  the project\u2019s completion and potentially prevent the marina from  reopening in time for the following season. In addition, officials said that  FEMA\u2019s EHP reviews were sometimes redundant, with similar reviews  required by other federal or state agencies. For example, both FEMA and  HUD require an EHP review, which in some cases could result in a  duplication of requirements.", "SRIA amended the Stafford Act and required the President to establish  an expedited and unified interagency review process to ensure  compliance with environmental and historic preservation requirements  under federal law relating to disaster recovery projects in order to  expedite the recovery process. As a result, a steering group led, in part,  by FEMA and consisting of federal partners in emergency management,  environmental quality, and historic preservation was established to  develop and implement a more efficient process for federal EHP reviews  for disaster recovery projects. In addition, according to HUD officials,  while the Unified Federal Review process is underway, a Sandy-specific  team\u2014the Federal Sandy Infrastructure Permitting and Review Team\u2014 has been established to facilitate coordinated review and permitting of the  certain infrastructure projects, as recommended in the Hurricane Sandy  Rebuilding Strategy.", "In response, through the Unified Federal Review process, 11 federal  agencies that perform environmental and historic preservation reviews  during disaster recovery entered into a memorandum of understanding to  coordinate their independent review processes in an attempt to expedite  decision making and implementation of recovery projects. The Unified  Federal Review Process was established and effective on July 29, 2014  through the Memorandum of Understanding Establishing the United  Federal Environmental and Historic Preservation Review Process.  It is  too soon to evaluate the extent to which the Unified Federal Review, as  implemented, has resulted in harmonized and streamlined review  requirements for applicants.", "In keeping with the Unified Federal Review agreement, FEMA\u2019s 2015  Hazard Mitigation Assistance Guidance specifies that the agency can  accept EHP documentation from other federal agencies if the  documentation addresses the scope of the FEMA-approved activity and  FEMA verifies that it meets FEMA\u2019s EHP compliance requirements. In  addition, according to a FEMA official there are multiple complicating  factors that could affect applicants undergoing EHP review; however, the  official stated that the vast majority of FEMA projects\u2014when the  environmental planning and historic preservation review process is begun  early during project planning\u2014are not delayed. Moreover, a senior FEMA  official responsible for EHP compliance noted that during EHP reviews  the act of considering various alternatives can actually result in solutions  that promote greater disaster resilience."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Disaster Resilience- Building Efforts Are Dependent on Local Capacity and Participation, Which Can Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although states are usually the grant recipients for PA, HMGP, and  CDBG, local partners or federally-recognized Indian tribes often plan and  execute the projects these grants fund.

In some cases localities do  not have full-time staff dedicated to disaster resilience-related activities,  and may have difficulty keeping hazard mitigation plans current, making  grant applications, or monitoring and reporting on compliance with  multiple grant requirements. For example, 11 of 13 respondents to our  follow-up survey reported that local applicants may have difficulty  collecting the information required to complete FEMA\u2019s Benefit Cost Analysis Tool for their PA or HMGP applications, as shown in figure 21.Officials in 1 state said that the amount of documentation required for the  benefit cost analysis limited the number of project applications the state  was able to submit.", "In addition, some officials reported that localities or individual businesses  or homeowners were not willing to pursue hazard mitigation opportunities  because of competing concerns. For example, some communities may be  hesitant to pursue acquisition activities, which result in permanently  replacing homes or businesses with open space, because of the potential  to diminish the tax base or limit future economic development  opportunities.

The  issuance of EOs and PPDs in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy  demonstrates the federal government\u2019s focus on disaster resilience,  linking hazard mitigation and recovery to break the cycle of damage- repair-damage. For example, the President signed EO 13632 on  December 7, 2012 creating the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force  and charged the task force with developing the Hurricane Sandy  Rebuilding Strategy. It also charged the task force with taking into  account existing and future risks and promoting the long-term  sustainability of communities and ecosystems in the Sandy-affected  region. In addition, the EO on Sandy rebuilding called for the federal  government to:  1.  remove obstacles to resilient rebuilding in a manner that addresses  existing and future risks and vulnerabilities and promotes long-term  sustainability of communities,   2.  plan for the rebuilding of critical infrastructure damaged by Hurricane  Sandy in a manner that increases community and regional resilience  in responding to future impacts, and  3.  identify resources and authorities that can contribute to strengthening  community and regional resilience as critical infrastructure is rebuilt.", "Further, in 2013, the President issued an EO titled Preparing the United  States for the Impacts of Climate Change (EO 13653) and a PPD titled  Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (PPD-21), both calling for  the nation to manage risks in a way that makes the United States more  resilient in the future. The President also issued a Climate Action Plan to  improve the nation\u2019s resilience to flooding and better prepare the nation  for the impacts of climate change. The plan directs federal agencies to  take appropriate actions to reduce risk to federal investments, specifically  to \u201cupdate their flood-risk reduction standards.\u201d In January 2015, to  further the Climate Action Plan, the President released EO 13690,  Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.

The law  authorized several changes to the way FEMA may deliver federal disaster  assistance. For example, it authorizes FEMA to use expedited  procedures in HMGP. As a result, FEMA has issued guidance for  streamlining the program and is planning actions to continue to refine the  changes and measure their effectiveness. SRIA also allows FEMA to  provide up to 25 percent of the estimated costs for eligible hazard  mitigation measures to a state or tribal grantee before eligible costs are  incurred.", "In addition, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy\u2014as a result of EO  13632\u2014recognized the need to institutionalize regional approaches to  resilient planning and coordinate Sandy recovery infrastructure resilience  projects. More specifically, one of the recommendations stated that  MitFLG should institutionalize regional approaches to disaster resilience  planning in the NDRF and NMF. In addition, federal agencies have taken  a variety of actions to enhance regional resilience\u2014particularly as they  implemented select Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy  recommendations aimed at enhancing the Sandy-affected region\u2019s  disaster resilience. The Hurricane Sandy Task Force recommendations  related to disaster resilience and a brief status update for each  recommendation are included in appendix II.", "As a result of the recommendations, the Sandy task force developed its  Resilience Guidelines in the spring and summer of 2013. The guidelines  are intended to ensure that federal agencies have a consistent approach  to enhancing disaster resilience and to improve decision making to  ensure wise investments by establishing criteria for those investments.  The Task Force found that the main challenges involved complex  interagency issues that called for a more streamlined approach to  prioritizing the myriad of guidance, executive orders, frameworks, and  plans related to disaster resilience.", "We have previously concluded that complex interagency and  intergovernmental efforts can benefit from a national strategy. In 2004, we  identified elements of an effective national strategy including: (1)  identifying the purpose, scope, and particular national problems the  strategy is directed toward; (2) establishing goals, priorities, milestones,  and performance measures; (3) defining costs, benefits, and resource  and investment needs; (4) delineating roles and responsibilities; and (5)  integrating and articulating the relationship with related strategies\u2019 goals,  objectives, and activities.", "The NMF, by articulating a vision where the nation shares a culture of  resilience and describing the national capabilities required to focus on  disaster risk and resilience in everyday activities, to some extent serves  as such a strategy in that it has begun to address purpose, scope, and  responsibilities. Although the current framework\u2014the first-ever version\u2014 may evolve in future updates to reflect the more expansive and nuanced  understandings that come from sustained attention to an issue and  lessons learned from recent and future events, it already serves the  highest-level functions of an effective national strategy. What the nation  lacks and the framework does not significantly address, however, is  information; direction; and guidance for costs, benefits, and investments  needed to ensure that the nation is prioritizing federal resources in the  most effective and efficient manner possible.", "As previously described, states\u2019 and localities\u2019 experiences with the  Hurricane Sandy recovery demonstrate that the fragmentation and the  postdisaster emphasis inherent in the current approach to disaster  resilience investment can create obstacles to most effectively marshaling  resources toward the goal of overall risk reduction. In interviews, senior  officials at FEMA and HUD who provide MitFLG leadership acknowledged  that the current approach does not lead to the most efficient or effective  disaster resilience investments. As one of these officials put it, the federal  government\u2019s current investments aimed at enhancing the nation\u2019s  disaster resilience\u2014for instance, projects such as home acquisitions and  elevations\u2014have benefited individuals and, often, communities, but may  not have effectively reduced states\u2019 overall risk profiles. The official stated  that there are better investments that could be made, bringing into  question whether the federal government is getting the most effective  return on its disaster resilience investments.", "Findings of the Sandy Task Force Report also align with some of the  challenges states and city officials reported experiencing. For example,  Sandy Task Force Infrastructure Resilience Guidelines found that there is  significant overlap among various sets of guidelines, and, apart from  regulatory requirements and agency mission, which take primacy, there is  no guidance on prioritizing or differentiating across these sets of   Further, the guidelines also found that relief from regulatory  guidelines.and administrative processes may help communities recover and rebuild  more quickly; however, the guidelines also warned that relief from these  processes may contribute to decisions that are not aligned with resilience  principles, because, for example, immediate needs following a disaster  are prioritized over long-term goals\u2014a condition that relates to challenges  states and cities experience with both the general postdisaster emphasis  and the inherent fragmentation in the postcatastrophe environment.", "Although there are benefits to investing in disaster-resilience in a  postdisaster environment, there are challenges and tradeoffs that may  limit effective risk reduction. According to MitFLG officials, the federal  government may not have focused enough attention on pre-disaster  hazard mitigation. A study endorsed by the American Society of Civil  Engineers, the Association of State Flood Plain Managers, the National  Emergency Management Association, and the International Code  Council, among others, found that investing resources and capital to  prevent harm before it occurs is a rational and logical course of action;  however, social, political, and economic realities tend to drive public  choice away from investments that attempt to eliminate or minimize  disasters\u2019 impacts before they occur. More comprehensive  considerations afforded to the balance of pre- and postdisaster  investments could help ensure better returns on investments designed to  limit federal fiscal exposures by buying down risk.", "Moreover, information about the benefits of various types of investments  and the context in which they are made\u2014information that could guide  decision makers at every level of government and in the private sector\u2014 is largely not available. Conducting a comprehensive study to assess the  cost-benefit trade-offs and return on investment of hazard mitigation  activities would require substantial investment and expertise. FEMA has  developed a modeling methodology to assess the performance of flood  mitigation projects\u2014loss avoidance studies\u2014drawing on experience with  flood programs in actual postproject hazard events. However, modeling  the difference between losses with and without hazard mitigation  measures presents challenges, in part because of the lack of concrete  data to inform assumptions that underpin the models. Another challenge  is that savings depend on two highly uncertain variables\u2014(1) the  frequency and severity of future disasters affecting the property in which  federal investments are made, and (2) the extent to which the federal  government will bear the costs to recover from those disasters. However,  multiple catastrophic events over the last decade\u2014including Hurricanes  Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Ike and Sandy\u2014have resulted in the federal  government bearing anywhere from 75 to 100 percent of the total  recovery costs for FEMA eligible projects across 18 states.", "The return on investment of hazard mitigation also depends on the nature  of the specific activities and their impact on the affected property and thus  varies on a project-by-project basis. A 2005 Multihazard Mitigation  Council study attempted to quantify the future savings (in terms of losses  avoided) from hazard mitigation activities related to earthquake, wind, and  flood funded through three major FEMA natural hazard mitigation grant  programs\u2014the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact, and the  Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. The study results indicated that  the natural hazard mitigation activities funded by the three FEMA grant  programs between 1993 and 2003 were cost-effective and reduced future  losses from earthquake, wind, and flood events by $4 for every dollar of  investment. This figure has been cited in congressional hearings and  other arenas to describe the benefits of hazard mitigation; however, it is  dated and generalizes the benefit to all disasters based on a relatively  narrow set of disaster-loss data.", "In recent months, leaders and experts from multiple sectors\u2014including a  former FEMA director and representatives from the insurance industry\u2014 have called for a more strategic approach to making disaster resilience  investments. Without a comprehensive strategic approach to help  Congress and federal agencies that implement disaster resilience-related  programs prioritize, align, and guide federal investments, the federal  government\u2019s approach has been largely reactionary and fragmented.  Further, the lack of a strategic approach increases the risk that the federal  government and its nonfederal partners will experience lower returns on  investments or lost opportunities to effectively mitigate critical lifelines  against known threats and hazards. It also ignores the question of what  the right balance of federal and nonfederal investment should be and  whether incentives within the various statutes, regulations, and program  policies are appropriately aligned to encourage that balance. Moreover,  because states may rely on postdisaster federal funds to mitigate future  risks, states may not be incentivized to dedicate resources to  comprehensively address their overall risk profiles prior to a disaster  occurring.", "An investment strategy to complement the National Mitigation Framework  could help provide a more comprehensive and complete national strategy  to help ensure that the federal government is receiving the most  beneficial return on its disaster resilience funding activities. In particular,  an investment strategy would help to ensure that federal funds expended  to enhance disaster resilience achieve as effectively and efficiently as  possible the goal of reducing the nation\u2019s fiscal exposure as a result of  climate change and the rise in the number of federal major disaster  declarations. For example, an investment strategy could:   identify the most critical components of disaster resilience, such as  critical infrastructure, to help target financial resources in a way that  would protect those components from future disasters;   identify and oversee an approach to developing the information  required to more effectively and accurately determine which, and  under what circumstances, investments in disaster resilience reduce  overall risk, and in turn reduce federal fiscal exposures to disasters; describe the appropriate balance of federal and nonfederal investment  and help to identify how policymakers and program implementers  should structure incentives to help reach this balance; and  consider the current balance between pre- and postdisaster resource  allocation and advise the President and Congress on the benefits and  challenges of the current balance, including whether the nation should  seek to take a more proactive position in funding and encouraging  pre-disaster mitigation activities.", "A senior MitFLG official told us that executive-level leadership with  decision-making power is necessary for MitFLG to be able to effect  change. This is particularly important when multiple agencies are  responsible for managing fragmented federal efforts, such as the nation\u2019s  efforts to enhance its overall disaster resilience. An investment strategy  that complements the NMF could help support the ongoing leadership  from the executive and legislative branches by identifying what new or  amended federal policies, regulations, and laws are required to enhance  the nation\u2019s disaster resilience in the most efficient and effective way  possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2004 to 2013, FEMA obligated over $95 billion in  federal assistance for disaster recovery for presidentially declared major  disasters during that period, and the number of major disaster  declarations has increased significantly in recent decades. In the wake of  Hurricane Sandy, the federal government has demonstrated increased  focus on disaster resilience as a mechanism to limit the nation\u2019s fiscal  exposure to future disasters and has taken steps to improve states\u2019  abilities to use federal disaster recovery funding to incorporate resilient  rebuilding into recovery. However, state and local officials have still  experienced challenges enhancing their states\u2019 overall disaster resilience  when using federal funds through FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance and Hazard  Mitigation Grant Programs.", "During the Sandy recovery, states and localities were in some cases  constrained in their ability to pursue hazard mitigation activities using  FEMA PA and HMGP funding streams. State and city officials we  interviewed and surveyed reported experiencing several challenges in the  implementation of FEMA\u2019s PA and HMGP, including the complexities of  the hazard mitigation planning process, FEMA PA and HMGP staff  turnover, limitations on eligibility, and lack of FEMA support for PA  mitigation during project formulation. In addition, officials reported being  challenged by the manner in which HMGP estimates and final awards  were determined, specifically, the timing of the final estimate of HMGP  awards in tandem with the HMGP project application deadline. These  challenges could result in missed opportunities to improve states\u2019 disaster  resilience when providing federal funding for that purpose. Further, such  challenges may inhibit the federal government\u2019s efforts to reduce  vulnerabilities and integrate hazard mitigation into disaster recovery and  its ability to meet risk reduction goals established in the NDRF and  National Mitigation Framework. Assessing the challenges state and local  officials reported, including the extent to which the challenges can be  addressed and corrective actions can be implemented, as needed, may  help ensure that FEMA\u2019s hazard mitigation priorities are effectively  reflected in implementation of the agency\u2019s PA and HMGP programs.", "Although federal efforts helped to improve the nation\u2019s disaster resilience  during the recovery from Hurricane Sandy, a comprehensive federal  strategy to prioritize and guide federal investments intended to enhance  the nation\u2019s overall disaster resilience has not been developed. The  federal government primarily funds disaster resilience projects in the  wake of disasters\u2014when damages have already occurred and  opportunities to pursue hazard mitigation may conflict with the desire for  the immediate restoration of critical infrastructure. As the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure continues to be threatened by extreme  weather, the increase in the number of major disaster declarations, and\u2014 according to some state officials\u2014states\u2019 reliance on the federal  government to fund most of the costs associated with disaster response  and recovery, it is critical that the federal government ensures that it is  getting the best return on its disaster resilience investments. Also,  federal programs that provide disaster resilience funding are fragmented,  resulting in challenges to lowering the overall risk profiles of states and  enhancing the nation\u2019s disaster resilience from future disasters.

DHS stated that FEMA is aware  of and acknowledges the challenges state and local officials reported.  FEMA is planning to seek input from federal, tribal, state, and local  stakeholders as part of its efforts to reengineer the PA program, which  they believe will address many of the issues raised in the report. In  addition, in accordance with its strategic plan, FEMA is exploring ways to  improve risk reduction through the Federal Insurance Mitigation  Administration and Recovery mitigation programs, which will focus on  three concurrent work streams: (1) policy, regulation, and statute; (2)  codes and standards; and (3) operations. For example, FEMA will  encourage states, tribes, and localities to adopt and enforce the most  current version of the International Building Code and the International  Resilience Code. DHS anticipates these efforts, among others, to be  complete by December 31, 2016.

DHS stated that MitFLG recognizes the benefit of  prioritizing federal investments to identify those with the best potential to  enhance resilience against future disasters. DHS also stated that  although MitFLG does not have the authority to compel other federal  agencies to prioritize their funding to achieve a specific goal, it is working  with the interagency group on a variety of resilience activities. We  recognize that MitFLG does not have the authority to compel other federal   agencies to comply with the recommendations developed as part of the  investment strategy. However, we believe creating a strategy that helps  guide federal decisions makers across the interagency group\u2014including  recommendations to the executive and legislative branches of the federal  government on how to best prioritize federal resources aimed at  enhancing disaster resilience\u2014would be consistent with MitFLG\u2019s  purpose, which is to coordinate mitigation efforts across the federal  government.

We  obtained information on appropriations from the Disaster Relief  Appropriations Act, 2013 (Sandy Supplemental), and the information  related to the purposes of programs and activities from the Sandy  Supplemental and federal agency documents. We focused on describing  five federal programs that have the ability to support resilience-building  efforts and that are administered by four federal agencies that received  92 percent of the Sandy Supplemental.
