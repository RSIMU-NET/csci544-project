However, 6 of the 13 acquisition career fields, including 3 priority career fields\u2014contracting, business and engineering\u2014did not meet growth goals.", "DOD has completed workforce competency assessments for 12 of the 13 acquisition career fields and added training classes to address some skill gaps. It is unclear the extent to which skill gaps remain, in part because 10 of the career fields have not conducted follow-up competency assessments to gauge progress. DOD has not established time frames for doing so. Office of Personnel Management standards state that identifying skill gaps and monitoring progress towards addressing gaps are essential steps for effective human capital management.", "DOD has not updated its acquisition workforce plan, which would allow it to be better positioned to meet future needs. GAO's analysis of DOD budget information indicates that many career fields will continue to be significantly over or under the growth goals DOD established in 2010, especially in priority career fields such as contracting and engineering. In the past, some hiring decisions made by DOD components using the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund exceeded initial 2010 career field targets. In addition, over the past 7 years, about 2,700 personnel, or 26 percent of those hired with these funds, were in career fields that were not considered high priority in the 2010 acquisition workforce plan. An updated plan that includes revised career field goals, coupled with guidance on how to use the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund, could help DOD components focus future hiring efforts on priority career fields. Without an integrated approach, the department is at risk of using the funds to hire personnel in career fields that currently exceed their targets or are not considered a priority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD complete the remaining competency assessment, establish time frames for conducting follow-up assessments, issue an updated acquisition workforce plan, and issue guidance to prioritize the use of funding.

The contracts may be for major weapon systems, support  for military bases, consulting services, and commercial items, among  others. A skilled acquisition workforce is vital to maintaining military  readiness, increasing the department\u2019s buying power, and achieving  substantial long-term savings through systems engineering and  contracting activities.", "During the 1990s, as defense budgets decreased, DOD reduced the size  of its military and civilian acquisition workforce and by the early 2000s  began relying more heavily on contractors to perform many acquisition  support functions. DOD reported that between 1998 and 2008, the  number of military and civilian personnel performing acquisition activities  decreased 14 percent from about 146,000 to about 126,000 personnel.  Amid concerns about the skill gaps within the military and civilian  workforce and the growing reliance on contractors, the Secretary of  Defense announced his intention in April 2009 to rebalance the workforce  mix. DOD issued an acquisition workforce plan in April 2010 that specified  DOD would add 20,000 military and civilian personnel to its workforce by  fiscal year 2015 through hiring actions and converting contractor positions  to civilian or military positions. The 2010 acquisition workforce plan also  identified growth targets for each of DOD\u2019s 13 acquisition career fields  and included a process for assessing workforce competencies.", "This report examines DOD\u2019s efforts to rebuild its acquisition workforce.  We began this work in response to Section 1108 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which, as amended, requires DOD  to develop a strategy for improving DOD\u2019s civilian workforce, including a  plan specifically for DOD\u2019s military and civilian acquisition workforce, on a  biennial basis. The legislation also contained a provision for GAO to  assess plans that DOD was to submit between 2009 and 2012. DOD  issued a strategic workforce plan that included an appendix detailing the  plan for the acquisition workforce in April 2010; accordingly, we assessed  the plan and issued a report. DOD is currently developing an update to  the April 2010 acquisition workforce plan, but it is uncertain when it will be  issued. In the absence of an updated plan, we determined the extent to  which DOD has (1) increased the size of its acquisition workforce; (2)  identified workforce competencies and mitigated any skill gaps; and (3)  planned for future workforce needs.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has increased the size of its  acquisition workforce, which consists of both civilian and military  personnel, we collected acquisition workforce data for fiscal years 2008  through 2015 from DOD\u2019s DataMart, a central repository of workforce  data. We analyzed the data to determine whether DOD has met its overall  and individual career field growth targets and to identify workforce trends.  Because DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce plan addressed the department\u2019s  strategy to revitalize its acquisition workforce between fiscal years 2009  and 2015, we used workforce data from the end of fiscal year 2008 as a  baseline to conduct our analysis. In most cases we compared fiscal year  2008 data to March 2015 data. However, in some cases the most current  data DOD could provide was through the end of fiscal year 2014. We  noted whether we used fiscal year 2014 or March 2015 data as  appropriate in the report. To assess the reliability of DOD\u2019s DataMart  data, we (1) reviewed existing information about the data and the system  that produced them, (2) reviewed the data for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness, and (3) worked with agency officials to identify any  data problems. When we found discrepancies, we brought them to DOD\u2019s  attention and worked with DOD officials to correct the discrepancies. We  also interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report. We interviewed acquisition leaders in each of the military  departments and other defense agencies, collectively referred to in this  report as DOD components, to determine how the growth in the  acquisition workforce was achieved in their respective components.", "To determine the progress DOD has made to identify acquisition  workforce competencies and mitigate any skill gaps, we analyzed all  competency assessments that had been completed by October 2015. We  determined if career fields completed the process outlined in DOD\u2019s 2010  acquisition workforce plan and whether these efforts met the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s key principles for assessing the management  of human capital. We also interviewed leaders in six career fields, which  generally comprise the largest career fields and together make up 73  percent of the acquisition workforce, to obtain their insights into the  competency assessment process and challenges. The leaders we  interviewed were from the business; program management; contracting;  engineering; production, quality, and manufacturing; and test and  evaluation career fields. We identified new and revised training classes  offered by the Defense Acquisition University to address skill gaps, and  discussed efforts to develop proficiency standards with officials from the  Defense Acquisition University and the military departments as well as  some career field leaders.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has planned for future workforce  needs, we analyzed workforce and funding data submitted as a part of  the fiscal year 2016 president\u2019s budget submission and the planned  funding levels for the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund  for fiscal years 2015 through 2020. To assess the reliability of the  workforce and funding data, we (1) reviewed the data for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness; and (2) worked with DOD officials to identify  any data problems.

In 2002, we reported that DOD recognized  that human capital strategic planning is fundamental to effective overall  management. Further, we reported that DOD was working to identify and  address problems that have been hampering this effort, which included a  lack of accurate, accessible, and current workforce data; mature models  to forecast future workforce requirements; a link between DOD\u2019s planning  and budgeting processes; and specific planning guidance. In 2015, we  reported that DOD has demonstrated sustained leadership commitment  to address its acquisition workforce challenges, underscored by the  department\u2019s emphasis on growing and training the acquisition workforce  through its Better Buying Power initiatives.", "As part of our larger body of work examining human capital management  issues, we and the Office of Personnel Management have identified six  key principles of strategic workforce planning that organizations should  incorporate in their processes, including: aligning workforce planning with strategic planning and budget  formulation;  involving managers, employees, and other stakeholders in planning;  identifying critical gaps and competencies and analyzing workforce  gaps; developing workforce strategies to address gaps in numbers, skills, building the capabilities needed to support workforce strategies  through steps that ensure the effective use of human capital  flexibilities; and monitoring and evaluating progress toward achieving workforce  planning and strategic goals.", "Several offices within DOD play key roles in strategic planning activities,  such as determining the size and makeup of the acquisition workforce,  budgeting for the workforce, assessing workforce competencies, and  addressing skill gaps (see table 1).", "Pursuant to the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act, DOD  identified 13 career fields and designated acquisition-related positions  held by military or civilian personnel. DOD also established certification  requirements that included education, training, and experience elements  for each acquisition position. Certification is the procedure through which  DOD components determine that an employee meets these requirements  for one of three levels in each acquisition career field.", "DOD components fund their acquisition workforce personnel through a  variety of accounts, including (1) operation and maintenance; (2)  research, development, test and evaluation; and (3) working capital.  Additionally, Congress established the Defense Acquisition Workforce  Development Fund in 2008 to provide funds dedicated to recruiting,  training, and retaining the acquisition workforce. There are two boards  that oversee acquisition workforce programs, including the Fund and  related initiatives. The Senior Steering Board is expected to meet  quarterly and provide strategic oversight, while the Workforce  Management Group is expected to meet bimonthly and oversee the  fund\u2019s operations and management (see table 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Exceeded Its Overall Acquisition Workforce Growth Goal, but Shortfalls Exist in Several Career Fields", "paragraphs": ["DOD has increased the size of its workforce since September 2008,  exceeding its 20,000 personnel growth target by over 7,000 as of March  2015. The growth varied within individual components. For example, the  Air Force and Navy, as well as the other DOD agencies collectively, have  more acquisition personnel now than in fiscal year 2008. Conversely, the  Army has experienced an 8 percent decrease in the size of its acquisition  workforce since fiscal year 2008 due to Army-wide cost savings  measures that have impacted the size of the civilian workforce. The  reported increase in DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce was accomplished  through hiring of additional personnel, converting functions previously  performed by DOD contractors to performance by DOD civilian personnel  (referred to as insourcing), adding military personnel to the acquisition  workforce, and administratively recoding existing personnel, the last of  which does not result in an increase in DOD\u2019s workforce capacity.  Shortfalls, however, exist in certain career fields.

This equates to a nearly 27,000 personnel  increase and 7,000 personnel more than identified in DOD\u2019s April 2010  acquisition workforce plan. Figure 1 shows that most of this growth  occurred in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.", "Acquisition workforce growth outpaced losses between fiscal years 2008  and 2012. However, in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, the department  experienced a small decrease. During this time, DOD components were  faced with sequestration and other cost-cutting measures. In  preparation for these cuts, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics issued a memorandum in  September 2012 that specified that DOD components were to take a  strategic view in workforce decisions and protect the rebuilding  investments, especially in light of ongoing contractor support reductions.  For the most part, components were able to sustain the acquisition  growth levels they had already achieved, with the exception of the Army,  which lost several thousand personnel. In fiscal year 2015, each  component again experienced an increase, with the exception of the  Army. According to Army Defense Acquisition Career Management  officials, the Army\u2019s cost-cutting efforts have affected all aspects of Army  operations, including acquisition. Since 2008, the number of overall Army  military and civilian personnel has decreased by 91,000, or 12 percent,  from 790,000 to 699,000. The acquisition portion of this reduction was  almost 3,400 personnel.", "The department grew the acquisition workforce through a combination of  hiring and insourcing actions, as originally planned, as well as by adding  military personnel and administratively recoding existing positions. Figure  2 shows how DOD increased the acquisition workforce through fiscal year  2014, the most recent year for which DOD could provide complete data.", "About 72 percent of the workforce growth has been achieved through  hiring new civilian employees, with more than half of this increase  attributable to funds provided through the Defense Acquisition Workforce  Development Fund. Since 2009, DOD has spent about $1.8 billion from  the fund to recruit and hire about 10,400 new civilian employees. DOD  used the majority of the funding to pay their salaries for a 2- to 3-year  period, after which the components fund the personnel through their own  budget accounts. The hiring actions generally were in the career fields  that DOD indicated were a priority in the 2010 acquisition workforce plan.  For example, about three-quarters of all Defense Acquisition Workforce  Development Fund hiring was targeted toward five priority career fields\u2014 contracting, business, engineering, program management, and auditing\u2014 identified in DOD\u2019s April 2010 acquisition workforce plan. DOD  components used their own funds to hire the balance of the new civilian  and military employees identified in the figure above.", "Overall, insourcing accounted for about 14 percent of the workforce  growth. DOD originally planned to insource 10,000 contractor positions  for the acquisition workforce by fiscal year 2015. Components insourced  about 3,400 positions prior to a March 2011 revision to DOD\u2019s insourcing  policy. According to the memorandum revising the policy, which was  issued jointly by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics and the Under Secretary of Defense  Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer, a case-by-case approach would be  used for additional insourcing of acquisition functions based on critical  need, whether a function is inherently governmental, and the benefit  demonstrated by a cost-benefit analysis. DOD officials stated that the  revised policy effectively curtailed any additional efforts.", "Based on data provided by DOD\u2019s Human Capital Initiatives Directorate,  we estimate that recoding accounted for at least an 11 percent increase  in DOD\u2019s overall acquisition workforce. Acquisition officials stated that  administrative recoding efforts, which resulted in both increases and  decreases to the acquisition workforce, were made to ensure that all  acquisition personnel were properly accounted for within each component  and career field. According to acquisition officials, recoding was  necessary because some personnel were performing acquisition  functions the majority of the time, but were not counted as a part of the  acquisition workforce. These personnel generally continued to perform  the same duties and do not equate to an increase in the capacity of the  organization. The recoded personnel are required to meet acquisition  professional certification standards, including training, education, and  experience requirements. According to Human Capital Initiatives and  DOD component officials, recoding primarily occurred in three career  fields\u2014facilities engineering, life cycle logistics, and science and  technology manager. For example, Air Force Materiel Command  estimated that it recoded approximately 3,600 personnel at its  maintenance depots as acquisition personnel, some of which were  recoded to the life cycle logistics career field.", "Increases in the number of military positions accounted for 3 percent of  the workforce growth. According to Army and Air Force acquisition  officials, one of the primary reasons DOD increased the number of  military personnel serving in the acquisition workforce was to provide  increased capacity. Much of this growth was in the contracting career field  during contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Overall, Human Capital Initiatives statistics show that growth efforts have  helped DOD reshape the civilian workforce. In fiscal year 2008, DOD  found that about half of its civilian acquisition workforce had 10 years or  less before they were eligible for retirement, with far fewer mid-career  individuals ready to take their place or provide mentoring and supervision  to those workforce members who were early in their career. Defense  Acquisition Workforce Development Fund hiring has helped strategically  reshape the workforce by bolstering critical functions and building early  and mid-career workforce size. Although no specific goals were set, figure  3 shows the progress DOD has made increasing the number of early- career staff (those eligible to retire in 20 years or more) and mid-career  staff (those eligible to retire in 11 to 20 years).", "There have also been improvements in the training and qualifications of  the workforce. For example, the percent of the workforce that met  certification requirements increased from 58 percent to 79 percent  between fiscal years 2008 and 2014. In addition, the number of  acquisition personnel with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher increased from  77 to 83 percent. However, DOD still faces the challenge of an aging  workforce, as statistics also show that the average age of the workforce  has been static since 2008 at about 45 years, and the percentage of  retirement eligible personnel has remained at 17 percent. Defense  acquisition officials recognize the risks associated with the loss of very  experienced members of the acquisition workforce. These officials noted  they are concerned about retaining an adequate number of personnel in  the senior career group to provide leadership and continuity for the  workforce between 2020 and 2030."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth Goals Not Met in Some Priority Career Fields", "paragraphs": ["While DOD met the overall acquisition growth goal, it did not accomplish  the goals set for some career fields.

The  department did not, however, reach the targets in its growth plan for the  other 6 career fields by about 4,400 personnel, including the priority  career fields of contracting, business, and engineering (see figure 4).", "According to military department acquisition officials, shortfalls in  contracting and engineering career fields are largely the result of high  attrition rates and difficulty in hiring qualified personnel. Despite these  challenges, the engineering career field was within 1 percent of its hiring  goal. The business career field did not meet its overall growth goal in part  because of recoding actions that resulted in a loss to the career field,  greater than expected attrition, and Army cost-cutting efforts. Leaders in  some of these areas are trying to identify ways to complete activities  more efficiently to reduce the impact of shortfalls.

In a separate, but related, effort DOD has not yet  completed efforts to develop proficiency standards for the acquisition  career fields, which would ultimately allow leaders to measure employee  proficiency against standards that are specific to each career field.", "Contracting and auditing were the two career fields that were able to pair  supervisor and employee responses collected in competency  assessments to make observations about workforce proficiency. These  results helped senior leaders identify areas where the workforce did not  possess the same level of proficiency as supervisors expected.

The auditing career  field overhauled its training curriculum for new auditors to closely tie with  government auditing standards, which career field officials stated would  play a large role in addressing gaps in the auditing competencies. The  new hire curriculum consists of a 2-week onboarding session, followed by  a 2-week class in basic contract audit skills, plus another 2-week class  focused on applying the skills in specific types of audits.", "The other 10 career fields that completed a competency assessment  relied on staff self-assessments to make observations about workforce  proficiency because of low survey response rates, particularly by  supervisors. As a result, the Center for Naval Analysis, which conducted  surveys for these 10 career fields, generally stated in its reports that the  results were less verifiable because they were not validated against  supervisor responses and that leaders should exercise caution when  extrapolating the results. Overall response rates for these career fields  ranged from 13 to 37 percent. Five of the career field leaders we met with  stated that they used other reviews and input from functional integrated  product teams to complement the survey results and then worked with the  Defense Acquisition University to develop or update training classes. The  program management career field, for example, conducted two studies,  one in 2009 and another in 2014.

Specifically, the  components were told to responsibly sustain the acquisition workforce  size and make adjustments based on workload demand and  requirements.", "According to January 2015 workforce projections included in budget  exhibits that components developed for the fiscal year 2016 president\u2019s  budget, the components generally plan to maintain the current level and  composition of the civilian and military acquisition workforce through fiscal  year 2020, though individual components project slight shifts. For  example, these projections indicate that the Army plans to increase the  size of its acquisition workforce by almost 2.5 percent by predominantly  adding military personnel, while the Air Force projects a less than 1  percent decrease and the Navy projects a decrease of almost 2 percent.", "The other DOD components are planning to decrease the size of their  current workforces collectively by about 5 percent. However, Army  officials stated that in September 2015, the Army revised its projection. It  now estimates that its acquisition workforce will decrease by about 1,800,  or 5 percent, by fiscal year 2020 as a result of recent reductions to the  Army\u2019s entire military structure from fiscal year 2016 forward. According  to DOD guidance, the component budget exhibits contain estimates of the  number of authorized and funded acquisition workforce personnel through  the Future Years Defense Program. The estimates do not provide  information on components\u2019 workforce projected shortfalls.", "Our analysis of the budget exhibits shows that to maintain the overall size  of the workforce at around 150,000, DOD components collectively plan to  spend between $18.5 billion and $19.4 billion annually through fiscal year  2020. This funding will be used to pay acquisition workforce salaries,  benefits, training, and related workforce improvement initiatives. The total  amount includes about $500 million in planned funding annually for the  Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund, which will be used to  hire about 4,900 new employees through fiscal year 2020 to help sustain  the current size of the workforce and continue training and development  efforts. Budget documents also indicate, however, that many career fields  are projected to continue to be significantly over or under their original  growth targets identified in DOD\u2019s April 2010 acquisition workforce plan  (see figure 6).", "Our analysis of the PB-23 submissions indicates that eight career fields  will lose about 2,500 positions collectively between 2015 and 2020. One  of these career fields, life cycle logistics, is projected to lose almost 1,400  of these positions, but will still be significantly over the growth target  established in 2010. Five career fields are expected to grow by a total of  about 1,000 positions, with the majority of this growth in the contracting  and facilities engineering career fields. The growth expected between  2015 and 2020 will allow purchasing to meet its initial growth target.  Despite this projected growth, however, four of the priority career fields\u2014 contracting, business, engineering, and audit\u2014will remain under the April  2010 growth targets.", "Further, concerns about the levels of contracting and engineering  personnel were expressed by officials at each of the three major  acquisition commands we met with\u2014Air Force Materiel Command, Army  Materiel Command, and Naval Sea Systems Command. For example,", "Air Force Materiel Command has not been able to hire enough  personnel to offset a 10 percent attrition rate in the contracting career  field, according to career field leaders. It also has shortfalls in  engineering personnel, which requires multiple programs to share  engineers with particular technical expertise. The command manages  personnel shortfalls by assessing risks for its programs and then  reallocating staff from programs that are considered to have less risk  to new programs or programs that have more risk. Command officials  cited several reasons for the shortfalls. First, since fiscal year 2013,  the command has initiated 19 new acquisition programs without  budgeting for the civilian and military personnel needed to adequately  support the entire portfolio of the command\u2019s programs. Second,  command officials noted that they have lost some military and civilian  acquisition personnel due to DOD-wide cuts in operation and  maintenance funding accounts from which these personnel are paid.  Finally, officials stated that the command has made cuts to the  contractor workforce that more than offset the growth in the military  and civilian acquisition workforce to date.", "Army Materiel Command officials stated that the command is currently  experiencing shortfalls in the contracting career field and the shortfall  is expected to reach about 800 personnel by fiscal year 2020. The  shortfalls are the result of several cost-cutting actions taken by the  Army since fiscal year 2011 to implement mandated reductions and  caps on future spending. For example, the command\u2019s contracting  organization was only able to fund about 3,600 of its authorized 4,000  positions. Officials from that organization stated that they have moved  over $100 million in contract actions from overburdened contracting  offices to other contracting offices within the command that have  additional capacity. Officials estimate that they can only mitigate the  impact of about one-third of planned reductions through workload  realignments and process changes. In addition, the command has  taken on several new missions without gaining additional resources,  including contingency contract administration services that were  previously performed by the Defense Contract Management Agency  and lead responsibility for contracting in Afghanistan, which was  previously provided through a joint contracting organization assigned  to U.S. Central Command.", "Naval Sea Systems Command officials stated that the command is  experiencing shortfalls in the contracting and engineering career  fields, and they are projecting additional shortfalls by fiscal year 2020.  One metric the command is tracking to assess contracting workload  shows that the number of new contract awards that are delayed into  the next fiscal year was approximately 100 for fiscal year 2015. This  includes the contract award for the Navy\u2019s Own Ship Monitoring  System, a technology for submarine sonar systems, as well as the  Aegis Weapon System Modernization production upgrades. The  number of new contract awards that are delayed into the next fiscal  year is expected to grow to about 430 contracts by fiscal year 2020 as  a result of workload increases and shortfalls in the contracting career  field. Command officials expect current shortfalls in contracting  personnel to be exacerbated by DOD-wide cuts to civilian personnel.", "In addition, Naval Sea Systems Command engineering officials said  that one-third of the command\u2019s technical specifications and  standards, which serve as the fleet\u2019s instructional manual on routine  ship maintenance, have not been reviewed in the past 20 years. They  said that the backlog of specification and standard reviews indirectly  contributed to two failures within 5 years of the main reduction gears  on a Navy destroyer\u2014a warship that provides multi-mission offensive  and defensive capabilities. The failures resulted from an industry  change in oil composition that was not addressed by corresponding  changes to the Navy\u2019s maintenance standards for the ship.", "In general, command officials could not provide validated data on the  extent of current workforce shortfalls, but each military department is  developing models to help better project acquisition program needs and  quantify potential shortfalls. Specifically:", "The Air Force Materiel Command pilot-tested an updated Air Force  workforce model in 2015 to assist with personnel planning over the life  cycle of a program based on factors such as type of program and life  cycle phase. The model projects that the command will have a  shortfall of over 1,300 military and civilian acquisition positions by  fiscal year 2017, and nearly 1,900 positions by fiscal year 2021.  Command officials are working closely with acquisition program  managers to validate program needs and to identify weaknesses in  the model. Additional functionality is expected to be added over the  next several years that will allow the command to target hiring to fill  specific workforce gaps. For example, instead of soliciting applications  for engineers in general, the command could more specifically target  materials engineers.", "The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology is in the process of developing personnel planning  models that will better allow organizations to forecast their manpower  requirements. The program management model was approved by the  Army Manpower Analysis Agency and is beginning to be used by  program managers. Army Materiel Command officials expect a new  contracting model to be available for use later in fiscal year 2016.  Additional models for research and development and test and  evaluation are also being planned.", "Naval Sea Systems Command officials stated that they are in the  process of developing career field-specific tools to, among other  things, forecast needs, help identify skill gaps, and create demand  signals for career development opportunities. No date was provided  for when these tools will be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have an Updated Acquisition Workforce Strategy or Guidance on the Use of Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Funds to Help Focus Future Hiring Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not issued an updated acquisition workforce strategy to help  guide future hiring decisions. According to Human Capital Initiatives  officials, budget uncertainties have been the primary reason for the delay.  The Director of Human Capital Initiatives noted that senior DOD and  military department leadership regularly discuss the state of the  acquisition workforce and its capacity to address emerging needs and  challenges. The Director also noted that similar discussions occur at  various levels within DOD components. As a result, the Director stated  that while the size and composition of the workforce differs from what was  called for in DOD\u2019s 2010 acquisition workforce plan, DOD\u2019s current and  projected workforce largely reflect the decisions made during these  discussions. However, according to acquisition officials we met with, DOD  components and sub-components make thousands of individual hiring  decisions, based not only on the need to obtain critical skills, but to also  sustain growth already achieved in a career field, address emerging  issues, and meet other priorities. Human Capital Initiatives officials said  that they are working to issue an updated acquisition workforce plan in  2016.  10 U.S.C. Section 115b requires that DOD issue a biennial acquisition  workforce strategy that, among other things, assesses the appropriate  mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities and includes  a plan of action to meet department goals. Further, as we have previously  reported, issuing a workforce strategy and an associated plan of action is  crucial for DOD to effectively and efficiently manage its civilian workforce  during times of budgetary and fiscal constraint. For example, continuing  cuts to operation and maintenance budget accounts and efforts to reduce  headquarters spending by 20 percent over the next few years could result  in additional reductions to acquisition workforce positions in some career  fields. In addition, Section 955 of the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2013 requires DOD to plan to achieve civilian and service  contractor workforce savings that are not less than the savings in funding  for military personnel achieved from reductions in military strength, which  could also affect the size of the acquisition workforce. DOD may also be  faced with another round of sequestration cuts, which could result in  hiring freezes or workforce reductions. Without issuing an updated  workforce strategy, as statutorily required, DOD may not be positioned to  meet future acquisition needs.", "Aligning the use of the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund  to high priority workforce needs is also crucial. In the past, some hiring  decisions made by DOD components using the Defense Acquisition  Workforce Development Fund exceeded initial 2010 career field targets.  In addition, over the past 7 years, about 2,700 personnel, or 26 percent of  those hired with these funds, were in career fields that were not  considered high priority in the 2010 acquisition workforce plan. For  example, funds were used to hire about 850 personnel for the life cycle  logistics career field that is significantly over its growth target. To focus  use of the funds, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,  Logistics and Technology issued guidance in March 2013 that identified  critical career field priorities for the future acquisition workforce and  emphasized the need to balance critical acquisition skills needed with  other personnel requirements during times of constrained budgets and  limited personnel resources. In fiscal year 2014, the Assistant Secretary  of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition directed that 75  percent of Navy\u2019s hiring using these funds should be in priority career  fields such as contracting, engineering, and business. The Air Force has  not issued similar guidance on how to target hiring efforts to meet critical  needs.", "Section 1705 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires the Human Capital  Initiatives Directorate to issue guidance for the administration of the  Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund. The guidance is to  identify areas of need in the acquisition workforce, including changes to  the types of skills needed. The Director of Human Capital Initiatives told  us, however, that while key stakeholders involved in acquisition workforce  planning, such as the Senior Steering Board and defense acquisition  career managers, discuss areas of need in the workforce, the office does  not issue guidance on how DOD components should prioritize their hiring  decisions. Without clearly linking the use of these funds with the strategic  goals of the department, components may continue to over-hire in some  career fields and not be able to adequately meet critical acquisition  program needs in other career fields."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has focused much needed attention on rebuilding its acquisition  workforce and has used the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development  Fund to increase hiring and provide for additional training that supports  this effort. This is especially noteworthy given that the department faced  sequestration and other cost-cutting pressures over the past several  years.", "Now that the department has surpassed its overall growth goals and has  moved into a workforce sustainment mode, the 2010 acquisition  workforce plan needs to be updated. Focus should now be placed on  reshaping career fields to ensure that the most critical acquisition needs  are being met. DOD attempted to strategically reshape its acquisition  workforce with the 2010 acquisition workforce plan, but fell short in  several priority career fields, including contracting and engineering. An  updated plan that includes revised career field goals, coupled with  guidance on how to use the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development  Fund, could help DOD components focus future hiring efforts on priority  career fields. Without an integrated approach, the department is at risk of  using the funds to hire personnel in career fields that currently exceed  their targets or are not considered a priority.", "DOD has also made progress in identifying career field competencies, but  additional steps are needed to complete this effort. For example, the  production, quality, and manufacturing career field has yet to complete its  initial competency assessment and DOD has not established time frames  to conduct follow-up assessments for the other career fields so that it can  determine if skill gaps are being addressed. Office of Personnel  Management standards state that identifying skill gaps and monitoring  progress towards addressing gaps are essential steps for effective human  capital management.
