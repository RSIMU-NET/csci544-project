In fiscal year 2017, NSF had a total budget of $7.5 billion, and  according to NSF, over 90 percent of its appropriated funds directly  support research and education. For example, in fiscal year 2017, NSF  funded awards to support research on improving earthquake predictions,  programs for increasing the number of students in science fields, and  translation and online dissemination of scholarly research as a resource  for scientists, historians, and educators. NSF makes these awards to  institutions of higher education (universities), K-12 school systems,  industry, science associations, and other organizations involved in  research.", "For most awards, NSF reimburses awardees for both direct and indirect  costs incurred. Direct costs, such as salaries for employees working on  NSF-supported projects and costs for leasing equipment, can be  attributed to a specific project. Indirect costs are not directly attributable to  a specific project but are necessary for the general operation of an  organization receiving an award. Such costs can include depreciation on  buildings and equipment; the costs of operating and maintaining facilities;  and general administration and expenses, such as salaries and expenses  for management, personnel administration, and accounting.", "To be reimbursed for indirect costs, organizations must properly identify  and claim reimbursement for these costs in accordance with applicable  federal guidance. The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit  Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and NSF  implementing policy govern how NSF is to reimburse indirect costs.", "For an organization to be reimbursed for indirect costs on an award under  the Uniform Guidance and federal regulations, the entity generally must  have a negotiated and approved indirect cost rate (ICR) agreement with  either the federal agency that funded the award or with another federal  agency. The negotiation and approval process begins when an  organization submits an ICR proposal and supporting documentation  such as audited financial statements and a cost policy statement.  Generally, to calculate the proposed rate, an organization divides its total  indirect costs by the total direct costs across all of the organization\u2019s  federal awards for a particular time period. After receiving a rate proposal,  the federal agency reviews it, determines the reasonableness of  proposed costs, and negotiates a formal ICR agreement with the  organization. This agreement sets the rate for a 1-to-4-year period. The  ICR is then applied to each of an organization\u2019s federal awards for the  period to allocate its indirect costs for those awards. For example, an  organization with direct costs of $800,000 for an award and an ICR of 25  percent would get an additional $200,000 for indirect costs, for a total  award of $1 million. The rate applies to all of the organization\u2019s federal  awards that are eligible for indirect costs during the period, even if some  of the awards are made by agencies other than the one that negotiated  the ICR.", "Under the Uniform Guidance, the federal agency that negotiates and  approves an ICR agreement with an organization is designated as the  cognizant agency. For nonprofit organizations, the Uniform Guidance  assigns cognizance to the federal agency with the largest dollar value of federal awards to an organization unless different arrangements are  agreed to by the federal agencies concerned. As of February 2017, NSF  had cognizance over about 110 organizations, mostly nonprofit and  professional societies, museums, and operators of large shared-use  facilities (such as accelerators, telescopes, and research vessels) that get  the largest dollar value of their federal awards from NSF. However, NSF  does not have cognizance for universities. For universities, the Uniform  Guidance assigns cognizance to the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense (DOD), depending on  whether HHS or DOD provided more funds to the university for the most  recent 3 years.", "Within NSF, the Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Branch (CAAR) has  the primary responsibility for reviewing ICR proposals and negotiating  ICR agreements with organizations for which NSF has cognizance. In  addition, in fiscal year 2009 NSF entered into an interagency agreement  with the Department of Interior\u2019s (Interior) Business Center. Under this  agreement, the Business Center reviews proposals and negotiates ICR  agreements for selected organizations for which NSF has cognizance.  According to an NSF official, NSF entered into the agreement because  the agency was behind on rate negotiations and needed assistance in  addressing the backlog, while Interior had established processes and  procedures, as well as staff trained to negotiate the ICRs on behalf of  other federal agencies.", "In prior reports, we have raised concerns about the growth of indirect  costs and the process for setting ICRs at the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) within HHS. In September 2013, we found that reimbursements for  indirect costs increased faster than those for direct costs on NIH research  grants awarded to universities for fiscal years 2002 through 2012. We  recommended that NIH assess the impact of growth in indirect costs on  its mission, including, as necessary, planning for how to deal with  potential future increases in indirect costs that could limit the amount of  funding available for total research. HHS agreed with our  recommendation and has provided information on actions taken by NIH to  implement it; however, the actions have not fully addressed the  recommendation. In September 2016, we identified deficiencies in  cognizant agencies\u2019 design of internal controls for setting ICRs for  organizations that received NIH awards. These deficiencies increased the  risk that rates used by NIH would include inappropriate indirect costs and  result in federal agencies paying more than their share of the  organizations\u2019 indirect costs. We recommended improving controls over  NIH\u2019s ICR process, such as developing detailed procedures for the  completion and documentation of supervisory review of the ICR  negotiation process. NIH concurred with our recommendations and  described ongoing and planned actions to implement them.", "You asked us to review the amount of NSF funding for science research  and education that goes to indirect costs and NSF\u2019s processes for  negotiating ICRs.

Our analyses of indirect costs were based on budgeted  indirect cost data because NSF does not collect data from awardees  about their actual indirect costs on awards.", "To assess the reliability of the data, we traced a selection of summary- level data elements for fiscal year 2016 (e.g., summary indirect and direct  costs) back to the record-level data on individual NSF awards and  determined that the data were consistent between the two sources,  including confirming that the data contained no outliers in the data fields  we used. We interviewed NSF officials knowledgeable about the  budgetary management system used to generate the indirect cost data  provided to us, discussed variations in and the reliability of the data, and  reviewed available documentation. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for purposes of presenting data on the total amount of  NSF awards that were budgeted for indirect costs over time.", "To further analyze what is known about indirect costs on NSF awards  over time, we interviewed NSF officials about factors that can cause  variation in indirect costs from year to year. We also analyzed the record- level data on individual awards from fiscal year 2016 to determine the  extent of differences, if any, in the indirect costs of awards for different  disciplinary fields and types of organizations receiving the awards. Finally,  we reviewed NSF\u2019s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide  and other agency documents on its policies and procedures for indirect  costs.", "To determine the extent to which NSF has implemented guidance for  setting ICRs for organizations over which it has cognizance, we  interviewed NSF officials and reviewed the Uniform Guidance related to  the setting of ICRs. Using the Uniform Guidance, we identified key control  activities that agencies are to use for determining allowable, allocable,  and reasonable indirect costs and methods for allocating such costs to  federally funded research grants in the ICR setting process. We  compared the control activities identified in the Uniform Guidance to  NSF\u2019s internal guidance, such as the Indirect Cost Rate Proposal Review  Standing Operating Guidance (May 2013).", "To examine how NSF has applied its internal guidance, we reviewed  reports from NSF\u2019s Monitoring Tracking Database (MTD) and selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 9 out of 22 rate agreement case files\u20147 files  that were negotiated by NSF and 2 by Interior. To select the  nongeneralizable sample, we identified the total population of rate  proposals received and closed in fiscal year 2016 and stratified the  population by amount of award funding (i.e., high, medium, and low). We  then selected three rate agreement case files from each of the  populations. To understand the extent to which NSF applied its internal  guidance, we reviewed documentation contained in the rate agreement  case files, such as ICR proposals, rate agreements, and trend analysis. In  doing so, we determined whether NSF staff had performed the following  key control activities: (1) verifying that the proposal contained the  required documentation and was submitted on time; (2) validating and  recalculating the ICR information; and, (3) reviewing and approving the  negotiated rates. After our review of the nine rate agreement case files,  we interviewed NSF and Interior staff to clarify our understanding of the  rate setting process and how the process is documented in the rate  agreement case files. Our findings are not generalizable to those rate  agreements we did not review, although they provide illustrative examples  of rate agreement case files.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2016 to September 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Proposal Analysis and Rate Negotiation: This stage consists of  steps for reconciling total expenditures in the financial statements with  the total expenditures in the indirect cost proposal, reviewing indirect  costs, verifying unallowable costs, preparing a trend analysis  (including the organization\u2019s indirect costs and rates for the previous 2  years, if available), and negotiating the indirect rate with the awardee.  3.  Rate Approval and Issuance: This stage consists of steps for  approving the indirect rate, preparing and transmitting the rate  agreement to the awardee for signature, and closing out the proposal  review by updating the MTD and filing working papers in appropriate  files.", "Additionally, NSF\u2019s internal guidance includes tools to assist awardees in  preparing ICR proposals and to expedite NSF\u2019s review process.

In addition, when an  entity engages an external party to perform certain operational processes,  management retains responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of  internal control activities performed by the external party. NSF has  engaged an external party to provide assistance in negotiating ICRs.  Specifically, in 2009, NSF entered into an interagency agreement with  Interior to negotiate ICRs for a portion of the awardees for which NSF has  cognizance. For the first 10 months of fiscal year 2017, Interior had  negotiated ICRs for approximately 33 percent of the awardees for which  NSF had cognizance. According to NSF officials, Interior, acting as an  agent for NSF, has the responsibility for reviewing ICR proposals and  setting ICRs directly with awardees, following OMB requirements. In addition, NSF\u2019s internal guidance states that Interior will set ICRs in  accordance with NSF protocols.", "However, according to NSF officials and internal guidance, Interior\u2019s  approval and signing of ICRs are largely independent of NSF, and in  addition, NSF conducts limited monitoring of the ICRs that Interior  negotiates. For example, NSF officials said that they review monthly  summaries of rates negotiated by Interior and completed rate agreements  and that on request, they meet with Interior\u2019s supervisors and participate  in problem resolution. However, they do not review Interior\u2019s ICR files,  such as checking the adequacy of documentation submitted by awardees  or the accuracy and reasonableness of the calculations and resulting  rates proposed by the awardee.", "NSF officials stated that it was their understanding that by entering into  the interagency agreement, they delegated the authority for performing  ICR proposal reviews and setting ICRs to Interior. However, under  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, NSF still  retains cognizance and oversight responsibilities for the ICRs set by  Interior. By including procedures in its internal guidance for overseeing  work performed by Interior, NSF could ensure that the ICRs set by Interior  comply with federal guidance and NSF protocols."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Setting ICRs in accordance with federal guidance is important to ensuring  that federal agencies do not pay more than their share of awardees\u2019  indirect costs. NSF has developed internal guidance to help ensure that  ICRs are set appropriately, and NSF staff follow many parts of the  guidance. However, staff have not consistently followed the guidance for  using certain tools and templates for setting ICRs or guidance for  updating the agency\u2019s database to reflect the status of awardees and  their ICR proposals\u2014for example, because NSF has not yet required  them to do so. Details on supervisory activities are also not included in  the guidance, including the criteria used by the supervisor for assessing  the risk level of a proposal and determining specific steps for mitigating  risks, and steps supervisors take for their reviews of work performed to  set ICRs. Additionally, the guidance does not include procedures  necessary to carry out new provisions of the Uniform Guidance and to  monitor the ICRs set by Interior on NSF\u2019s behalf to ensure that they  comply with federal guidance and NSF protocols. NSF officials described  ways that staff implement these procedures even though the procedures  are not fully detailed or included in guidance. However, including the  missing details and procedures in NSF\u2019s internal guidance, and requiring  staff to follow the guidance, could help NSF ensure that staff properly and  consistently negotiate ICRs and that the rates negotiated comply with  applicable federal guidance, which in turn would help ensure that the  funding provided for indirect costs does not unnecessarily limit the  amount available for research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to NSF:  The Director of NSF should require staff to follow written internal  guidance for (1) using tools and templates NSF has developed for the  process for setting indirect cost rates and (2) updating the agency\u2019s  database to reflect the status of awardees for which NSF has cognizance  and of indirect cost rate proposals.
