This report examines (1) economic trends in the CNMI and (2) trends in  the composition of the CNMI workforce, including the ratio of United  States workers to foreign workers in the CNMI during the previous 5  calendar years.", "To examine the trends in the CNMI economy, we reviewed prior GAO  reports and we obtained and analyzed data from the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) of the CNMI, including contributions to GDP by select  industries, for calendar years 2007 through 2018. We converted the GDP  figures from 2009 base year dollars to 2018 base year dollars. We also  obtained and analyzed data on visitor arrivals from the Marianas Visitor  Authority for fiscal years 2005 through 2019. We compared the data  against data we have previously reported. As it relates to visitor arrivals,  we discussed with officials from the Mariana Visitors Authority whether  Super Typhoon Yutu disrupted the collection of data. All data were  deemed reliable for our purposes. To examine the CNMI casinos, we  reviewed annual reports from the Saipan casino operator, U.S. and CNMI  government documents, press releases and news reports. We also  interviewed CNMI government officials from the Departments of Finance  and Labor, the Commonwealth Casino Commission, and a casino  representative in Saipan, and reviewed documents from U.S. government  agencies, to understand potential challenges that could affect the CNMI  economy.", "To examine the trends in the CNMI workforce, we obtained and analyzed  data from the CNMI government and the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS). Specifically:", "We obtained summary level tax data from the CNMI government on  December 18, 2019, which included information on the number of  workers in the CNMI and their citizenship, to examine the ratio  between United States and foreign workers in the CNMI workforce.  These data were compiled by the CNMI Department of Finance, and  were rolled up to provide counts of workers based on the workers\u2019  reported citizenship. The data available for inclusion in this report do  not match the definition of United States worker established in the  2018 Act. The Act defines a United States worker as any worker who  is: a citizen or national of the United States; an alien who has been  lawfully admitted for permanent residence; or a citizen of the Marshall  Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau  who has been lawfully admitted to the United States pursuant to their  respective compacts of free association. In 2018, the CNMI  government began collecting data on worker visa status recorded on  employee tax documents filed by the employer. But about one-third of  collected tax forms did not include information about the visa type or  status of the worker. Therefore, with incomplete data, we could not  identify people lawfully admitted for permanent residence who remain  foreign citizens. The summary-level citizenship data have been used  in prior GAO reports. We reviewed those reports to ensure that the  data were being collected using the same procedures as in the past,  and we were using the data in the same manner. We also interviewed  knowledgeable CNMI officials about the data collection methods and  how the data were extracted from CNMI government data systems,  and checked available documentation from those prior GAO reports to  confirm our use of them. We found the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes of summarizing the numbers of United States  workers and foreign workers.", "We obtained record-level data (such as worker\u2019s name, worker\u2019s date  of birth, and petition receipt number) from DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS) for fiscal years 2012 through 2019 to  examine CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) program information  on workers since the program began. We compared the annual  number of approved CW-1 permits with the annual numerical limit, or  cap, on CW-1 permits that USCIS set for fiscal years 2012 through  2019. Using computerized algorithms, we analyzed the data for key  characteristics of workers who were granted CW-1 permits, such as  years of continuous employment in the CNMI. To assess the reliability  of the USCIS data, we tested the data electronically to identify and  resolve inconsistencies in personally identifiable information for permit  holders and to ensure accuracy in tracking these individuals over  time, and we discussed our results with USCIS officials. We have  previously used the same methods for assessing the reliability of this  data, and USCIS had agreed with that methodology. We determined  that the USCIS data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  reporting on characteristics of CW-1 permit holders for fiscal year  2019 and for identifying trends over time.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2019 to February 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Emil Friberg (Assistant Director),  Joshua Akery, Kathryn H.
