SSBCI provides funding to strengthen state and municipal programs that support lending to small businesses. Under the act, GAO is required to conduct an audit of both programs annually. GAO's first reports were on the programs' implementation and made recommendations. This second report examines (1) the status of Treasury's efforts to monitor participants' compliance with program requirements under SBLF and SSBCI, (2) the status of SBLF's and SSBCI's small business lending, and (3) Treasury's evaluation of SBLF and SSBCI and communication of outcomes to Congress and interested parties.

In response to GAO's previous recommendation on SBLF monitoring, Treasury has developed procedures for monitoring SBLF participant compliance with legal and reporting requirements. Treasury also issued standards to provide states with best practices for reviewing participants' compliance with SSBCI's legal and policy requirements and developed procedures for sampling transaction-level data to evaluate the accuracy of the states' SSBCI annual reports.", "As of June 30, 2012, SBLF participants had increased their business lending over the 2010 baseline. The median SBLF participant had a 31 percent increase in total business lending and a 14 percent increase for small business loans under $1 million, according to GAO's analysis. For SSBCI, states had used about 10 percent of the funds as of June 30, 2012. The act provides Treasury with authority to terminate funds that have not been allocated to states within 2 years of Treasury's approval of the state's participation in SSBCI. However, Treasury has not yet developed a formal written policy explaining what actions it will take if SSBCI participants have not met the requirements to receive their full allocation of funds within the 2-year time frame. Treasury officials said that they currently have no plans to use this authority but retain the ability to do so in the future. Nevertheless, formal guidelines on how Treasury will use this authority could help ensure consistent use of the authority if used in the future and provide clarity to states about the consequences of not using the funds in a timely manner.", "Treasury has taken steps to evaluate SBLF's and SSBCI's performance but could enhance public reporting of program outcome information. In a quarterly report to Congress, Treasury compares business lending in SBLF participants to a large comparison group that it adjusted for certain aspects of bank size and geography. GAO's analysis using a peer group that was adjusted for financial health as well geography and size showed that in nearly every case, the difference in total business lending growth was somewhat smaller than in Treasury's analysis. Treasury considered using a more refined peer group that adjusted for these factors but judged that the differences were not significant. However, Treasury did not disclose these options in the report or explain why the larger comparison group was chosen, which compromised the transparency of Treasury's methodology. Furthermore, Treasury's approach did not isolate the impact of SBLF from other factors that could affect lending, as GAO recommended in its first SBLF report. Treasury officials said they are continuing to explore evaluation approaches, including collecting additional data from a survey of SBLF institutions. In response to GAO's 2011 recommendation on SSBCI performance measures, Treasury has designed performance measures, such as the amount of private leverage states have achieved with SSBCI funds. However, Treasury has not yet developed a way to make this performance information public. Treasury shares information with the states through conferences and technical assistance, but performance information could help Congress and the states to better understand the effectiveness of SSBCI's various programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Treasury should develop a policy on how it will use its authority to terminate SSBCI funds.

In addition, in our 2011 report, we reported that the lack of clarity by  Treasury in explaining the program\u2019s requirements created confusion  among applications and Treasury faced multiple delays in implementing  the SBLF program and disbursing SBLF funds by the statutory deadline  of September 27, 2011.", "The amount of funding a bank received under the SBLF program  depended on its asset size as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar  year 2009.

A CAP is a loan  portfolio insurance program wherein the borrower and lender, such as a  small business owner and a bank, contribute to a reserve fund held by the  lender. Under a CAP, when a participating lender originates a loan, the  lender and borrower combine to contribute an amount equal to a  percentage of the loan to a loan reserve fund, which is held by the lender.  Under SSBCI, the contribution must be from 2 percent to 7 percent of the  amount borrowed. Typically, the contribution ranges from 3 percent to 4  percent.

States  had received and used funds at differing levels, but some states were  concerned that Treasury may take actions to suspend disbursements  after participants have been in the program for more than 2 years.  Treasury has the authority to terminate disbursements to SSBCI  participants who have not met the requirements to receive their full  allocation within 2 years of having been accepted into the program.   Treasury has not yet developed a policy that reflects how it will use this  authority even though this 2-year period will end for most states sometime  in 2013.

This number includes a $1.5 billion increase over the  prior quarter. Further, Treasury reported that 89 percent of participants  had increased their qualified small business lending over baseline levels  and about 76 percent of participants had increased their qualified small  business lending by 10 percent or more. As previously discussed, SBLF  uses a dividend or interest rate incentive structure to encourage  participating institutions to increase qualified small business lending.  SBLF participants paid an average dividend or interest rate of 2.1 percent  on their SBLF funds as of June 30, 2012. Over half of SBLF participants  paid a dividend or interest rate of 1 percent on their SBLF funds\u2014 because their qualified small business lending growth was 10 percent or  higher\u2014and 15 percent of institutions paid 5 percent or more (see  fig. 1).", "SBLF participants also showed increases in small business loans under  $1 million, as well as total business lending. While the Small Business  Jobs Act set the threshold for qualified small business lending at $10  million, depository institutions are required to submit Call Reports with  detailed financial information including small business lending, which the  reports define as loans under $1 million. Such data are useful for  comparing certain small business lending of SBLF participants with that of  institutions that did not participate in SBLF.which includes all business loans, including loans over $10 million and   Total business lending\u2014 those to businesses with over $50 million in revenue\u2014can also help  illustrate differences in lending activity between these two groups.", "Treasury uses total business lending in its reporting to compare SBLF  participants to non-SBLF institutions and noted that qualified small  business lending makes up a large part of total business lending for SBLF  participants. For example, qualified small business lending totaled 95  percent of total business lending for the median SBLF participant as of  December 31, 2011.", "SBLF participants increased both small business loans under $1 million  as well as total business lending. In particular, the median SBLF  participant had a 31 percent increase in total business lending for the  quarter ending June 30, 2012, over the baseline level. The median  SBLF participant had a 14 percent increase for small business loans  under $1 million over the same period. When categorizing SBLF  participants by the changes in their lending, the SBLF participants fell into  the higher growth categories for total business lending, but were more  evenly distributed for small business loans under $1 million except for  participants whose lending increased over 40 percent (see fig. 2).", "About half of SBLF participants used their program funds to repay and  exit TARP\u2019s CPP. These CPP refinance participants had noticeably lower  lending growth than SBLF participants that did not participate in CPP (see  fig. 3). In particular, CPP refinance participants increased small business  loans under $1 million by 5 percent compared with 33 percent for non- CPP participants. For total business lending, CPP refinance participants  saw increases of 17 percent compared with 45 percent for non-CPP  participants. Treasury officials said that one possible reason for this  difference is that CPP refinance participants were only eligible for a  limited amount of incremental SBLF funds, beyond the amount of CPP  funds refinanced. As a result, unlike other SBLF participants, these  institutions did not receive as much \u201cnew\u201d capital to increase small  business lending. Nevertheless, all SBLF participants are subject to the  same incentive structure based on the dividend or interest rate.  Furthermore, Treasury officials also noted that in many instances the  CPP refinance participants may have already experienced an increase in  lending from the CPP capital they originally received.", "As of June 30, 2012, Treasury had transferred $468 million in SSBCI  funding to the states, representing about one-third of the $1.5 billion that  was set aside for the program.

Loan participation programs  accounted for 47 percent of the funds used, as of June 30, 2012, followed  by venture capital programs (28 percent), collateral support programs (17  percent), and loan guarantee programs (6 percent), as shown in figure 4.  The remaining program categories\u2014capital access programs, direct  lending, and other\u2014combined for the remaining 2 percent of funds used.", "Participating states have received and used SSBCI funds at differing  levels, partially because of when applications were approved and funds  were allocated (see fig. 5). Of the 53 states, territories, or municipalities  that received SSBCI funding, 47 had used a proportion of their funds as  of June 30, 2012. Montana had the highest proportion used of the amount  that Treasury had allocated, as of June 30, 2012. States we interviewed  said that disbursing funds was much faster for state programs that were  in existence before SSBCI because the infrastructure was already in  place and lenders were already familiar with the programs.

One state official told us that because their programs are  relatively new and lending institutions are unfamiliar with them, the 2-year  time frame is too tight for lenders to make informed decisions about  participating in the program. Similarly, officials from two states told us that  the 2-year time frame for disbursing the SSBCI funds is short because  their state small business programs were newly created.", "According to Treasury officials, Treasury is aware of the 2-year time  frame and the potential concerns of the states. After reviewing the law,  Treasury officials told us that the Secretary has discretion on whether or  not to revoke the undisbursed allocation if it has not been transferred to a  participating state as of the 2-year anniversary. According to Treasury  officials, they have not drafted a policy or procedures on what actions  they may implement if the states miss the 2-year time frame for their final  disbursement of funds. However, they told us that the states were  encouraged to describe in their applications how they would disburse the  funds within the 2-year time frame and that they advised the states of the  importance of meeting the 2-year time frame.

At an  October 2012 conference attended by many SSBCI participants,  according to Treasury staff, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Small  Business, Community Development, and Affordable Housing Policy told  the participants that Treasury did not currently plan to exercise this  authority in the near future. However, these statements are not currently  documented in a written or formal policy statement explaining its position.  Treasury staff told us when Treasury develops a policy on its  discretionary authority, it will provide all participants with sufficient lead  time so that they can modify or adjust their programs, as necessary.  Treasury officials told us that the purpose of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary\u2019s conference announcement was to address the concern and  clarify that Treasury would not be taking action at this time if an SSBCI  participant had not met the 2-year requirement and to affirm that Treasury  retains its discretionary authority going forward.", "In prior work, we have recommended that when states are required to  spend federal funds to meet a statutory deadline or specific program  requirements, agencies should provide guidance to the states on what  they should expect if they are unable to meet the deadline.

In its analysis, Treasury adjusted the comparison group  for a number of factors, including an institution\u2019s asset size and  geography, thereby excluding institutions that fell outside the asset size  range of SBLF participants and that were headquartered in states that did  not have an institution participating in SBLF.helpful step in understanding the possible effects of SBLF funding.  However, Treasury did not adjust its comparison group to better ensure  that its distribution among various asset sizes and states mirrored that of  SBLF participants. Moreover, Treasury did not adjust its comparison  group to account for differences in financial health despite requiring SBLF  applicants to demonstrate a certain degree of financial health before  approving them for funding. For example, the act specifically restricted  Treasury from accepting applications from institutions that were on or  recently removed from the FDIC problem bank list. Because the  comparison group did not exclude such institutions that were unable to  qualify for SBLF funding, these institutions may have downwardly skewed  the group\u2019s small business lending growth rate, thus causing Treasury\u2019s  results to overstate the implied effect of the program. As a result,  Treasury\u2019s analysis seemingly links SBLF funding to the increase in small  business lending when that increase, to some extent, may have been  associated with the factors mentioned above or other factors such as  improved local economic growth.", "We used the Texas Ratio as a proxy for financial health. It is defined as nonperforming  assets plus loans 90 or more days past due divided by tangible equity and reserves. The  Texas Ratio helps determine a bank\u2019s likelihood of failure by comparing its troubled loans  to its capital.

That is, growth rates of SBLF participants remained noticeably  higher than those of our peer group. This growth could indicate a  beneficial effect of SBLF funding on lending, or it could be due to other  factors, including differences between SBLF participants and our peer  group for which we were not able to adjust.

Moreover, SBLF participants in the larger asset categories had  lower growth rates in total business lending. However, the peer and  comparison groups had no noticeable trend across different asset size  groups. In addition, the peer and comparison groups were closest to  SBLF participants among institutions with assets over $1 billion.", "Treasury officials said that in determining the comparison group to use in  their analysis, they analyzed distributional differences in asset size and  geography between the groups, as well as some indicators of financial  health. They judged that the differences in the variables they analyzed  were modest and believed that adjusting for these differences\u2014that is,  making the comparison group more representative of SBLF participants\u2014 would only provide a limited benefit while making the analysis less  transparent and more difficult for others to replicate. They were also  concerned that using what they considered to be a more judgmental  approach, such as selecting a peer group, would require certain arbitrary  decisions which might raise concerns about the validity of their selection  criteria. As a result, Treasury determined that the differences found in  their analyses did not warrant an approach that would adjust for these  factors.", "In addition, although Treasury officials told us they considered but  decided against using a comparison group that would have been adjusted  to more closely mirror SBLF participants; they did not explain this  decision in the methodology section of the Use of Funds Report. In prior  work on another Treasury program, we said that Treasury should  enhance its communications relating to financial assistance so that they  are transparent to the Congress and the public.

While a  comparison group is an important step and provides useful context, a  more rigorous analysis of peer banks to help assess what might have  happened without SBLF, as our 2011 report on SBLF recommends, may  help Treasury better understand the effects of the program. Our prior  work on program evaluation suggests that a carefully constructed control  group should be as similar to program participants as possible to help  identify the impact of a program, and a number of statistical methods can  help account for differences. making arbitrary judgments in the selection of peers could be addressed  by conducting a sensitivity analysis\u2014a best practice also identified by the  Office of Management and Budget\u2014which involves varying assumptions  to determine how sensitive results are to changes in those assumptions.", "See GAO, Program Evaluation: A Variety of Rigorous Methods Can Help Identify  Effective Interventions, GAO-10-30 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 23, 2009) and Designing  Evaluations: 2012 Revision, GAO-12-208G (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 2012). approving applications for small business loans or credit lines; the  demand for small business loans; the participant\u2019s practices regarding  approvals of loans and lines of credit for small business; use of SBLF  funding or the type of actions the institution has taken because of SBLF  funding; and outreach activities to minority, women, and veteran  communities.

For instance, Treasury has not created a  specific number of estimated jobs as a target because so many factors  can determine the use of funds\u2014for example, the degree of interest by  financial institutions and private investors, the performance of the state  agency and any contractors that operate the approved program, and the  effectiveness of the program features designed by the state. How this  program activity affects the level of employment in a state introduces  many variables that can be difficult to predict. According to Treasury  officials, specific numeric indicators, such as the number of loans  resulting from state business programs, may or may not be indicative of  the performance of SSBCI. In analyzing performance outcomes for  SSBCI, Treasury staff advised us that outcomes are highly dependent on  factors outside of the program\u2019s control, such as the demand for credit in  a given locality and the quality of the small business borrowers\u2019 requests  for such funds. Also, the states have different economies that may affect  the results of the SSBCI funds.

Treasury also issued the standards for  compliance to provide states with best practices for reviewing  participants\u2019 compliance with SSBCI\u2019s legal and policy requirements and  developed procedures for sampling transaction-level data to evaluate the  accuracy of the states\u2019 annual reports.", "Most SSBCI participants have only received the first of three  disbursements of their full allocation approved by Treasury, and some  participants were concerned that they may have difficulty using the funds  in time to meet the requirements to get their third and final allocation  within 2 years. SSBCI participants lack a clear understanding of what  actions Treasury plans to take if they do not meet the 2-year time frame.  Although a Treasury official has publicly indicated that Treasury does not  currently plan to exercise the authority to terminate funds that have not  been allocated within 2 years from the states\u2019 approval date, it retains the  authority to do so in the future. Treasury has yet to develop a formal  written policy or guidance explaining its position. Clear and specific  guidelines on how Treasury plans to use this authority to terminate funds  will help ensure Treasury is consistent in how it applies this authority and  may further encourage participants to develop programs and approaches  to use the funds in a timely manner. Moreover, such a policy could also  facilitate the ongoing communication between Treasury and the  participants on how best to allocate and use the funds.", "Treasury has taken some steps to evaluate the performance of SBLF and  the extent to which SBLF participants are increasing their small business  lending, but further refinements could provide a better assessment of the  effectiveness of SBLF. As we found in our December 2011 SBLF report,  Treasury has yet to finalize plans for assessing the performance of the  program, including measures that can isolate the impact of SBLF from  other factors that affect small business lending. As we found in Treasury\u2019s  analysis as well as our own, SBLF participants appear to be increasing  their small business lending since entering the program. However, as we  recommended in our 2011 report, many factors can contribute to such  increases, and Treasury should assess these trends taking other factors  into account. While Treasury compared SBLF participants to non-SBLF  institutions and reported this analysis in its Use of Funds Report, it did not  provide important information on why it selected the comparison group  that it used rather than using a peer group more closely matched to the  SBLF participants. Our own analysis using a peer group showed that  SBLF participants had increased their lending compared to peers, but  also showed that the difference in small business lending growth was  somewhat smaller than what Treasury\u2019s analysis suggests. The lack of  explanation for Treasury\u2019s approach in the Use of Funds Report could  create confusion about the rigorousness of the comparison. Furthermore,  a more transparent description of the methodological decisions would  help to enhance the transparency of the information reported. In addition,  as we recommended in the 2011 report, Treasury should include in its  plans for assessing the program a more robust evaluation that controls for  factors that affect small business lending, such as improved local  economic growth. Without such an evaluation, policymakers, including  Congress, may not have the information they need to assess whether the  SBLF approach of using capital injections is a desirable policy option for  increasing small business lending. Furthermore, a more transparent  description of the methodological decisions would help to enhance the  transparency of the information reported.", "In addition, as we recommended last year, Treasury has created  performance indicators to help monitor and measure the effectiveness of  SSBCI. However, Treasury has not yet determined how and when it will  make this information public. Treasury officials acknowledged the  importance of this information for policymakers and have said they hope  to develop a method for sharing this information publicly after they have  had time to review the second annual reports that will be completed by  the states next year. While we recognize that it is still early in the program  and results vary greatly across the program participants for a variety of  reasons, performance information is an important tool for policymakers,  particularly as Congress reviews and considers programs to assist small  businesses going forward. In addition, making this information public in a  timely manner may help program participants, who could observe how  their peers are performing and use this information to help them improve  their own programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury take the following  three actions:", "To help ensure that Treasury is transparent and accountable in its  decision making, Treasury should develop a written policy explaining  how it will use the Secretary\u2019s discretionary authority to terminate the  availability of allocated funds to SSBCI participating states if funds  have not been transferred to the participant by the end of the 2-year  period beginning on the date that the Secretary approved the state for  participation.", "To enhance the transparency of its reporting on SBLF, Treasury  should expand its methodology discussion in its Use of Funds Report  to include the rationale for its methodology and alternative  methodologies it considered.", "To provide Congress and the participating states with information on  the progress of SSBCI, Treasury should make information publicly  available on its performance indicators measuring SSBCI\u2019s  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Treasury for review and comment.

In  the written comments, Treasury agreed with the three recommendations  and stated that it has begun to take steps to implement each of them.   Specifically, Treasury said it has begun to develop a written policy for  exercising its discretion to terminate any portion of a state\u2019s allocation not  yet transferred to the state after two years. Treasury said it also will  include the rationale for Treasury\u2019s methodology along with alternative  methodologies that were considered in the methodology section of the  next Use of Funds Report and that work is underway on publishing  performance indicators that measure SSBCI outcomes. Treasury noted  that the report reflected the progress SBLF and SSBCI had made in  setting up compliance procedures and taking steps to improve  communication with program participants.

For SBLF, we reviewed and  analyzed SBLF\u2019s Participant Compliance Monitoring Procedures, which  were issued on September 28, 2012. We interviewed Treasury officials on  their compliance program and the process by which staff review the  Quarterly Supplemental Reports for their accuracy.", "For SSBCI, we reviewed SSBCI National Standards for Compliance and  Oversight and SSBCI Policy Guidelines. We reviewed the Allocation  Agreements between Treasury and nine participating states that we  interviewed to analyze the conditions and the requirements placed on the  states. We interviewed Treasury officials on implementing the SSBCI  compliance standards and officials from the states of Colorado, Florida,  Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, and  Texas. We judgmentally selected these nine states based on the  following criteria: (1) the top 25 states awarded the most SSBCI funds; (2)  geographical diversity; (3) states with at least two small business  programs; (4) states that began using funds as of March 31, 2012, and  states that had not yet used funds for any loans or investments as of  March 31, 2012; and (5) avoiding states which have been reviewed  previously by GAO or the Treasury\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.  Because a large number of states had not spent their first allocation as of  December 31, 2011, we used both the 2011 Annual Report and the  Quarterly Report for March 31, 2012, to identify states\u2019 progress in  allocating their funds. In terms of geographical diversity, we selected at  least two states from each of four regions: Midwest, Northeast, South,  and West.", "To determine the status of SBLF, we reviewed the SBLF Use of Funds  Reports to determine the most current level of qualified small business  lending and the distribution of dividend or interest rates paid by program  participants. Because Treasury requires only SBLF participants to submit  data on qualified small business lending\u2014generally, lending below $10  million\u2014 we also analyzed total business lending as well as small  business loans under $1 million, which is available through the Call  Reports.private financial database that contains publicly filed regulatory and  financial reports\u2014and analyzed lending by SBLF participants for the  quarter ending June 30, 2012. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the  act) establishes the baseline for measuring the change in small business  lending as the average of the amounts that were reported for each of the  four calendar quarters ended June 30, 2010. Call Reports did not begin  requiring quarterly reporting of small business loans under $1 million until  the second quarter of this four quarter baseline period. Accordingly, we  calculated the baseline for small business loans under $1 million using  the average of each of the three calendar quarters ended June 30, 2010.  The act also defines one of the categories of qualified small business  lending as owner-occupied nonfarm, nonresidential real estate loans. For  quarterly reports of small business lending, Call Reports use a broader  category of all nonfarm, nonresidential real estate without a distinction for  owner occupancy. As a result, the small business loans under $1 million  include the broader category. The total business lending numbers use the  full baseline and the narrower categorization of owner-occupied nonfarm,  nonresidential real estate and should therefore not be compared to the   We accessed the Call Report data using SNL Financial\u2014a  numbers for small business loans under $1 million. We assessed the  reliability of these data, for example, by analyzing missing data and  performing various logic tests and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on SBLF lending.", "To review SSBCI participants\u2019 small business lending, we collected and  reviewed data from the Quarterly Report as of June 30, 2012\u2014the most  recent quarter available. We conducted data reliability checks on the  SSBCI quarterly data for the dollar amounts transferred to the states and  the dollar amounts used by each participating state to identify any  potential discrepancies in the data. We interviewed Treasury officials on  how they assessed these data. In addition, we verified with three states  the data that they had sent to Treasury on the SSBCI Quarterly Report as  of June 30, 2012. We also interviewed state and Treasury officials about  the status of the use of SSBCI funds and Treasury\u2019s authority to suspend  disbursements to SSBCI participants. Based on these steps, we  determined that the data collected by Treasury for SSBCI were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting total amounts of funds  allocated and used by the states.", "To examine the extent to which Treasury evaluates and communicates  SBLF and SSBCI program outcomes, we reviewed Treasury  documentation for both programs. For determining the extent to which  Treasury evaluates the performance of SBLF, we reviewed the Use of  Funds Report to evaluate the methodology Treasury used to assess the  performance of SBLF participants against a comparison group of  institutions that did not participate in SBLF. We interviewed Treasury  officials to understand the process for developing the comparison group  as well as the alternatives they considered. We used the methodology in  the report to replicate Treasury\u2019s group for our analysis. To help  understand the usefulness of the comparison group, we also chose a  peer group of non-SBLF institutions that we adjusted for geographical and  size distribution as well as financial health, using the Texas Ratio as a  proxy.Treasury\u2019s comparison group of 6,175 institutions and categorized them   To select the peer group, we started with our replication of  into six asset-size groups. We then sorted the institutions by state, asset  group, and Texas Ratio and generally assigned two peer institutions to  each SBLF participant with the closest Texas Ratios, within the same  state and asset group. In some cases, we had to make judgments in  choosing the peers\u2014for example, when two SBLF participants were  similar to one another and when too few potential peers existed. We  determined that any potential judgment factors were mitigated by the fact  that the peer group mirrored the SBLF more closely than the comparison  group across geographical and size distribution as well as financial health  (see table 1). Consistent with the Use of Funds Report, we analyzed the  growth in total business lending because qualified small business lending  data were not available for non-SBLF institutions and because qualified  small business lending totaled 95 percent of total business lending for the  median SBLF participant as of December 31, 2011. Here we calculated  the baseline using the average of the four quarters ending June 30, 2010.  The data limitation mentioned earlier that required us to use only three  quarters in the calculation of the baseline only applied to the availability of  small business lending data, and the three-quarter baseline was used  only in those earlier sections. We compared our peer group with  Treasury\u2019s comparison group and compared both to SBLF participants.  We also compared Treasury\u2019s analysis against our previous work on  program evaluation as well as best practices identified by the Office of  Management and Budget. In assessing the SBLF communication  process, we reviewed and analyzed SBLF\u2019s Contact Management  Procedures and interviewed Treasury officials on how they communicated  with SBLF participants.", "For determining the extent to which Treasury evaluates SSBCI  performance outcomes, we collected and reviewed the performance  measures that Treasury developed for evaluating SSBCI.
