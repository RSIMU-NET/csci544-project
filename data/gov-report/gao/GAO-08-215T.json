The following illustrates some trends since 2000: (1) The estimated amount of cocaine arriving in Mexico for transshipment to the United States averaged about 290 metric tons per year. Reported seizures averaged about 36 metric tons a year. (2) The estimated amount of export quality heroin and marijuana produced in Mexico averaged almost 19 metric tons and 9,400 metric tons per year, respectively. Reported heroin seizures averaged less than 1 metric ton and reported marijuana seizures averaged about 2,900 metric tons a year. (3) Although an estimate of the amount of methamphetamine manufactured in Mexico is not prepared, reported seizures along the U.S. border rose from about 500 kilograms in 2000 to highs of about 2,800 kilograms in 2005 and about 2,700 kilograms in 2006. According to U.S. officials, this more than fivefold increase indicated a dramatic rise in supply. In addition, according to State, corruption persists within the Mexican government and challenges Mexico's efforts to curb drug production and trafficking. Moreover, Mexican drug trafficking organizations operate with relative impunity along the U.S. border and in other parts of Mexico, and have expanded their illicit business to almost every region of the United States. U.S. assistance since fiscal year 2000 has helped Mexico strengthen its capacity to combat illicit drug production and trafficking. Among other things, extraditions of criminals to the United States increased; thousands of Mexican law enforcement personnel were trained; and controls over chemicals to produce methamphetamine were strengthened. Nevertheless, cooperation with Mexico can be improved. The two countries do not have an agreement permitting U.S. law enforcement officers to board Mexican-flagged vessels suspected of transporting illicit drugs on the high seas; an aerial monitoring program along the U.S. border was suspended because certain personnel status issues could not be agreed on; State-provided Vietnam-era helicopters have proved expensive and difficult to maintain and many are not available for operations; and a State-supported border surveillance program was cut short due to limited funding and changed priorities. In 2006, in response to a congressional mandate, ONDCP and other agencies involved in U.S. counternarcotics efforts developed a strategy to help reduce the illicit drugs entering the United States from Mexico. An implementation plan was prepared but is being revised to address certain initiatives recently undertaken by Mexico. Based on our review of the plan, some proposals require the cooperation of Mexico; but, according to ONDCP, they had not been addressed with Mexican authorities at the time of our review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss GAO\u2019s recent report on U.S. drug  control assistance to Mexico since 2000.

The  goal over the years has been to disrupt the market for illegal drugs, making  it more difficult for traffickers to produce and transport illicit drugs to the  United States. Specifically, the United States has provided Mexico with  assistance for a range of projects, including interdicting cocaine shipments  from South America; stemming the production and trafficking of opium  poppy, as well as marijuana; and, more recently, controlling precursor  chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine.", "In the past, Mexico has chosen to combat drug trafficking with reduced  assistance from the United States, and Mexican sensitivity about its  national sovereignty has made it difficult for the two countries to  coordinate counternarcotics activities. However, beginning in the mid- 1990s, cooperation began to improve, culminating in 1998 in the signing of  a Bi-National Drug Control Strategy.

DEA has  also funded some training for members of its vetted units, and Defense has  provided training for Mexican military officials.", "According to U.S. and Mexican officials, this training was an integral part  of the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s efforts to develop a professional cadre  of investigative agents within AFI, and it also supported more general  efforts by the Fox administration to upgrade the capabilities and ethical  awareness of Mexican law enforcement officials at the federal, state, and  local levels. By 2006, the United States had supported training for over  2,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, with a goal of  training 2,000 more in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interdiction Cooperation and Coordination Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["From 2000 to 2006, Defense has spent a total of about $58 million for  equipment and training for the Mexican military, particularly to help the  Mexican Navy interdict aircraft and vessels suspected of transporting  illicit drugs. From 2000 to 2006, Defense provided training for about 2,500  Mexican military personnel in the use of certain kinds of equipment, as  well as training to enable them to coordinate with U.S. aircraft and vessels.  The training provided was designed to strengthen the Mexican military\u2019s  ability to detect, monitor, and interdict suspected drug trafficking aircraft  and vessels, as well as help professionalize Mexico\u2019s military and improve  relations between the U.S. and Mexican militaries.", "Defense initiatives have facilitated coincidental maritime operations  between the United States and Mexico that have resulted in greater  cooperation between the two countries, particularly with respect to  boarding, searching, and seizing suspected vessels transiting Mexican  waters. In recent years, the Mexican Navy has regularly responded to U.S.  information on suspect vessels transiting Mexican waters\u201446 times in  2006, for example. In addition, the Mexican Navy agreed on several  occasions to temporarily place Mexican liaison officers aboard U.S. Coast  Guard vessels, as well as placing U.S. Coast Guard officers aboard  Mexican vessels. The Mexican Navy also permitted U.S. law enforcement  personnel to participate in some dockside searches and post-seizure  analyses.", "However, the United States and Mexico have not agreed to a bilateral  maritime cooperation agreement that would allow U.S. law enforcement  personnel to board and search Mexican-flagged vessels on the high seas  suspected of trafficking illicit drugs without asking the government of  Mexico for authority to board on a case-by-case basis. According to  Defense officials, a request to board and search a suspicious Mexican- flagged vessel\u2014or one whose captain reports it as Mexican-registered\u2014 can be complex and time-consuming, involving, at a minimum, the Foreign  Affairs Secretariat as well as the Mexican Navy. Waiting for approval or  the arrival of the Mexican Navy typically creates delays, which can result  in the loss of evidence as the illicit drugs are thrown overboard or the  vessel is scuttled or escapes. In addition, while the Mexican Navy has  proved willing to respond to U.S. information on suspicious vessels  transiting Mexican waters, according to Defense officials, the Mexican  Navy does not normally conduct patrols more than 200 nautical miles from  shore.", "In addition, according to embassy and Defense officials, Defense has little  contact with Mexico\u2019s Defense Secretariat (SEDENA), which oversees  the Mexican Army and Air Force. According to these officials, the Mexican  Army has conducted counternarcotics operations throughout Mexico,  including in Acapulco, Nuevo Laredo, and Tijuana, to reduce the violence  caused by drug trafficking, and it manually eradicates opium poppy and  marijuana. But, according to Defense officials, none of these efforts took  advantage of U.S. expertise or intelligence. In the past, some eradication  efforts were also done by the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office, which  worked with its U.S. counterparts. Now, however, the Calder\u00f3n  administration plans to consolidate all eradication efforts under SEDENA,  which makes greater cooperation with SEDENA all the more important.", "In addition, from 2001 until late 2006, Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) provided eight Citation jets for detection and monitoring of  suspected drug trafficking aircraft along the U.S.-Mexican border under a  program known as Operation Halcon in cooperation with AFI. According  to CBP officials, in recent years Operation Halcon was a successful  interdiction effort that helped prevent drug traffickers from flying aircraft  near the U.S.-Mexico border, which made it more difficult to transport  illicit drugs to the United States. They also noted that CBP and AFI  personnel worked very closely and one CBP official worked full time at  the AFI Command Center. Moreover, CBP officials maintained that the  embassy infrastructure, operational staffing, and relationships developed  under Halcon provided critical daily interface with the Mexican  authorities, facilitating quick responses to operational needs along the  border and the sharing of intelligence. Overall, in 2005, between 15 and  25 percent of the 294 suspect aircraft identified by Operation Halcon  resulted in seizures of aircraft and other vehicles or arrests.", "In March 2006, the United States sought to formalize Operation Halcon to  limit liability for U.S. pilots involved in the patrols in the event of an  accident. However, the Mexican government did not respond with terms  acceptable to CBP, and in November 2006, the government of Mexico  suspended the program. As a result, U.S. embassy officials said that fewer  suspect flights are being identified and interdicted. According to CBP  officials, since the suspension, seizures of illicit drugs along the U.S.- Mexico border have increased, and this, according to DEA, CBP, and other  officials, is an indication that more drugs are finding their way to northern  Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Aviation Support for Interdiction Can Be Better Coordinated", "paragraphs": ["From 2000 to 2006, NAS provided about $22 million, or 13 percent of INL\u2019s  obligations for Mexico, to support aviation programs for counternarcotics  efforts by the Attorney General\u2019s Office and one program for the Mexican  Air Force. Since 1990, NAS has provided 41 Vietnam-era UH-1H  helicopters, of which 28 remain in service, to the Mexican Attorney  General\u2019s Office to transport law enforcement personnel interdicting drug  trafficking aircraft landing in Mexico. Since 2000, NAS has expended    $4.5 million to refurbish 8 of the aircraft. According to State, the aircraft  have served as the transportation workhorse for the Attorney General\u2019s air  services section, flying a total of approximately 14,000 hours from 2001 to  2006. However, according to the embassy, the UH-1H program did not  meet its target of interdicting 15 percent of all aircraft detected in the  transport of illicit drugs and crops\u2014in 2005, 4 percent were interdicted. In  addition, the helicopters\u2019 readiness rates have progressively declined from  about 90 percent in January 2000 to 33 percent in January 2007. NAS and  Mexican officials attributed the reduced readiness rates to a lack of  funding and a lack of spare parts for these aging aircraft, which Defense  will stop supporting in 2008. In January 2007, NAS officials told us that  State/INL does not intend to provide any further support for the UH-1Hs.", "Beginning in 2004, NAS provided the Attorney General\u2019s Office 12  Schweizer 333 helicopters, of which 11 remain operational. The total  expended for these helicopters was $14.2 million, which included a 2-year  support package. Equipped with forward-looking infrared sensors for  nighttime operations as well as television cameras, the Schweizers are  designed to provide the Attorney General\u2019s Office with a reconnaissance,  surveillance, and command and control platform. According to State  officials, the Schweizers were used in Nuevo Laredo and other locations,  providing support for surveillance operations, flying a total of  approximately 1,750 hours from September 2004 to February 2007.", "Originally, NAS had planned to provide 28 Schweizers, deploying them to  various points throughout Mexico. However, according to State officials,  due to funding limitations and changed priorities, NAS capped the number  at 12. In addition, Mexican Attorney General officials told us that they  would have preferred a helicopter with both a surveillance capability and  troop transport capacity.", "From 2000 to 2006, NAS also expended about $4.2 million to repair,  maintain, and operate four C-26 aircraft provided by the United States to  Mexico in 1997. The aircraft did not originally come equipped with a  surveillance capability, and the Mexican Air Force had indicated it had no  plans to invest in the necessary equipment. In 1998, we reported that the  Mexican Air Force was not using the aircraft for any purpose. After  Mexico upgraded these aircraft with forward-looking infrared radar in  2002, NAS funded maintenance of the aircraft and sensors, as well as  training for sensor operators and imagery analysts.

The stated objectives of the strategy, which we reviewed in  June 2007, were to    enhance and better coordinate the collection of intelligence;    effectively share information, when appropriate, with Mexican officials;  investigate, disrupt, and dismantle Mexican DTOs; interdict drugs and other illicit cargo by denying entry by land, air, and sea  routes;   deny drug traffickers their profits by interdicting bulk currency  movements and electronic currency transfers;   enhance Mexico\u2019s counterdrug capabilities; and  reduce the corruption that facilitates illicit activity along and across the  border.", "In addition, a plan was developed to implement the strategy.

Moreover, reducing drug-related  corruption remains a challenge for the Mexican government, and Mexican  DTOs have increasingly become a threat in both Mexico and the United  States. Mexican officials have recognized the increasing threat and  indicated that combating the illicit drug threat in cooperation with the  United States is a priority.", "As we noted in our recent report, the Calder\u00f3n administration has signaled  an interest in working with the United States to reduce drug production  and trafficking. At the time, to respond to the Calderon administration\u2019s  initiatives, ONDCP and the U.S. counternarcotics community was revising  the Southwest Border Strategy\u2019s implementation plan to emphasize greater  cooperation with Mexico. We recommended that the Director of ONDCP,  as the lead agency for U.S. drug policy, in conjunction with the cognizant  departments and agencies in the U.S. counternarcotics interagency  community, coordinate with the appropriate Mexican officials before  completing the Southwest Border Strategy\u2019s implementation plan to help  ensure Mexico\u2019s cooperation with any efforts that require it and address  the cooperation issues we identified.", "ONDCP concurred with the recommendation and it has since assured us  that the interagency counternarcotics community is actively engaged with  their Mexican counterparts.
