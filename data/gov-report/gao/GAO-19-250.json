GAO found that there is potential for significant delays on both fronts.

Assumed improvements in how long it takes to repair software defects has not occurred as planned, placing additional pressure on the contractor's delivery date. Additionally, Air Force officials have acknowledged that the government developmental test period after acceptance could double in duration and delay operations further because of concurrency, test plan uncertainty, and risks of late discovery of problems.", "With approximately 2 years of work remaining before delivery, there is no plan to have the full schedule independently assessed. For complex programs, such as OCX, best practices state an independent view is necessary and that a periodic schedule assessment should be performed as progress is made and risks change.

As of January 2019,  Raytheon was tracking 48 risks it has identified with cost effects\u201426 with  a moderate likelihood of occurring. For example, a moderate risk includes  the possibility of finding more defects than planned, which could have   both cost and schedule consequences. Other moderate risks include the  possibility of software development taking longer to complete or needing  to create more software code than planned. If realized, both of these risks  have cost effects to pay for additional work and schedule effects to allow  additional time to complete work. As of January 2019, Raytheon has no  high risks that it tracks. There was also a significant amount of change in  the risks themselves in 2018, as Raytheon added 27 new risks while  closing 30.

As currently formulated, this period will be used to prepare  for the transition from OCS to OCX via (1) transition exercises to train  operators, (2) transition rehearsals to practice the actual handover from  OCS to OCX, and (3) a 156-day integrated system test to verify OCX\u2019s  requirements, operational suitability, and readiness to enter operational  testing.", "However, that 7-month duration may not be sufficient to conduct all of the  activities that are necessary to verify OCX is ready to transition to  operations. First, the head of the GPS Directorate\u2019s Lead Development  Test Organization, which plans and executes the 7-month developmental  testing, said that there is some schedule risk because of concurrent  activities that need to be accomplished, including crew rehearsals and  other test events. Second, the content of the test period has not yet been  finalized. The planned testing events will be reviewed and refined about 6  months before beginning the test as it becomes clearer what can be  tested and what data will be available from the system. The test director  and the OCX program manager are considering combining some test  events and, if possible, starting some testing prior to acceptance. Third,  the test director and the OCX program manager described a number of  risks that could delay completion of developmental testing including (1)  the late identification of issues requiring significant new software coding  and retesting and (2) identification of new requirements that are not in the  scope of the current effort.", "In addition, OCX program officials stated that neither they nor senior Air  Force leadership would transition OCX to operations if the operators are  not ready or requirements have not been verified. They also stated that  there are numerous levels of review within the Air Force, and any of these  decision makers can refuse to approve the transition of OCX to  operations. As a result, according to OCX program officials it could take 5  to 7 months longer than planned, or potentially 14 months total, to  complete developmental testing.", "In addition, experience with prior upgrades to the current GPS ground  system indicates that the completion of developmental testing may  require more time than the 7 months assumed in the schedule.

The 11-month upgrade to  OCS from 2006 to 2007 was for an effort that was significantly smaller in  software size in comparison to the size of OCX, but similarly brought new  capabilities to OCS related to the command and control of satellites. The  8-month upgrade to OCS from 2009 to 2010 also provided command and  control of a new type of GPS satellite and enhanced security for the  current GPS receiver cards.

According to these best  practices, a well-planned schedule is a fundamental management tool  that can help government programs use public funds effectively by  specifying when work will be performed and measuring program  performance against an approved plan. Typically, schedule delays are  followed by cost growth. When this occurs management tends to respond  to schedule delays by adding more resources or authorizing overtime.  Therefore, a reliable schedule can contribute to an understanding of the  cost effect if the program does not finish on time. Moreover, an integrated  and reliable schedule can show when major events are expected, as well  as the completion dates for all activities leading up to them, which can  help determine whether a program\u2019s parameters are realistic and  achievable.", "Further, the Cost Guide states that, too often, programs overrun costs  and schedule because estimates fail to account for the full technical  definition, unexpected changes, and risks. The Cost Guide states that  one of many challenges program managers face is too much optimism in  the original estimate. The Cost Guide also states that because optimism  is often prevalent, organizations will encourage goals that are  unattainable by accentuating the positive. Because over-optimism  potentially affects both cost estimates and schedules, an independent  view and analysis is important to properly overcome this bias. An  independent view also allows decision makers to react sooner and take  steps to minimize any identified risks, like schedule delays. The following  best practices recommend that the schedule estimate should be  periodically updated to reflect (1) actual progress and (2) newly identified  risks.", "Periodic Updates and Actual Progress: GAO\u2019s Schedule Guide  states that updating a schedule to reflect actual progress is important  when assessing the realism of the initial schedule duration  assumptions. Programs should make adjustments, if necessary, to the  forecast of the remaining effort.", "Periodic Updates and Risk: GAO\u2019s Schedule Guide states that  prudent organizations recognize that uncertainties and risks can  become better defined as the program advances and should conduct  periodic reevaluations of risks. GAO\u2019s Cost Guide states that program  managers often do not sufficiently account for risks because they tend  to be optimistic and because they believe in the original estimates for  the plan without allowing for additional changes in scope, schedule  delays, or other elements of risk.", "Since the current schedule was approved in September 2018, Raytheon  has updated its delivery schedule estimate quarterly or as needed to  reflect changes, and modifies the delivery and acceptance dates  accordingly. Raytheon does not update the full program schedule  because the government-run developmental testing is not included in its  schedule estimate.

An independent assessment of the schedule would normally be  produced in conjunction with the statutory requirement to conduct another  independent cost estimate at the next major program milestone.  However, in September 2018 the milestone decision authority waived the  requirement to hold the next major program milestone. DOD\u2019s Office of  Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation conducts independent cost  estimates which account for a full program schedule when statutorily  required. In addition, according to an official in that office, they also  conduct only schedule assessments, without completing a full  independent cost estimate, when requested by a program\u2019s milestone  decision authority. In June 2018, the Office of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation provided the last full, independent cost estimate with  a schedule assessment to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  and Sustainment, the milestone decision authority, to support the decision  to approve the OCX baseline.

Once software development is complete, it must go through  developmental testing. The schedule for this phase may also be optimistic  as risks associated with competing activities have the potential to double  the amount of time needed for testing.", "DOD will be in a better position to assess OCX\u2019s progress and the  potential for additional delays when the majority of its changes to its  software development approach are completed at the end of 2019. At this  time, however, while the program plans to continue assessing schedule  progress, there are no plans in place for an independent schedule  assessment. The program\u2019s history has consistently shown program and  contractor estimates to be optimistic and that independent assessments  have provided useful insights about risks as well as past experience with  similar activities.

DOD said that the Office of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation conducted an independent cost and schedule  estimate supporting the OCX program\u2019s September 2018 system  development milestone and that DOD subsequently funded OCX  consistent with that estimate. Further, DOD said that the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation as well as the Defense Contract  Management Agency continually assess the program\u2019s ability to meet  cost, schedule, and performance objectives. DOD also said the OCX  forecast is currently holding to the government schedule, which is ahead  of the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation\u2019s independent  cost estimate.

As stated in  our report, DOD has not conducted an assessment of the full schedule  since June 2018, since which time program risks have evolved. In  addition, the other potential sources for schedule oversight suggested by  DOD are limited in scope. The Defense Contract Management Agency  does not look at the full OCX program schedule, as it examines the  schedule only until contractor delivery. Officials from the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation said they do some programmatic  monitoring of OCX, including on selected metrics, to inform DOD\u2019s annual  program and budget submission.
