Federal law, particularly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, has defined the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) as the focal point for IT management within agencies. Given the longstanding challenges the government faces in managing IT and the continued importance of the CIO, GAO was asked to (1) determine the current roles and responsibilities of CIOs, (2) determine what potential modifications to the Clinger-Cohen Act and related laws could be made to enhance CIOs' authority and effectiveness, and (3) identify key lessons learned by CIOs in managing IT. To do this, GAO administered a questionnaire to 30 CIOs, compared responses to legislative requirements and the results of a 2004 GAO study, interviewed current CIOs, convened a panel of former agency CIOs, and spoke with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Federal CIO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CIOs do not consistently have responsibility for 13 major areas of IT and information management as defined by law or deemed as critical to effective IT management, but they have continued to focus more attention on IT management-related areas. Specifically, most CIOs are responsible for seven key IT management areas: capital planning and investment management; enterprise architecture; information security; IT strategic planning, \"e-government\" initiatives; systems acquisition, development, and integration; and IT workforce planning. By contrast, CIOs are less frequently responsible for information management duties such as records management and privacy requirements, which they commonly share with other offices or organizations within the agency. In this regard, CIOs report spending over two-thirds of their time on IT management responsibilities, and less than one-third of their time on information management responsibilities. CIOs also report devoting time to other responsibilities such as addressing infrastructure issues and identifying emerging technologies. Further, many CIOs serve in positions in addition to their role as CIO, such as human capital officer. In addition, tenure at the CIO position has remained at about 2 years. Finally, just over half of the CIOs reported directly to the head of their respective agencies, which is required by law. The CIOs and others have stressed that a variety of reporting relationships in an agency can be effective, but that CIOs need to have access to the agency head and form productive working relationships with senior executives across the agency in order to carry out their mission. Federal law provides CIOs with adequate authority to manage IT for their agencies; however, some limitations exist that impede their ability to exercise this authority. Current and former CIOs, as well as the Federal CIO, did not identify legislative changes needed to enhance CIOs' authority and generally felt that existing law provides sufficient authority. Nevertheless, CIOs do face limitations in exercising their influence in certain IT management areas. Specifically, CIOs do not always have sufficient control over IT investments, and they often have limited influence over the IT workforce, such as in hiring and firing decisions and the performance of component-level CIOs. More consistent implementation of CIOs' authority could enhance their effectiveness in these areas. OMB has taken steps to increase CIOs' effectiveness, but it has not established measures of accountability to ensure that responsibilities are fully implemented. CIOs identified a number of best practices and lessons learned for more effectively managing IT at agencies, and the Federal CIO Council has established a website to share this information among agencies. Agencies have begun to share information in the areas of vendor communication and contract management; the consolidation of multiple systems into an enterprise solution through the use of cloud services; and program manager development. However, CIOs have not implemented structured agency processes for sharing lessons learned. Doing so could help CIOs share ideas across their agencies and with their successors for improving work processes and increasing cost effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that OMB update its guidance to establish measures of accountability for ensuring that CIOs' responsibilities are fully implemented and require agencies to establish internal processes for documenting lessons learned. In commenting on a draft of this report, OMB officials generally agreed with GAO's findings and stated that OMB had taken actions that they believed addressed the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, the federal government estimates spending  approximately $79 billion for information technology (IT) investments.  Although the government makes these substantial annual investments, it  faces longstanding problems in its management of IT. Our most recent  high-risk series update continues to identify high-risk modernization  efforts and governmentwide IT management challenges. Further, our  recent report on opportunities to reduce potential duplication in  government programs identified numerous areas in which IT programs  could be consolidated or better managed to save taxpayer dollars and  help agencies provide more efficient and effective services.", "Over the years, Congress has enacted various laws in an attempt to  improve the government\u2019s performance in IT management. One of these  laws\u2014the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996\u2014required agency heads to  designate Chief Information Officers (CIO) to lead reforms that would help  control system development risks; better manage technology spending;  and achieve real, measurable improvements in agency performance.  Additionally, we have long been proponents of having strong agency CIOs  in place to lead federal agencies in managing IT. Recognizing the key role  of CIOs in helping agencies achieve better results through IT, in July 2004,  we reported our findings from a congressionally requested study that  examined federal agency CIOs\u2019 roles and responsibilities, reporting  relationships, tenure, and challenges. That study, undertaken about 8  years following the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act, noted a number of  findings regarding the extent to which CIOs had responsibilities for key IT  management and other areas we identified as required by statute or as  critical to IT management. For example, we reported that few CIOs were  responsible for all key IT and information management areas and generally  reported to their agency heads or other top-level managers. Also, the CIOs  had cited challenges in implementing effective IT management and  obtaining sufficient and relevant resources, among others.", "It has now been 15 years since enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act, and  recognizing the continued importance of the CIO position to achieving  better results through IT management, you requested that we conduct a  follow-up study of federal agency CIOs. As agreed, our objectives were to  (1) determine the current roles and responsibilities of CIOs, (2) determine  what potential modifications to the Clinger-Cohen Act and related laws  could be made to enhance CIOs\u2019 authority and effectiveness, and (3)  identify key lessons learned by CIOs in managing information technology.", "To address these objectives, we administered a questionnaire to the  CIOs of 30 federal departments and agencies (24 entities identified in the  Chief Financial Officers Act, the 3 military departments, and 3  independent federal agencies). We asked CIOs about their roles and  responsibilities, reporting relationships with the agency head, and  changes needed to their authority and effectiveness in addressing areas  of IT management. We also inquired about any experiences of these  CIOs that could potentially serve as lessons learned in managing  information technology. We then compared the questionnaire responses  to statutory requirements for CIO roles and responsibilities. Further, we  compared the overall findings with those in our 2004 report to identify any  differences or trends in CIOs\u2019 responses. Subsequently, we conducted  semi-structured interviews with each of the CIOs who were in office at the  time of our review to corroborate and supplement information we received  in the survey. In addition, we convened a panel of nine former federal  CIOs to obtain their views on the roles and responsibilities of federal  CIOs, based on their prior experiences serving in the position. Finally, we  met with the Federal CIO to discuss IT reform initiatives being undertaken  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to enhance and clarify  the roles of federal CIOs.", "We conducted this performance audit at the 30 agencies and OMB from  June 2010 to September 2011 in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The CIO position was established by Congress to serve as  a focal point for IT within an agency to address these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Evolution of Agency CIO Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Since l980, federal law has placed the management of IT under the  umbrella of information resources management (IRM). Originating in a  l977 recommendation to Congress from the Commission on Federal  Paperwork, the IRM approach was first enacted into law in the Paperwork  Reduction Act of l980. This act required OMB to oversee federal agency  IRM areas, which combined IT with information management areas,  including information collection, records management, and privacy. The  law also gave agencies a more general responsibility to carry out their  IRM activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner and to  comply with OMB policies and guidelines. To assist in this effort, the law  required that each agency head designate a senior official who would  report directly to the agency head to carry out the IRM responsibilities of  the agency under the law.", "Amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act in l986 and l995 were  designed to strengthen agency and OMB implementation of the law.  Most particularly, the act\u2019s 1995 amendments provided detailed agency  requirements for each IRM area, to match the specific OMB provisions.  In addition, these amendments required agencies to develop, for the first  time, processes to select, control, and evaluate the results of major  information systems initiatives. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as  amended through 1995, senior IRM officials were required to carry out the  responsibilities of their agencies with respect to IRM and report directly to  the head of the agency.", "In l996, the Clinger-Cohen Act supplemented the information technology  management provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act with detailed  requirements for IT capital planning and investment control and  performance and results-based management. The Clinger-Cohen Act  also established the position of agency CIO by amending the Paperwork  Reduction Act to rename the senior IRM officials \u201cchief information  officers\u201d and specifying additional responsibilities for them.", "Accordingly, agency CIOs are required by law to carry out the  responsibilities of their agencies with respect to  information collection and control of paperwork;  statistical policy and coordination;  \uf0b7  privacy, including compliance with the Privacy Act;  information security, including compliance with the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA);  information disclosure, including compliance with the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA); and  information technology management.", "Specifically, with regard to IT management, the CIO is responsible for  implementing and enforcing applicable governmentwide and agency  IT management policies, principles, standards, and guidelines;  \uf0b7  assuming responsibility and accountability for IT investments;  \uf0b7  assuming responsibility for maximizing the value and assessing and  managing the risks of IT acquisitions through a process that, among  other things, is integrated with budget, financial, and program  management decisions, and provides for the selection, management,  and evaluation of IT investments;  \uf0b7  establishing goals for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of  agency operations through the effective use of IT;  \uf0b7  developing, maintaining, and facilitating the implementation of a  sound, secure, and integrated IT architecture; and  \uf0b7  monitoring the performance of IT programs and advising the agency  head whether to continue, modify, or terminate such programs.", "Together, these statutory responsibilities require CIOs to be key leaders  in managing IT and other information functions in a coordinated fashion in  order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of programs and  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Reports on CIOs\u2019 Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on the status of agency CIOs, including their  roles and responsibilities, reporting relationships, backgrounds, and  challenges. We have also reported on private-sector CIO roles and  responsibilities and challenges and compared them with those of federal  CIOs.", "In October l997, we testified on an OMB evaluation of the status of  agency CIO appointments at 27 federal agencies shortly after enactment  of the Clinger-Cohen Act. In that testimony, we noted that OMB had  identified several agencies where the CIO\u2019s duties, qualifications, and  placement met the requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act. According to  OMB, these CIOs had experience, both operationally and technically, in  leveraging the use of information technology, capital planning, setting and  monitoring performance measures, and establishing service levels with  technology users. However, OMB had expressed concerns about the  number of other agencies that had acting CIOs, and about CIOs whose  qualifications did not appear to meet the requirements of the Clinger- Cohen Act or who did not report directly to the head of the agency. We  pointed out that OMB had also raised concerns about agencies where the  CIOs had other major management responsibilities or where it was  unclear whether the CIO\u2019s primary duty was the IRM function. Our  testimony emphasized the importance of OMB following through on its  efforts to assess CIO appointments and resolve outstanding issues. We  noted that, despite the urgent need to deal with major challenges,  including poor security management, and the need to develop, maintain,  and facilitate integrated systems architectures to guide agencies\u2019 system  development efforts, there were many instances of CIOs who had  responsibilities beyond IRM. While some of these CIOs\u2019 additional  responsibilities were minor, in many cases they included major duties,  such as financial operations, human resources, procurement, and grants  management. We stressed that asking the CIO to shoulder a heavy load  of responsibilities would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for  that individual to devote full attention to IRM issues.", "In July 2004, we reported the results of our study, based on a  questionnaire and interviews with CIOs at the same 27 major  departments and agencies that OMB had previously evaluated. Our  study examined 13 major areas of CIO responsibilities\u20147 areas  predominantly in IT management and 6 areas predominantly in  information management, as defined by the relevant laws or deemed  critical to the effective management of IT. These areas are described in  table 1, along with the relevant source.", "Our study found that CIOs were not responsible for all of the information  and IT management areas. Specifically, all CIOs were responsible for  only 5 of the 13 areas, while less than half of the CIOs were assigned  responsibility for information disclosure and statistical policy and  coordination. Overall, the views of these CIOs were mixed as to whether  they could be effective leaders without having responsibility for each  individual area.", "The 2004 study also examined the backgrounds and tenure of CIOs,  noting that they had a wide variety of prior experiences, but generally had  work or educational backgrounds in IT or IT-related fields, as well as  business knowledge related to their agencies. The CIOs and former  agency IT executives in the study believed it was necessary for a CIO to  stay in office for 3 to 5 years to be effective. However, at the time of our  study, the median tenure of permanent CIOs whose time in office had  been completed was about 2 years.", "Based on the study, we also reported on major challenges that the federal  CIOs said they faced in fulfilling their duties. In this regard, over 80  percent of the CIOs had cited implementing effective IT management and  obtaining sufficient and relevant resources as challenges. We stressed  that effectively tackling these reported challenges could improve the  likelihood of a CIO\u2019s success. Further, we highlighted the opportunity for  Congress to consider whether the existing statutory requirements related  to CIO responsibilities and reporting to the agency head reflected the  most effective assignment of information and technology management  responsibilities and reporting relationships.", "In September 2005, we reported on the results of our study of 20 CIOs  of leading private-sector companies. We noted that most of the private- sector CIOs had full or shared responsibility for 9 of 12 functional areas  that we had explored. For the most part, the responsibilities assigned to  these private-sector CIOs were similar to those assigned to federal CIOs.  In only three areas (information dissemination and disclosure, information  collection, and statistical policy) did half or fewer of the CIOs have  responsibility. In 4 of the 12 functional areas, the difference between the  private-sector CIOs and federal CIOs was greater. Fewer of the private- sector CIOs had these responsibilities in each case. We also reported  that private-sector CIOs faced challenges related to increasing IT\u2019s  contribution to their organization\u2019s bottom line\u2013\u2013such as controlling IT  costs, increasing IT efficiencies, and using technology to improve  business processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Reports Identified Challenges within IT and Information Management", "paragraphs": ["Although agencies have taken constructive steps to improve IT and  information management policies and practices, including through  activities of CIOs, we have continued to identify and report on long- standing challenges in the key areas addressed in this report.", "IT strategic planning: In January 2004, we reported on the status of  agencies\u2019 plans for applying information resources to improve the  productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of government programs. At  that time, we noted that agencies generally had IT strategic plans that  addressed elements such as information security and enterprise  architecture, but did not cover key areas specified in the Paperwork  Reduction Act. Agencies cited a variety of reasons for not having  addressed these areas, including that the CIO position had been vacant,  that not including a requirement in guidance was an oversight, or that the  process was being revised. We pointed out that, not only are these  practices based on law, executive orders, OMB policies, and our  guidance, but they are also important ingredients for ensuring effective  strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment  management, which, in turn, make it more likely that the billions of dollars  in government IT investments will be wisely spent. We made a number of  recommendations, including that each agency take action to address IT  strategic planning, performance measurement, and investment  management practices that were not fully in place.", "IT workforce planning: In 1994 and 2001, we reported on the  importance that leading organizations placed on making sure they had  the right mix of skills in their IT workforce. In our 2004 report on CIOs\u2019  roles and responsibilities, about 70 percent of the agency CIOs reported  on a number of substantial IT human capital challenges, including, in  some cases, the need for additional staff. Other challenges included  recruiting, retention, training and development, and succession planning.  In February 2011, we identified strategic human capital management as a  governmentwide high-risk area after finding that the lack of attention to  strategic human capital planning had created a risk to the federal  government\u2019s ability to serve the American people effectively. As our  previous reports have made clear, the widespread lack of attention to  strategic human capital management in the past has created a  fundamental weakness in the federal government\u2019s ability to perform its  missions economically and efficiently.", "Capital planning and investment management: Since 2002, using our  investment management framework, we have reported on the varying  extents to which federal agencies have implemented sound practices for  managing their IT investments. In this regard, we identified agencies that  have made significant improvements by using the framework in  implementing capital planning processes. In contrast, however, we have  continued to identify weaknesses at agencies in many areas, including  immature management processes to support both the selection and  oversight of major IT investments and the measurement of actual versus  expected performance in meeting established performance measures.  For example, in 2007, we reported that two agencies did not have the  processes in place to effectively select and oversee their major  investments. In June 2009, we reported that about half of the projects  we examined at 24 agencies did not receive selection reviews (to confirm  that they support mission needs) or oversight reviews (to ensure that they  were meeting expected cost and schedule targets). Specifically, 12 of the  24 reviewed projects that were identified by OMB as being poorly planned  did not receive a selection review, and 13 of 28 poorly performing projects  we examined had not received an oversight review by a department-level  oversight board. Accordingly, we made recommendations to multiple  agencies to ensure that the projects identified in the report as not having  received oversight reviews received them.", "Information security: Our reviews have noted significant information  security control deficiencies that place agency operations and assets at  risk. In addition, over the last several years, most agencies have not  implemented controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to  computer networks, systems, or information. An underlying cause for  information security weaknesses identified at federal agencies is that they  have not yet fully or effectively implemented key elements for an  agencywide information security program, as required by FISMA. To  address these and other challenges, we have recommended that  agencies fully implement comprehensive, agencywide information  security programs by correcting shortcomings in risk assessments,  information security policies and procedures, security planning, security  training, system tests and evaluations, and remedial actions. Due to the  persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities and the associated  risks, we continue to designate information security as a governmentwide  high-risk issue in our most recent biennial report to Congress, a  designation we have made in each report since 1997.", "Enterprise architecture: We have reported on the status of major federal  department and agency enterprise architecture efforts. We found that  the state of the enterprise architecture programs at the major federal  departments and agencies was mixed, with several having very immature  programs, several having more mature programs, and most being  somewhere in between. Collectively, agencies faced barriers or  challenges in implementing their enterprise architectures, such as  overcoming organizational parochialism and cultural resistance, having  adequate resources (human capital and funding), and fostering top  management understanding. To assist the agencies in addressing these  challenges, we have made numerous recommendations aimed at  ensuring that their respective enterprise architecture programs develop  and implement plans for fully satisfying each of the conditions in our  enterprise architecture management maturity framework. In addition, in  our most recent high-risk update report we identified possible areas  where enterprise architecture could help to alleviate some challenges. For  example, we suggested that one agency align its corporate architecture  and its component organization architectures to avoid investments that  provide similar but duplicative functionality.", "Systems acquisition, development, and integration: Our work has shown  that applying rigorous practices to the acquisition or development of IT  systems or the acquisition of IT services can improve the likelihood of  success. In addition, we have identified leading commercial practices for  outsourcing IT services that government entities could use to enhance their  acquisition of IT systems and services. We have evaluated several  agencies\u2019 software development or acquisition processes and reported that  agencies are not consistently using rigorous or disciplined system  management practices. For example, after reviewing the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Atlas investment, we recommended that the agency  implement effective management controls and capabilities by, among other  things, revising and updating its cost-benefit analysis; making the program  office operational; developing and implementing rigorous performance  program management practices; and ensuring plans fully disclose the  system capabilities, schedule, cost, and benefits to be delivered. In  addition, ensuring that effective system acquisition management controls  are implemented on each agency business system investment remains a  formidable challenge, as our recent reports on management weaknesses  associated with individual programs have demonstrated. For example, we  recently reported that the Department of Defense\u2019s large-scale software- intensive system acquisitions continued to fall short of cost, schedule, and  performance expectations. Specifically, our report noted that six of the  department\u2019s nine enterprise resource planning systems had experienced  schedule delays ranging from 2 to 12 years, and five had incurred cost  increases ranging from $530 million to $2.4 billion.", "E-government initiatives: In December 2004, we reported the results of  our review of the implementation status of major provisions from the E- Government Act of 2002, which required a wide range of activities  across the federal government aimed at promoting electronic  government, such as providing the public with access to government  information and services. We found that, although the government had  made progress in implementing the act, the act\u2019s requirements were not  always fully addressed. Specifically, OMB had not (1) ensured that a  study on using IT to enhance crisis preparedness and response had been  conducted that addressed the content specified by the act, (2) established  a required program to encourage contractor innovation and excellence in  facilitating the development and enhancement of electronic government  services and processes, or (3) ensured the development and  maintenance of a required repository and website of information about  research and development funded by the federal government. We made  recommendations to OMB aimed at ensuring more consistent  implementation of the act\u2019s requirements.", "We have also reported on various challenges agencies faced in meeting  information management requirements, including in the areas of privacy,  information collection, records management, information disclosure, and  information dissemination.", "In 2002 and 2003, we reported on agencies\u2019 handling of the personal  information they collect and whether this handling conforms to the Privacy  Act and other laws and guidance. In the 2002 report, we made  recommendations to selected agencies aimed at strengthening their  compliance with privacy requirements. In the 2003 report, we made  recommendations to OMB, which included directing agencies to correct  compliance deficiencies, monitoring agency compliance, and reassessing  OMB guidance.", "In 2005, we reviewed agency compliance with information collection  clearance requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act. In an  analysis of 12 case studies, we found that while CIOs generally reviewed  information collections and certified that they met the standards in the act,  in a significant number of instances, agencies did not provide support for  the certifications, as the law requires. We recommended that OMB and  the agencies take steps to improve review processes and compliance  with the act.", "In 2008, we reviewed the management of e-mail records at four agencies  and found agency practices did not always conform to requirements. We  recommended that the National Archives and Records Administration  develop and implement an oversight approach that provides adequate  assurance that agencies are following its guidance, including both regular  assessments of agency records and records management programs and  reporting on these assessments.", "Also in 2008, we reported on trends in Freedom of Information Act  processing and agencies\u2019 progress in addressing backlogs of overdue  FOIA requests. We found weaknesses in agency reporting on FOIA  processing and recommended, among other things, that guidance be  improved for agencies to track and report on overdue requests and plans  to meet future backlog goals.", "In July 2010, we identified and described current uses of web 2.0  technologies by federal agencies to disseminate information.  Specifically, we found that the federal government may face challenges in  determining how to appropriately limit collection and use of personal  information as agencies utilize these technologies and how and when to  extend privacy protections to information collected and used by third-party  providers of web 2.0 services. In July 2011, we identified ways agencies  are using social media to interact with the public and assessed the extent  to which they had policies in place for managing and identifying records,  protecting personal information, and ensuring the security of federal  information and systems. We made recommendations to 21 agencies to  improve their development and implementation of social media policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Has Several Initiatives Under Way to Improve the Oversight and Management of IT, Including Changing the Role of Federal Agency CIOs", "paragraphs": ["On March 5, 2009, President Obama designated the Administrator of  OMB\u2019s Office of Electronic Government and Information Technology as  the first Federal Chief Information Officer.

This 18-month plan specified five major goals:  strengthening program management, streamlining governance and  improving accountability, increasing engagement with industry, aligning  the acquisition process with the technology cycle, and applying \u201clight  technology\u201d and shared solutions. As part of this plan, OMB has  initiatives under way to, among other things, strengthen agencies\u2019  investment review boards and to consolidate federal data centers. The  plan stated that OMB will work with Congress to consolidate commodity  IT spending (e.g., e-mail, data centers, content management systems,  web infrastructure) under agency CIOs. Further, the plan called for the  role of federal agency CIOs to focus more on IT portfolio management.", "In March 2011, we testified on the efforts of OMB and the Federal CIO to  improve the oversight and management of IT investments in light of the  problems that agencies have continued to experience with establishing IT  governance processes to manage such investments. These initiatives  included increasing the accountability of agency CIOs through the use of  the IT Dashboard, a public website established in June 2009 that  provides detailed information, including performance ratings, for over 800  major IT investments at federal agencies. Each investment\u2019s performance  data are updated monthly, which is a major improvement from the  quarterly reporting cycle used by OMB\u2019s prior oversight mechanisms.  However, in a series of reviews, we have found that the data on the  Dashboard were not always accurate. Specifically, we found that the  Dashboard ratings were not always consistent with agency performance  data.", "OMB has also initiated efforts to improve the management of IT  investments needing attention. In particular, in January 2010, the Federal  CIO began leading TechStat sessions\u2014a review of selected IT  investments between OMB and agency leadership to increase  accountability and transparency and improve performance.

The units with which they shared  responsibilities varied, as did the roles the CIO played. For example, in  the area of records management, one CIO reported working closely with  the agency\u2019s data manager and making recommendations regarding  records management. In the privacy area, one CIO reported  coordinating with the agency\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer, general  counsel, and human resources offices to address any privacy issues. To  ensure accuracy of information disseminated, one CIO reported  collaborating with the agency\u2019s Office of Public Affairs.", "The areas in which the least number of CIOs reported they were  responsible were statistical policy and coordination and information  disclosure. In this regard, 21 CIOs stated that statistical policy and  coordination was handled by other offices within their agencies, such as a  policy or research office. This included components functioning as  Principal Statistical Agencies.

As part of  this process, CIOs are responsible for advising the agency head on  whether IT programs and projects should be continued, modified, or  terminated. In order to carry out these responsibilities, CIOs should be  positioned within their agencies to successfully exercise their authority.

Another  agency began an agencywide consolidation effort so that the CIO\u2019s  responsibility will be delegated to one person to centrally manage IT assets  instead of multiple agency CIOs. This agency recently implemented a  policy that has given one individual the title of CIO and stated that the CIO  will assume oversight, management, ownership, and control of all  departmental IT infrastructure assets. Another agency was centralizing  decision-making authority in the office of the CIO for addressing troubled IT  investments. In addition, one agency conducted a reorganization that  placed component CIOs under the agency CIO.

For example, one agency faced challenges with distributing  technical support to 27 organizational units. After the agency head  directed the consolidation of IT support services under the CIO, the  agency gained a better understanding of spending on services and  equipment needed to provide IT support. In another example, an agency  had been operating under separate e-mail systems, which prevented it  from maximizing operational efficiency and productivity. Specifically, the  agency faced high costs for maintaining individual systems; difficulty  sending broadcast e-mails across the entire department, thus preventing  the e-mails from being received in a timely fashion; difficulty obtaining  accurate and complete contact information for all employees in one global  address list; and difficulty operating calendar appointments. In order to  address these challenges, the agency utilized a cloud-based service  solution, which the agency explained would result in lower costs per user,  an improved security posture, and a unified communication strategy.", "In addition, agency CIOs told us their agency had implemented changes  based upon lessons learned that have improved the effectiveness of the  CIO. For example, while several CIOs implemented investment review  boards or similar governance mechanisms, three CIOs explained that at  their agency, senior-level officials, including deputy secretaries, and in  one instance, an undersecretary, chaired these boards, which provided  higher visibility over the selection, control, and evaluation of IT  investments. Additionally, one CIO explained that implementing an  enterprisewide licensing solution to optimize the agency\u2019s buying power  resulted in a savings of $200 million. One told us about improved  effectiveness in information security through the use of a centralized  information security center.

Two CIOs indicated that their agency did not have such a  process due to a shortage of resources or because they did not see the  development of such a process as being their responsibility. Without  structured processes for capturing and documenting these lessons  learned, agencies risk both losing the ability to share knowledge acquired  with CIOs\u2019 experience and increasing the time required for newly hired  CIOs to become effective. Additionally, the lack of internal documented  processes for capturing lessons learned within agencies has the potential  to inhibit the Management Best Practices Committee\u2019s ability to effectively  identify, document, and disseminate individual agencies\u2019 lessons learned  and best practices throughout the federal government.

These limitations, which include control and influence over IT budgets,  commodity IT investments, and staffing decisions, are consistent with  issues we have previously identified that prevented CIOs from advising  and influencing their agencies in managing IT for successful outcomes.  While OMB\u2019s guidance reaffirms CIO authorities and responsibilities to  influence IT outcomes, it does not establish measures of accountability.

However, as discussed earlier,  most of the agencies in our study reported that they had not established  processes for documenting internal lessons learned. Further, the guidance  to which OMB\u2019s officials referred is limited to lessons learned for post- implementation reviews of specific IT projects and does not include the  broader spectrum of IT management areas, such as program management  and information security. As such, we continue to believe that agencies  could benefit from having established internal processes for documenting  lessons learned across the broader spectrum of IT management areas  and, therefore, believe our recommendation is warranted.", "Although we made no specific recommendations to the 30 agencies  included in our review, we sent each agency a draft of the report for  comment.

However,  the CIO also stated that, while our report did not identify legislative  changes needed to enhance current CIOs\u2019 authority and generally felt  that existing law provides sufficient authority, the department believes  there are legislative opportunities to clarify and strengthen CIO  authorities that should be pursued, such as overlap in responsibilities  between the CIO and other officials. The department stated that it was  taking actions to address this issue internally. As discussed earlier in  this report, the effectiveness of agency CIOs depends in large  measure on their having clear roles and authorities. As noted,  however, we found no evidence indicating that legislative changes are  needed to achieve this. Rather, our study results determined that  these officials face limitations that hinder their ability to effectively  exercise their current authorities.

This included reports from  Gartner and Deloitte on the role of federal CIOs and OMB\u2019s 25 Point  Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology  Management.

We selected the three independent agencies  based on whether they had a CIO in place when our review began and  the size of the agency\u2019s 2011 budget estimates. Using the questionnaire,  we requested information on whether each CIO was responsible for each  of 13 information technology (IT) and information management areas that  we identified as either required by statute or critical to effective IT  management in our 2004 report.

We also asked each agency to supply the name, beginn and ending dates in office, and circumstances (e.g., whether they were an acting or permanent position) of each of the individuals who ha served as CIO at the agency since 2003. Further, we also collected and  reviewed any supporting documentation of recent departmental changes.", "We then interviewed each of the CIOs who were in place at the time of  our review (see app. II for a list of the CIOs) in order to validate  responses from the questionnaire and to obtain an understanding of their views on the 13 IT and information management areas including roles  and responsibilities, changes needed to enhance authority and  effectiveness, and lessons learned for managing information and  technology.", "From the questionnaire and interview responses, we analyzed CIO responses to determine their current roles and responsibilities and  reporting relationships with agency heads.

Additionally, we  assessed the CIOs\u2019 reported time spent in the 13 IT and information  management areas of responsibility and the importance of each area to  them, as well as their views on changes needed to improve their authorit y  and effectiveness. We also reviewed CIOs\u2019 qualifications and current and  former CIOs\u2019 tenure. Further, we analyzed CIO responses to questions  concerning changes needed to improve their authority and effectiveness  and compared them to the authority described in federal IT laws. We  supplemented our analysis by reviewing our prior reports related to  s\u2019  agency CIO authority and IT management challenges. We also ana CIOs\u2019 comments related to lessons learned that they have used to  improve IT management at their agency.
