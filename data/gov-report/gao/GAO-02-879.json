The declaration calls for a continuation of discussions on liberalizing trade in agriculture and services which began in 2000. In addition, it provides for new talks on market access for nonagricultural products, trade and the environment, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, and other issues. Four main factors led to the World Trade Organization's successful launch of new multilateral trade negotiations in Doha. First, the United States' and the European Union's clear support of the launch, bolstered by the strong personal relationship between the U.S. Trade Representative and the European Union Commissioner for Trade, facilitated agreement on the agenda for new negotiations. Second, World Trade Organization members applied an effective preparation strategy before the Doha ministerial conference. Third, some key developments at the Doha conference helped gain support from the developing countries for launching negotiations. Last, World Trade Organization officials and member country representatives said that the tragic events of September 11th galvanized Organization members to show their support for a strong and healthy worldwide trading system. The Doha Declaration requires negotiators to make early, crucial decisions because it mandates several important interim deadlines. One of these deadlines involves decisions on agricultural trade, where World Trade Organization members must agree on modalities, or methodologies, timetables, and desired targets, for reducing agricultural export subsidies, domestic support, and agricultural tariffs by March 31, 2003. The second interim deadline concerns the \"Singapore issues,\" which Organization members must decide whether to include in the negotiations by the next ministerial conference in September 2003. The overriding challenge for the World Trade Organization in the negotiations will be to forge consensus within its large and diverse membership and to deal with several difficult organizational issues.

This round resulted in over a dozen separate agreements  that, among others, covered intellectual property rights and trade in  services and strengthened existing disciplines on agriculture. It also  established a stronger dispute settlement process than had been available  under the GATT. Moreover, unlike previous trade rounds, the Uruguay  Round agreements were part of a \u201csingle undertaking,\u201d meaning that all  GATT members had to agree to all their provisions, with no discretion as to  which accords they wished to accept.", "The WTO administers rules for international trade, provides a mechanism  for settling disputes, and provides a forum for conducting trade  negotiations. WTO membership has increased since its creation to 144  members, up from 90 GATT members when the Uruguay Round was  launched in 1986. WTO membership is also diverse in terms of economic  development, consisting of all developed countries and a large percentage  of developing countries, from the more advanced to the very poor.  Specifically, while the WTO has no formal definition of a \u201cdeveloping  country,\u201d the World Bank classifies 105 current WTO members, or  approximately 73 percent, as developing countries.

The WTO General Council, made up of  representatives from all WTO member governments, implements decisions  adopted by the members in between ministerial conferences.  Decisionmaking in the WTO is largely based on consensus among its  members rather than on a majority of member votes as it is in many other  international organizations.", "Four ministerial conferences have taken place since the WTO\u2019s creation.  Prior to the third ministerial conference, held in Seattle in December 1999,  WTO members announced their intention to launch a new round of  multilateral trade negotiations. However, the Seattle conference ended  without launching negotiations. Following four days of intensive talks, the  conference was suspended without issuing a ministerial declaration. The  failure to launch a new round in Seattle resulted from a combination of  circumstances, including a lack of agreement among members on the  issues to be discussed in a new round, the sensitivity and complexity of  trade issues under consideration, and inherent difficulties in the  negotiation process.", "Ultimately, at the fourth ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar, in  November 2001, WTO members were able to reach consensus on a new  negotiating effort, officially called the Doha Development Agenda. The  Doha Declaration sets forth a work program for the negotiations to be  concluded by January 1, 2005. Figure 1 illustrates the organizational  structure that the WTO has established to conduct the negotiations  mandated by the Doha Declaration.", "The new negotiating effort will encompass agriculture and trade in  services, two critical areas where negotiations have been ongoing since  2000, under an existing Uruguay Round mandate. Special sessions of  standing WTO bodies will also address the relationship between trade and  the environment; attempt to clarify and improve provisions of the WTO  Dispute Settlement Understanding; and negotiate the establishment of a  multilateral notification and registration system for geographical indications for wines and spirits.  The WTO also called for a special  session of the Trade and Development Committee to identify and attempt  to strengthen special and differential treatment provisions for developing  countries. The status of this body has been the subject of debate and is  unclear. While some countries consider it to be a legitimate negotiating  group, the United States and several other countries contend that it belongs  under the general Doha work program. In addition to the special sessions,  two new negotiating groups have been created to review and propose  revisions to WTO disciplines dealing with trade rules and to recommend  cuts in tariffs and other steps to facilitate market access for nonagricultural  products. Chairpersons of special sessions and new negotiating groups  have been appointed by the WTO membership to serve up to the fifth  ministerial conference in 2003, at which time all appointments will be  reviewed.

First, a strong relationship  between the United States and the European Union, particularly the U.S.  Trade Representative (USTR) and the European Union (EU) Commissioner  for Trade, helped forge consensus among other WTO members. Second,  WTO members used an effective strategy to prepare for the Doha  ministerial conference. Third, two key developments occurring during the  Doha ministerial greatly contributed to the developing countries\u2019,  particularly African countries\u2019, willingness to launch negotiations. Finally,  the tragic events of September 11th helped galvanize WTO members to show  their support for a strong and healthy worldwide trading system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S.-EU Relationship Was Critical", "paragraphs": ["The strong support on the part of the United States and the European  Union for the negotiations, bolstered by the positive relationship between  the U.S. Trade Representative and the EU Commissioner for Trade, helped  bring together other WTO members on specific issues and on the overall  goal of launching a new set of global trade negotiations. WTO members did  not agree to launch a new set of trade negotiations at the 1999 ministerial  conference in Seattle due, in part, to a lack of consensus among major  trading countries, especially the United States and the European Union. In  Doha, by contrast, the United States and the European Union, while not  agreeing on all of the key issues, were united behind a common goal of  launching a new round. According to some member country  representatives, the long-standing friendship between the U.S. Trade  Representative and the EU Trade Commissioner, dating back to the 1980s,  was a positive force in launching the negotiations. They noted that the two  officials used their personal rapport to garner support for an agenda for  these negotiations. Examples cited included their efforts to build bridges  with developing countries and to work together to devise compromise  language on trade and the environment, which allowed the European  Union to make crucial concessions in agriculture. Several WTO member  country representatives told us that agreement between the United States  and the European Union was essential to forging a consensus to launch  negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preparation Strategy Was Effective", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. officials and foreign government representatives, a key  strategy for achieving consensus to launch negotiations was holding two  informal \u201cmini-ministerials,\u201d or informal meetings, among a cross section  of developed and developing country members, in the months before the  Doha ministerial conference. According to U.S. and foreign officials, these  meetings helped to rebuild personal relationships among ministers that  were crucial to overcoming the negative atmosphere evidenced by the  WTO\u2019s failure to launch negotiations in Seattle in 1999. Further, throughout  2001, trade ministers from major trading countries met individually with  other ministers, especially from developing countries. In addition,  developing countries, including many in Africa, participated in a network of  informal meetings to prepare for the ministerial. Some developing country  representatives said that in contrast to preparations before the Seattle  ministerial, these efforts showed willingness on the part of developed  countries to better understand and address their concerns. For example,  several foreign representatives cited the fact that the U.S. Trade  Representative spent a great deal of time before the Doha ministerial  listening to developing countries\u2019 views, particularly those of African  nations. They added that this was a positive step in relations between  developed and developing WTO member countries. According to U.S. and  WTO officials and foreign representatives, this effort was significant, as  negotiations could not have been launched without the developing  countries\u2019 support.", "Another preparatory strategy that helped WTO members reach consensus  on an agenda for new negotiations was the nature of the text used as the  basis for discussion at the ministerial meeting. Before the Doha ministerial,  the General Council chair produced his own text based on input he  received during exhaustive meetings with small groups of WTO members.  This text reflected the consensus views of members on the issues, based on  the chair\u2019s own best judgment. In contrast, before the Seattle ministerial  conference, specific proposals from various member countries on each  issue drove the discussions on what should be included in the draft  declaration. This led to a lengthy (32 page) draft declaration text that was a  compendium of member country positions, including nearly 400 bracketed  items, indicating disagreement among members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Developments in Doha Won Developing Country Support", "paragraphs": ["WTO officials and foreign representatives said that two developments at  the Doha ministerial conference were crucial to gaining developing  countries\u2019 support to launch a new set of negotiations. First, the WTO  granted the European Union a waiver from WTO\u2019s most-favored-nation  clause (MFN) to continue providing preferential market access to African,  Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries through its Cotonou Agreement, which was signed in 2000.   The Cotonou Agreement will be valid for 20  years, during which time the European Union and ACP countries can enter  into additional economic integration agreements, progressively removing  barriers to trade. In addition, the agreement includes a pledge of 13.5  billion euros in development assistance to ACP countries for the initial 5- year period. The Secretary General of the ACP group has concluded that  the Cotonou Agreement will help integrate ACP countries into the world  economy by reinforcing regional integration, thus helping them to benefit  from globalization.", "Second, WTO officials and U.S. and foreign country representatives said  the adoption at Doha of a declaration clarifying the relationship between  the WTO\u2019s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property  Rights (TRIPS) and public health was critical to gaining the support of  many African nations. The Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and  Public Health states that the TRIPS agreement \u201cdoes not and should not  prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health.\u201d  Prior to  the ministerial, African nations, nongovernmental organizations, and  others had argued that TRIPS could prevent developing countries from  gaining access to medicines needed to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,  malaria, and other epidemics (see app. I for a further discussion of this  declaration)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "September 11th Tragedy Galvanized Support for Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["The final major factor that U.S. and WTO officials and member country  representatives cited as contributing to the ministerial\u2019s success was the  tragic events of September 11th. They said that after September 11th, many  WTO members felt that it was essential for there to be a successful major  international meeting to demonstrate the strength of the international  community. Further, given the potential impact of the attacks on the world  economy, which was already in recession, the ministerial would be an  important barometer of the strength of the multilateral trading system.

This is attributable to the extreme importance  of agricultural trade reform for a large number of WTO member countries,  many of which want to see progress in the agriculture talks before coming  to agreement on other issues. However, meeting this deadline will be  difficult, because it necessitates reaching agreement on areas of long- standing dispute, particularly with regard to agricultural export subsidies  and domestic support payments, which have generated strong domestic  constituency concerns. Specifically, it is the negotiators\u2019 intention to agree  on a target and timetable for phasing out agricultural export subsidies.  They will also need to agree on a definition of the types of domestic  agricultural support payments that should be considered trade-distorting.  Agricultural modalities also include devising a formula for WTO members  to reduce tariffs, which, while important, is less controversial.", "Achieving agricultural trade reform in the negotiations is critical because  improving access to countries\u2019 agricultural markets is a major priority for a  wide range of WTO member countries, including major agricultural  exporters such as Canada, Australia, and Brazil, who want to expand their  overseas markets. Proponents also include many developing countries,  among them Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Thailand, who  wish to take advantage of their natural competitive advantage in the  agricultural sector. Agricultural reform is also critical to the United States,  whose farmers have faced a finite domestic market over the past several  years, falling international commodity prices, and a strong dollar that had  effectively inflated the cost of their exports to foreign markets. Because  agricultural trade is such a top priority to so many WTO members, the chair  of the special session of the Committee on Agriculture has called it a key to  completion of the negotiations, stating that without progress in agriculture,  there will be no progress in the overall round.", "Meeting the March 2003 interim deadline on modalities for export  subsidies and domestic support payments will be difficult, as these areas  have been particularly contentious, generating intense domestic  constituency concerns in the European Union, Japan, and the United  States. For the European Union, the goals set out in the Doha Declaration  for phasing out export subsidies present a serious challenge. Over the  years, European farmers have come to rely on the generous support and  subsidies provided under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In fact,  the CAP has become the single biggest expenditure in the EU budget,  representing approximately 42 percent of its budget. In recent years, the  European Union has begun to reform the CAP and lower costs.  Nevertheless, EU farmers in certain countries, such as France, wield  considerable political power and could challenge the positions taken by  governments that would agree to eliminate export subsidies. Similarly, in  Japan, accepting substantial cuts in domestic support for agriculture and  reduced tariffs on agricultural imports could jeopardize farmers\u2019 support  for the current government. Meanwhile, in May 2002, the United States  enacted the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-171),  which will raise U.S. spending on domestic support for agriculture by about  $73.5 billion over the next 10 years.", "Many WTO member countries are aggressively pursuing the goal of  reducing and eventually eliminating export subsidies, including the 18- country coalition known as the Cairns Group, which accounts for one- third of the world\u2019s agricultural exports, as well as India, Mexico, Nigeria,  and the United States. The European Union is the main target of the Doha  mandate regarding export subsidies, as its subsidies far exceed those of  other countries. As shown in figure 3, in 1998 the European Union was  responsible for about 90 percent ($6.6 billion) of all agricultural export  subsidies used worldwide. In 2000, EU expenditures on export subsidies  were about 170 times the amount paid by the United States.  The  European Union has stated that it cannot agree to eliminate export  subsidies completely. The European Union and other WTO member  countries maintain that disciplining export subsidies without addressing  other programs affecting export competition, such as U.S. export credit  guarantees, would be discriminatory.", "Like export subsidies, the Doha mandate of reducing domestic support  payments to farmers is highly controversial. The Cairns Group maintains  that only non-trade-distorting support payments, such as for pest and  disease control measures, should be allowed. Non-trade-distorting  domestic support programs are government funded and typically are not  directed at particular products or related to production levels or prices.  Although Japan and the European Union are willing to reduce support  payments to their farmers, they want to maintain some types of payments  linked to production. EU officials, for example, argue that certain  payments to farmers, based on measurement such as acreage or number of  animals, should continue to be allowed, provided they are tied to limits on  production and serve worthwhile goals. These goals include stewardship of  the rural environment and more humane treatment of farm animals. The  United States has called for simplifying the rules for domestic support and  establishing a ceiling on trade-distorting support that applies  proportionately to all countries. As shown in figure 4, the European Union  has provided much higher levels of support to its farmers than have other  WTO members, and it also enjoys a much higher allowable ceiling for such  support under its Uruguay Round commitments.", "A third aspect of the decision on modalities is to devise a formula for  reducing tariffs on agricultural products. While less contentious than  attempts to reach agreement on modalities for export subsidies and  domestic support payments, agreeing on how to reduce agricultural tariffs  is important, particularly to the United States. According to the U.S.  Undersecretary of Agriculture, the average tariff for U.S. agricultural  products is 12 percent, while the average global tariffs for food and  agricultural products worldwide are 62 percent. Japan\u2019s tariffs average 59  percent, while the Cairns Group\u2019s and the EU\u2019s are 30 percent. Tariff  reductions are a sensitive issue for many developing countries. Some  developing countries are reluctant to bring tariffs down to a level that  might compromise the livelihood of significant segments of their  populations who depend on agricultural production. Once WTO members  agree on agricultural tariff modalities, they must submit tariff schedules  detailing their proposed new tariff levels by the fifth ministerial conference  in September 2003. Accomplishing this task 6 months after the March  modalities deadline could be difficult for some WTO members. For  example, some developing countries have limited staff, experience, and  resources. In addition, the European Union must create tariff schedules not  only for its current members but also for the 10 countries that are  candidates to become EU members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meeting Interim Deadline on Singapore Issues Is Highly Contentious", "paragraphs": ["A second critical decision point in the Doha Development Agenda involves  whether negotiations should proceed on what are generally referred to as  the Singapore issues, which include issues related to investment,  competition, trade facilitation, and transparency in government  procurement. Because of the extreme sensitivity of these issues,  particularly regarding competition and investment, WTO members decided  in Doha to delay the start of formal negotiations on these topics until they  could make certain decisions at the fifth ministerial conference in 2003.  These decisions are of key importance, because they, along with progress  in agriculture, are likely to drive the rest of the negotiations. EU officials  insist that moving forward with negotiations on competition and  investment is essential to the successful conclusion of the overall  negotiations, while developing countries have consistently opposed  including them in the talks.", "Basic disagreement among WTO members on the meaning of the language  in the Doha Declaration is likely to make the upcoming decision on the  Singapore issues difficult, particularly in the areas of trade and investment  and trade and competition. The language in the declaration is ambiguous  on this issue. It states that for each of the four areas, negotiations should  take place after the fifth ministerial conference \u201con the basis of a decision  to be taken, by explicit consensus, at that Session on modalities of  negotiations.\u201d  In the view of developed countries, including the United  States and the European Union, the declaration calls for negotiations on  these issues to be launched after the fifth ministerial in September 2003.  However, India, with the support of some other developing countries,  maintains that no such consensus was reached at Doha. In Doha, India held  up consensus until it obtained a statement from the ministerial conference  chair that each WTO member would have \u201cthe right to take a position on  modalities that would prevent negotiations from proceeding \u2026until that  member is prepared to join in an explicit consensus.\u201d The general view  among WTO member representatives in Geneva is that the Doha  Declaration does not mandate that negotiations on the Singapore issues be  launched after the fifth ministerial conference. Instead, a decision on  whether to proceed with these negotiations will have to be made at that  2003 ministerial meeting.", "The main controversy surrounding the Singapore issues deals with the EU\u2019s  strong advocacy for negotiations on trade and investment and trade and  competition. Japan and South Korea also support negotiating these issues.  The European Union argues that investment rules based on the principles  of national treatment, MFN treatment, transparency, and the right to  establish businesses overseas are necessary to contribute to a stable and  predictable global business climate for foreign direct investment.  Regarding trade and competition policy, the European Union advocates  incorporating basic principles into domestic law, including  nondiscrimination, transparency, due process, judicial review, a ban on  certain cartels, and sufficient enforcement powers.", "Many developing countries, on the other hand, led by a group of countries  known as the Like-Minded Group, have consistently expressed their  strong opposition to the inclusion of the Singapore issues in the negotiating  agenda. For example, India has acted to prevent any discussions in the  applicable WTO working groups on these issues. India is concerned that  any discussion might be construed as a negotiation, rather than as an effort  to clarify the issues. India argued that undertaking new obligations in these  areas would present too great a burden on developing countries. In fact,  many developing countries maintain that they are still having difficulty  implementing their Uruguay Round obligations (see app. I for a discussion  of implementation issues).

They argue that they should not be held to the same standard of trade  liberalization as the developed country members. Balancing these different  views will be a challenge in the negotiations. Further, China\u2019s recent  membership in the WTO could affect the dynamics of the organization,  partly because of the size of its economy.", "WTO members include high-income countries like the United States, which  alone accounts for about 13 percent of world trade; large, low-income  countries like China and India, each having populations of over 1 billion;  and members like Dominica, with fewer than 71,000 inhabitants, and  Mongolia, which accounts for less than 0.01 percent of world trade. As  mentioned earlier, the World Bank classifies 105 current WTO members, or  approximately 73 percent, as developing countries, and about 21 percent of  these as least developed countries. One WTO official pointed out that 80  percent of the WTO membership represents only 1.7 percent of world  trade.", "Developing countries are taking a more active role in the current  negotiations as compared with the Uruguay Round, and they will scrutinize  more closely the commitments they agree to make. Notably, WTO members  are calling the current negotiations the Doha Development Agenda,  symbolizing the special emphasis on meeting the needs of developing  countries. According to a WTO official and a developing country  representative in Geneva, many developing country members have  maintained that they had not fully realized that, under the Uruguay Round,  all WTO members were obligated to implement the complete package of  agreements and were to be held accountable by the WTO\u2019s dispute  settlement system. (Prior to the completion of the Uruguay Round, parties  to GATT could opt out of agreements if they so chose.) One WTO official  believed that, because WTO developing country members now better  understand the WTO dispute settlement process, they are less likely to  accept vague language in order to reach a consensus, as compared with the  previous round. He said that this could make it harder to reach consensus,  as negotiators demand more clarity. Finally, some developing country  members have had difficulty implementing their Uruguay Round  obligations.", "Some developing country members have views on trade liberalization that  are different from those of their developed country counterparts. Although  many developing countries are willing to liberalize their markets to gain  concessions in areas in which they are most competitive, particularly in  agricultural trade, others maintain that they need special exceptions to  trade liberalization to help them develop. For example, some of these  developing country members want to opt out of lowering tariffs for certain  products, reevaluate existing tariff bindings for food security reasons, or  continue to use export subsidies to promote development.", "The WTO\u2019s challenge lies in the fact that the Doha Declaration calls for  strengthening the ability of developing countries to argue for exceptions to  trade liberalization through the WTO\u2019s \u201cspecial and differential treatment\u201d  provisions. By the end of July 2002, the Committee on Trade and  Development was to identify those special and differential treatment  provisions that are mandatory and those that are nonbinding in character,  and to examine ways in which these provisions could be made more  precise and effective. On July 24, 2002, the committee recommended that  the General Council agree to set up a monitoring mechanism, whose details  would be worked out later. It further asked the General Council to approve  extending until December 31, 2002, the committee\u2019s deadline for making  clear recommendations for decisions on special and differential treatment.  According to a WTO official, this exercise will be difficult, given the  potential for such exceptions to undermine the overall negotiations\u2019 goal to  increase trade liberalization.", "China\u2019s entry as a new member of the WTO in 2001 is another sign of the  diversity of the WTO\u2019s membership. Because China is a large economy and  a significant trader, as well as a developing country under World Bank  standards, the role it chooses to take in the WTO could affect the  dynamics of the organization and therefore the negotiations. In fact, one  high-level WTO official noted that China\u2019s new mission to the WTO in  Geneva is the fourth largest among the membership. WTO officials and  member country representatives with whom we spoke generally believed  that China would act in its own national interest and not necessarily side in  all cases with any one bloc of WTO member countries. One WTO  representative from a developing country predicted that China would form  alliances where it made sense for China. Many WTO country  representatives predicted that China would be active in the negotiations  and would be likely to support further trade liberalization by other WTO  members. However, it has been reported that Chinese officials have  recently taken the position that China should not be expected to make  significant concessions in the negotiations given the substantial  commitments it has already made in joining the WTO, particularly in the  area of market access for nonagricultural products. In addition, one WTO  country representative predicted that China\u2019s membership might have an  impact on the outcome of the WTO negotiations on trade remedies.

In addition, the countries with the highest  tariffs, primarily developing countries, are resistant to reducing their tariffs  for several reasons. First, many already enjoy dutyfree access through U.S.  and EU trade preference programs, so further reductions in MFN rates will  only dilute the competitive advantage they receive from these programs.  Second, many developing countries are resistant to making significant  reductions in their nonagricultural tariffs, or are opposed to their  elimination, because they rely on tariffs as a significant source of revenue.", "The key points of controversy will likely surround the issues of tariff  reciprocity among countries, tariff peaks, and tariff escalation.

Guidelines  and procedures for the negotiations include two key principles: no sectors  should be excluded from the negotiations; and negotiations can occur in  bilateral, plurilateral, or multilateral (including all members) groups,  mainly using a request-offer method. However, according to a WTO  official, the negotiations will be conducted predominantly on a bilateral  basis using the request-offer approach, with results applied to all WTO  members on an MFN basis.", "Although it is probably one of the least controversial issues on the Doha  agenda, the services negotiations face several difficulties. One challenge  is to convince developing countries to open up their services sectors.  According to a U.S. services industry representative, this difficulty is  attributable, in part, to the fact that developed countries can offer few  concessions in the services area because their barriers are already so low  in many sectors. Another difficulty is that some areas of trade in services  that developing countries are interested in pursuing may be difficult to  negotiate. For example, the tourism sector is one of the developing  countries\u2019 best economic growth opportunities. But liberalization in this  sector will be difficult to negotiate because of its linkage to other sectors  such as air and road transport and financial services. Finally, services  negotiations are by nature especially complex, time consuming, and  resource intensive. For example, they can involve a separate set of bilateral  negotiations among all 144 WTO member countries, for each and every  sector; and they would involve agreeing to change domestic laws and  regulations and developing and implementing new administrative  procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade and the Environment", "paragraphs": ["For the first time, the WTO will begin negotiations on trade and  environment issues.

There are approximately 200 multilateral  environmental agreements in place today. In addition, the negotiations are  to address procedures for exchanging information between WTO  committees and MEA secretariats, and the criteria for granting observer  status. They are also to liberalize trade in environmental goods and  services. These negotiations will be conducted in special sessions of the  existing WTO Committee on Trade and Environment.", "During the preparation period before the Doha ministerial, the European  Union demanded that the negotiations include environmental issues.  Developing countries have generally resisted any efforts to negotiate these  issues in the WTO, arguing that industrialized countries might use  environmental standards as a form of \u201cgreen\u201d protectionism. The United  States also opposed the EU\u2019s objectives for addressing environment in the  WTO. Of the three environment-related issues that the European Union  specifically sought at the Doha ministerial, only the relationship between  MEAs and WTO rules became part of the negotiating agenda. The European  Union also sought negotiations to clarify countries\u2019 use of the  \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d in taking trade measures to protect  environmental and human health, and of \u201ceco-labeling.\u201d However, the  issue of precaution was left out of the Doha Declaration entirely, while eco- labeling could be added to the negotiations if members decide at the next  ministerial that there is consensus to do so. According to a USTR official,  additional environmental issues are unlikely to be included in the  negotiations.", "Clarifying the relationship between the WTO and the MEAs is the most  prominent item on the negotiating agenda related to the issue of trade and  the environment. To be acceptable to WTO members, including the United  States, the Doha Declaration limited the scope of these negotiations. In  particular, the results of the negotiations are limited to the applicability of  WTO rules to parties to an MEA. Further, negotiations shall not affect WTO  rights of any WTO member that is not a party to an MEA in question.  However, there has never been a challenge under the WTO dispute  settlement system to trade measures taken between parties to an MEA,  and, according to both a USTR official and a WTO Secretariat official, such  a challenge is unlikely. Consequently, the negotiations on this issue may  have a limited impact.", "The Doha Declaration also limits the negotiations to clarifying the  relationship between WTO rules and \u201cspecific trade obligations set out in  MEAs.\u201d  Members are debating whether this language excludes trade  measures that are not specifically mentioned by an MEA but that are taken  to pursue an MEA objective. The European Union is likely to support a  broader scope than are most other members, including the United States.  Only about 20 MEAs contain trade provisions. For example, the Montreal  Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer controls the  production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances such as  chlorofluorocarbons. The Basel Convention, which controls trade or  transportation of hazardous waste across international borders, and the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species are other  multilateral environmental agreements containing trade provisions.", "The Committee on Trade and Environment has been charged with  reviewing the effect of environmental measures on market access and  reporting to the fifth ministerial conference on the desirability of future  action.

Nevertheless, many WTO member governments have argued there is still  room for improvement in the existing WTO dispute settlement system.  Beginning in 1997, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, which administers  the dispute settlement process, held a series of informal discussions on the  basis of proposals and issues that members had identified to improve the  DSU. However, this effort did not result in a consensus for change.  Subsequently, at the Doha ministerial conference, WTO members agreed to  initiate formal negotiations to improve and clarify DSU provisions.", "Many countries want these negotiations to address the issue of conflicting  time lines in WTO rules regarding when a member can retaliate against  another for failing to implement a dispute settlement ruling. Other  priorities for the United States specifically include (1) streamlining the  dispute settlement process to achieve faster results by preventing countries  from delaying compliance with dispute settlement rulings and (2)  increasing the transparency of the proceedings of dispute settlement and  appellate panels. A potential area of disagreement in the DSU negotiations  involves the way in which members can impose sanctions on other  countries when they fail to implement adverse WTO decisions.

According to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, under the EU\u2019s proposal, many WTO members would incur  significant costs for the examination and enforcement of geographical  indications, which would not be paid for through fees or trade concessions  and would be offset by few benefits.

Implementation issues involve two major concerns. First,  many developing countries maintained that they lacked the capacity in  terms of expertise, financial resources, and institutions to fully meet their  Uruguay Round obligations such as complying with subsidies obligations  and initiating trade-related investment measures. Given these difficulties,  many developing countries demanded that deadlines for these obligations  be extended. Second, many developing country members claimed that they  had not reaped the economic benefits promised by the Uruguay Round  agreements. They argued for changing the agreements to make them more  balanced in favor of developing country interests. Examples include  accelerating the schedule for increasing textile and apparel quota growth  rates in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.

Second, other outstanding  implementation issues not mandated for negotiations, such as initiatives  surrounding textile and apparel trade, are to be addressed as a matter of  priority by the existing WTO bodies.
