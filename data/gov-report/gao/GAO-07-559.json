DOD's reported obligations for UCAs increased from $5.98 billion in 2001 to $6.53 billion in 2005. However, the government's procurement system does not identify undefinitized task or delivery orders or undefinitized contract modifications. In light of DOD's reported increase in its use of task and delivery orders in recent years, the data gap could be large. Because DOD decentralizes oversight of its UCAs, the department would have to manually obtain data from each of its local commands in order to obtain a complete picture. The local commands GAO visited performed oversight of their UCAs to varying degrees. DOD is generally using UCAs to rapidly fill urgent needs, as permitted, in a variety of circumstances. Local managements' message to the contracting community is to not use a UCA unless absolutely necessary, but this message is emphasized differently from one location to another. GAO found 10 instances in the 77 UCAs we reviewed where UCAs could have been avoided with better acquisition planning. For example, one UCA for the continuation of ongoing services was awarded the day after the previous contract expired. DOD did not meet the definitization time frame requirement of 180 days after award on 60 percent of the 77 UCAs reviewed. The most common reasons for the delays were untimely receipt of an adequate proposal from the contractor, acquisition workforce shortfalls, and changing requirements. GAO also found that DOD tends to obligate the maximum amount of funding permitted--up to 50 percent of the not-to-exceed amount--immediately at award of UCAs. As a result, contractors may have little incentive to quickly submit proposals. In addition, since DOD does not track whether it meets the Federal Acquisition Regulation requirement to definitize letter contracts (one type of UCA) before 40 percent of the work is complete, GAO was unable to assess compliance with this requirement. Contracting officers are not documenting, as required, the basis for the profit or fee prenegotiation objective and the profit or fee negotiated. As such, it is unclear whether the costs incurred prior to definitization are considered when computing the profit rates or fee amounts. For the 40 fixed-price contracts GAO reviewed, profit ranged from 3 to 17 percent, and for the 37 cost-type contracts in our sample, fees ranged from 4 to 15 percent. Generally the rate was applied equally over the entire contract term, including the undefinitized period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To meet urgent needs, the Department of Defense (DOD) can authorize  contractors to begin work and incur costs before reaching a final  agreement on contract terms and conditions, including price. Such  agreements are called undefinitized contract actions (UCA). The terms and  conditions of UCAs are generally required to be definitized within   180 days, before more than 50 percent of the estimated contract price is  obligated, or before more than 40 percent of the work is completed,  whichever occurs first. Although UCAs may be necessary to support  urgent needs, these actions are not a desirable form of contracting. The  government bears the majority of the cost and risk during the  undefinitized period. The government risks paying increased costs during  this period because the contractor has little incentive to control costs,  creating a potential for wasted taxpayer dollars. Therefore, DOD needs to  ensure that it is using UCAs only when necessary and that these contract  actions are then negotiated as quickly as possible.", "The House of Representatives report on the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 required us to review whether DOD  is properly using UCAs and negotiating them on time. Accordingly, we  assessed (1) the level of insight DOD has into its use of UCAs, (2) how and  when DOD is using UCAs, (3) whether DOD is definitizing UCAs in a  timely fashion, and (4) whether contracting officers are documenting the  basis for negotiated profit or fee.", "For the purposes of this report, we define UCAs as including letter  contracts, undefinitized task and delivery orders, and undefinitized  contract modifications (that is, modifications that significantly expand or  otherwise change the scope of the work). To determine the level of insight  DOD has into its use of UCAs, we analyzed information from the DOD  DD350 procurement database and interviewed senior-level acquisition  officials. We also met with officials from the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to discuss the data  available for oversight of UCAs. OFPP is responsible for collecting,  developing, and disseminating government procurement data. The most  significant governmentwide data collection tool is the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). To identify how  and when DOD is using UCAs and whether DOD is definitizing these  actions in a timely manner, we reviewed a randomly selected sample of   77 UCAs from the six military locations that awarded the majority of  dollars for letter contracts during fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and one non  military defense agency that issued several UCAs during that time period.  The specific locations selected for our review were    Air Force: Aeronautical Systems Center and Warner Robins Air    Army: Aviation and Missile Command and TACOM Life Cycle    Navy: Naval Air Systems Command and Naval Sea Systems Command,    National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.", "For purposes of this report, we refer to these seven locations as the local  commands.", "At each location, we reviewed contract files and interviewed officials from  the local acquisition office as well as the contracting officers responsible  for the UCAs we reviewed and selected program office officials. We also  reviewed relevant federal and defense acquisition regulations regarding  the appropriate use of and definitization requirements for UCAs. In  addition, we interviewed representatives from four companies who  entered into UCAs with either military services or the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency.

Despite this huge investment in buying goods and services, our  work and the work of the DOD Inspector General (IG) has found that  DOD\u2019s spending sometimes is inefficient and not managed effectively. Too  often, requirements are not clearly defined; rigorous price analyses are not  performed, and contractors\u2019 performance is not sufficiently overseen. In  fact, we have identified overall DOD contract management as a high-risk  area for the past several years.", "When a requirement needs to be met quickly and there is insufficient time  to use normal contracting vehicles, federal regulations permit the use of a  UCA. UCAs are binding commitments used when the government needs  the contractor to start work immediately and there is insufficient time to  negotiate all of the terms and conditions for a contract. UCAs can be  entered into via different contract vehicles, such as a letter contract   (a stand-alone contract), a task or delivery order issued against a pre- established umbrella contract, or a modification to an already established  contract.", "The FAR and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement  (DFARS) govern how and when UCAs can be used. The regulations also  establish requirements as to how quickly UCAs must be definitized.  Although each regulation contains two criteria, they are not the same. The  FAR states that a letter contract needs to be definitized within 180 days  after the award date or before 40 percent of the work is complete,  whichever occurs first. While the DFARS includes the 180-day time frame,  it addresses all UCAs (including undefinitized task and delivery orders and  contract modifications) and adds a requirement to definitize before more  than 50 percent of funds are obligated. It does not mention the 40 percent  of work completed. Under FAR and DFARS respectively, a waiver of the  180-day requirement can be granted for extreme circumstances or when  the agency is supporting a contingency or peacekeeping operation. The  definitization time frame can also be extended an additional 180 days  when a qualifying proposal is received from the contractor. The contractor  does not receive profit or fee during the undefinitized period, but can  recoup it once the contract is definitized.", "Under UCAs, the government risks paying unnecessary costs. For  example, in a September 2006 report on contracts in support of Iraq  reconstruction, we found that the timeliness of definitization can affect the  government\u2019s costs. We reported that DOD contracting officials were  more likely to adhere to the Defense Contract Audit Agency\u2019s advice  regarding the disposition of questioned and unsupported costs when  negotiations were timely and occurred before contractors had incurred  substantial costs under UCAs. On the other hand, contracting officials  were less likely to remove questioned costs from a contract proposal when  the contractor had already incurred these costs during the undefinitized  period. Similarly, the DOD IG found that untimely definitization of  contracts transfers additional cost and performance risk from the  contractors to the government.", "Contractors should bear an equitable share of contract cost risk and  receive compensation for bearing additional risk based on the degree of  risk assumed. Costs that have already been incurred on an unpriced  action, such as a letter contract, have virtually no cost risk associated with  them.

In another, a UCA was awarded to obtain a jamming system that was  needed to avoid grounding F-15 aircraft.

However, for 10 of the UCAs we reviewed, the government may have been  able to prevent the use of a UCA with better planning. These included, for  example, 4 UCAs issued to procure long lead items that could have been  contracted for earlier. The requirement for long lead items is typically  established early in a program and is normally provided advanced funding  in the annual budget process, which should provide sufficient time to  acquire the items through normal acquisition procedures. Other  inadequate planning situations included 4 UCAs\u20141 at the Naval Sea  Systems Command and 3 at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2014 that we believe could have been prevented by the program office. In each  instance, the requirement was known in a significant amount of time  before the UCA was issued. These situations ranged from late issuance of  the request for proposals (which had been planned earlier) to awards that  were issued quickly to avoid disruptions in services (which could have  been anticipated). For example, one National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency UCA for the continuation of ongoing services was awarded the day  after the services from the prior contract ended. The agency should have  been able to reasonably estimate the requirement and prices in advance  based on the terms and work of the ongoing contract, which were already  known. The remaining three inadequate planning situations were due to  circumstances that were beyond the control of the program office. For  example, a Navy UCA was issued because the senior acquisition executive,  external to the program office, delayed the approval of the program\u2019s  acquisition plan. Furthermore, one UCA added requirements that  expanded the work beyond what was originally planned. Specifically, the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency awarded a UCA to quickly obtain  aerial data from the regions affected by hurricanes, but subsequently  augmented it to establish a permanent facility that had been planned for  some time.

In many cases, multiple reasons contributed to  the definitization delay. Some of the longest delayed definitizations  occurred because of a combination of the three reasons stated above.", "Table 4 provides a summary of the number of instances each reason was  provided as an explanation of the delay.", "Contracting officers stated that delays in obtaining a qualifying proposal  were sometimes caused by the program office\u2019s changing requirements.  Many contracting officials stated the government\u2019s requirement was  inadequately described when the UCA was awarded or was subsequently  changed after award once the requirement was better understood.  Contractor representatives and contracting officers noted that it is difficult  for a contractor to timely submit an adequate proposal when the  government is unsure about the specifications of the product or service it  requires. Officials at two companies noted that they attempt to submit  qualifying proposals on time, but must redo them\u2014sometimes multiple  times\u2014to reflect the government\u2019s revised requirements.", "In addition to timeliness of proposals and changing requirements,  shortfalls in the government\u2019s acquisition workforce were another key  reason for definitization delays. This issue was manifest in different ways,  including inadequate numbers of contracting officials, the heavy workload  of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, which is frequently called upon to  perform audits of the proposal\u2019s pricing structure, and, in four cases,  contracting officials who did not perform their duties to definitize the  UCAs. Some contracting officers commented that UCAs require twice the  work that a normal contract award does, because in essence they go  through the contracting process twice\u2014once for the undefinitized period  and once for the definitized period. Problems with acquisition staff or  workloads at the commands resulted, in some instances, in a UCA  remaining undefinitized until someone turned attention to it. Some  contracting officers told us that their focus is on getting the UCA awarded;  after that, they often must turn to other pressing awards so that following  up on definitizations becomes less of a priority. We also found one  situation where a UCA simply fell through the cracks because it dropped  off the local reporting system due to a computer error. In one case, the  contracting officer awarded a UCA but took another job before it was  definitized, and the contracting officer who inherited it was not aware for  some time that it had not been definitized; thus, no one acted on it for over  a year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UCAs Are Usually Awarded with Maximum Obligations Allowed", "paragraphs": ["Most of the UCAs we reviewed were awarded with the maximum  obligations allowed.

As a result, contractors may have less incentive to hasten  the submission of qualifying proposals and agencies have little incentive to  demand their prompt submission, since funds are available to proceed  with the work, leading to a protracted negotiation process. One  contracting officer obligated a smaller percentage initially, but as time  went by and various issues arose that slowed definitization, he raised the  obligated amount little by little until it reached 50 percent. In hindsight, he  said it would have been easier to just obligate the 50 percent at the  beginning.

Such data are needed  to provide DOD (and other agencies) more complete information on  UCAs, which can then be used to improve oversight of their use.", "Although DOD concurred with our recommendation to issue guidance  addressing the FAR definitization requirement, in its comments, DOD  stated that our reference to the FAR requirements for UCA definitization  schedules did not consider the difference in requirements for DOD that are  specified in the U.S. Code. However, our report does address those  differences. DOD also stated that the Defense Acquisition Regulation  Council has initiated a DFARS case, based upon our discussions during  this review, to clarify that DOD contracting officers should use the DOD  definitization schedule criteria. DOD agreed that the need for enhanced  oversight of UCAs is appropriate and said it will consider requiring the  military departments to enhance oversight of UCAs and to provide  periodic reports, with remediation plans, for those past the definitization  time frames. The Department also published two notices in the Federal  Register on May 22, 2007, seeking public comments on current DOD  contract financing and funding policies, including the weighted guidelines  that are used to determine appropriate profit or fee based on an  assessment of contractor risk.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and other interested congressional  committees. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In  addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you have any questions about this report or need additional information,  please contact me at (202) 512-6986 or calvaresibarra@gao.gov.

We  analyzed information from DOD\u2019s procurement system (DD350) and local  commands for undefinitized contract actions from fiscal year 2001 through  fiscal year 2005. We also reviewed the relevant sections of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement, as well as service-level guidance pertaining to the use of  undefinitized contract actions.", "To identify how and when DOD is using UCAs and whether DOD is  definitizing these actions in a timely manner, we reviewed a random  sample of undefinitized contract actions from six military commands and  one non military defense agency. While undefinitized contract actions may  include letter contracts, task or delivery orders, and contract  modifications, only letter contracts are recorded by DD350 in a manner  that allowed GAO to identify them as undefinitized at the time of award.  Therefore, the specific locations for our review were selected based on the  total dollar value and volume of letter contracts issued during fiscal years  2004 and 2005 by various DOD buying organizations as recorded in the  DD350 system. On the basis of this data, we selected the two commands  with the largest dollar volume of letter contracts within each of the three  military services (Air Force, Army, and Navy). As such, the six military  locations represented over 75 percent of the total dollars awarded for  letter contracts during the period. We also selected the non military  defense agency with the largest number of letter contracts. The specific  locations selected for our review were:  Aeronautical Systems Center, Dayton, Ohio  Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner Robins, Georgia  TACOM Life Cycle Management Command, Warren, Michigan  Aviation and Missile Command, Huntsville, Alabama  Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C .  Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C.", "To include other types of undefinitized contract actions in our review, we  requested a listing of task and delivery order and contract modifications  issued as undefinitized contract actions during fiscal years 2004 and 2005  from each of the seven locations that we planned to visit. This request was  necessary because these types of undefinitized actions are not identified in  the federal procurement data system. We then established a population of  undefinitized contract actions at each location and selected a random  sample of contract actions to review. Not every location could provide us  with a listing of other undefinitized contract actions prior to our site visit,  and in some cases there were an insufficient number of such actions to  meet our sampling needs. In such cases we reviewed additional letter  contracts selected at random to achieve similar sample sizes at each  location. A total of 77 undefinitized contract actions were sampled for this  review. The six Army, Navy, and Air Force contracting organizations that  we selected for our review initiated 70 of the undefinitized contract  actions that we reviewed. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  initiated 7 of the undefinitized contract actions that we reviewed.  Observations made from our review cannot be generalized to the entire  population of undefinitized contract actions issued by DOD.", "We omitted undefinitized contractual actions for foreign military sales,  purchases that did not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, special  access programs, and congressionally mandated long lead procurement  contracts since these actions are not subject to compliance with the  definitization requirements we were reviewing. We also excluded all  undefinitized task orders issued under basic ordering agreements. The  majority of pricing and contract terms are established under basic  ordering agreements, leaving few terms and conditions to be definitized  after award when orders are issued under this type of contract.", "At each location, we reviewed contract document files and interviewed  officials from the local program office as well as the cognizant contracting  officers. In a few cases the contracting officer could not speak to the  reasons for definitization delays because that officer was not involved with  the award or definitization of the UCA selected for our review. We relied  on data provided to us by DOD and the buying commands we visited,  which we verified where practical. For example, in determining the length  of time to definitize the sampled actions, we verified the data reported in  DD350 by tracing the reported award and definitization dates to the  contract file documentation. We also verified contract obligation and not- to-exceed amounts reported in DD350 by reviewing contract file  documentation available in hard copy at the sites we visited and  electronically from DOD\u2019s Electronic Data Access Web-based system.", "To obtain insight into the issues surrounding the use of UCAs from a  contractor\u2019s point of view, we interviewed representatives from four  companies who entered into undefinitized contract actions with one or  more of the buying organizations that were selected for this review.", "We conducted our work from August 2006 through April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Undefinitized Contract Actions Reviewed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Common crypto appliqu\u00e9 for F-15 aircraft", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
