The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through its Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), has lead federal responsibility for such information sharing. GAO was asked to assess (1) actions I&A has taken to enhance the usefulness of intelligence products it provides to state and local partners, (2) other services I&A provides to these partners, and (3) to what extent I&A has defined how it intends to share information with these partners. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, strategies, best practices, and agency documents; contacted a nongeneralizable sample of 10 fusion centers\u0097where states collaborate with federal agencies to improve information sharing\u0097based on geographic location and other factors; and interviewed I&A officials. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in September 2010. Information DHS deemed sensitive has been redacted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the usefulness of intelligence products it provides to state and local partners, I&A has initiatives underway to identify these partners' information needs and obtain feedback on the products, but strengthening these efforts could support the development of future products. As of August 2010, I&A had finalized information needs--which are owned and controlled by the states--for 9 of the 50 states. I&A was working with remaining states to identify their needs, but it had not established mutually agreed upon milestones for completing this effort, in accordance with program management principles. Working with states to establish such milestones and addressing any barriers to identifying their needs could better assist states in the timely completion of this process. In addition, I&A has begun issuing a new customer feedback survey to recipients of its products and plans to begin analyzing this feedback to determine the value of the products, but it has not developed plans to report the results of its analyses to state and local partners. Reporting the results to these partners and actions it has taken in response could help I&A demonstrate that the feedback is important and makes a difference, which could encourage state and local partners to provide more feedback and ultimately make I&A\u0092s products and services more useful.", "In addition to intelligence products, I&A provides a number of other services to its state and local partners--primarily through fusion centers--that have generally been well received by the center officials GAO contacted. For example, I&A has deployed more than 60 intelligence officers to fusion centers nationwide to assist state and local partners in areas such as obtaining relevant intelligence products and leveraging DHS capabilities to support their homeland security missions. I&A also facilitates access to information-sharing networks disseminating classified and unclassified information, provides training directly to center personnel, and operates a 24-hour service to respond to state and local requests for information and other support.", "Historically, I&A has focused its state and local efforts on addressing statutory requirements and responding to I&A leadership priorities, but it has not yet defined how it plans to meet its state and local information-sharing mission by identifying and documenting the specific programs and activities that are most important for executing this mission. Best practices show that clearly identifying priorities among programs and activities is important for implementing programs and managing results. Further, I&A's current performance measures do not allow I&A to demonstrate the expected outcomes and effectiveness of programs and activities that support state and local partners, as called for in program management principles. I&A officials said they are planning to develop such measures, but had not established time frames for doing so. Defining and documenting how I&A plans to meet its state and local information-sharing mission and establishing time frames for developing additional performance measures could better position I&A to make resource decisions and provide transparency and accountability over its efforts. GAO recommends that I&A establish milestones for identifying the information needs of state and local partners, report to these partners on how I&A used feedback they provided to enhance intelligence products, identify and document priority programs and activities related to its state and local mission, and establish time frames for developing additional related performance measures. DHS agreed with these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that I&A establish milestones for identifying the information needs of state and local partners, report to these partners on how I&A used feedback they provided to enhance intelligence products, identify and document priority programs and activities related to its state and local mission, and establish time frames for developing additional related performance measures.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and subsequently enacted  laws\u2014including the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 and the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission  Act of 2007 (the 9/11 Commission Act)\u2014assigned the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) responsibility for, among other things, sharing  terrorism-related information as appropriate with its state and local  partners, and authorized additional measures and funding to support  carrying out this mandate. DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A)  is the lead DHS component with responsibilities for sharing this  information with all levels of government and the private sector. Most  states and some major urban areas have established fusion centers that  provide a conduit for I&A to share information within the state.", "Our prior work on the importance of including state and local entities in  information sharing has shown that these efforts continue to be a  significant challenge for the federal government. In January 2005, we  designated terrorism-related information sharing a high-risk area because  the government had continued to face formidable challenges in analyzing  and disseminating this information in a timely, accurate, and useful  manner. We reported that information is a crucial tool in fighting  terrorism and that its timely dissemination is critical to maintaining the  security of our nation. This area remained on the high-risk list for our  January 2009 update. As a result of this designation, we continuously  monitor federal efforts to remove barriers to and better achieve  information sharing.", "This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we provided to you  in September 2010. DHS deemed some of the information in that report as  sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosures. Therefore, this  report omits certain information associated with (1) the types of products  I&A provides to its state and local partners, (2) the specific number of  products it provided to these partners, and (3) the amount of feedback  I&A received on its products from these partners. Although the  information provided in this report is more limited in scope, it addresses  the same questions as the sensitive report.  Also, the methodology used for  both reports is the same. In the context of how I&A has responded to its  statutory mission to share terrorism-related information with state and  local partners, the sensitive report addressed the following questions:    To what extent has I&A taken actions to enhance the usefulness of  intelligence products that it provides to state and local partners?", "In addition to intelligence products, what other services does I&A  provide to state and local partners to facilitate information sharing,  and what are its partners\u2019 views of these services?", "To what extent has I&A defined how it intends to meet its state and  local information-sharing mission?", "To determine the extent to which I&A has taken actions to enhance the  usefulness of intelligence products for state and local partners, we  reviewed documentation related to I&A\u2019s intelligence products and its  efforts to gather the information needs of state and local partners and  feedback on the products provided. These documents included fact  sheets, briefing handouts, and Federal Register notices. We also reviewed  I&A reports to Congress on the dissemination of intelligence products and  related feedback; a 2008 contractor report on I&A\u2019s support to fusion  centers, which led to I&A efforts to gather state and local information  needs; and a 2010 I&A-sponsored study on how intelligence products are  disseminated to state and local agencies. In addition, we reviewed  statutory provisions that address I&A\u2019s role in disseminating intelligence  products and gathering feedback, and the October 2007 National Strategy  for Information Sharing, which provides criteria on the importance of  gathering state and local information needs, among other things. Further,  we reviewed standards for program management and our previous reports  to identify criteria regarding project management and stakeholder  involvement in federal agency programs and decision making. We  compared I&A\u2019s efforts against the relevant legislation and criteria to  identify efforts to meet certain provisions and potential areas for  improvement. We also interviewed senior officials from various I&A  divisions to discuss how they prepared and disseminated intelligence  products, what prior and current efforts they took or are taking to gather  state and local information needs and feedback on products, and how  these efforts have evolved over time.", "In addition, we interviewed directors, intelligence analysts, and other  senior officials from 10 fusion centers\u2014including the President of the  National Fusion Center Association\u2014and asked them whether I&A had  discussed their information needs, their views on the usefulness of I&A\u2019s  products, related feedback they have provided to I&A, and other issues.", "Because we selected a nonprobability sample of fusion centers to contact,  the information we obtained from these locations may not be generalized  to all fusion centers nationwide. However, because we selected these  centers based on their geographic location, maturity, and whether an I&A  officer had been deployed to the center (5 had officers deployed and 5 did  not), the information we gathered from these locations provided us with a  general understanding of information sharing between I&A and state and  local agencies. We also met with officials from associations that represent  state and local interests\u2014the Major Cities Chiefs Association and  International Association of Chiefs of Police\u2014to discuss their views on  I&A efforts to address state and local needs. These associations do not  represent the views of all state and local entities, but provide additional  context regarding state and local information sharing. Further, we  reviewed pertinent statutory provisions and other documentation related  to the Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group (ITACG) to  determine its role in incorporating state and local needs and perspectives  into federal intelligence products, as well as any issues ITACG officials  identified regarding the dissemination of federal intelligence products.", "Regarding other services I&A has provided to facilitate information  sharing with state and local partners, we analyzed relevant laws and  strategies to determine criteria and activities that I&A has been charged  with leading. These documents include the October 2007 National  Strategy for Information Sharing and the 9/11 Commission Act, which  provides for the establishment of a State, Local, and Regional Fusion  Center Initiative at DHS and contains numerous provisions that address  the federal government\u2019s information-sharing responsibilities to fusion  centers. To obtain details on services I&A provides to state and local  partners, we reviewed I&A\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress regarding its  support to fusion centers from fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of  fiscal year 2010. We also reviewed internal quarterly reports on an I&A  initiative to respond to state and local requests for information and  administrative support (i.e., the Single Point of Service) from May 2008  through the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. In addition, we reviewed  third-party reports containing information on these efforts, such as the  2008 report on I&A fusion center support, a Congressional Research  Service report on the DHS intelligence enterprise, and an I&A-sponsored  evaluation of I&A\u2019s various programs. We interviewed senior officials  from various I&A components\u2014including the State and Local Program  Office and the Production Management Division\u2014to gain an  understanding of I&A\u2019s activities that directly support fusion centers. We  also interviewed senior officials from the 10 fusion centers and two  associations that we contacted to discuss I&A\u2019s direct support to state and  local partners at fusion centers and obtain their views on these services.", "To determine the extent to which I&A has defined how it intends to meet  its state and local information-sharing mission, we reviewed requirements  contained in applicable federal guidance, including guidance to agencies  from the Office of Management and Budget for developing strategic plans,  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, and our recommended  practices for strategic planning. We then reviewed I&A\u2019s planning  documents to identify where the required elements could be found. In  addition, we reviewed reports and I&A-sponsored studies on its programs  and planning. We also interviewed senior officials responsible for  agencywide planning, including officials from I&A\u2019s Program and  Performance Management Division and I&A\u2019s chief of staff. In addition, we  interviewed management officials responsible for planning in I&A  component divisions and branches to determine the processes used to  create planning documents and ensure accountability for achieving  program results.", "As discussed above, we reviewed reports and studies prepared by I&A and  third-party contractors related to I&A\u2019s efforts to support and facilitate  information sharing with state and local partners. We have included data,  findings, and recommendations from these documents in this report. We  found the analyses and data in the internal reports and third-party studies  to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes in this report. We performed  our work on the sensitive version of this report from February 2009 to  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History and Overview of I&A", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, DHS established its Directorate of Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection.

I&A also provides staff,  services, and other support to the Under Secretary related to efforts to  lead, integrate, and manage intelligence activities across the department.", "I&A has undergone several transitions and realignments since its inception  in 2002, which affect all of the office\u2019s customers, including state and local  partners. Several of I&A\u2019s divisions, offices, and branches have some role  in helping the office meet its mission to share information with these  partners. Most importantly, I&A\u2019s State and Local Program Office was  established to manage a program to accomplish DHS\u2019s fusion center  mission. Specifically, the office is responsible for deploying DHS  personnel with operational and intelligence skills to fusion centers to  facilitate coordination and the flow of information between DHS and  fusion centers, provide expertise in intelligence analysis and reporting,  coordinate with local DHS and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  components, and provide DHS with local situational awareness and access  to fusion center information.", "In addition to the State and Local Program Office\u2019s support to fusion  centers, other entities within I&A are engaged in providing intelligence  products and other products and services to state and local customers. For  example, several analytic divisions\u2014such as those that address border  security and domestic threats\u2014are responsible for conducting analysis  and preparing intelligence reports on a variety of topics of interest to  various stakeholders, including state and local entities. The Collections  Requirement Division gathers information needs from state and local  partners, among other things, and the Production Management Division is  responsible for finalizing intelligence reports that are prepared by the  analytic divisions and distributing them to I&A\u2019s customers, including state  and local partners. In addition, I&A\u2019s newly formed Customer Assurance  Branch is now responsible for gathering and compiling feedback on the  intelligence products that I&A provides to its customers, including state  and local partners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Statutes and Strategies Governing Information Sharing with State and Local Entities", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, several statutes have  been enacted into law designed to enhance the sharing of terrorism- related information among federal, state, and local agencies, and the  federal government has developed related strategies and guidelines to  meet its statutory obligations. Related to I&A, the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 assigned the original DHS intelligence component\u2014the  Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection\u2014with  responsibility to receive, analyze, and integrate law enforcement and  intelligence information in order to (1) identify and assess the nature and  scope of terrorist threats to the homeland, (2) detect and identify threats  of terrorism against the United States, and (3) understand such threats in  light of actual and potential vulnerabilities to the homeland. Further, the  9/11 Commission Act directs the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2014through  the Under Secretary for I&A\u2014to integrate information and standardize the  format of terrorism-related intelligence products. The act further directed  the Secretary to create a mechanism for state, local, and tribal law  enforcement officers to provide voluntary feedback to DHS on the quality  and utility of the intelligence products developed under these provisions.  DHS is also charged through the 9/11 Commission Act with developing a  curriculum for training state, local, and tribal partners in, among other  things, federal laws, practices, and regulations regarding the development,  handling, and review of intelligence and other information.", "As part of DHS\u2019s information sharing with state and local entities, several  provisions of the 9/11 Commission Act relate to support provided directly  to fusion centers. Most states and some major urban areas have  established fusion centers to, among other things, address gaps in  terrorism-related information sharing that the federal government cannot  address alone and provide a conduit for information sharing within the  state. Specific to fusion centers, the act provides for the Under Secretary  for Intelligence and Analysis to assign, to the maximum extent practicable,  officers and intelligence analysts from DHS components\u2014including I&A\u2014 to fusion centers. The act also provides that federal officers and analysts  assigned to fusion centers in general are to assist law enforcement  agencies in developing a comprehensive and accurate threat picture and to  create intelligence and other information products for dissemination to  law enforcement agencies.", "In October 2007, the President issued the National Strategy for  Information Sharing, which identifies the federal government\u2019s  information-sharing responsibilities to include gathering and documenting  the information that state and local agencies need to enhance their  situational awareness of terrorist threats. The strategy also calls for  authorities at all levels of government to work together to obtain a  common understanding of the information needed to prevent, deter, and  respond to terrorist attacks. Specifically, the strategy requires that state  and local law enforcement agencies have access to timely, credible, and  actionable information and intelligence about individuals and  organizations intending to carry out attacks within the United States; their  organizations and their financing; potential targets; activities that could  have a nexus to terrorism; and major events or circumstances that might  influence state and local actions. The strategy also recognizes that fusion  centers are vital assets that are critical to sharing information related to  terrorism, and will serve as primary focal points within the state and local  environment for the receipt and sharing of terrorism-related information.  I&A has cited this strategy as a key document governing its state and local  information-sharing efforts. Thus, in response to the designation of fusion  centers as primary focal points, requirements in the 9/11 Commission Act,  and the difficulty of reaching out to the thousands of state and local law  enforcement entities nationwide, I&A views fusion centers as primary  vehicles for sharing information with state and local partners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Past Work on Terrorism-Related Information Sharing", "paragraphs": ["In October 2001, we first reported on the importance of sharing  information about terrorist threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, and lessons  learned. Since we designated terrorism-related information sharing a  high-risk area in January 2005, we have continued to monitor federal  efforts to remove barriers to effective information sharing. As part of this  monitoring, in October 2007 and April 2008, we reported on our  assessment of the status of fusion centers and how the federal government  is supporting them. Our fusion center report and subsequent testimony  highlighted continuing challenges\u2014such as the centers\u2019 ability to access  information and obtain funding\u2014that DHS and the Department of Justice  (DOJ) needed to address to support the fusion centers\u2019 role in facilitating  information sharing among federal, state, and local partners. Specifically,  the October 2007 report recommended that federal officials determine and  articulate the federal government\u2019s role in helping to ensure fusion center  sustainability. In response, in late 2008, I&A reported that it had dedicated  personnel and other resources, as well as issued guidance, directly  supporting fusion centers. We have ongoing work that is assessing fusion  center sustainability and efforts to protect privacy, and expect to report  the results of this work later this year.", "In June 2008, we reported on the federal government\u2019s efforts to  implement the Information Sharing Environment, which was established  to facilitate the sharing of terrorism and homeland security information.  We recommended that the Program Manager for the Information Sharing  Environment and stakeholders more fully define the scope and specific  results to be achieved and develop performance measures to track  progress. The Program Manager has taken steps to address these  recommendations but has not fully addressed them. We are continuing to  review federal agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the Information Sharing  Environment and expect to report the results of this work later this year.  Finally, in December 2009, we reported on our assessment of DHS and FBI  efforts to share information with local and tribal officials in border  communities and recommended that DHS and FBI more fully identify the  information needs of, and establish partnerships with, local and tribal  officials along the borders; identify promising practices in developing  border intelligence products with fusion centers and obtain feedback on  the products; and define the suspicious activities that local and tribal  officials in border communities are to report and how to report them.

From June 2009 through May 2010, I&A  disseminated thousands of Homeland Intelligence Reports to its state and  local partners through fusion centers. I&A officials noted that the number  of reports disseminated has increased over time because of the overall  increase in the number of submissions from DHS components, such as  U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, as well as greater reporting by state and local partners.", "In 2009, I&A commissioned a study in response to concerns voiced by  state and local first responders and first preventers (e.g., law enforcement,  fire departments, emergency management, health services, critical  infrastructure providers, and other relevant stakeholders) that they were  not receiving enough useful information products from fusion centers.

In 2007, I&A began its initial effort to  identify the information needs of its state and local partners in conjunction  with a pilot study that found that I&A had not identified fusion center  needs for product development or produced intelligence products tailored  to those needs. Specifically, the study found that fusion center leaders at  pilot sites did not believe that DHS intelligence products fully met their  mission needs by providing information of operational importance to state  and local law enforcement. The study also found that DHS did not have an  intelligence process that identified fusion center needs to inform reporting  and analysis, produced products tailored to those requirements, or  collected feedback from fusion centers on the value of these products.", "During 2007, I&A identified the information needs from five of the six  fusion centers that it contacted during its pilot study, according to I&A  officials. These information needs included topics such as border security  and threats posed by prison radicalization. I&A reached out to nine  additional fusion centers in 2008, and was able to obtain and validate  information needs from four of them, which submitted their needs on a  voluntary basis. Thus, over the first year and a half of these efforts, I&A  obtained and validated information needs from a total of nine fusion  centers. I&A planned to visit an additional eight fusion centers in 2009 but  only visited one center before efforts were suspended in March 2009, with  no resulting compendium of fusion center needs. According to a senior  I&A official, the process I&A was using to obtain these needs was time  consuming and inefficient. The official explained that a number of  different I&A entities were involved in gathering these needs, visiting  fusion centers one at a time, and following up with each to validate the  needs.", "In March 2009, I&A refocused its efforts to identify Standing Information  Needs for each state, which I&A defines as \u201cany subject, general or  specific, for which there is a continuing need for intelligence, which will  establish a foundation for guiding intelligence collection efforts and  reporting activities.\u201d Examples include the need for information on  individuals or groups that are capable of attacking critical infrastructure  and key resources, and emerging cross-border connections between  transnational criminal organizations or gangs. According to an Acting  Deputy Director of I&A\u2019s Domestic Threat Analysis Division, Standing  Information Needs are focused on long-term analytic needs, whereas prior  efforts to collect information needs were focused on identifying and  providing products in response to more immediate information needs\u2014a  function now handled through I&A\u2019s Single Point of Service initiative,  which is discussed later in this report.", "I&A describes its approach to assisting states in identifying their Standing  Information Needs as a two-fold process. First, I&A provides states with a  list of general topics\u2014such as critical infrastructure protection\u2014that align  with DHS\u2019s Standing Information Needs for their use in identifying areas of  interest. I&A then poses a series of questions to state fusion center  personnel to help them define more detailed information needs under  those topics in an organized and complete manner. In October 2009, I&A  began soliciting these needs from all state fusion centers with I&A  intelligence officers, except for 3 that had taken part in the pilot phase of  the program. As of August 2010, 9 states had completed efforts to identify  their information needs, 12 states had completed drafts that were awaiting  final state approval, and 20 states were in the process of drafting their  needs. After the states have finalized their Standing Information Needs,  I&A plans to assist them in prioritizing those needs.", "According to the Deputy Director of I&A\u2019s Collection and Requirements  Division, I&A has begun providing products to states in response to  Standing Information Needs that the states have submitted. The official  noted that these products are labeled in a manner that makes a clear link  between the state\u2019s identified need and the product that is issued, and that  the products are also sent to other stakeholders that may have similar  interests. Thus, I&A reports that it can track states\u2019 needs from the time  they are received through each product provided in response to those  needs. According to I&A, this current effort is completed manually and is  labor intensive. I&A is currently researching tools to automate the  Standing Information Needs process to ensure that products are reaching  as many customers as possible by distributing reports generated as a  result of these needs to all interested parties.", "I&A is making progress in gathering and responding to state Standing  Information Needs and has developed internal milestones for completing  the identification of these needs. According to standard program  management principles, time frames or milestones should typically be  incorporated as part of a road map to achieve a specific desired outcome  or result; in this case, development of a nationwide compendium of state  and local information needs. According to I&A, because these needs are  state-owned and approved documents, I&A cannot compel states to meet  its internal milestones. Nevertheless, working closely with states to jointly  develop such milestones is particularly important given the past  challenges I&A has encountered in identifying these needs, and given that  it has spent nearly 3 years in this process and has completed efforts to  identify needs from nine states to date.", "According to the Deputy Director of I&A\u2019s Collection Requirements  Division, while assisting states in developing their Standing Information  Needs is a significant priority, the biggest challenge the division faces in  addressing this priority is limited resources. I&A has two to three staff  assigned to work with states to gather these needs and those staff get  pulled from this task to deal with other, higher priority issues. For  example, the official noted that in the spring of 2010, the staff were taken  from this work to advise the U.S. Coast Guard on methods of information  gathering and reporting regarding the British Petroleum Deepwater  Horizon oil spill. While we recognize that states have the lead in defining  their needs, given the importance that both I&A and its state and local  partners place on having state and local needs drive intelligence and  product development, it is important that these needs be identified as  expeditiously as possible. Working with states to establish milestones for  developing their information needs and identifying and addressing any  barriers to developing those needs and meeting milestones could better  hold I&A accountable for assisting the states in the timely completion of  this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I&A Is Analyzing Feedback on Intelligence Products, but Reporting the Results of the Analysis to State and Local Partners Could Provide Better Transparency and Accountability to Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the primary mechanism I&A used to collect feedback on its  intelligence products was to include a reference to an unclassified e-mail  address in each product that recipients could use to submit comments.  Other feedback mechanisms include Web sites used to disseminate  information, teleconferences, and information gathered by I&A officers  located at fusion centers, a practice that officials at 6 of the 10 fusion  centers we contacted preferred versus replying via e-mail.", "The level of feedback I&A has received on its products through this e-mail  address has increased and has largely been positive. Specifically, from  June 2008 through May 2009, I&A\u2019s report to Congress on voluntary  customer feedback\u2014required by the 9/11 Commission Act\u2014shows that  I&A received 175 feedback responses on intelligence products from state  and local customers, versus 50 responses during the prior reporting  period. I&A\u2019s analysis of the responses show that about 67 percent were  positive, meaning that respondents felt they were useful for planning and  resource allocation. Appendix I presents more information on how I&A  categorizes the feedback it has received. Officials at 9 of the 10 fusion  centers we contacted said that they found I&A\u2019s products to be generally  helpful. For example, officials from 2 fusion centers cited I&A reports on  the attempted Christmas Day 2009 airline bombing as examples of relevant  information that was provided to them in a timely manner. Regarding  Homeland Intelligence Reports, I&A said that state and local partners\u2019  feedback has been minimal, and that it is continuing to encourage them to  comment on these reports so that I&A can adjust these products to meet  its partners\u2019 needs. One example cited in I&A\u2019s latest customer feedback  report to Congress illustrates the importance of obtaining feedback for  supporting I&A efforts to improve its future products. Specifically, a fusion  center expressed concerns that the perspectives of 3 southwest border  state fusion centers were not included in an assessment that I&A  headquarters produced on border violence. The feedback resulted in  teleconferences and other I&A actions to ensure that state and local  perspectives are included in future assessments of border violence.", "According to I&A officials, the amount and detail of feedback received to  date, while positive, has been of limited use in improving product  development. Thus, in 2010 I&A began using a new customer satisfaction  survey to gather more meaningful feedback from state and local partners  on its intelligence products and other areas of support. For example, the  survey asks respondents how the product was used to support their  mission, how it could be improved, and their level of satisfaction with the  timeliness and relevance of the product to the respondents\u2019 intelligence  needs. I&A plans to use the survey results to establish who in the state and  local community is accessing its reports, and to make improvements to  intelligence products that increase customer satisfaction. According to the  Chief of I&A\u2019s newly formed Customer Assurance Branch\u2014which is  responsible for managing efforts to collect and analyze feedback on I&A\u2019s  analytic services\u2014I&A began deploying the survey to all recipients of  products marked \u201cFor Official Use Only\u201d in March 2010. As of May 2010,  I&A officials said that they had received several hundred responses to this  survey, approximately half of which were from state, local, tribal, and  territorial partners\u2014more than double the number of responses from  these partners over the previous year of reporting.", "The results of these feedback surveys are to be sent directly to the  analysts and divisions preparing intelligence products for incorporation  into ongoing and future work, according to agency officials. The officials  noted that this survey is to be one part of a larger effort to capture and  manage feedback on not only I&A\u2019s intelligence products, but also services  that it provides internally to its analysts and report preparers.", "According to I&A, once it has gathered data for one full quarter, it will  begin to examine different ways that it can compile and assess the  information gathered from these surveys. I&A anticipates that its efforts  will include organizing feedback survey responses by the type of product  issued (e.g., Homeland Security Monitor), analytic division, and product  topic (e.g., border security or critical infrastructure). Organizing feedback  in this way could help I&A determine the value and responsiveness of its  particular product types to state and local customer needs, and in turn  help I&A focus its limited resources. At the time of our review, I&A  planned to report the results of such analyses to Congress through its  upcoming 2010 report to Congress on voluntary feedback from state and  local customers.", "I&A has also taken initial steps to report the results of its feedback  analysis directly to state and local customers. Specifically, during the  summer of 2010, I&A provided briefings on the value of this feedback  during two stakeholder forums, according to an official from I&A\u2019s  Customer Assurance Branch. This official added that I&A plans to  continue using stakeholder forums\u2014such as conferences and meetings of  fusion center directors\u2014to report on I&A\u2019s assessment of state and local  feedback and its use in refining I&A products. However, I&A had not  developed plans on when it will provide such reporting, how frequently, or  in what level of detail. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government require agencies to ensure effective communication with  external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on an agency  achieving its goals\u2014in this case, I&A\u2019s state and local information-sharing  partners. In addition, standard program management principles call for  time frames or milestones to be developed as part of a road map to  achieve a specific desired result. As I&A moves forward with its efforts to  collect and analyze feedback from state and local partners, developing  plans for reporting the results of its feedback analysis\u2014including time  frames and level of detail\u2014to these partners and the actions it has taken in  response could help I&A demonstrate that the feedback is important and  makes a difference.

Historically, I&A\u2019s state and local  programs and activities have been in response to a variety of factors,  including its focus on addressing statutory requirements and efforts to  leverage and support fusion centers that state and local agencies had  established. I&A\u2019s efforts to implement this mission have also been  affected by administration changes and changing and evolving I&A  leadership priorities. In addition, I&A has had to balance resources for  supporting fusion centers and other state and local information-sharing  programs and activities against other competing priorities. State and local  partners are one of a number of customer sets the office supports along  with the Secretary, other DHS components such as U.S. Customs and  Border Protection, other federal agencies, and the intelligence  community\u2014with each competing for resources. For example, although  Congress\u2014through the 9/11 Commission Act\u2014has stressed the  importance of supporting fusion centers, DHS has not provided consistent  funding for I&A to support the centers, although I&A has made  investments on its own. Specifically, until the fiscal year 2010 budget  cycle, DHS did not request funds to support the deployment of I&A  personnel to these centers. Rather, I&A had to reprogram funds from other  areas to support this critical part of its state and local mission.

The results of the study identified several areas for  improvement, including the need to better respond to fusion center  requests for information and provide centers with reporting and analysis  that addresses their mission-critical information needs. One of the  initiatives I&A took in response that provided a more organized and  integrated approach to supporting state and local customers was creating  a single point within the office that these customers could contact for their  questions and requests for support and that would be held accountable for  responding to these needs.", "In addition, in 2008, I&A sponsored an agencywide study that was  conducted by the HSI to evaluate I&A programs related to its role in  providing homeland security intelligence and information to various  federal officials and agencies, members of Congress, and the department\u2019s  state and local partners, among others. The resulting April 2009 report  noted that I&A is an emerging organization that is still in the initial stages  of its organizational development, including developing its strategic  planning capabilities and strategic business processes.  The report also  noted that the lack of a strategic plan hindered I&A\u2019s efforts to conduct  any type of officewide program or resource planning that could be  appropriately tied to its mission, goals, and objectives. As a result, HSI  found that various I&A components had developed their own goals,  priorities, processes, and procedures and, in some cases, may be working  at cross-purposes. HSI also found that the lack of I&A efforts to allocate  resources to support strategic goals and objectives prevented managers  from organizing their efforts for long-term effectiveness, which left them  unable to plan for growth or to adapt to emerging issues.", "As a first step, HSI recommended that I&A go through a strategic planning  process and develop an overarching strategic plan in order to provide I&A  leadership with a road map for making organizational changes.  Specifically, HSI recommended that I&A develop a strategy that defines its  overall mission, goals, objectives, priorities, and performance measures. In  December 2009, I&A developed a strategy that contains 4 overall goals that  the office as a whole is to meet. For example, 1 of the goals is to serve as  the premier provider of homeland security information and intelligence,  and another goal is to build partnerships and foster teamwork. The  strategy also contains 12 objectives that I&A plans to use to meet these  goals. Two of these objectives focus on its state and local partners. The  first is to strengthen the national network of fusion centers. Specifically,  through a proposed Joint Fusion Center Program Management Office, I&A  was to lead a DHS-wide effort to support fusion centers. The role of this  office was to ensure coordination across all departmental components  with the dual priorities of strengthening fusion centers and DHS  intelligence products. According to DHS, the office was to have five  primary responsibilities to make fusion centers more effective.  Specifically, the office was to  survey state, local, and tribal law enforcement to get feedback on what  information these \u201cfirst preventers\u201d need to do their job;    develop a mechanism to gather, analyze, and share national, regional,  and local threat information up and down the intelligence network;  coordinate with fusion centers to continuously ensure they get the  appropriate personnel and resources from DHS;    provide training and exercises to build relationships between fusion  center personnel and promote a sense of common mission; and  train fusion center personnel to respect the civil liberties of American  citizens.", "According to I&A officials, in August 2010, I&A did not receive  congressional approval to establish this office.

For example, other goals and  objectives involve identifying customer information needs, developing  analytic products, obtaining feedback on products, and measuring  performance. The Director noted that I&A may revise the strategy\u2019s goals  and objectives in response to the February 2010 DHS Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review Report to Congress, which outlines a strategic  framework to guide the homeland security activities of DHS components.

In its April 2009  report, HSI recommended that I&A divisions and branches create  derivative plans that are linked to the strategy. Among other things, the  derivative plans were to identify priority programs and activities, assign  roles and responsibilities, and describe performance measures and  incentives tied to performance. I&A leadership would then be responsible  for ensuring that the divisions and branches implement their plans. I&A  has decided not to develop the more specific derivative component plans  or a plan or road map for how it will specifically meet its state and local  mission.

I&A could possibly use this  feedback to set annual targets for the level of timeliness and  responsiveness that it would like to achieve and use the survey results to  track progress towards these targets over time. I&A could in turn use this  performance data to decide on future improvements.

For example, working with states to establish  milestones for identifying each state\u2019s information needs and identifying  and working to resolve any barriers to completing this process could help  hold I&A accountable for the timely completion of this process, which is  an important step in supporting the development of future I&A products.  Periodically informing state and local partners of how I&A analyzed the  feedback they provided and what actions I&A took in response to this  feedback and analyses could help strengthen I&A\u2019s working relationships  with these partners and encourage them to continue to provide I&A  feedback, which could ultimately make I&A\u2019s products and services more  useful. Defining and documenting the specific programs and activities  I&A\u2019s components and divisions will be held responsible for implementing  so that I&A collectively can meet its state and local mission could help to  establish clear direction and accountability. Finally, committing to plans  and time frames for developing outcome-based performance measures  that gauge the information-sharing results and impacts of I&A\u2019s state and  local efforts and how these efforts have affected homeland security could  help I&A and Congress establish accountability for funding provided. By  taking all of these steps, I&A could potentially increase the usefulness of  its products and services, the effectiveness of its investments, and the  organization\u2019s accountability to Congress, key stakeholders, and the public  for sharing needed homeland security information with state and local  partners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help I&A strengthen its efforts to share information with state and local  partners, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct  the Under Secretary for I&A to take the following four actions:    Work with states to establish milestones for the timely completion of  efforts to identify state information needs and identify and work to  resolve any barriers to this timely completion.", "Periodically report to state and local information-sharing partners on  the results of I&A\u2019s analysis of the product and services feedback these  partners provide and the actions I&A took in response to this  feedback.", "Define and document the programs and activities its divisions and  branches will be expected to implement in order for I&A to collectively  meet its state and local information-sharing mission and provide  accountability and transparency over its efforts.", "Establish plans and time frames for developing performance measures  that gauge the results that I&A\u2019s information-sharing efforts have  achieved and how they have enhanced homeland security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On August 6, 2010, we provided a draft of the sensitive version of this  report to DHS for review and comment.  In its written comments, DHS  stated that the department, particularly I&A, concurred with all four  recommendations and discussed efforts planned or underway to address  them.  Specifically, DHS agreed with our first recommendation related to  the need for I&A to work with states to establish milestones for the timely  completion of efforts to identify state information needs and identify and  work to resolve any barriers to this timely completion. According to DHS,  I&A has established internal milestones for the timely completion of this  process. DHS noted, however, that while I&A advises and assists states  with the development of their information needs, ultimately those  outcomes are owned and controlled by the states themselves and, thus,  I&A is unable to impose its milestones on them.  Nevertheless, DHS noted  that I&A is confident that it can work with states to develop mutually- agreed upon milestones for completing this process and will report  progress towards meeting these milestones on a regular basis.  Working  with states to develop such milestones and reporting on progress will  address the intent of our recommendation.", "DHS also agreed with our second recommendation that I&A periodically  report to state and local partners on the results of I&A\u2019s analysis of the  products and services feedback these partners provide and the actions  I&A took in response to this feedback. DHS noted that I&A plans to  regularly report the results of its partners\u2019 products and services feedback,  as well as the actions I&A took in response to that feedback, to these  partners, DHS management, and Congress.  In September 2010, after  providing written comments, I&A officials informed us that they have  taken steps to report the results of feedback analysis to state and local  customers.  Specifically, during the summer of 2010, I&A provided  briefings on the value of this feedback during two stakeholder forums,  according to an official from I&A\u2019s Customer Assurance Branch.  The  official added that I&A plans to continue using stakeholder forums\u2014such  as conferences and meetings of fusion center directors\u2014to report on  I&A\u2019s assessment of state and local feedback and its use in refining I&A  products.  However, I&A had not developed plans for reporting the results  of its feedback analysis moving forward\u2014including time frames and level  of detail\u2014which would address the intent of this recommendation.", "Further, DHS agreed with our third recommendation that I&A define and  document the programs and activities its divisions and branches will be  expected to implement in order for I&A to collectively meet its state and  local information-sharing mission and provide accountability and  transparency over its efforts. DHS noted that I&A was in the process of  developing a new strategic plan that will include strategic-level measures  and implementation plans.  DHS added that the plan will establish  organizational strategic objectives that I&A\u2014through its divisions and  branches\u2014will be expected to achieve, to include information sharing  with state and local entities, and will provide the measures by which its  success will be gauged.  Developing a plan that defines and documents  how I&A plans to meet its state and local information-sharing mission\u2014 including programs, activities, and priorities\u2014will meet the intent of this  recommendation.", "Finally, DHS agreed with our fourth recommendation that I&A establish  plans and time frames for developing performance measures that gauge  the results that I&A\u2019s information-sharing efforts have achieved and how  they have enhanced homeland security. DHS noted that I&A is in the  process of developing a new strategic implementation plan that will  include strategic-level measures.  DHS added that the plan will provide a  basis for gauging, among other things, the results of I&A\u2019s information  sharing efforts.  We support I&A\u2019s intention to develop additional  performance measures. However, to fully address the intent of our  recommendation, I&A should commit to plans and time frames for  developing outcome-based performance measures that gauge the  information-sharing results and impacts of I&A\u2019s state and local efforts  and how these efforts have affected homeland security.", "The full text of DHS's written comments is reprinted in appendix VI.
