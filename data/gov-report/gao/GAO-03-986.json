An adjustment is made to the mileage rate for rural trips to account for higher costs. CMS has stated that this rural adjustment may not sufficiently target providers serving sparsely populated rural areas. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) directed GAO to examine rural ambulance costs.

Ambulance providers' total costs primarily reflect readiness--the need to have an ambulance and crew available when emergency calls are received. Readiness-related costs are fixed, meaning that they do not increase with the number of trips provided, as long as a provider has excess capacity. As a result, providers that make fewer trips tend to have a higher cost per trip than those that make more trips. We also found that the length of providers' trips had little effect on their cost per trip. The modest variation in Medicare payments to ambulance providers that serve rural counties probably does not fully reflect their differences in costs because the key factor affecting provider costs--the number of trips--varies widely across rural counties. In 2001, the least densely populated quarter of rural counties averaged far fewer trips than the most densely populated quarter. This suggests that the cost per trip is likely higher for providers serving the least populated rural counties. On average ambulance providers are paid somewhat more for trips in the least densely populated rural counties than for those in other rural counties. However, those payment differences are dwarfed by the difference in trip volume. Because trip volume is a strong indicator of costs, the Medicare payment differences across rural counties likely do not fully reflect differences in providers' cost per trip. In implementing the fee schedule, CMS adjusted the mileage rate for rural trips to account for the higher cost per trip of providers serving rural areas. However, trip volume is a better indicator of providers' cost per trip than is trip length. Thus, adjusting the base rates for rural trips--the portion of Medicare's payment that is designed to pay for providers' fixed costs--is a more appropriate way of accounting for rural low-volume providers' higher cost per trip than adjusting the mileage rate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, Medicare paid over $2 billion for over 10 million ambulance trips  for its 40 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries.  Ambulance providers  that deliver Medicare-covered services range from small community, one- vehicle operations staffed entirely by volunteers to large privately owned  firms or government agencies that operate many vehicles and rely on paid  staff.  Medicare covers medically necessary ambulance services when  other means of transportation, such as a wheelchair van or a taxi, are  inadvisable, given the beneficiary\u2019s medical condition at the time.   Medically necessary ambulance trips include both emergency care, such as  responses to 911 calls, and nonemergency care, such as transfers from one  hospital to another.", "In 2002, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented  a congressionally mandated ambulance fee schedule that substantially  changed the way Medicare pays for ambulance services.  Under the fee  schedule, providers receive a base payment per trip, which varies by the  kind of service provided, and a mileage payment, which varies by the length  of the trip.  A rural adjustment, which is applied to the mileage payment,  increases the payment for trips that begin in rural areas, generally defined  as areas outside of metropolitan areas.  CMS has stated that this approach  to a rural adjustment was the only one feasible at the time the agency was  developing the fee schedule.  However, as we have stated before and as  CMS has acknowledged, this adjustment may not sufficiently target the  increased payments to providers serving sparsely populated rural areas.   These providers may incur higher per trip costs than other providers  because of their low volume of ambulance trips.  We have recommended  that CMS develop a more refined rural adjustment, and CMS is exploring  alternative approaches to adjusting payments for rural ambulance trips.", "Developing a Medicare payment method for ambulance services that  maintains beneficiary access to these services has been complicated by the  wide variation in ambulance providers, their volume of trips, and the areas  they serve.  For example, ambulance providers in rural areas where there  are few people are likely to be idle more often than providers in more  densely populated areas, and may need to earn more per trip to maintain  ambulances and crews.  As a result, payments that are appropriate for  providers serving densely populated urban areas may not be appropriate  for those serving less densely populated rural areas.  Recognizing cost  differences across providers in the payment method is important because  many providers rely on Medicare revenue and their continuing availability  is critical to ensuring beneficiaries\u2019 access to services.", "The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act of 2000 (BIPA) directed us to examine the cost of ambulance services  in rural areas.

This survey, the sole national data source on the costs of providing  ambulance services, obtained responses from a nationally representative  sample of 421 ground ambulance providers that participated in Medicare.   To determine how the factors affecting ambulance providers\u2019 costs vary  geographically, we used data from the 2001 Area Resource File (ARF),  which is maintained by the Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA), to examine the characteristics of urban and rural counties, such as  their population and land area.  In addition, we used Medicare claims data  for 2001 to determine the number and length of Medicare-covered  ambulance trips delivered in urban and rural counties, and the number of  providers that served those areas.  We also used these data to estimate  Medicare\u2019s average payments for ambulance trips under the fee schedule.

Some deliver only basic life support (BLS) while others deliver  advanced life support (ALS) services.  In addition to responding to  emergencies, ambulance providers may provide nonemergency  transportation, such as transfers from one hospital to another.  For some  ambulance providers, nonemergency trips account for a significant share  of their trips; for others, such trips account for few or none of their trips.   Some ambulance providers are the sole providers serving their  communities, while others operate in areas with multiple ambulance  providers.", "Medicare ambulance providers also differ in the percentage of their trips  covered by Medicare and in their reliance on Medicare revenue.  In 1998,  Medicare beneficiaries on average accounted for about half of the total  trips by providers that billed Medicare.

We tested a number of additional terms, including  length of trips, but they were all either statistically insignificant or  significant but with very small effects.  We restricted our model to  providers with 5,000 or fewer total trips per year because we were  primarily interested in rural providers, which generally have fewer trips.   However, our sensitivity analyses showed that the results were broadly  similar when the model was applied to all full cost providers.  Our model  has an adjusted R of 0.48, indicating that the model explains 48 percent of  the variance in costs.  In general, when trip volume declines, the estimated  cost per trip increases, although less than proportionately.  That is, a 10  percent decrease in trip volume is associated with an increase in cost per  trip of less than 10 percent.", "Analysis of variation in factors affecting costs across geographic areas.  To  examine differences between urban and rural areas in factors affecting  ambulance costs, we grouped counties with similar characteristics.  We  followed CMS in classifying counties in metropolitan statistical areas  (MSA) as urban counties and counties outside MSAs as rural.  However,  for our analysis we did not apply the Goldsmith modification that CMS uses  to identify as rural certain areas within MSAs.  These rural areas are  typically small, so we did not treat them as rural counties because that  would distort our urban and rural comparisons.  Our sensitivity analyses  determined that our findings would have been generally the same if we had  considered these areas as rural counties, although in some cases the  differences between urban and rural counties would have been heightened.", "To examine differences among rural counties, we grouped them based on  their population density.  Population density\u2014the ratio of population to  land area\u2014is a commonly used measure of rurality.  We used population  density to group counties into quartiles, and then divided the least densely  populated quartile of rural counties into frontier counties\u2014those with six  or fewer persons per square mile\u2014and nonfrontier counties, because of  our interest in the most sparsely populated rural areas.  Using this  grouping, we found that ambulance trip volume decreased steadily from  the most densely populated rural counties to the least densely populated.   We also examined several other classification systems: urban influence  codes (UIC), which classify counties based on each county\u2019s largest city  and its proximity to other areas with large, urban populations; rural-urban  continuum codes (RUCC), which classify metropolitan counties by the size  of the urban area and nonurban counties by the size of the urban  population and proximity to a metropolitan area; and rural-urban  commuting areas (RUCA), which classify census tracts using patterns of  urbanization, population density, and daily commuting patterns, and then  map the census tracts into zip codes.  These systems are more complex  than the system we used, and we found that they did not help explain  variation in trip volume as well as counties grouped by population density.", "To confirm the effect of population density on trip volume, we did several  additional analyses.  We regressed counties\u2019 annual volume of Medicare  trips (expressed as natural logarithms) on population and land area  (expressed as natural logarithms).  Population had a positive effect on the  number of trips, while land area had a negative effect.  An increase of 1  percent in population increased the number of trips by about 1 percent in a  county, while an increase of 1 percent in land area decreased the number of  trips by about 0.1 percent.  Population density combines the two effects:   a 1 percent increase in population density increases the number of trips by  0.7 percent. is a measure of the proportion of the  variation in the dependent variable (the natural logarithm of trips) accounted for by the  independent variables (the natural logarithms of land area and population)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Rural Counties Grouped by Medicare Population Density", "paragraphs": ["Total population density is strongly related to Medicare population density.
