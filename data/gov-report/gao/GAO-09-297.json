Additionally, IRS would benefit from being able to identify which software package the taxpayer used to better target research and efforts to increase software use and electronic filing. IRS provides some oversight of the tax software industry but does not fully monitor compliance with established security and privacy standards. Further, IRS has not developed a plan to monitor compliance with new standards, which are optional in 2009 but may be mandatory in 2010. Without appropriate monitoring, IRS has limited assurance that the standards are being implemented or complied with. IRS has not conducted an assessment to determine whether taxpayers' use of tax software poses any risks to tax administration. Risks include that IRS may be missing opportunities to systemically identify areas to improve software guidance and enhance information security. IRS officials said the likely benefits of an assessment would not warrant the costs but have not determined either the benefits or costs of such an assessment. Moreover, IRS has also said that it is in the agency's best interest to ensure that taxpayers can rely on commercial software to make electronic filing accurate, easy, and efficient. Further, if even small improvements in the accuracy of tax returns could be made by clarifying the guidance in tax software, the effect on revenue could be substantial.

Taxpayers use tax software as an alternative to  hiring a paid preparer or manually preparing tax returns on their own.  Taxpayers rely on tax software to answer tax law questions, prepare tax  returns that are accurate, and, in many cases, file those returns  electronically. Taxpayers also expect tax software to ensure the security  and privacy of their tax information. Tax software that does not help  taxpayers prepare accurate returns or that cannot be trusted to file  electronically in a secure and timely manner could contribute to taxpayer  noncompliance, the need for costly IRS enforcement actions, and  taxpayers reverting to error-prone paper filing.

One company\u2019s product\u2014Intuit\u2019s TurboTax\u2014 represented over half of the returns filed electronically by individual  taxpayers. These and other tax software companies generally offer several  versions of retail, online, and downloadable software packages that  taxpayers can use to prepare federal and state tax returns. They generally  charge less for versions that are designed to handle simple tax returns and  charge more for versions that can prepare more complicated returns such  as those dealing with business expenses. In 2008, the three companies also  employed two basic pricing strategies. One strategy was to charge  separate, incremental fees for federal return preparation, state return  preparation, and electronic filing. For example, in 2008, one company  charged about $40 for federal return preparation, with incremental fees of  about $20 for electronic filing. The other pricing strategy used was to  bundle several services together\u2014typically return preparation and  electronic filing\u2014and charge one price for the bundle.", "Tax software is one of the three major methods that taxpayers use to  prepare their returns. As figure 1 illustrates, over 39 million (or 28 percent)  of the approximately 138 million individual income tax returns filed in  2007 were prepared by individuals using tax software. Over 77 million  individuals used a paid preparer to prepare returns electronically in 2007,  and 71 percent of those returns were also submitted electronically to IRS.  The remaining 21 million returns were manually prepared by individuals or  their paid preparers. After preparation, taxpayers can either electronically  file their return or mail a paper copy to IRS. Figure 1 shows that millions  of taxpayers who had a return prepared electronically (either by using tax  software or a paid preparer) filed paper copies. Such returns are called \u201cv- coded\u201d because IRS codes such returns with a \u201cv\u201d to process and track  them separately from other paper-filed returns.", "Many of the companies that sell tax software also have partnered with IRS  to provide free electronic preparation and filing to eligible taxpayers.  Those taxpayers have the option of filing their returns for free using  products from the Free File Alliance, LLC (FFA)\u2014a consortium of tax  preparation companies that provides online electronic preparation and  filing to eligible taxpayers at no charge. Figure 1 includes the  approximately 4 million FFA returns filed in 2007 by individuals using  commercial software.", "To help improve paper processing, about half of the state revenue  agencies use a bar coding technology to convert data on paper returns to  electronic data. Bar coding is less expensive and more accurate than  processing paper returns because it eliminates manual transcription but is  still more expensive and less efficient than electronic filing. IRS does not  use this technology for processing individuals tax returns.", "Returns filed electronically have significant advantages for IRS and  taxpayers compared to paper-filed returns as discussed below and further  detailed in appendix III.", "IRS estimates that processing an electronically filed return costs the  agency $0.35 per return while processing a paper return costs $2.87 per  return. Using IRS\u2019s current cost estimates based on fiscal year 2005  return data, we estimate IRS would have saved approximately $143  million if the 56.9 million paper returns in 2007 had been filed  electronically.", "Electronically filed returns also have higher accuracy rates than paper- filed returns because tax software eliminates transcription and other  errors.  IRS processes electronically filed returns in less than half the time it  takes to process paper returns, facilitating faster refunds.", "We have previously reported that electronically filed returns have the  potential to improve IRS\u2019s enforcement programs. IRS does not use all  tax return information in its automated compliance checking programs  because IRS policy is to post the same information from electronic and  paper returns, and the cost of transcription prevents IRS from  transcribing paper returns in full. IRS officials previously estimated in  2007 that having all tax return information available electronically  would result in a $175 million increase in tax revenue annually from at  least one of its compliance programs.", "IRS recently issued the results of the first phase of its Advancing E-file  study, which examines tax filing behavior and characteristics and contains  potential options to increase electronic filing.", "We have previously reported that IRS\u2019s ability to achieve efficiencies  depends on its continuing ability to increase electronic filing. We recently  suggested that Congress mandate that paid tax return preparers use  electronic filing and that IRS require software companies to include bar  codes on individual paper returns. IRS agreed to study the latter option.", "IRS has responsibility for enforcing tax laws in the Internal Revenue Code  (IRC). In addition, IRC section 6011 provides specific authority for IRS to  prescribe forms and regulations for tax returns, including the information  required on those returns and whether they must be filed electronically.  The IRC imposes civil and criminal penalties on paid tax return preparers,  which include tax software companies, for unauthorized disclosure or use  of a taxpayer\u2019s personal and tax-related information. In addition to tax  law penalties, the providers of services for preparing and filing tax returns  are subject to the privacy and safeguarding rules created under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (see app. IV)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Little Information about How Tax Software Pricing Strategies Affect Taxpayers\u2019 Willingness to Use Software and File Electronically", "paragraphs": ["For the 2009 tax filing season, the two largest tax software companies that  previously charged separate electronic filing fees for federal returns in  some of their retail and downloadable products have eliminated those  electronic filing fees.

However, for some products, the companies will still charge  separate, incremental fees for other services such as state return  preparation, state electronic filing, and return review by a tax professional.  According to industry representatives, IRS officials suggested they  eliminate separate federal filing fees to encourage electronic filing.  However, the effect of these changes on electronic filing will not begin to  be known until the end of the present tax filing period and will be difficult  to determine. On one hand, taxpayers who buy a tax software package  that includes a bundle of services may be encouraged to use software and  file electronically because there is no longer a separate charge for doing  so. On the other hand, if the cost of such a package is significantly higher,  it may discourage taxpayers\u2019 use of tax software since they may not be  able to purchase a less expensive package that does not include electronic  filing.", "The two largest tax software companies that eliminated federal electronic  filing fees also made some other pricing changes for preparing and  electronically filing both federal and state tax returns in 2009 including:    online tax packages are generally priced lower than in 2008;    online tax packages are generally priced lower than    most retail/downloadable packages remained essentially the same in  price when compared to 2008.", "For the third largest tax software company, its package prices for both  online and retail/downloadable products remained the same in 2009 as in  2008 because the preparation and electronic filing fees remained the same  in both years. See appendix II for more details.", "Another change in 2009 is that IRS and FFA have agreed to provide a  fillable version of federal tax forms. These fillable tax forms, which  taxpayers can complete online and file electronically, will provide a basic  calculator function but will not provide the question-and-answer format  similar to commercial tax software. The forms will be accessible for free  to all taxpayers via IRS\u2019s Web site and are in addition to FFA\u2019s current free  products for eligible taxpayers described in the background of this report.", "As part of the upcoming second phase of its Advancing E-file study, IRS  plans further surveys to obtain taxpayers\u2019 views on electronic filing.  However, it does not plan to include questions, for example, about the  effect of 2009 pricing changes on taxpayers\u2019 willingness to file  electronically. Currently, IRS has little such information. For example, IRS  and the Oversight Board surveys to date have not addressed how a  separate charge for electronic filing affects taxpayers\u2019 willingness to file  electronically.", "With the 2009 changes, however, IRS has an opportunity to directly  measure the effect of eliminating separate fees to file federal tax returns  electronically, making changes to software pricing overall, and making  electronic tax forms available so that all taxpayers can complete and file  for free online. We recognize that such a direct study would not be simple  to conduct because, for example, it may be difficult to isolate the effect of  multiple price changes and factors other than price, such as accuracy and  security, which also affect taxpayers\u2019 willingness to file electronically.  Further, prior year data are limited. However, even limited information  about how taxpayers\u2019 electronic filing behavior changes after price  changes would give IRS an empirical basis for supporting the continued  elimination of separate fees for electronic filing and other pricing changes  as well as complementing surveys of taxpayers\u2019 views.", "Ideally, to study the effect of pricing on electronic filing rates, IRS would  need to know the software package and version used by each taxpayer in  order to know the approximate price paid. Currently, IRS requires a  software identification number on electronically filed returns, which does  not identify the specific software package or version used to prepare those  returns. IRS does not require any type of software identification number  on v-coded returns (returns prepared using software but filed on paper).  Having a more complete software identification number would not only  allow IRS to better target its research but also its enforcement activities  and efforts to increase use of tax software and electronic filing. Officials  from one software company told us that such a change could be easily  made by their company at a relatively low cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Oversight of the Tax Software Industry Is Not Comprehensive or Systematic", "paragraphs": ["In its Advancing E-file study, IRS reported that one of the most important  factors influencing taxpayers\u2019 use of tax software is its ability to  accurately apply tax laws. IRS requires tax software to pass its  Participants Acceptance Testing System (PATS), which includes verifying  that computations are correct, tax rate schedules are updated, and returns  transmitted electronically are compatible with IRS systems. However,  PATS does not go further in testing to determine, for example, whether the  guidance tax software provides is sufficient in helping taxpayers prepare  accurate tax returns.", "IRS developed a National Account Manager (NAM) position in 2000 to  serve as the main communication channel between the tax software  industry and IRS. NAMs communicate in regularly scheduled conference  calls with tax software companies about issues of mutual interest  including tax law changes, updates to IRS forms and publications, and the  upcoming tax filing season. Software companies also contact the NAMs  when they encounter technical issues such as a disruption to electronic  filing.

IRS\u2019s monitoring efforts allow the agency  and software companies to identify and resolve problems with  electronically filed returns.", "For example, in 2008, IRS asked tax software companies to hold returns  with the Alternative Minimum Tax until IRS was able to process them.  Through its monitoring efforts, IRS officials identified companies that  were transmitting those types of returns which IRS then rejected. IRS sent  notices to these companies, which reduced the number of rejected  returns.", "IRS has worked with the tax software industry on an ad hoc basis to  clarify the guidance provided by tax software.

Prior to this change, some  companies\u2019 software defaulted to a \u201cno\u201d response.", "Another example involving commercial software used by paid preparers  rather than individual taxpayers shows that IRS can work with the  software companies to influence and improve guidance:  IRS\u2019s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) office worked with a group of  tax software developers to ensure software used by paid preparers  eliminated default answers where taxpayers\u2019 answers are critical to  return EITC accuracy, and incorporated a \u201cnote\u201d capability in the tax  software enabling the preparer to record additional inquiries and  taxpayer responses.", "IRS officials, however, acknowledged that these efforts were not the result  of a comprehensive and systematic approach to improving the guidance  provided by software. IRS does not have plans to review tax software to  see if the guidance it provides to taxpayers is sufficient in helping them  prepare accurate returns, in part because IRS relies on the extensive  scenario and other testing done by the industry as discussed in the next  section. As a result, IRS does not know if it is missing opportunities to  improve tax software guidance to better ensure compliance. As an  example of such an opportunity, we recently recommended that IRS  expand outreach efforts to external stakeholders, including software  providers, as part of an effort to reduce common types of misreporting  related to rental real estate.

Taxpayers who file their  returns on their home computers using online, retail, or downloadable tax  software products are sending their returns to authorized electronic filing  providers. IRS does not have the capability to receive electronic returns  directly from individual taxpayers. Only IRS-authorized electronic filing  providers, including Electronic Return Originators (ERO) and software  companies, among others, can transmit tax returns electronically to IRS.  According to TIGTA, EROs were responsible for the majority of  electronically filed tax returns accepted by IRS in 2007. IRS regulates  authorized electronic filing providers by conducting suitability checks of  applicants during the application screening process, including checks of  the applicants\u2019 criminal backgrounds, credit histories, and tax  compliance. Once approved, authorized electronic filing providers are  subject to IRS monitoring visits, which are conducted to ensure that the  providers are meeting requirements such as ensuring security systems are  in place to prevent unauthorized access to taxpayer data. However, in  2007, TIGTA identified deficiencies in IRS\u2019s monitoring program. For  example, IRS did not suspend electronic filing providers who were in  violation of program requirements even though they had been issued  notifications of suspension. In response, IRS added a new control  procedure, effective January 30, 2008, to better track suspension cases.", "IRS has also established security and privacy requirements that apply to  FFA members. For example, according to IRS officials, FFA members  must adhere to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards and third-party  security and privacy certifications, and use PCI-approved companies to  conduct penetration and vulnerability testing. IRS has a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) with FFA requiring members to provide IRS with  documentation demonstrating compliance with security standards.  However, IRS does not fully monitor compliance with existing FFA  security and privacy requirements. Although IRS receives FFA security  reports, it does not actively review or validate those reports unless a  problem, such as a security incident, is reported.", "For 2009, IRS is suggesting that all authorized electronic filing providers  that participate in online filing adhere to new security and privacy  standards, the majority of which are similar to existing FFA requirements;  however, IRS is not requiring compliance with those standards (see app.  VI). These standards are optional in 2009 because IRS finalized them late  in 2008. IRS has no plans to determine if tax software companies that are  authorized electronic filing providers participating in online filing are  adhering to advisory security and privacy standards for the 2009 filing  season. Because the new standards would apply to a relatively few  number of companies and include the three largest, the costs to collect  information on adherence to the standards would be low. For the 2010  filing season, IRS may make those standards mandatory. Also, IRS is  considering expanding these standards to include software companies that  offer retail and downloadable products but has not yet established a time  frame for doing so. IRS officials stated they are considering developing a  plan to monitor compliance with these security and privacy standards for  2010. Without appropriate monitoring, IRS has limited assurance that the  standards have been adequately implemented or software companies are  complying with the standards.

For approximately 13 hours, taxpayers could not reliably file their returns  electronically through Intuit to IRS. According to IRS, about 171,000 tax  returns were affected. IRS accommodated affected taxpayers by extending  the tax filing deadline and not applying late filing penalties.

IRS and software industry officials we spoke with believe it is  in the industry\u2019s financial interest to ensure that taxpayers can rely on tax  software. In their annual filing reports, both Intuit and H&R Block  identified financial losses and harm to their reputation as potential risks of  system failures or interruptions. For example, Intuit reported one of the  many risks to its company is that the interruption or failure of its  information and communication systems could cause customers to revert  to paper filings, resulting in reduced company revenues. In addition,  according to IRS officials and tax software industry representatives, the  industry has not yet experienced a significant problem with tax software  or electronic filing. IRS and tax software industry officials further stated  that the industry is better suited to conduct extensive scenario and  security testing because of the significant cost of conducting such testing.  Software industry officials reported spending tens of millions of dollars  each year on testing to ensure accuracy. Further, they reported employing  hundreds of tax analysts to review and simplify IRS instructions,  publications, and forms; monitor proposed changes to tax legislation; and  consult with IRS and state revenue agencies to ensure accurate  interpretations of tax laws. Intuit officials reported complying with  recognized international security standards. Intuit officials also reported  undergoing a biennial third-party security assessment, as well as  proactively conducting ongoing security application assessments and  vulnerability and penetration testing.

Continued growth in  electronic filing depends on increasing use by individual taxpayers and  maintaining their confidence in the accuracy as well as the security and  privacy of their tax information, and the reliability of electronic filing.  However, IRS does not know whether there are security and privacy risks  because it has not monitored existing requirements. While tax software  companies have not reported significant security breaches involving  taxpayer data either residing on their databases or during electronic  transmission to IRS in recent years, cases of lost or stolen data at other  taxing authorities illustrate the potential negative outcomes of such a  breach. For example, in 2007, Oregon\u2019s Department of Revenue  experienced a breach in which electronic files containing confidential  taxpayer information may have been compromised by an ex-employee  downloading a contaminated file.", "While tax administration has not been significantly affected by disruptions  to electronic filing, as noted previously, on tax day 2007, about 171,000  Intuit customers experienced a 13-hour disruption. During this time, Intuit  customers could not reliably file their returns electronically with Intuit,  and ultimately to IRS, but this disruption did not significantly affect tax  administration.

We have made several recent  recommendations intended to improve the compliance of these taxpayers  by enhancing the clarity of tax software which, as we noted, IRS plans to  address in most cases. However, IRS has not conducted research on the  correlation between tax software and compliance\u2014such as whether and  how tax software packages influence compliance. Such research could be  enhanced even more by the use of a single software identification number,  which would allow IRS to identify the specific software package used by a  taxpayer. Although limited testing of hypothetical scenarios by TIGTA and  the National Taxpayer Advocate led them to identify possible software  weaknesses that might affect compliance, this testing was based on a  nonstatistical sample of scenarios and software packages. Because there  are millions of potential scenarios and each one is different, it is not  possible to generalize from the nonstatistical samples and reach  conclusions about the overall effect of tax software on compliance.  Furthermore, hypothetical scenarios do not provide evidence about how  taxpayers actually use the software or whether taxpayers are actually  complying with tax laws.", "IRS is already devoting resources to oversight of the tax software industry,  as described in the previous section.

In such markets, if the price charged to taxpayers is equal  to the marginal cost, companies will not be able to cover their average cost  of production and cannot stay in business. Therefore, companies in these  markets will attempt to recover more of their fixed costs through various  forms of price discrimination. Price discrimination can take the form of  developing different versions of the product to match the needs of  different types of consumers, who are then charged different prices  according to their willingness to pay.", "The literature also suggests that companies in these markets may offer  products that consist of several services bundled together\u2014 sometimes  charging separate prices for each service or charging a single price for  different combinations (bundles) of services.
