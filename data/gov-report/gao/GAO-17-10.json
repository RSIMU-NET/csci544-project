GAO compared certification and training to relevant guidance; reviewed relevant documents to identify intelligence inputs and the provision of intelligence input into acquisition programs; and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed certifications and training for acquisition and intelligence personnel, but it does not have certifications for certain personnel who provide intelligence support to acquisition programs. These personnel help integrate threat information on foreign capabilities and intelligence mission data\u2014technical intelligence such as radar signatures and geospatial mapping data\u2014into acquisition programs. DOD uses certifications to determine that an employee has necessary education, training, and experience. The lack of certifications for personnel providing intelligence support to acquisition programs has led to the services developing varying levels of training: the Air Force certifies and requires training specific to providing intelligence support, the Army offers training that is not required, and the Navy has no formal training. Without certifications for personnel providing intelligence support to acquisition programs, DOD does not have assurance that these personnel are prepared to carry out their duties.", "DOD has multiple efforts underway to improve processes and procedures for integrating intelligence into its acquisitions but does not require prioritization of intelligence mission data, which would identify those data most needed for a weapon system to perform its mission. A task force DOD created in 2015 to better integrate intelligence into acquisition programs identified the need for prioritization and proposed processes and procedures for doing so. Without department-wide requirements to prioritize intelligence mission data, new processes and procedures such as those developed by the task force may not be fully implemented and weapon systems could be deployed without the intelligence mission data they need to perform their missions.", "DOD is developing two tools for integrating intelligence into major defense acquisition programs. One tool to share threat information lacks a communication plan to obtain feedback from users to better ensure its effectiveness. Without user feedback, DOD may not receive useful information to develop the tool. The other tool is for acquisition programs to communicate their intelligence needs to the intelligence community, though the services did not identify a need for the tool and there is no mechanism to fund its implementation and operation. Without assessing the need for such a tool or plans or funding for implementation and operation, DOD may be using funds unnecessarily to develop an unneeded tool."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD create certifications and training for intelligence support personnel, require that intelligence mission data be prioritized, develop a communication plan for a threat information tool, and determine the need to develop another tool.

DOD reported in March 2016 that it  expects to invest $1.6 trillion on the development or procurement of its  portfolio of 80 major defense acquisition programs, many of which  depend on intelligence input both during the acquisition process and  subsequently, to effectively perform their missions once deployed. The  intelligence community provides this information not only when systems  are deployed in support of the warfighter, but also as the platforms are  developed and procured as a defense acquisition program. This latter  role of the intelligence community, known as intelligence support to  acquisition, has become increasingly important as weapon systems have  become more advanced and dependent on processing data from on- board sensors to perform their mission.", "The intelligence community provides support to acquisition programs in  two broad categories: threat intelligence on foreign capabilities, and  intelligence mission data. Threat intelligence identifies the capability and  strategy of an adversary\u2019s system that could defeat or reduce the  effectiveness of a friendly military mission. Intelligence mission data refer  to technical intelligence information such as radar signatures or  geospatial mapping data that weapon systems use to carry out a mission  once deployed.", "Further, according to DOD, adversaries are developing new threats more  rapidly than the department can develop new systems to counter them.  There is a growing concern that the technological superiority of the United  States over foreign adversaries has been decreasing, thereby  representing a threat to national security and military capabilities. The  confluence of these trends has created recognition within DOD of the  need for more effective collaboration across the defense acquisition and  intelligence communities. To address this issue, among others, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  (USD(AT&L)) has implemented a series of reform efforts known as Better  Buying Power to improve various aspects of the defense acquisition  enterprise, such as improving collaboration between the acquisition and  intelligence communities. In the third phase of this effort, known as Better  Buying Power 3.0, USD(AT&L) identified a need for stronger partnerships  among the acquisition and intelligence communities in order to maintain  knowledge of current and potential threats.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 includes a  provision that we review the processes and procedures for the integration  of intelligence into the defense acquisition process. This report  evaluates, for major defense acquisition programs, the extent to which  DOD has (1) processes and procedures for certifying and training  personnel assigned to provide intelligence support to acquisition  programs; (2) efforts to improve processes and procedures for integrating  intelligence into its acquisition programs; and (3) efforts to develop new  tools for integrating intelligence into its acquisition programs. We also  collected information related to DOD\u2019s efforts to identify opportunities for  weapon systems to collect intelligence even when unrelated to their  primary mission, which is presented in appendix I.", "To address each of our three objectives, we reviewed written directives,  instructions, publications, guides, and briefs related to the role of  intelligence in acquisitions. We also interviewed officials from the  acquisition, intelligence, and requirements components of DOD, including  the offices of the USD(AT&L) and the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence (USD(I)); the Joint Staff; the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marine Corps; and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). We  interviewed members of the Acquisition Intelligence Requirements  Executive Steering Group and Task Force to assess their efforts to better  integrate intelligence into DOD acquisitions. We also interviewed officials  from the offices of the Director of National Intelligence; Cost Assessment  and Program Evaluation; Director of Operational Test and Evaluation; and  USD(AT&L) Office of Performance Assessments and Root Cause  Analyses.", "To address the first objective we reviewed DOD guidance governing the  management of intelligence and acquisition personnel. We interviewed  officials from USD(AT&L), USD(I), the Joint Staff, and the Army, Navy, Air  Force, and Marine Corps intelligence and acquisition communities who  participate in the development of policy and management of personnel  regarding staffing, qualifications, certification, and training of personnel  providing intelligence support to acquisition programs. We also  interviewed and received written responses from Defense Acquisition  University officials regarding changes to the acquisition curriculum that  included additional intelligence material. We analyzed the certifications  and qualifications established by DOD for implementing the Defense  Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act; DOD guidance for acquisition  personnel; and certifications and qualifications for intelligence personnel  under USD(I) guidance, to determine whether any certifications apply to  personnel who provide intelligence support to acquisition programs.", "To address the second objective we interviewed or requested information  from acquisition program offices, as well as from staff who provide  intelligence support to those programs. We selected a non-generalizable  sample of six Acquisition Category I programs from the four services\u2014 including two each from the Navy and Air Force, and one each from the  Army and Marine Corps\u2014to obtain an understanding of how intelligence  is integrated into acquisition programs. We discussed the questions  orally or received written responses from each program. While the  responses we obtained are not generalizable to all major defense  acquisition programs, the information learned from program officials  provided context and important insights for our understanding of the  interaction between acquisition and intelligence personnel. To determine  current intelligence inputs and processes for major defense acquisition  programs, we reviewed both department-wide and service-level guidance,  including Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the  Defense Acquisition System, and analyzed the guidance to determine  where DOD guidance indicated that intelligence inputs into acquisition  programs are to occur. Due to the evolving nature of the role of  intelligence in acquisitions, we also sent a set of structured questions to  officials from the Office of USD(I), Joint Staff, DIA, and the intelligence  organizations of the services to confirm the key intelligence inputs into  major defense acquisitions as of June 1, 2016.", "To address the third objective, we identified two tools that DOD is  currently developing through discussions with Acquisition Intelligence  Requirements Task Force officials. We verified that these tools were in  development through interviews with officials responsible for oversight of  acquisitions and intelligence, including officials at USD(AT&L), USD(I),  and DIA. We interviewed DOD officials and viewed demonstrations of the  developmental versions of these tools. We compared the developmental  plans and information provided to us by DIA and Performance  Assessments and Root Cause Analyses officials against standards  developed by professional organizations, such as the Project  Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge, federal standards for internal controls, and key practices  for collaboration among federal agencies. Further details of our  objectives, scope, and methodology are presented in appendix II.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2015 to November  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Further, most of the intelligence inputs are to be verified or updated at  points prior to the Milestone B decision and again prior to the Milestone C  decision, the point at which approval is sought in order to progress to the  production and deployment phase. We describe the intelligence inputs  and key DOD guidance for providing intelligence support to acquisition  programs in appendix III.", "The USD(AT&L) is responsible for acquisition policy and oversight, and  as the Defense Acquisition Executive has responsibility for supervising  the Defense Acquisition System. The milestone decision authority is the  designated individual with overall responsibility for a program and has the  authority to approve its progression to the next phase of the acquisition  process. The milestone decision authority is accountable for cost,  schedule, and performance reporting. The service acquisition  communities are led by Service Acquisition Executives who are assistant  secretaries within their respective military departments. For example, the  Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology)  serves as the Army acquisition executive, while the Assistant Secretary of  the Navy (Research, Development, & Acquisition) serves as the Navy  acquisition executive. The program manager is the designated individual  with responsibility for individual acquisition programs who has the  authority to accomplish that program\u2019s development, production, and  sustainment objectives to meet the user\u2019s operational needs, and is  accountable for cost, schedule, and performance reporting to the  milestone decision authority.", "At the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff level, the J-8 Directorate  provides support to the Joint Staff for evaluating and developing force  structure requirements, and its director serves as Secretary of the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council and as Chairman of the Joint  Capabilities Board. In these capacities, the director orchestrates Joint  Staff support of the capabilities development process through the Joint  Capabilities Integration and Development System. One of the J-8  Directorate\u2019s objectives is to provide early capability development  guidance to the services. The services have different organizational  structures that define their respective requirements communities. For  example, according to the Air Force, via its Major Commands, the Air  Force has personnel responsible for 12 capability portfolios such as Air  Superiority and Global Precision Attack that manage Air Force capability  requirements.", "According to DOD, the speed of technical innovation and the complexity  of advanced weapon systems, such as the F-35, are creating an  increasing demand for specialized intelligence mission data to provide  information for sensors and automated processes supporting the  warfighter. There are several types of intelligence mission data, each  used by weapon systems in different ways, including signatures,  electronic warfare integrated reprogramming data, characteristics and  performance, order of battle, and geospatial intelligence (see figure 2).  Signatures are distinct, repeating characteristics, such as radio  frequencies or acoustic characteristics, which are associated with a  particular type of equipment, materiel, activity, individual, or event. For  example, a weapon system may associate a specific signature with an  enemy system, and identify it as such. Electronic warfare integrated  reprogramming data also describe radio frequencies, and are typically  used to attack or control other electronic systems\u2014for example, jamming  enemy radar capabilities. Characteristics and performance data describe  the abilities of a particular foreign military system, while order of battle  describes the strength and structure of armed forces. These can assist a  weapon system and its operator to prioritize and determine appropriate  actions against the enemy.", "The title, specific duties, and organizational structure for the personnel  providing intelligence support to acquisition programs vary by service  (see table 1).

At the  department level, the Air Force and the Navy may have similar  intelligence mission data needs for their respective fighter aircraft, but the  Army\u2019s intelligence mission data needs will likely differ greatly from those  of its sister services based on the respective threats each faces.", "As of July 2016, no requirements existed within DOD guidance to  prioritize intelligence mission data, though there were efforts underway in  2016 by the task force and within the Air Force to develop processes and  procedures for intelligence mission data prioritization. According to task  force and Air Force officials, the Acquisition Intelligence Requirements  Task Force worked in parallel with an Air Force effort to identify potential  processes to prioritize intelligence mission data at the acquisition program  and service levels, respectively. These officials presented proposals in  June and July 2016 for potential processes and procedures to prioritize  intelligence mission data at the acquisition program level. They also  described how prioritization at the service and department levels may be  accomplished, as shown below:", "Acquisition program prioritization: The task force proposal would  involve prioritization of intelligence mission data into the following four  levels of impact on the acquisition program\u2019s capabilities were the  data not acquired or unavailable:  1.  Level I denotes unacceptable degradation: intelligence mission  data requirements that, if not satisfied, would result in  unacceptable mission task degradation with no work-around  possible;  2.  Level II denotes significant degradation: intelligence mission  requirements that, if not satisfied, would result in a significant  mission task degradation that is unacceptable to the operator but  for which a work-around is available, acceptable to the operator,  and must be applied;  3.  Level III denotes partial degradation: intelligence mission data  requirements that, if not satisfied, would result in a partial or  minimal degradation that is acceptable to the operator and for  which a work-around is optional; and,  4.  Level IV denotes little to no impact: intelligence mission data  requirements that, if not satisfied, would result in little to no  degradation to the mission.", "Service prioritization: Air Force officials described an effort undertaken  in May 2016 to apply the individual program approach using levels 1  to 4 described above to categorize 150 intelligence mission data  needs at the service level. Task force officials stated that the Air Force  effort undertaken in fiscal year 2016 would use a cost-capability  approach to better inform the fiscal year 2017 service-wide  prioritization effort.", "Department prioritization: Task force officials indicated that  implementing prioritization at the individual program and service levels  would be required prior to developing an enterprise-wide capability to  prioritize intelligence mission data. Officials from USD(AT&L) stated  that the enterprise-wide prioritization of intelligence mission data could  also be informed by efforts related to developing Integrated DOD  Intelligence Priorities. Furthermore, officials from the DIA stated that  there is a lack of coordination regarding how the service intelligence  centers conduct their business, and that the centers currently were  not prioritizing, verifying, or balancing the work related to producing  intelligence mission data. Task force officials stated that DIA was  developing an intelligence mission data production prioritization  process that would respond to enterprise-wide intelligence mission  data priorities.", "Though DOD has taken efforts to identify and develop processes and  procedures to prioritize intelligence mission data, previous efforts have  not succeeded in implementing intelligence mission data prioritization.  Federal internal control standards state that management should  establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate  authority to achieve objectives. Per the joint memorandum that  established the Acquisition Intelligence Requirements Executive Steering  Group, the steering group and associated task force were created to  integrate, coordinate, and prioritize intelligence support functions and  processes. However, previous efforts have not succeeded in  implementing a system to prioritize these data at any level. For example,  the Intelligence Mission Data Senior Steering Group never met, and the  DIA\u2019s standing working group efforts may lead to a prevention of  duplication of intelligence mission data production efforts, but would not  lead to prioritization of the data. The Acquisition Intelligence  Requirements Task Force was created to address intelligence support to  acquisition, including intelligence mission data issues, and it has  developed some proposed processes and procedures for prioritization of  intelligence mission data. Without specific DOD guidance requiring  intelligence mission data prioritization, new processes and procedures  such as those developed by the task force and the services may not be  fully implemented. With no required process to prioritize intelligence  mission data, the intelligence community may continue to process  requests for intelligence mission data as they are received, and thus  weapon systems may not have the intelligence mission data they need to  successfully perform their missions once operational."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Developing New Tools for Integrating Intelligence into Acquisition Programs but Faces Challenges in Development and Implementation", "paragraphs": ["As of July 2016, DOD was developing new tools to better integrate  intelligence into acquisition programs.

Specifically,  officials from USD(AT&L), Joint Staff, and DIA, as well as service  intelligence officials, stated that the System Threat Assessment Reports  historically arrived at acquisition program offices late, not until after the  requirements for a new weapon system had been identified and approved  as part of the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System process  well after the designing of the weapon system had begun. Furthermore,  officials from DIA, USD(AT&L), and the service intelligence and  acquisition communities stated that these reports are often several  hundred pages in length, take as long as 9 months to produce, and are  not substantively used by acquisition program managers. According to  these officials, as well as officials from the Acquisition Intelligence  Requirements Task Force, program managers simply used System  Threat Assessment Reports to check off a box on a list of required  documents for the next acquisition milestone decision meeting.  Specifically, Air Force officials from the Joint Surveillance Target Attack  Radar System Recapitalization acquisition program stated that the  system threat assessment reports were not usable because they did not  contain the level of relevance and specificity needed by the acquisition  program, and because they were too long, fragmented, and difficult to  navigate. Lastly, DIA officials stated they had determined that as much as  80 percent of all System Threat Assessment Reports are repetitive with  each other and are not program specific.", "According to DIA, the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat is a planned  system-specific threat tool created by selecting relevant modules from a  library of threat information. DIA and officials from USD(AT&L) described  the planned threat library as consisting of dynamic modules based upon  threat category, such as fighter aircraft, that would be updated by the  analyst at the services\u2019 intelligence centers with new threat information as  it is produced within the intelligence community. DIA officials reported that  as part of a broader piloting effort the agency completed in 2015, they  were able to develop a Validated Online Lifecycle Threat in 3 months for  the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System recapitalization  program. According to DIA officials, the agency will have spent nearly  $2.5 million from fiscal year 2015 through the end of fiscal year 2016 to  begin developing the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat and the  associated threat library, and it plans to have the tool completed by the  end of fiscal year 2017.", "DIA officials reported that they had not effectively \u201cmarketed\u201d the  Validated Online Lifecycle Threat tool to its intended stakeholders and  users. While Marine Corps officials stated that the threat modules can be  updated in a shorter timeframe than a System Threat Assessment  Report, officials from the Navy and the Army did not know that DIA  intended the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat to be a dynamic system,  and they stated that they believed the planned tool to be a static, online  version of the System Threat Assessment Report. For example, Army  officials stated that the tool may be less useful than its predecessor  because it is composed of static modules that may not provide the same  level of individualized detail. Though some Navy officials who provide  intelligence support to acquisition programs indicated that they had  received briefs and other information about the new tool, other Navy  officials expressed concerns that the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat  would not be customizable to programs and could, similar to the System  Threat Assessment Report, include extensive information that was not  program-specific and could therefore be as inefficient as the System  Threat Assessment Reports. Air Force officials from the Joint Surveillance  Target Attack Radar System Recapitalization acquisition program stated  that the Validated Online Threat Assessment tool was intended to  alleviate resource constraints in the intelligence community, but that the  tool was being implemented without input from the acquisition community  and individual program management offices.", "The Project Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management  Body of Knowledge states that managing stakeholders\u2019 engagement  helps to increase the probability of project success by ensuring that  stakeholders clearly understand the project goals, objectives, benefits,  and risks.

On some of the  responses to our data collection instrument, the respondents provided  comments that indicated they were not familiar with the input, and on the  others, we attribute the variance to different understandings of guidance  among the respondents.", "During our review of DOD guidance to identify intelligence inputs into  acquisition programs throughout the acquisition lifecycle we identified the  following key guidance documents for providing intelligence support to  acquisition programs:", "DOD Directive 5000.01: The Defense Acquisition System, issued May  12, 2003, provides management principles and mandatory policies  and procedures for managing all acquisition programs, along with  DOD Instruction 5000.02. This directive notes that intelligence and the  understanding of threat capabilities are integral to system  development and acquisitions decisions, and that program managers  are to keep threat capabilities current and validated in program  documents throughout the acquisition process.", "DOD Instruction 5000.02: Operation of the Defense Acquisition  System, issued January 7, 2015, provides the detailed procedures  that guide the operation of the Defense Acquisition System.  Regarding intelligence inputs into the acquisition process, among  others, the guidance identifies the requirement for a Lifecycle Mission  Data Plan for acquisition programs dependent upon intelligence  mission data. Additionally, the guidance describes the need to  consider threat projections in the context of Analyses of Alternatives.  It further notes that affordability analysis should involve a DOD  component\u2019s intelligence and acquisition communities. Finally, DOD  Instruction 5000.02 lists requirements for a number of intelligence  inputs, such as Capstone Threat Assessments, Initial Threat  Environment Assessments, System Threat Assessment Reports, and  Technology Targeting Risk Assessments. According to DOD officials,  several of these inputs are being phased out.", "DOD Directive 5250.01: Management of Intelligence Mission Data  (IMD) in DOD Acquisition, issued January 22, 2013, establishes  policies and assigns responsibilities to provide linkages between the  management, production, and application of DOD intelligence mission  data and accommodation of intelligence mission data in the  acquisition process. It helps to synchronize the acquisition,  intelligence, and requirement communities regarding intelligence  integration into the requirements process and acquisition life cycle.  According to Acquisition Intelligence requirements Task Force  officials, this directive is currently under revision.", "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 5123.01G: Charter of  the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), issued February  12, 2015, implements the Joint Requirements Oversight Council,  established by statute, which supports the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff in carrying out the duties of the principal military  advisor to the President, National Security Staff, and Secretary of  Defense, among other functions. This instruction notes that the  Secretary of Defense has designated the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence as one of the advisors to the Council, and identifies the  Director of the Joint Staff Directorate for Intelligence as an advisor on  intelligence supportability and intelligence interoperability issues,  among other things.", "Manual for the Operation of the Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System (JCIDS), issued February 12, 2015 (including  changes through December 18, 2015): The manual provides detailed  guidelines and procedures for the Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System, and describes interactions of that process with  several other departmental processes. Among other things, the  manual contains a content guide for intelligence supportability,  providing general descriptions of categories of intelligence support, to  assist with the identification of intelligence support requirements and  sufficiency or risk of shortfalls in intelligence infrastructure required to  support a proposed potential acquisition program throughout its  lifecycle. The manual indicates that in cases where the intelligence  support requirements exceed the intelligence community\u2019s ability to  provide support, resources required to augment the intelligence  support must be accounted for in program affordability documentation.  Categories of intelligence support listed in the manual include  intelligence manpower support, intelligence resource support,  intelligence planning and operations support, targeting support, and  intelligence mission data support, among others. Intelligence  manpower support is to be addressed where the proposed acquisition  will require intelligence personnel for development, testing, training, or  operation. In some circumstances, the category may address  necessary manpower changes or specific required skills. Intelligence  resource support is to be addressed if the proposed acquisition or  supporting efforts will require or depend upon intelligence funding.", "Defense Acquisition Guidebook: The Defense Acquisition University  maintains this DOD best practice guide, which complements DOD  Directive 5000.01 and DOD Instruction 5000.02. Chapter 8 \u2013  Intelligence Analysis Support to Acquisition\u2014describes various  aspects of providing intelligence support to acquisition programs such  as threat intelligence support and signature and other intelligence  mission data support.
