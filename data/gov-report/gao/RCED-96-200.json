Key urban issues, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and the economic viability of neighborhoods and commercial areas, are significantly affected by the decisions on how these funds are spent. The decisions, in turn, grow out of the urban transportation planning process and the role of the nation\u2019s 339 metropolitan planning organizations (MPO)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MPOs Vary in Size and Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1970s, MPOs have been significant players in urban transportation planning. An MPO is not a discrete decision-making body with real jurisdictional powers, such as a city or county government. Instead, an MPO is best viewed as a consortium of governments and other bodies\u2014such as transit agencies and citizens groups\u2014that join together for cooperative transportation planning. An MPO\u2019s organization and membership often consists of (1) a policy-making board involving elected officials from the local governments in the metropolitan area; (2) a technical committee consisting of professional staff of local, state, and federal transportation agencies; and (3) an MPO staff. The MPO\u2019s primary mission is to develop a consensus on a long-term transportation plan for an urban area and to develop a transportation improvement program (TIP) that identifies projects to implement the plan. How each of the 339 MPOs in the United States fulfills this mission depends on its relationship with the state department of transportation and other transportation operators, the number of local governments in the region, the size and experience of the MPO staff, the growth rate of the population, and the number of transportation modes in the region.", "According to a 1995 report on MPOs by the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), some MPO-like organizations existed in the 1950s to prepare special metropolitan planning studies in Chicago, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. In 1970, federal policy fostered the development of comprehensive urban transportation planning by requiring the creation of planning agencies in areas with populations of 50,000 or greater to carry out cooperative planning at the metropolitan level. Originally, all MPOs were treated alike under federal laws and regulations. In the mid-1980s, when funding for metropolitan planning was reduced, preference for funding was given to those MPOs in metropolitan areas over 200,000 in population, areas now known as Transportation Management Areas (TMA).", "ISTEA\u2019s funding provisions also provided additional discretion and funding to those MPOs located in areas violating the federal air quality standards. ISTEA established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program (CMAQ) and authorized $6 billion over 6 years to help the areas not in attainment with the air quality standards (nonattainment areas) reach compliance with the Clean Air Act\u2019s (CAA) requirements. With CMAQ funds, the MPOs located in the areas that are not in compliance with the federal standards for ozone or carbon monoxide emissions can approve projects that help control or reduce these emissions.", "The population and geographic area covered by the MPOs also determine the breadth of their responsibilities and the support they have to meet their ISTEA planning requirements. Some MPOs, such as those in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, plan for urbanized populations of over 6 million. Typically, these MPOs are well financed and have a dedicated professional staff of 100 or more. At the other extreme, the MPOs that plan for urban areas with populations just over 50,000 may have no staff or a single county government employee working part time for the MPO.", "In addition, the MPOs\u2019 planning duties can be complicated by the boundaries of jurisdictions in metropolitan areas. As growth occurs, urbanized areas sometimes overrun the MPOs\u2019 boundaries or become so large that state and local officials establish more than one MPO to serve the area. Currently, 14 contiguous urbanized areas within a single state have two or more MPOs. In these locations, such as Florida\u2019s Tampa Bay area, cooperation and coordination among the MPOs are essential. Other urban areas cross state lines. For example, the Philadelphia MPO plans for the Pennsylvania and New Jersey portions of the Philadelphia urban area, and the St. Louis MPO plans for the Missouri and Illinois portions of the urban area. The task of these MPOs is complicated by their having to deal with two or more state governments and more than one Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISTEA Presented MPOs With New Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The ACIR report noted that ISTEA brought three new, far-reaching philosophies to the administration of the federal surface transportation programs: (1) the decentralization of decision-making to the state and local governments, and particularly to the MPOs in the larger metropolitan areas with populations of 200,000 or more; (2) stronger environmental connections, especially to the CAA; and (3) the elevation of nontraditional goals and stakeholders to new prominence in the planning and decision-making processes.", "ACIR noted that the decentralization of decisions gave many MPOs a larger area to plan for, more miles of road to make decisions about, more flexibility to consider alternatives to the automobile, a lead role in allocating certain federal transportation funds, a longer horizon to consider for the planning process, and a responsibility to consider many transportation-related public policies. In 129 urban areas with populations greater than 200,000,\u2014the TMAs\u2014ISTEA gives the MPOs the authority to select projects from the TIP, in consultation with the state. In other areas, the selection of projects is to be carried out by the state in cooperation with the MPO.", "Environmental considerations have become more of a driving force in the MPOs\u2019 work as well. The MPOs in nonattainment areas must develop transportation plans that ensure that the CAA\u2019s requirements are met. In constraining the transportation plans to meet the CAA\u2019s goals, the MPOs cannot, with limited exceptions, spend any federal funds on any highway projects that will exacerbate existing air quality problems or lead to new violations of federal air quality standards. The MPO-developed transportation plans must contribute to reducing motor vehicle emissions.", "The elevation of nontraditional goals and stakeholders in the MPO planning process is specified in the ISTEA section that requires the MPOs to consider 16 factors when developing their metropolitan plans. Some of the planning factors require planners to consider the effects of transportation policies on land-use development; the social, economic, energy, and environmental impacts of transportation decisions; provide for the efficient movement of freight; and ensure connections with international borders, ports, and airports and intermodal facilities. These planning factors address many of the ways that transportation relates to other values and the unintended impact of transportation and transportation facilities. ISTEA stated that these factors must be considered as part of the planning process. In addition, ISTEA and subsequent planning regulations emphasized an early and continuous effort to involve citizens that actively seeks input from direct stakeholders and other members of the public, including those traditionally underserved by the existing transportation systems. The public\u2019s involvement is to be sought at various points in the planning process, including the development of the plan, the TIP, and individual projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MPOs Must Produce Two Planning Documents", "paragraphs": ["Taking into consideration all of the relevant requirements of ISTEA and the CAA, the MPOs must develop two basic planning documents\u2014the transportation plan and the transportation improvement program. The first document\u2014the transportation plan\u2014is a long-term document that specifies a 20-year vision for a metropolitan area\u2019s transportation system. The plan is to include short- and long-range strategies leading to the development of an integrated and efficient intermodal transportation system. The plan is to be revised and updated at least every 3 years in those areas not meeting the federal air quality standards and at least once every 5 years in other areas. An acceptable plan must be a realistic, implementable document describing how the transportation system will serve metropolitan development objectives, address congestion and air quality concerns, and address other issues.", "The TIP is a much more detailed document that specifies a list of priority projects to be implemented in each year covered. It must include all transportation projects that will receive federal transportation funding and be clearly based on the objectives laid out in the plan. The TIP covers a period of at least 3 years and must be updated every 2 years. After approval by the governor, the metropolitan TIP must be included in the state TIP, which is then subject to review and approval by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).", "ISTEA specifies that the plans and TIPs include a financial component that demonstrates how the plans will be funded and implemented. The TIP must be financially constrained each year and must include only those projects for which funding has been identified using current or reasonably available revenue sources. The state and the transit operators must provide information early in the process of developing the TIP about the amount of federal, state, and other funds likely to be available. This financial constraint requirement was a major change in federal policy. Before ISTEA, long-range plans and TIPs were often lengthy \u201cwish lists\u201d of projects proposed by local governments, transit operators, and others. Because such plans and programs bore no relation to the available financial resources, many projects were never implemented. Hence, the real implementation decisions took place outside of the formal planning process. Thus, under ISTEA the financial constraint requirement ensures that the implementation decisions come directly from a systematic planning process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the abilities of the MPOs to meet the demands of ISTEA\u2019s planning requirements, the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and the Chairman of that Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure requested us to determine the challenges that the MPOs face in implementing ISTEA\u2019s metropolitan planning requirements. Specifically, this report (1) discusses the MPOs\u2019 experiences in implementing ISTEA\u2019s planning requirements and (2) examines the extent to which the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s certification review process ensures that the MPOs in larger urban areas comply with ISTEA\u2019s requirements.", "To assess the challenges that the MPOs faced in meeting ISTEA\u2019s metropolitan planning requirements, we reviewed numerous surveys, reports, conference summaries, and other literature on urban transportation planning that have been published since 1991. In addition, we spoke to representatives of FHWA, FTA, and other national experts. We also obtained and analyzed the results of a 1994 nationwide survey of all MPOs in the United States conducted by the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC). On the basis of these efforts, we determined that three of ISTEA\u2019s planning provisions\u2014(1) the requirements for involvement by citizens in developing plans and programs, (2) financially constraining the transportation improvement program, and (3) project identification\u2014were particularly challenging for the MPOs. To further explore these key issues, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with officials of 13 MPOs and 11 state transportation planning agencies. These organizations are listed in appendix II. The MPOs we selected included those that had great or little difficulty with planning requirements (on the basis of their responses to the NARC survey) and represented different regions in the United States. All but 1 of the 13 MPOs we interviewed represent urban areas with populations of 200,000 or greater\u2014the transportation management areas. With each MPO, we discussed why it did or did not have difficulty with selected planning requirements, the reasons for the difficulty or lack of it, the benefits and drawbacks of the planning requirement, and whether the Congress should reconsider these or any other of ISTEA\u2019s planning requirements.", "To determine whether DOT\u2019s certification review process was ensuring that MPOs comply with planning requirements, we obtained and reviewed DOT\u2019s guidance for field staff conducting the reviews and discussed with FHWA and FTA officials the rationale behind DOT\u2019s approach to the reviews. We also obtained copies of the 55 certification reports published through January 5, 1996, and reviewed and analyzed their contents. Finally, we spoke to selected MPOs and states about their views on the advantages and drawbacks of the certification process.", "We performed our work from August 1995 through July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. After providing a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment, we met with DOT officials, including the Chief, Metropolitan Planning Division, Federal Highway Administration, and the Chief, Statewide Planning Division, Federal Transit Administration.

Despite these challenges, the MPOs we interviewed believe that their efforts to meet these requirements have been beneficial. Furthermore, both the MPOs we interviewed and the national organization representing MPOs support continuing these three provisions. The state transportation planning officials we interviewed were less unanimously supportive of these provisions, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) advocates eliminating the requirement to financially constrain the long-term transportation plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Involve Citizens Improve the Acceptability of Plans and Programs", "paragraphs": ["ISTEA\u2019s requirements for extensive involvement by members of the general public in the transportation planning process required considerable changes at many of the nation\u2019s MPOs. The public participation requirement has challenged the MPOs to expand the resources devoted to involving citizens and apply more effective techniques for soliciting public input. Despite the initial challenges, all 13 MPOs we interviewed believed that ISTEA\u2019s requirements were desirable and beneficial to the planning process. According to the MPOs we spoke to, effective public outreach serves to inform the public of key regional transportation issues, helps ensure that programs contain projects truly needed by the public, and identifies \u201cproblem\u201d projects early in the planning process.

The efforts to involve citizens were to include an open exchange of information and ideas between transportation decision makers and the public, including all individuals and groups potentially affected by transportation decisions. Such efforts were to occur at various stages of the transportation planning process, including the development of the long-term plan, the TIP, and individual projects.", "At the outset of ISTEA, the MPOs\u2019 ability to meet the act\u2019s public involvement requirements was in doubt. A 1992 study commissioned by DOT noted that public participation in transportation planning had been relatively narrow and of low visibility, except for critical episodes when contentious issues arose. The urban areas that did have extensive public participation efforts before ISTEA were those that had active civic cultures. The 1995 ACIR report found that participation by the public is one of the areas emphasized by ISTEA in which the MPOs need the most assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Efforts to Involve Citizens Require Greater Resources, Enhanced Expertise, and a Balancing of Interests", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s regulations also note that an effective effort to involve citizens requires the MPOs to provide the public with timely and relevant information on transportation planning, full public access and input to key decisions, and opportunities for the public\u2019s early and continuing involvement. These requirements have been challenging to the MPOs for a number of reasons. Specifically, we found that ISTEA\u2019s requirement for involving the public challenges the MPOs to (1) significantly expand the resources devoted to that involvement, (2) develop new methods for soliciting public input, and (3) effectively use the results of their efforts to involve the public.", "First, the efforts to involve citizens required greater resources than the MPOs may have been devoting. A 1994 planners manual found that effective involvement by the public would require not only greater commitment from MPO managers and public officials, but also significant postage and publication budgets and more staff time than most MPOs would likely expect. Our interviews with the MPOs and the states clearly bore this out. Eleven of the 13 MPOs we interviewed told us they had expanded their efforts to involve citizens since ISTEA, and 7 of them said that the need for additional resources was a challenge. Typically, the MPOs told us that while they had made some limited efforts to involve the public before ISTEA, these were often cursory. For example, the St. Louis MPO\u2019s effort grew from a standing citizens committee into a multifaceted program to involve more people. This MPO\u2019s efforts to inform and educate the public now include transportation issue papers distributed to target audiences, public speaking engagements before community groups via a speakers bureau, press releases on topical transportation-related issues, and articles in MPO periodicals. The efforts to obtain input from the public include public meetings, smaller focus groups, surveys, and project solicitations. Similarly, an official of the Philadelphia MPO told us that the MPO has tripled its spending on involvement by the public\u2014from $90,000 to about $300,000 annually\u2014and now has two full-time staffers exclusively devoted to the effort.", "Second, the development and implementation of programs to involve the public may call for knowledge and skills that may not have been readily available to MPOs at the outset of ISTEA. The 1995 ACIR report also found that the MPOs needed research on the techniques that will encourage citizens\u2019 participation, especially those techniques that have been successful in highly populated areas, and the services of experts trained in such techniques. The report found that the MPOs needed to be more sophisticated in using the media to build support from the public. These issues also arose in our interviews with the MPOs and the states. In open-ended discussions, 4 of the 13 MPOs noted the difficulty presented by selecting and implementing the appropriate techniques for involving the public. For example, an official of the St. Louis MPO told us that identifying the best method is the biggest problem the MPO faces in its attempts to involve the public. The official added that the problem is an ongoing one, as the public response to individual techniques seems to diminish over time. The Springfield, Massachusetts, MPO noted that in developing transportation newsletters, simply translating the planners\u2019 technical jargon into readable language for the general public is a large task. The MPO has hired a specialist to assist with this effort. Such technical assistance may be key for many MPOs\u2014the Milwaukee MPO, which did not have much difficulty with ISTEA\u2019s requirements for involving citizens, credited technical assistance from the University of Wisconsin\u2019s extension service as a significant factor in the program\u2019s success.", "Finally, the MPOs must determine how input from the process of involving the public will influence plans and programs. Nearly all of the MPOs we interviewed found it difficult to get the general public interested and involved in transportation planning issues. These MPOs noted that, typically, \u201cJohn Q. Public\u201d will become interested in transportation planning only if a specific project will affect his well-being. He may get very involved, for example, if he believes that a road-widening project will increase the traffic near his home and hence harm the value of his property. As a result, the public\u2019s input generally may not reflect the views of a cross-section of the general public. Several MPOs said that getting input from lower-income and minority communities is particularly challenging. On the other hand, certain interest groups, often with a narrowly defined agenda, may be very active in commenting on the transportation planning process. As a result, the interest of activists with specific agendas may dominate the process of involving the public. One MPO official noted that citizens\u2019 involvement has given professional groups a vehicle for expressing their views and dominating the public discussion. In putting together plans and programs, the MPOs must balance the input of activists with the transportation needs of the broader public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MPOs We Interviewed Believe ISTEA\u2019s Provisions for Involving the Public Are Beneficial and Support Continuation", "paragraphs": ["Despite the difficulties and imperfections inherent in the efforts to involve the public, all of the MPOs we interviewed believe that effective involvement by the public is critical to good planning. All 13 MPOs noted that their efforts to meet ISTEA\u2019s requirements for involving the public have resulted in plans and programs that are more reflective of the public\u2019s transportation needs and hence enjoy broader and stronger public support. Also, citizens\u2019 latent opposition to projects is uncovered much earlier in the planning process. For example, the Durham, North Carolina, MPO told us of a project that would widen a four-lane road to eight lanes. All of the technical analyses supported the need for this project, but the MPO ran into significant public opposition as the construction phase neared. The project was delayed for over a year, which, according to the MPO official, might well have been avoided if the public\u2019s input had been sought earlier in the planning process.", "For the reasons outlined above, the 13 MPO officials we spoke to unanimously supported the continuation of the requirement for involving the public in transportation planning. However, MPO and state planning officials emphasized the importance of flexibility in selecting the appropriate techniques for inviting citizens\u2019 input and the concomitant importance of avoiding overly prescriptive federal regulations. For example, a Florida state department of transportation official stated that techniques that work well for communities in Florida\u2019s panhandle may be ineffective in the Hispanic and Caribbean communities of south Florida. An official at the St. Louis MPO stated that any one technique for involving the public has a relatively short shelf life, with diminishing returns over time. Hence, it is important to vary techniques\u2014such as surveys, public meeting, focus groups, and so on\u2014over time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Constraint Ensures Realistic Program of Projects", "paragraphs": ["Financially constraining TIPs\u2014the 3-year plan\u2014was a new requirement for many MPOs. A 1994 planner\u2019s guide noted that prior to ISTEA, many TIPs were laden with more projects than could be afforded and that bringing these TIPs into balance was politically painful. Also, successfully constraining a TIP requires reliable projections of revenue\u2014projections that were not always available. Despite these difficulties, all but two of the MPOs we spoke to had developed financially constrained TIPs, and all MPOs believed that the practice was critical to meaningful short-term planning. As the requirement has forced a realization of limited resources, it has encouraged planners to explore other options for local and regional financing.

For example, a TIP featuring $10 million in highway and transit improvements would have to show that these projects could be paid for with federal, state, local, or other funds that were demonstrably available. This requirement was a significant change to federal planning requirements. According to the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC), before ISTEA, there were pressures to include as many projects as possible in the TIP, regardless of the cost. Consequently, proposed transportation spending was sometimes more an outcome of political influence than of a rational planning process. NARC noted that by ensuring that planners develop and limit investment programs on the basis of realistic budgets, transportation spending would be a rational outcome of the planning process.", "The MPOs and states we interviewed stated that the requirement to financially constrain TIPs is one of the most challenging of ISTEA\u2019s planning requirements. Because many MPOs had not financially constrained TIPs before ISTEA, both their technical ability to develop financial plans and their institutional wherewithal to exclude projects not falling within the budget were in doubt at the outset of ISTEA. A nationwide survey of MPOs conducted by the National Association of Regional Councils found that financially constraining the TIP was the most difficult of eight selected ISTEA planning requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Constraint Requires Developing Regional Consensus and Effective Working Relationship With the State", "paragraphs": ["Our interviews with the MPOs and the states, as well as other studies of MPOs under ISTEA, reveal that the financial constraint requirement presented the MPOs with two main challenges. First, the MPOs had to develop a regional consensus as to which programs would be on the TIP. Second, the MPOs had to obtain reliable estimates of the funds available from the state departments of transportation.", "Because a financially constrained TIP is a defined and realistic program of transportation spending, it must be based on a regional consensus about which projects are best suited to meet a region\u2019s transportation needs. Highways, mass transit, and other projects can be proposed by many entities, including the state, cities, counties, transit agencies, and community groups. The financial constraint requirement forces policy-makers to consider trade-offs and make choices among these alternative transportation investments. In open-ended discussions, 6 of the 13 MPOs that we interviewed noted the difficulties involved in reaching such a consensus. For example, the Atlanta MPO noted that its 1992 TIP contained about four times as many projects as could be paid for with reasonably available resources. To bring the TIP into balance, it had deleted about $400 million worth of planned projects by 1993. This action did not please the sponsors of deleted projects, although many projects had scant chance of implementation. Similarly, the MPO for Dallas/Ft. Worth noted that the MPO and the state department of transportation had a significant dispute because a freeway improvement advocated by the state was not included in the financially constrained TIP.", "A reliable estimate of available revenues is indispensable in financially constraining the TIP. Because much of the funding for urban transportation\u2014both state and federal\u2014comes from the state departments of transportation, the MPOs depend on their states to provide guidance on the financial resources that can reasonably be expected to be available during the TIP period. Most MPOs either did not raise this issue or told us that the state departments of transportation have been cooperative and have provided financial estimates with reasonable timeliness. However 3 of the 13 said that the states\u2019 lack of willingness to provide reliable estimates of the available revenues has been a hurdle in developing financially constrained TIPs. At two MPOs, the inability to obtain reliable financial information was the center of disputes between the MPO and the state department of transportation about the ability of the MPO to select projects. For example, officials of one MPO told us that the state department of transportation did not provide estimates of the available funds, except in the form of draft state TIPs. In essence, the MPO said that the state had refused to provide any estimates of the future revenues that the MPO could use to develop a local TIP.", "Another MPO told us that it had submitted a TIP that was financially constrained on the basis of the revenue estimates provided by the state.", "The TIP was included in the state\u2019s transportation improvement program, which was subsequently rejected by FHWA/FTA because the state\u2019s revenue assumptions included a drawdown of its unobligated balances, which is not possible without congressional action. As a result, the MPO had to develop a revised TIP with about one-third the resources of the original TIP. The state\u2019s action and the subsequent rejection of the TIP created considerable resentment among the local officials and project sponsors in the region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MPOs We Interviewed Support Continuing the Financial Constraint Requirement Because It Has Produced Better Investment Programs", "paragraphs": ["Twelve of the 13 MPOs we interviewed told us they had developed financially constrained TIPs under ISTEA. Furthermore, all of the MPOs we spoke to unanimously supported the continuation of the requirement to financially constrain the TIP, as did 7 of the 11 state transportation offices we interviewed. All of the MPOs we spoke to noted that the financial constraint requirement forces the development of TIPs that include the projects that will be implemented. Officials of the New Orleans MPO, for example, told us that before ISTEA, the system of selecting and implementing transportation projects had broken down. There was little sense of real priority in the TIP. Because the TIP is now financially constrained, its credibility and \u201cimplementability\u201d are significantly enhanced, and the priorities spelled out in the TIP now drive investments. Similarly, an Atlanta MPO official told us that the commitment to the projects on the TIP is much greater because the TIP is now a firm program of transportation investment priorities.", "In addition to establishing a meaningful program of projects, the financial constraint requirement has led to tangential benefits. Many MPOs said that the financial constraint requirement has forced regional elected officials to realize the gap between transportation needs and reasonably available revenues. As a result, regional policy-makers are examining other revenue- raising measures, including innovative financing mechanisms. For example, the staff of the Pensacola, Florida, MPO told us that the regional policy-makers were considering establishing a toll authority for that fast-growing region.

According to the 1995 NARC study, ISTEA stressed that the MPOs be transformed from weak advisory bodies into strong decision-making partners working more closely and on an equal footing with the state transportation agencies and other key stakeholders. The MPOs were to play a pivotal role in planning as leaders, managers, and builders of consensus among other agencies that may have different perspectives and priorities.

The MPOs were not traditionally strong decision-making bodies, and federal policy had de-emphasized urban transportation planning during the 1980s. As a result, the planning capacity of many MPOs deteriorated during this time. As the Institute of Public Administration noted in 1992, the MPOs\u2019 budgets, functions, staffs, and technical capacities dwindled during the 1980s. Perhaps as a result, DOT analysts conducting comprehensive planning reviews between 1991 and 1993 found that important metropolitan planning and programming decisions were determined primarily by the states or by transit operators.

One MPO said that the state\u2019s TIP process did not allow the MPO to participate fully in the process of selecting projects. For example, the state had limited certain federal funds for pedestrian projects in a manner that the MPO believed was inconsistent with ISTEA. An official of the state department of transportation told us that it gets extensive input and advice from the MPO and other regional interests in determining the projects to be included in the state\u2019s plans.

For example, ISTEA states that projects in urban areas with populations of 200,000 or greater shall be selected by the MPO in consultation with the state, except projects under the National Highway System and the Bridge and Interstate Maintenance programs. The MPOs typically stated that this provision had some impact but was mainly symbolic.

It also noted that the detailed requirements in federal regulations and guidance can lead to substantial delays on projects and to court challenges.

AASHTO\u2019s states that in financially constraining TIPs, MPOs should have the flexibility to program at a level that enables them to deal with the uncertainty of project schedules and with fluctuating levels of federal funding. State officials expressed similar concerns. Four of the 11 state planning officials we contacted opposed the retention of this requirement. While they support the principle of financially constraining the TIP, they believe that the regulatory interpretation is too strict. Three of the four stated that the planning regulations should allow some over-programming. As one MPO explained, delays are inevitable on some projects because of environmental permitting or other reasons. Because the process of amending a TIP\u2014for example, adding a new project\u2014is very time consuming and administratively difficult, this delay can be substantial. Several states we interviewed noted that a modest over-programming of the TIP\u2014for example, by 10 percent\u2014would circumvent this problem by including a short list of \u201cready to go\u201d projects that could be funded in the event that other, higher-priority TIP projects were delayed.", "AMPO supported the financial constraint requirement for the long-term (20-year) plan.

AASHTO noted that the requirement was unrealistic and could prevent MPOs from taking advantage of fiscal partnering arrangements. As a result, AASHTO calls for eliminating the ISTEA requirement to financially constrain long-term plans. In addition, 5 of the 11 states we interviewed opposed the continuation of this requirement.

Potentially, this action would increase from 129 to 339 the number of MPOs with the authority to select projects. AASHTO\u2019s proposal to raise the threshold for the transportation management area to 1 million people would take the authority to select projects away from about 94 MPOs that currently have it.
