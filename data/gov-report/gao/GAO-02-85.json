Although older workers are less likely than younger workers to lose a job, when they do lose a job, they are less likely than younger workers to find other employment. To retain older workers and extend their careers, some public and a few private employers are providing options, including flexible hours and financial benefits, reduced workloads through the use of part-time or part-year schedules, and job-sharing. Most employers are not yet facing labor shortages or other economic pressures that would require them to consider flexible employment arrangements because the retirement of the baby boom generation will occur gradually during the next several decades."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Much public attention has been paid to the impending retirement of the unusually large \u201cbaby boom\u201d generation, comprised of those individuals born between 1946 and 1964. According to Census Bureau estimates, in 2019, when the last of the baby boomers have reached age 55, nearly 29 percent of the total U.S. population will be age 55 and older, compared with 21 percent today. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that total labor force growth will slow from an average annual rate of 1.1 percent between 1990 and 2000 to an annual rate of 0.7 percent between 2000 and 2025.", "These developments pose potential problems for employers and the economy generally, as the possible loss of many key experienced workers could create shortages in skilled worker and managerial occupations, with adverse effects on productivity and economic growth. To the extent that older workers (employees age 55 and older) decide to work longer, this can mitigate the slowing growth of the labor force and its attendant fiscal and economic problems.", "In light of the economic and human capital challenges posed by the retirement of baby boomers, you asked us to (1) provide a current and projected economic profile of older workers, (2) discuss the experience of older workers who lose their jobs and seek reemployment, and (3) describe the options that employers are providing to older workers who want flexible employment arrangements and the financial incentives to keep older workers from retiring.", "To provide this information, we analyzed data from multiple years of the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Displaced Workers Supplement to the CPS (DWS), and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We also developed a projection method, based on BLS methodology, for estimating the age and occupational structure of the labor force and the relative wage structure in 2008. In addition, we interviewed human capital representatives of both private and public sector employers, union officials, and pension and human capital experts from consulting firms and various advocacy groups. We consulted economists and other academics on these issues as well. Through these interviews and from a survey of the literature on phased retirement programs, we identified and interviewed 13 private employers and 10 public employers to discuss the formal or informal job arrangements they made with older workers to keep them on the job. Our work was conducted between November 2000 and September 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The maturation of the baby boom generation (persons born between 1946 and 1964) has progressed to the point where boomers will soon begin moving from the traditional working ages to the ages when many people start to retire. The first wave of the baby boom generation will start to turn age 65 in 2011 and the last of the boomers will be 65 in 2029. This development will lead to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population (defined as age 20 to 64) to the population age 65 or older. This ratio, called the \u201caged dependency ratio\u201d because it provides an estimate of how many workers will be available to support each retiree, was 21 percent in 2000, or 5 working-age individuals for every person over age 65. As the baby boom generation ages, the aged dependency ratio will rise. By 2030, it will reach 35 percent, meaning that there will be fewer than three persons of traditional working age for every person age 65 or over.", "The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons. It is also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade, a trend that is expected to continue. From 1950 to 1990, the labor force under 55 grew at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent. From 1990 to 2000, the average annual growth rate for this group was 1.0 percent, and BLS projects that from 2000 to 2025 labor force growth will slow to an annual rate of 0.3 percent.", "Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50 percent) for nearly 57 percent of the population age 65 and older. In April 2000, the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age (currently 65 years and 4 months) was eliminated, at least in part to remove the disincentive to work. Also, the delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is steadily being increased until it reaches 8 percent per year in 2008. Prior to these increases, those who chose to work beyond normal retirement age might receive less Social Security over their lifetime because the start of their benefit receipt was delayed. Some members of Congress have also put forward proposals that would raise normal retirement age for benefits beyond the current schedule of increases, as well as proposals that increase the early retirement age of 62.", "Other federal laws also attempt to make work and the workplace more hospitable for older individuals. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) promotes the employment of older persons based upon their ability rather than age and prohibits age discrimination in employment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces ADEA as well other federal statutes prohibiting employment discrimination. ADEA applies only to firms with 20 or more employees, thus excluding a not insignificant segment of the labor force. While some states have their own laws protecting older workers in small businesses, these laws still may exclude some small businesses.", "As pension benefits are a key source of retirement income for many workers, they can also influence the work decisions of older individuals. To encourage employers to establish and maintain pension plans for their employees, the federal government provides preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for plans that meet certain requirements. In exchange for preferential tax treatment, an employer is required to design the pension plan within legal limits that are intended to improve the equitable distribution and security of pension benefits. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers policies on pension distributions that are set by the Congress in the IRC to ensure that the benefits of all tax-qualified plans are apportioned in a nondiscriminatory manner.", "Many pension plans have features that encourage employees to retire at or before age 65.  Pension laws relating to defined benefit plans allow benefits earned after the normal retirement age (generally, age 65) to accrue at a lower rate.  Furthermore, many defined benefit plans subsidize early retirement benefits which tends to discourage employment after becoming eligible for these benefits.", "ERISA establishes certain minimum standards for private employee pension plans. This law also created the ERISA Advisory Council to advise the Secretary of Labor with respect to carrying out responsibilities under ERISA. The Advisory Council has made recommendations to the Secretary of Labor to consult and work with appropriate government agencies on pension and welfare plan reforms that could help employers establish phased retirement programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Growing Number of Older Workers Are in the Labor Force", "paragraphs": ["The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades and they will become an increasingly significant proportion of all workers.

Currently, 30 percent of all persons 55 and older participate in the labor force, a number that is expected to grow to 37 percent by 2015, according to projections by BLS.", "This increase in labor force participation among older workers is primarily driven by the growth in the number of older women and their labor force participation rates. Labor force participation rates of women between the ages of 55 and 64 have been steadily increasing from 42 percent in the mid- 1980s to 52 percent in 2000. A further increase in the participation rate to 61 percent is expected to occur by 2015, according to BLS. The labor force participation rate of women age 65 and older is currently 9 percent. This is up from the low point of slightly more than 7 percent in the mid-1980s but is lower than the 10 percent levels of the 1950s. BLS projects the growth in the participation rate in this age group to grow to 10 percent by 2015.", "The labor force participation rates of males over age 55 have been stable for several years and are projected to increase in the future. Older male labor force participation hit a low point in the mid-1990s that was part of a downward trend that had been occurring for several decades. Since then, the labor force participation rates of males between the ages of 55 and 64 have held steady at approximately 67 percent; BLS projects an increase to 69 percent in 2015. Labor force participation rates of males 65 and older also held steady at about 17 percent during the 1990s and are projected to rise to nearly 20 percent by 2015.", "As the number of older workers grows, older workers will also become a larger percentage of all workers. In 1950 and 1960, older workers comprised 17 percent and 18 percent of the labor force, respectively. (See Fig. 1.) As the relatively large baby boom generation entered the workforce between 1960 and 1990, the proportion of older workers fell to 12 percent of the total as the number of workers under age 55 swelled.

The slight difference in the employment distribution among these age groups is found in blue-collar and service occupations. Nearly 15 percent of workers age 65 to 74 are employed in service occupations compared with 11 percent of workers age 40 to 54. Blue-collar work accounts for 26 percent of employment among workers age 40 to 54 and 23 percent for workers age 65 to 74. The general shift in the economy away from physically demanding jobs is present among workers of all ages, but is far more pronounced among older workers as they age.", "Workers age 55 to 64 constitute a significant proportion of many occupations as they are nearly 13.9 million members (11 percent) of the total workforce.

(See Figs. 4 and 5.) The largest change should occur in white- collar occupations. Among executives/managers, the percentage of workers in this occupation who are over 55 is projected to grow from 15 percent to 23 percent. The percentage of the workforce that is over age 55 in professional occupations should also grow substantially from 14 percent to 19 percent. The smallest change should occur in employment in service occupations as the percentage of the workforce older than age 55 employed in the service sector grows from 13 percent to 14 percent. In line with these major occupational changes, certain specific occupations will increasingly rely on older workers. For example, from 2000 to 2008, the percent of teachers older than age 55 will increase from 13 percent to 19 percent, and the percent of nurses and related occupations older than age 55 will increase from 12 percent to 18 percent.

Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of workers age 55 to 74 in managerial/administrative and professional/technical occupations will increase by 2.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, while the proportion in blue collar and service occupations will decrease.

In 2000, both groups I and II had fewer individuals in the more physically demanding occupations of production, craft and repair, machine operation, and assembly; they also had a greater number of older workers in the white-collar and service occupations in 2000. Part of this shift likely occurred because as workers age they can experience health problems that make their jobs more difficult to perform and, therefore, they choose to move into less physically demanding jobs. Also, the composition of the labor force changes because of differential retirement rates and those who continue to work to older ages are more likely to be white-collar workers.", "The shift toward white-collar occupations is also partially explained by differences in educational attainment among the baby boom generation and the cohort proceeding them. (See Fig. 6.) Fifty-seven percent of persons who are age 40 to 54 have at least some college education (29 percent have a college degree) compared with 42 percent of individuals age 55 to 74 (21 percent have a college degree). Moreover, only 11 percent of individuals age 40 to 54 lack a high school diploma compared with 22 percent of persons age 55 to 74. The greater level of educational attainment among the baby boomers may lead to more employment opportunities as they age.

These earnings increases were primarily driven by a greater number of older workers working full-time instead of part-time (57 percent in 1989 versus 63 percent in 1999) and a movement in the occupational composition toward higher paying white-collar jobs (See tables 3 and app. I). Improvements in the economy during the last 15 years likely offered older workers the opportunity to move into full-time employment as labor shortages increased the demand for their services.

According to a study by Watson Wyatt, a large human capital consulting services firm, 16 percent of employers participating in their survey offer some type of flexible employment arrangement. However, they defined such an arrangement as any type of accommodation that was being made to an older worker either on a programmatic or individual basis.

Neither of these studies is nationally representative.", "While acknowledging the importance of the issue, unions we spoke with have not yet addressed flexible employment programs broadly in collective bargaining agreements due to a lack of interest on the part of employers generally and difficulties in establishing flexible schedules in many manufacturing settings. We spoke with officials from unions representing workers in the telecommunications industry and manufacturing industries like automobiles and aerospace, who said that flexible employment programs for older workers are not yet a major issue for many unions. A union official in the manufacturing industry said flexible employment programs may be difficult to establish because for many production processes, the work environment tends to require team production from employees on full-time schedules. A union official in the telecommunications industry said that unions have proposed some flexible employment arrangements in bargaining, but they say employers have not shown an interest because they do not yet see worker retention as an important issue.", "Evidence suggests that at least some middle- and large-sized employers currently do not see a need for flexible employment programs, although this could change in the future. According to the Watson Wyatt survey, 70 percent of companies do not offer phased retirement programs to older workers because they simply have not considered it. Other reasons given for not offering programs were the programs\u2019 incompatibility with corporate culture (16 percent), restrictions on in-service distributions (14 percent), employment costs (13 percent), and productivity concerns (9 percent).

A reduction in work hours seems to be a fairly common desire: 71 percent of retirees who have returned to work said the reason they initially retired was due to a lack of a more flexible work schedule.

Driven in large part by teacher shortages in many public school districts, state and local government employers have implemented programs that provide incentives for older employees to remain on the job. In many instances, these incentives were created by redesigning their state-defined benefit pension plans to include Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) features that allow a pension participant at an eligible retirement age to have pension benefits start even though he or she continues to work.These programs also include other pension plan revisions as well. At the state level, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, and Ohio have all adopted incentives for older teachers to stay on the job rather than retire.", "A growing number of state and local public employers have implemented, or are considering implementing, DROP pension features as incentives to encourage older employees to remain on the job. Although employers have used these for other public employees like firefighters or law enforcement personnel, many have focused on the retention of elementary and secondary public school teachers. For example, Arkansas has a DROP program in which all teachers who meet length-of-service requirements can have 70 percent of their monthly pension payments deposited into an account that is payable as a lump sum along with other options for payment. Teachers can stay in the DROP program for up to 10 years. The state also allows teachers who are eligible for retirement to draw their full pension and a full salary if they work in one of four subject areas deemed to have a critical shortage of teachers (math, science, foreign language, and special education) and if they separate from employment for 30 days.", "Louisiana has a variety of programs to encourage older teachers to stay on the job, and 4,300 teachers participated in them last year. The DROP program has been popular among the teachers because they can earn a lump sum in the range of $70,000 to $80,000 in 3 years. Two-thirds of eligible teachers participate in the DROP program and may participate for up to 3 years, after which they can continue working and will resume earning pension credits in their defined benefit system.

For example, facing a projected shortfall of 300,000 teachers over the next decade, the California legislature enacted several measures modifying the state teacher pension plan to encourage older teachers to continue to work. Starting in 2001, teachers who retire and then separate from employment for 1 year can return to teaching and earn a full salary while continuing to receive full pension payments. In addition, pension benefits have been enhanced in 3 ways: a longevity bonus of up to $400 per month has been added for 30 to 32 years of service; a 0.2 percent addition to the pension benefit has been granted for each year beyond 30 years of service; and 2 percent of salary is paid into a supplemental retirement account which is then payable as a lump sum.", "Nearly 10 percent (17,000 teachers) of Ohio\u2019s teaching workforce consists of rehired retirees.

In 2000, the ERISA Advisory Council identified current ERISA and IRC regulations that could constrain private employers in implementing flexible employment arrangements, including regulations prohibiting in-service distributions of defined benefit pension benefits and rules governing nondiscrimination.", "Pension regulations prohibiting in-service pension benefit distributions can discourage the employer\u2019s formation of DROP programs. Defined benefit pension plans sponsored by private employers are not allowed to pay pension benefits to older workers who become eligible for retirement income before the plan\u2019s normal retirement age. Therefore, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a private sector employer to provide a defined benefit DROP plan to workers who are younger than the pension plan\u2019s normal retirement age. To address this issue, the Council recommended relaxing the IRS rules on in-service distributions to facilitate the formation of phased retirement plans, although concern was expressed by some witnesses that workers might outlive their retirement savings by beginning benefits at an earlier but lower rate.", "The ERISA Advisory Council also found that federal regulations governing nondiscrimination in pension benefits or contributions can restrict employers from offering phased retirement programs. For example, some employers reported to the Council that they did not establish flexible employment programs because of concerns with violating federal pension regulations governing nondiscrimination in benefits or contributions. The concerns are based on the likelihood that a higher percentage of highly compensated employees would be participating in the programs because their skills are more desirable. To the extent that older workers are more likely to be owners or highly compensated employees than younger workers, a DROP plan could disproportionately include the employer\u2019s highest paid employees. In such a case, the employer\u2019s pension plan could be deemed as discriminatory and potentially lose its tax-qualified status. To alleviate these concerns, the Council recommended that the IRS relax its rules on nondiscrimination if the intent of the plan amendment was clearly not to be discriminatory. Recognizing the complexity of this issue, the ERISA Advisory Council also suggested that the Secretary of Labor organize a task force to focus on the obstacles within ERISA and other relevant federal laws that inhibit private employers from instituting DROPs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Other Factors Inhibit the Employment of Older Workers", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors contribute to discouraging the continued labor force participation of workers after a certain age. These factors include the following:   Some employers may have negative perceptions of older workers and discriminate. Past surveys have found that some managers possess negative perceptions about the productivity of older workers. For example, managers have expressed a perception that age reduces workers\u2019 physical stamina and ability to learn new skills. Under the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in employment on the basis of age, but evidence suggests that such discrimination does still occur. In 2000, the EEOC received 16,000 complaints of age discrimination, with nearly 3,000 merit resolutions and cumulative monetary damages of $45 million. Because some employers might seek to avoid hiring older workers because of potential litigation, the ERISA Advisory Council proposed that an interagency task force be convened to determine if any of the laws dealing with older workers\u2019 pension benefits, including the ADEA, the IRC, and ERISA, need to be amended in order to encourage the continued development of flexible retirement alternatives for older workers.", "Employers perceive higher costs associated with hiring older workers. Employers may feel that it is more difficult to recoup the costs of hiring and training older workers. The shorter potential length of time an older worker may remain with an employer, compared with a younger worker, implies that these up-front fixed costs are greater for older workers because of the shorter time period for employers to recoup their investment. Moreover, all other things being equal, older workers can raise an employer\u2019s cost of providing health coverage. To address these issues, the ERISA Advisory Council recommended that legislation be developed that would extend Medicare to workers between the ages of 55 and 64.", "Older workers have more health problems that inhibit work.

By 2008, 1 out of every 6 workers in the American labor force will be over age 55, and this ratio is estimated to reach over 1 out of 5 by 2025. Older workers will comprise a progressively larger number of our nation\u2019s managers, supervisors, and executives. Employers will have to rely more heavily on this segment of the labor force, as their experience and \u201cinstitutional knowledge\u201d become an increasingly valuable resource. Thus, older workers will become a critical labor force component in maintaining future productivity and economic growth, particularly if, as projected, labor force growth continues to slow.", "Yet, employers have taken little action so far to prepare for this demographic transition. We identified few employers with well established, formalized programs to encourage older employees to work longer. Some private employers have indicated an awareness of the need to retain older workers and are experimenting with different options to extend the work lives of their older employees. However, these programs remain small and are often administered on an ad hoc basis. Flexible employment programs also remain to be addressed by employers and workers in the collective bargaining context. Public employer efforts to retain or rehire older workers have been broader and somewhat more common, largely in response to localized labor shortages in skilled occupations like teaching.", "Part of this inaction may be because these demographic changes, while inevitable, remain largely on the horizon. Most employers are not yet facing labor shortages or other economic pressures requiring them to consider phased retirement or related programs. For this reason, time is available to develop sound policies, programs, and practices to respond to this demographic challenge. Some public discussion on this matter is already taking place. For example, Labor\u2019s ERISA Advisory Council has received testimony from employers and other interested parties as to how federal policy and laws should be changed to address phased retirement, and the older worker issue generally. From this testimony, the Advisory Council has made recommendations to the Secretary of Labor, particularly with regard to current pension law and policy.", "The ERISA Advisory Council has already urged that the Secretary of Labor convene a task force that would focus on issues concerning the extension of DROP plans to private employers. However, many of the recommendations suggested by the Advisory Council are beyond the purview of the Labor Department and would require action by other agencies or the Congress for implementation, as well as raising cost implications.  Additional expert assessment and input from those agencies charged with administering the affected laws and regulations would help ensure that these recommendations are both carefully crafted and represent sound policy, particularly those calling for far reaching legislative changes. Expertise and input from outside agencies could also help to identify any unintended consequences of the actions that could be taken. For example, amending the ADEA to facilitate the expansion of phased retirement programs might result in some older workers losing legal protection against age discrimination in ways not previously recognized or understood. It also raises the risk that workers might outlive their retirement savings by beginning benefits too early.", "Finally, greater input from other agencies could help to identify other aspects of the issues already explored and additional recommendations not addressed by the Advisory Council. This is particularly important given that the diversity among firms and industries suggests a need for a range of solutions. For example, what may work for public employers\u2014creating incentives to extend employment through alterations in the design of their defined benefit pension plans\u2014may not be helpful for private employers who do not have such plans or could not afford such redesign.", "The challenge of how to extend the work lives of older employees in a manner that balances the competitive imperative of business with the life realities of older workers presents many opportunities.

Specifically, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor convene an interagency task force to develop legislative and regulatory proposals addressing the issues raised by the aging of the labor force. This task force would include representatives from Labor, and other agencies that have either regulatory jurisdiction or a clear policy interest, bringing together the expertise necessary to consider fully the implications of each proposal.
