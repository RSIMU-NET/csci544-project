Concerned by reports of significant vulnerabilities in federal computer systems, Congress passed the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), which permanently authorized and strengthened the information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements for federal agencies. As required by FISMA to report periodically to Congress, in this report GAO discusses the adequacy and effectiveness of agencies' information security policies and practices and agencies' implementation of FISMA requirements. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed agency, inspectors general (IG), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), congressional, and GAO reports on information security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Significant weaknesses in information security policies and practices threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations, assets, and personnel of most federal agencies. Recently reported incidents at federal agencies have placed sensitive data at risk, including the theft, loss, or improper disclosure of personally identifiable information on millions of Americans, thereby exposing them to loss of privacy and identity theft. Almost all of the major federal agencies had weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls. Most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer resources. In addition, agencies did not always manage the configuration of network devices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity, such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely manner; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction; or maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information systems. An underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. As a result, agencies may not have assurance that controls are in place and operating as intended to protect their information resources, thereby leaving them vulnerable to attack or compromise. Nevertheless, federal agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements. For fiscal year 2006, agencies generally reported performing various control activities for an increasing percentage of their systems and personnel. However, IGs at several agencies disagreed with the information the agency reported and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these activities. Further, although OMB enhanced its reporting instructions to agencies for preparing fiscal year 2006 FISMA reports, the metrics specified in the instructions do not measure how effectively agencies are performing various activities, and there are no requirements to report on a key activity.

In their fiscal year  2006 financial statement audit reports, 21 of 24 major agencies indicated  that deficient information security controls were either a reportable   condition or a material weakness (see fig. 2). Our audits continue to  identify similar weaknesses in nonfinancial systems. Similarly, in their  annual reporting under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512 (commonly referred to as the  Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982), 17 of 24 agencies  reported shortcomings in information security, including 7 that considered  it a material weakness.

Most agencies continue to have  weaknesses in each of these categories, as shown in figure 3.", "In our prior reports, we have made hundreds of specific  recommendations to the agencies to mitigate the weaknesses identified.  Similarly, the IGs have issued specific recommendations as part of their  information security review work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access Controls Were Not Adequate", "paragraphs": ["A basic management control objective for any organization is to protect  data supporting its critical operations from unauthorized access, which  could lead to improper modification, disclosure, or deletion of the data.  Organizations accomplish this task by designing and implementing  controls that are intended to prevent, limit, and detect access to  computing resources (computers, networks, programs, and data), thereby  protecting these resources from unauthorized use, modification, loss, and  disclosure. Access controls can be both electronic and physical. Electronic  access controls include those related to user identification and  authentication, authorization, boundary protection, cryptography, and  audit and monitoring. Physical security controls are important for  protecting computer facilities and resources from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft. These controls involve restricting physical access to  computer resources, usually by limiting access to the buildings and rooms  in which they are housed and enforcing usage restrictions and  implementation guidance for portable and mobile devices.", "Twenty-two major agencies had access control weaknesses. Analysis of  our recent reports have identified that the majority of information security  control weaknesses pertained to access controls (see fig. 4). For example,  agencies did not consistently (1) identify and authenticate users to prevent  unauthorized access; (2) enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure  that authorized access was necessary and appropriate; (3) establish  sufficient boundary protection mechanisms; (4) apply encryption to  protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices; and (5) log, audit,  and monitor security-relevant events. Agencies also lacked effective  controls to restrict physical access to information assets.", "A computer system must be able to identify and authenticate different  users so that activities on the system can be linked to specific individuals.  When an organization assigns unique user accounts to specific users, the  system is able to distinguish one user from another\u2014a process called  identification. The system also must establish the validity of a user\u2019s  claimed identity by requesting some kind of information, such as a  password, that is known only by the user\u2014a process known as  authentication.", "Several agencies have not adequately controlled user accounts and  passwords to ensure that only authorized individuals are granted access to  its systems and data. For example, several agencies did not always  implement strong passwords\u2014using vendor-default or easy-to-guess  passwords, or having the minimum password length set to zero. One  agency\u2019s staff shared logon accounts and passwords when accessing a  database production server for the procurement system. By allowing users  to share accounts and passwords, individual accountability for authorized  system activity as well as unauthorized system activity could be lost.  Consequently, users could create short passwords, which tend to be easier  to guess or crack than longer passwords. Without appropriate controls  over identification and authentication, agencies are at increased risk of  unauthorized access.", "Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights and  permissions to a protected resource, such as a network, a system, an  application, a function, or a file. A key component of granting or denying  access rights is the concept of \u201cleast privilege.\u201d Least privilege is a basic  principle for securing computer resources and information. This principle  means that users are granted only those access rights and permissions that  they need to perform their official duties. To restrict legitimate users\u2019  access to only those programs and files that they need to do their work,  organizations establish access rights and permissions. \u201cUser rights\u201d are  allowable actions that can be assigned to users or to groups of users. File  and directory permissions are rules that regulate which users can access a  particular file or directory and the extent of that access. To avoid  unintentionally authorizing users access to sensitive files and directories,  an organization must give careful consideration to its assignment of rights  and permissions.", "Several agencies continued to imprudently grant rights and permissions  that allowed more access than users needed to perform their jobs. For  example, one agency had granted users of a database system the access  rights to create or change sensitive system files\u2014even though they did not  have a legitimate business need for this access. Further, the permissions  for sensitive system files also inappropriately allowed all users to read,  update, or execute them. These types of excessive privileges provide  opportunities for individuals to circumvent security controls. In another  instance, each user on one organization\u2019s network was permitted to have  access to sensitive Privacy Act-protected information including names,  addresses, and Social Security numbers of individuals. Once a Social  Security number is obtained fraudulently, it can then be used to create a  false identity for financial misuse, assume another individual\u2019s identity, or  to fraudulently obtain credit. As a result, there is increased risk that  sensitive data and personally identifiable information may be  compromised.", "Boundary protection pertains to the protection of a logical or physical  boundary around a set of information resources and implementing  measures to prevent unauthorized information exchange across the  boundary in either direction. Organizations physically allocate publicly  accessible information system components to separate subnetworks with  separate physical network interfaces, and they prevent public access into  their internal networks. Unnecessary connectivity to an organization\u2019s  network increases not only the number of access paths that must be  managed and the complexity of the task, but the risk of unauthorized  access in a shared environment.", "Several agencies continue to demonstrate vulnerabilities in establishing  required boundary protection mechanisms. For example, one agency did  not configure a remote access application properly, which permitted  simultaneous access to the Internet and the internal network. This could  allow an attacker who compromised a remote user\u2019s computer to remotely  control the user\u2019s secure session from the Internet. Another agency failed  to ensure that its contractor adequately implemented controls used to  protect its external and key internal boundaries. Specifically, certain  network devices did not adequately restrict external communication  traffic. As a result, an unauthorized individual could exploit these  vulnerabilities to launch attacks against other sensitive network devices.", "Cryptography underlies many of the mechanisms used to enforce the  confidentiality and integrity of critical and sensitive information. A basic  element of cryptography is encryption. Encryption can be used to provide  basic data confidentiality and integrity, by transforming plain text into  cipher text using a special value known as a key and a mathematical  process known as an algorithm. The National Security Agency also  recommends disabling protocols that do not encrypt information  transmitted across the network, such as user identification and password  combinations.", "Many agencies did not encrypt certain information traversing its networks,  but instead used clear text protocols that make network traffic susceptible  to eavesdropping. For example, at one agency\u2019s field site, all information,  including user identification and password information, was being sent  across the network in clear text. At another agency, the contractor did not  consistently apply encryption to protect network configuration data stored  on network devices. These weaknesses could allow an attacker, or  malicious user, to view information and use that knowledge to obtain  sensitive financial and system data being transmitted over the network.", "To establish individual accountability, monitor compliance with security  policies, and investigate security violations, it is crucial to determine what,  when, and by whom specific actions have been taken on a system.  Organizations accomplish this by implementing system or security  software that provides an audit trail, or logs of system activity, that they  can use to determine the source of a transaction or attempted transaction  and to monitor users\u2019 activities. The way in which organizations configure  system or security software determines the nature and extent of  information that can be provided by the audit trail. To be effective,  organizations should configure their software to collect and maintain audit  trails that are sufficient to track security-relevant events.", "Agencies did not sufficiently log and monitor key security- and audit- related events. For instance, agencies did not prepare key security reports  such as failed login attempt reports. In other cases, logging either was  disabled or configured to overwrite, or procedures for classifying and  investigating security\u2013related events had not been documented. As a  result, unauthorized access could go undetected, and the ability to trace or  recreate events in the event of a system modification or disruption could  be diminished.", "Physical security controls are important for protecting computer facilities  and resources from espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. These  controls restrict physical access to computer resources, usually by limiting  access to the buildings and rooms in which the resources are housed and  by periodically reviewing the access granted, in order to ensure that  access continues to be appropriate. Examples of physical security controls  include perimeter fencing, surveillance cameras, security guards, and  locks.", "Several agencies also lacked effective physical security controls.  Consequently, critical information held by the federal government, such as  Social Security numbers or other personal data, can be at acute risk of  unnecessary or unauthorized access by individuals intent on perpetrating  identity theft and committing financial crimes. For example, one agency  granted over 400 individuals unrestricted access to an entire data center\u2014 including a sensitive area within the data center\u2014although their job  functions did not require them to have such access. In another case, one  agency did not adequately protect the entrances to its facilities, as visitor  screening procedures were inconsistently implemented and available tools  were not being used properly or to their fullest capability.
