Such entities may include universities licensing patents developed by university research, companies focused on licensing patents they developed, or companies that buy patents from others for the purposes of asserting the patents for profit.", "Section 34 of AIA mandated that GAO conduct a study on the consequences of patent litigation by NPEs. This report examines (1) the volume and characteristics of recent patent litigation activity; (2) views of stakeholders knowledgeable in patent litigation on key factors that have contributed to recent patent litigation; (3) what developments in the judicial system may affect patent litigation; and (4) what actions, if any, PTO has recently taken that may affect patent litigation in the future.

Some stakeholders GAO interviewed said that the increase in 2011 was most likely influenced by the anticipation of changes in the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which made several significant changes to the U.S. patent system, including limiting the number of defendants in a lawsuit, causing some plaintiffs that would have previously filed a single lawsuit with multiple defendants to break the lawsuit into multiple lawsuits. In addition, GAO's detailed analysis of a representative sample of 500 lawsuits from 2007 to 2011 shows that the number of overall defendants in patent infringement lawsuits increased by about 129 percent over this period. These data also show that companies that make products brought most of the lawsuits and that nonpracticing entities (NPE) brought about a fifth of all lawsuits. GAO's analysis of these data also found that lawsuits involving software-related patents accounted for about 89 percent of the increase in defendants over this period.", "Stakeholders knowledgeable in patent litigation identified three key factors that likely contributed to many recent patent infringement lawsuits. First, several stakeholders GAO interviewed said that many such lawsuits are related to the prevalence of patents with unclear property rights; for example, several of these stakeholders noted that software-related patents often had overly broad or unclear claims or both. Second, some stakeholders said that the potential for large monetary awards from the courts, even for ideas that make only small contributions to a product, can be an incentive for patent owners to file infringement lawsuits. Third, several stakeholders said that the recognition by companies that patents are a more valuable asset than once assumed may have contributed to recent patent infringement lawsuits.", "The judicial system is implementing new initiatives to improve the handling of patent cases in the federal courts, including (1) a patent pilot program, to encourage the enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district court judges, and (2) new rules in some federal court districts that are designed to reduce the time and expense of patent infringement litigation. Recent court decisions may also affect how monetary awards are calculated, among other things. Several stakeholders said that it is too early to tell what effect these initiatives will have on patent litigation.", "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has taken several recent actions that are likely to affect patent quality and litigation in the future, including agency initiatives and changes required by AIA. For example, in November 2011, PTO began working with the software industry to develop more uniform terminology for software-related patents. PTO officials said that they generally try to adapt to developments in patent law and industry to improve patent quality. However, the agency does not currently use information on patent litigation in initiating such actions; some PTO staff said that the types of patents involved in infringement litigation could be linked to PTO's internal data on the patent examination process, and a 2003 National Academies study showed that such analysis could be used to improve patent quality and examination by exposing patterns in the examination of patents that end up in court."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that PTO consider examining trends in patent infringement litigation and consider linking this information to internal patent examination data to improve patent quality and examination. PTO commented on a draft of this report and agreed with key findings and this recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["History is filled with examples of successful inventors who did not develop  products based on the technologies they patented. For example, Elias  Howe patented a key component of the sewing machine\u2013\u2013a mechanism  for making a lockstitch\u2013\u2013but it was Isaac Singer who most successfully  brought these machines into the homes of thousands of Americans by  obtaining crucial patents of his own and paying Howe and other inventors  to license the technology described in their patents. In the United States,  the party that owns a patent\u2013\u2013the patent owner\u2013\u2013is not required to put  the patent to use in order to profit from it; he can also license others to  use it. In some instances, patent owners may need to actively assert  their patents in an adversarial context if another firm\u2019s product infringes  their patents. For example, Singer initially refused to obtain a license to  Howe\u2019s patent, but when Howe sued Singer for infringing his patent, the  two parties ultimately entered a licensing agreement.", "According to economists who have studied these issues, the U.S. patent  system\u2014authorized by the U.S. Constitution\u2014aims to promote innovation  by making it more profitable. For example, a patent owner can generally  exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the patented  technology for 20 years from the date on which the application for the  patent was filed. By restricting competition, patents can allow their owners  to earn greater profits on their patented technologies than they could earn  if these technologies could be imitated freely. Due to the exclusive rights  provided by patents, patents can help their owners recoup the costs of  the research and development (R&D) of new technologies. On the other  hand, any limiting effects on competition caused by the exclusive nature  of patents may result in higher prices for products having patented  technologies. The patent system, therefore, gives rise to complex trade- offs involving innovation and competition. These trade-offs can be  affected by decisions made by the United States Patent and Trademark  Office (PTO), which issues patents; the federal courts, which decide  patent infringement lawsuits; and the International Trade Commission  (ITC), which can order imports that infringe U.S. patents to be excluded  from entering the country.", "The Federal Trade Commission uses the related term \u201cpatent assertion entities\u201d to focus  on entities whose business model solely focuses on asserting typically purchased patents.  As such, the PME term also encompasses entities that might use third-party NPEs to  assert patents for them. for those products. Experts agree that NPEs have a variety of business  models, which makes it difficult to fit them neatly into any one of these  categories. For example, even companies that produce products related  to their patents\u2014known as practicing patent owners, or operating  companies\u2014sometimes assert patents that they own but that are not  related to the products they produce, which further complicates defining  an NPE.", "Some legal commentators, technology companies, the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC), and Congress, among others, have raised concerns  that patent infringement litigation by NPEs is increasing and that this  litigation, in some cases, has imposed high costs on firms that are  actually developing and manufacturing products, especially in the  software and technology sectors. Among the concerns of some  technology companies and legal commentators is that because NPEs  generally face lower litigation costs than those they are accusing of  infringement, NPEs are likely to use the threat of imposing these costs as  leverage in seeking infringement compensation. These technology  companies and legal commentators also have noted that NPEs often  claim that their patent covers an entire technology when in fact it may  cover just a small improvement in an existing technology, and that it can  be difficult for judges and juries to determine the patent\u2019s scope when  complex technologies are involved.", "The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), signed into law September  16, 2011, made several significant changes to the U.S. patent system.

Representatives of companies and PMEs we talked  with had regularly been sued or had regularly sued others over the past decade. Other  stakeholders we identified through our review of academic literature on patent litigation  and the patent system and were knowledgeable in the issues we were asked to study.  Because stakeholders varied in their expertise with various topics, not every stakeholder  provided an opinion on every topic. no more than plus or minus 5 percentage points over all these years and  no more than plus or minus 10 percentage points for any particular year.  Lex Machina used a variety of characteristics from court records, U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and corporate  websites to categorize litigants, including as an operating company or  likely operating company, PME or likely PME, university, or an individual  or trust. A limitation of this categorization is that litigants were not  contacted to verify their identity, so there is some uncertainty about the  accuracy of the category in which Lex Machina placed them. We also  obtained patent infringement data from RPX, another firm that collects  data on patent infringement lawsuits, in an effort to verify Lex Machina\u2019s  litigant categorizations. Also to describe what is known about the  volume and characteristics of recent patent litigation activity, we reported  data collected by the American Intellectual Property Law Association  (AIPLA) on the costs of patent litigation.literature on patent litigation and the patent system in general and  assessed the methodology of the studies we reported on for soundness.  To assess the reliability of data from Lex Machina, we met with Lex  Machina staff, examined documentation, and tested and reviewed the  data provided for completeness and accuracy. To assess the reliability of  data from PTO, AIPLA, and RPX, we conducted interviews and reviewed  relevant methodology documentation. We found these data to be  sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report.", "In addition to the steps we took to address all four objectives, in order to  describe views of stakeholders on what is known about the key factors  that contribute to recent patent litigation trends, we reviewed academic  literature on the patent and judicial systems and the benefits and costs of  patent assertion, including economic and legal studies. To describe  developments in the judicial system that may affect patent litigation, we  interviewed officials and judges from the U.S. District Courts for the  District of Delaware and for the Eastern District of Texas. We selected  these district courts because they had high levels of patent infringement  lawsuits according to Lex Machina data. We also interviewed judges with  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in  Washington, D.C., which hears appeals of patent cases decided in  federal district courts, as well as officials from the Administrative Office of  the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) and the Federal Judicial Center\u2013\u2013organizations  that provide broad administrative, legal, and technological services and  support to the judicial branch. We also reviewed documents and data  from the courts, as well as economic and legal studies. To describe what  actions, if any, PTO has recently taken that may affect patent litigation in  the future, we conducted interviews with officials from PTO and reviewed  documents and data from the agency, as well as economic and legal  studies.

PTO does not begin  examining patent applications upon receiving them and PTO\u2019s data  shows that, as of June 2013, the average time between filing and an  examiner\u2019s initial decision on the application was about 18 months. On  average, it takes 30 months for PTO to issue a patent once an application  is submitted.", "The focus of patent examination is determining whether the patent  application satisfies the statutory requirements for a patent, including: (1)  novelty, (2) nonobviousness, (3) utility, and (4) patentable subject   Generally, other patents, publications, and publicly disclosed but  matter. unpatented inventions that pre-date the patent application\u2019s filing date are  known as prior art. During patent examination, the examiner, among other  things, compares an application\u2019s claims to the prior art to determine  whether the claimed invention is novel and nonobvious. The examiner  then decides to reject or grant the claims in the application and deny the  application or grant a patent.", "U.S. patents include the specification and the claims:", "The specification is a written description of the invention that, among  other things, sufficiently discloses the invention and the manner and  process of making and using it. The specification must be written in  full, clear, concise, and exact terms so as to enable any person skilled  in the art to make and use the invention. As an example, an excerpt  from the specification for a cardboard coffee cup and insulator  invention describes \u201ccorrugated containers and container holders  which can be made from existing cellulosic materials, such as paper.\u201d", "The claims define the scope of the invention for which protection is  granted and must be definite. There are often a dozen or more claims  per patent, and they can often be difficult for a layperson to  understand, according to legal commentators. For example, one claim  for the cardboard coffee cup insulator begins by referring to \u201ca  recyclable, insulating beverage container holder, comprising a  corrugated tubular member comprising cellulosic material and at least  a first opening therein for receiving and retaining a beverage  container.\u201d A patent\u2019s claims can be written broadly or be more  narrowly defined, according to legal commentators, and applicants  can change the wording of claims\u2014which can affect their scope\u2014 during examination based on examiner feedback. Patents are a  property right and\u2014like land\u2014their claims define their boundaries.  When a property right is not clearly defined, it can lead to boundary  disputes, although to some extent uncertainty is inherent.  Consequently, legal commentators define high-quality patents as  those whose claims clearly define and provide clear notice of their  boundaries.", "Once issued by PTO, a patent is presumed to be valid. However, the  patentability of its claims can be challenged in administrative proceedings  before PTO or its Patent Trial and Appeal Board and its validity can be  challenged in federal court. For example, the AIA established three new  administrative proceedings for entities to challenge the patentability of a  patent\u2019s claims:  Inter partes review.patent owner to request review of an issued patent by presenting prior  art to PTO\u2014either patents or other publications\u2014to challenge the  claimed invention\u2019s patentability as obvious or not novel.

Challenges to a patent\u2019s validity are often brought by an accused infringer   Patent owners can bring  who has been sued for infringing the patent. infringement lawsuits against anyone who uses, makes, sells, offers to  sell, or imports the patented invention without authorization because a  patent is a right to exclude others from practicing the invention. Exactly  what a patent covers and whether another product infringes the patent\u2019s  claims are rarely easy questions to resolve in litigation, according to legal  commentators. As noted, appeals of district court decisions in  infringement cases are heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal  Circuit in Washington D.C.", "In patent infringement lawsuits, the accused infringer often challenges the patent\u2019s  validity as an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d meaning that even if the infringement allegations are  true, the would-be infringer is not liable because the patent is invalid. A party accused of  infringement can also file a lawsuit to obtain a court decision on whether they are  infringing or whether the patent is valid, which is known as a declaratory judgment action.", "If a patent infringement lawsuit is not dismissed in the initial stages, it  proceeds to discovery (a process that exists in all federal civil litigation)  and claim construction. Discovery requires the accused infringer to  produce documents or other information that shows, among other things,  how the allegedly infringing product is made and operates to help the  patent owner establish infringement. Similarly, the patent owner must  produce documents or other information that the accused infringer can  use to challenge the patent\u2019s validity, among other things. However,  parties that do not offer products or services using the patents at issue  often have far fewer documents to disclose\u2014because they do not have  any documents related to their products or services\u2014than patent owners  or accused infringers who do offer products or services.", "With this information the patent owner specifies which patent claims  allegedly are infringed and the alleged infringer responds by explaining  why the allegedly infringing product is not covered by the patent\u2019s claims.  This identifies the patent claims the court needs to interpret. Known as  claim construction, this is a fundamental issue in patent cases, and each  party tries to persuade the court to interpret the patent claims in its favor.  The court has broad discretion in how it goes about this process, which  can involve a hearing with testimony from witnesses, according to legal   In addition, if the patent\u2019s validity is being challenged,  commentators. the alleged infringer specifies why the patent allegedly is not valid,  including any prior art.", "This hearing is often referred to as a Markman hearing after the Supreme Court\u2019s  decision in Markman v.

Specifically, certain patent owners can file  a complaint with ITC if imported goods infringe their patent or are made  by a process covered by the patent\u2019s claims. If ITC determines after an  investigation that an imported good infringes a patent, the agency can  issue an exclusion order barring the products at issue from entry into the  United States, which the President can disapprove for policy reasons. ITC  decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal  Circuit. Legal commentators have reported that a 2006 Supreme Court  decision led to increased complaints alleging imported goods infringed  U.S. patents being filed with ITC, and recent ITC data show that the  number of investigations instituted by ITC increased from 32 in 2006 to 37  in 2012.", "According to PTO data, applications for all types of patents have  increased in recent years, and patents granted for software-related  technologies have seen dramatic increases over the past 2 decades (see  fig. 1). Software-related patents occur in a variety of technologies  containing at least some element of software, and cover things like  sending messages or conducting business over the Internet (e.g. e- commerce). Patents related to software can, but do not generally, detail  computer software programming code in the specification, but often  provide a more general description of the invention, which can be  programmed in a variety of ways.", "According to legal commentators, the number of software-related patents  grew as computers were integrated into a greater expanse of everyday  products. By 2011 patents related to software made up more than half of  all issued patents. Software was not always patentable, and Supreme  Court decisions in the 1970s found mathematical formulas used by  computers were not patentable subject matter. However, a 1981  Supreme Court decision overturned PTO\u2019s denial of a patent application  for a mathematical formula and a programmed digital computer because,  as a process, it was patentable subject matter. Subsequently, in 1998,  the Federal Circuit ruled that a mathematical formula in the form of a  computer program is patentable if it is applied in a useful way.  According to PTO officials, the agency interpreted these cases as limiting  their ability to reject patent applications for computer processes. Legal  commentators also said that after these decisions, particularly the 1998  Federal Circuit decision, software-related patenting grew as many  technology companies made the conscious effort to generate more  patents for offensive or defensive purposes\u2014that is, to use them to sue  or countersue competitors in infringement lawsuits, rather than use them  to recoup R&D costs.

Some stakeholders  we interviewed generally attributed the increase in 2011 to patent owners\u2019  anticipation of the passage of AIA, which restricts the number of accused  infringers who can be joined in a single lawsuit. Prior to the enactment  of AIA, plaintiffs could sue numerous defendants in a single lawsuit. AIA  restricts this practice by prohibiting joining unrelated defendants into a  single lawsuit based solely on allegations that they have infringed the  same patent. According to the legislative history of AIA, this provision was  designed to address problems created by plaintiffs joining defendants,  sometimes numbering in the dozens. As a result, some stakeholders we  interviewed generally agreed that the increase in 2011 was due to the fact  that plaintiffs had to file more lawsuits at the end of 2011 after AIA\u2019s  enactment in order to sue the same number of defendants or anticipated  this change and rushed to file lawsuits against multiple defendants before  it was enacted.

However, a few legal  commentators we interviewed said that such increases are common  during periods of rapid technological change\u2014new industries lead to  more patents and the number of patent infringement lawsuits also  increases because there are more patents to be enforced.

Individual inventors brought about 8 percent of the  lawsuits, and research firms and universities brought less than 3 percent  over the 5 year span. In about 3 percent of the lawsuits there was  insufficient evidence to determine the type of plaintiff (see fig. 4).", "Our analysis of the data from 2007 through 2011 shows that PMEs  tended to sue more defendants per suit than operating companies. For  this period, there were about 1.9 defendants on average for suits filed by  operating companies, and about 4.1 defendants on average for suits filed  by PMEs. In addition, a disproportionate share of PMEs sued a relatively  large number of defendants. For example, about 12 percent of PMEs  sued 10 defendants or more in a single lawsuit, compared to about 3  percent of operating companies, a statistically significant difference. Thus,  even with bringing about a fifth of all patent infringement lawsuits from  2007 to 2011, PMEs sued close to one-third of the overall defendants,  accounting for about half of the overall increase in defendants.

Specifically, from 2007 to 2011, 39 percent of PME and likely  PME lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, compared to  about 8 percent of lawsuits filed by all other plaintiffs. Some stakeholders  we interviewed said that in their view this occurs because juries in this  district favor patent owners over alleged infringers. In addition, one  study we reviewed that looked at all decisions for all patent lawsuits from  1995 to 2011, showed that the Eastern District of Texas, the Eastern  District of Virginia, and the District of Delaware were among the top  districts for quicker trials, higher success rates, and higher damage  awards for patent owners.", "An estimated 21 percent of patent infringement cases from 2007 to 2011  were still ongoing. Of the remaining cases, our analysis shows that about  86 percent either ended or likely ended in a settlement. This occurred  because both parties agreed to a judgment that the judge sanctioned,  both parties agreed to end the lawsuit, or the plaintiff, who had brought  the lawsuit, asked for it to be dismissed. Lawsuits brought by both  operating companies and PMEs settled or likely settled at similar rates.  Less than 3 percent of the cases that were not ongoing ended in a trial  and judgment, or were on appeal, which was consistent with what some  representatives of operating companies told us\u2014very few of their lawsuits  go to trial because they settle quickly to avoid high litigation costs.", "We were not able to determine litigation cost information from our sample  data, and we found very little information on the costs of patent  infringement lawsuits in court records.

According to a 2011 nongeneralizable survey of patent lawyers  by AIPLA, the cost of defending one patent infringement lawsuit, which  excludes any damages awarded, was from $650,000 to $5 million in  2011, depending on how much was at risk. As for damages awarded, a  2012 study that looked at all district court patent decisions that proceeded  through trial from 1995 to 2011 found that the median damage award was  over $5 million dollars and that damage awards in NPE cases were  higher than in other types of suits. The authors of a 2012 paper who  collected data from a nonrandom, nongeneralizable set of 82 operating  companies noted that total litigation costs for NPE suits, including  damages awarded and legal fees, were around $300,000 for small and  medium companies and $600,000 for large companies. The author of  another 2012 paper sought to examine the impacts of NPE litigation on  small companies and collected data from a nonrandom, nongeneralizable  set of 223 small technology companies. Of the 79 companies that  indicated that they had received a patent demand, 31 reported that the  demand affected the company in various ways, including reduced hiring  or a reduced value of their company\u2014which the author collectively  described as \u201csignificant operational impacts.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Reported That Patent Assertion Occurs Without Firms Ever Filing Lawsuits", "paragraphs": ["In addition to lawsuits, patent assertion occurs without firms ever filing  lawsuits, but the extent of this practice is unclear because we were not  able to find reliable data on patent assertion outside of the court system.

Although there is some inherent uncertainty associated  with all patent claims, several of the stakeholders with this opinion noted  that claims in software-related patents are often overly broad, unclear or  both.

For example, two of these stakeholders  said the computer software industry does not have clear terminology  or common vocabularies for describing concepts, innovations, and  ideas. Language describing emerging technologies, such as software,  may be inherently imprecise because these technologies are  constantly evolving. In contrast, pharmaceutical drug patents are  relatively clear because they use standardized scientific terminology,  according to a few stakeholders.", "Some stakeholders, including operating companies and legal  commentators, emphasized that claims in software patents  sometimes define the scope of the invention by encompassing an  entire function\u2013\u2013like sending an e-mail\u2013\u2013rather than the specific  means of performing that function. According to a few stakeholders  we spoke with, functional claims and other overly broad claims may  allow patent owners who sue for infringement to argue in court that  their patent covers (1) an entire technology when it may only cover a  small improvement, or (2) future technologies that their patent did not  originally intend to cover. For example, representatives from one PME  we spoke with said they had successfully sued companies for  infringement even though the companies were implementing their  idea in a completely different manner than described in their patent\u2013\u2013 noting that they had patented their invention before the technology to  best implement it was actually available. In addition, a few  stakeholders noted that in certain circumstances patent owners can  file a reissue application with PTO, which can sometimes broaden the  scope of patents after they are issued. In addition, a few  stakeholders noted that patent owners can also file continuation  applications during patent examination, which, depending on the type  filed, allow new subject matter to be added to the patent application.", "According to some stakeholders\u2014including PMEs and  representatives of operating companies that were sued for patent  infringement\u2014broad patents on concepts they would not expect to be  patented make it easy to infringe a patent without intending to do so,  although this is not a defense since patent infringement is a strict  liability offense.capital firms we spoke with said that many software-related patents  they encountered were for obvious concepts and did not represent  any real contribution to new technology. Other stakeholders, including  operating companies, judges, and legal commentators, also said  some patents, particularly software-related patents, should never  have been issued because they were obvious, not novel, or lacked  definiteness.", "For example, the software start-up and venture  Unclear boundaries make it hard to determine whether a patent is actually  related to a particular technology. Several diverse stakeholders, including  PMEs, operating companies, legal commentators, and judges we  interviewed said that many overly broad or vague patent claims do not  sufficiently identify the scope of the patent\u2019s coverage. This lack of notice  makes it difficult for entities to identify relevant existing patents and prior  art before developing new products, according to some legal  commentators and operating companies. This difficulty reduces the  effectiveness of searching for existing patents to ensure the product being  developed does not infringe on valid patents and, according to several  stakeholders, including PMEs, legal commentators, and venture capital  and start-up firms, entities do not always conduct patent searches. For  example, representatives from a software start-up company we spoke  with told us that searching for relevant patents before developing new  products is unrealistic and diverts already scarce resources, particularly  because their product development process can be as short as 2 months.  In contrast, pharmaceutical company representatives we spoke with said  that development of new drugs is so expensive that patent searches are a  necessity and that they can conduct thorough searches because their  patents are described clearly and are easy to find in industry databases.", "In addition, a few stakeholders we spoke with told us that the sheer  volume of patents makes searching for relevant patents before  developing new products particularly difficult, especially for products that  combine many patented technologies. For example, these stakeholders  we spoke with estimated that a typical smartphone uses from 50,000 to  250,000 patented technologies because such devices incorporate  technologies from digital cameras, global positioning systems, and  wireless communication. In contrast, pharmaceutical company  representatives we spoke with said they are able to conduct thorough  patent searches, in part, because there are fewer patents per drug.  Determining the licenses a new product needs can be costly when many  patents are involved; according to data from the AIPLA survey, the  median cost for a legal validity and infringement opinion is $15,000 per  patent. Additionally, a technology start-up company told us that they  may avoid patent searches because damage awards can be tripled for  willful infringement, and by not searching for existing patents, they can  claim ignorance.", "Even if an entity conducts a patent search, identifies a relevant patent,  and wants to avoid infringing it by obtaining a license to use it, according  to several diverse stakeholders we spoke with, including PMEs, legal  commentators, and operating companies, identifying the owner could be  difficult because patent owners are not required to notify PTO of changes  in assignment or ownership. According to some stakeholders we spoke  with, finding patent owners is further complicated by the fact that some of  these patent owners create subsidiary companies solely to hold their  patent rights. In fact, several stakeholders we interviewed, including legal  commentators, operating companies, and a PME, said that some entities  intentionally hide the existence of their patents until a sector or company  are using the patented invention without authorization and can be sued  for infringement. Further, some economic literature we reviewed suggests  that the numerous technologies in many products are sometimes  patented by many different patent owners and can have overlapping  rights, making it difficult and costly to determine which patents the  operating company needs to license. We discuss PTO\u2019s current efforts to  address these notice problems later in the report.", "Most of the representatives from operating companies we interviewed  said that PMEs specifically have played a role in the rise in patent  infringement litigation. Some of the representatives from operating  companies also said that PMEs are often more willing to bring lawsuits  based on a broad interpretation of their patents\u2019 claims because they  cannot be countersued for patent infringement since they do not produce  a product. Some economic literature we reviewed suggests that accused  infringers have an incentive to settle quickly to avoid the uncertainty of  claim construction and high litigation costs, particularly if they face very  high costs of changing their products to avoid infringement.

A few  representatives of operating companies told us that companies prefer to  settle lawsuits before trial for smaller amounts of money rather than risk  having to pay large damage awards and legal fees, even if they know the  case against them is weak. They said that some patent owners file  infringement lawsuits knowing that defendants will settle the case before  the court determines whether infringement occurred or the patents are  valid. In addition, some operating company representatives said that  patent owners often sue operating companies that have purchased  licenses to use software in order to get settlements from numerous  infringers rather than suing the vendor. One PME we spoke with said that  although it tries to sue technology vendors whenever possible, it sues end  users most of the time because these are usually profitable companies,  and there is greater potential for larger settlements.", "Until 2011, damage awards could be calculated using the 25 percent  rule\u2014whereby the alleged infringer would pay a royalty rate equivalent to  25 percent of the expected profits for the product that incorporates the  patent at issue.

In a 2011 report, FTC noted that some legal  rules for calculating damages were not grounded in economic analysis  and therefore may under- or overcompensate patent owners for  infringement in comparison to the market.

PTO often updates its patent examination manual  or issues guidance to patent examiners in response to changes in  case law and these recently issued supplemental guidelines try to  ensure that all technologies receive consistent examination practices,  according to PTO officials. These guidelines specifically address  examination of claims with functional language\u2014which recites a  feature by what it does rather than by what it is\u2014in computer- implemented claims. For example, the guidelines state that examiners  should determine whether the application discloses the computer and  algorithm that perform the claimed function in sufficient detail that  someone of ordinary skill in the art would know how to program the  computer to perform the claimed function, and that the inventor was in  possession of the claimed invention. The guidelines further noted that  the algorithm may be expressed in any understandable terms and  generally do not call for the application to contain actual computer  code. The supplemental guidelines attempt to make examination of  applications consistent and resulting patents clearer across all  technologies, according to PTO officials. In May 2012, an internal  PTO review showed that PTO examiners were making 4 to 6 percent  more rejections in patent applications across all technology areas  based on claims not being clear and definite than before the  supplemental guidelines were issued. PTO officials said patent  requirements are established by statute and case law, which  constrains the agency\u2019s ability to alter requirements for patent  applications. PTO officials told us that only court decisions or statutory  changes could change the law to require more detail for algorithms in  software-related patents, for example.  In November 2011, in response to the recommendations from FTC\u2019s  2011 report, PTO acknowledged that more uniform terminology would  help to improve the quality of software-related patents and began  working to establish a partnership with the software industry to  address this issue. In January 2013, PTO announced the Software  Partnership\u2014a cooperative effort with the software industry to explore  ways to enhance the quality of software-related patents, including  through the use of more uniform terminology.

According to agency officials, PTO plans to meet  this 2015 deadline, and the agency has started collecting and publishing  information on the number of times the new AIA proceedings are being   The  used and the timing of implementation. As of July 31st, 2013, there had  been 395 requests for inter partes reviews and 39 requests for review  under the transitional program for covered business method patents,  according to data from PTO.", "Given that challenging a patent\u2019s validity is a common defense for those  who have been accused of patent infringement, PTO officials we spoke  with mentioned that the new post-grant proceedings may have the  potential to reduce future patent litigation because they offer a less costly  and faster alternative to settling patent disputes in federal district courts.  For example, a representative of a number of technology companies we  spoke with estimated that the legal and filing fees for using one of these  proceedings would be between $166,000 and $390,000, depending on  the proceeding, for an average patent, while legal fees could be upwards  of $5 million for an infringement case filed in district court. According to  the Board judges we spoke with, these proceedings will be faster than  most litigation in district court\u2014which takes 2-\u00bd years for the patent  infringement trial to begin on average, according to a recent study\u2014 because the regulations stipulate that they normally are to conclude  within 1 year of being initiated. However, representatives from some  operating companies said that they will not use these post-grant review  proceedings if federal judges do not consistently delay the costly trials  until the Board completes its review. In the past, federal judges have not  always been willing to suspend a lawsuit while waiting for PTO to conduct  reexaminations, but may be more likely to do this given the regulatory 1  year timeline, according to these representatives. Judges at the Board  told us they are working to ensure that the post-grant review proceedings  are completed within 1 year. In addition, some operating company  representatives we spoke with said that post-grant review in particular  would be of limited utility since they only have 9 months after a patent is  issued to file a request for review, but usually only learn about a patent\u2019s  existence after being sued or receiving a demand letter, which is often  many years after the patent has been issued.", "Finally, representatives from some operating companies said they are not  planning to use post-grant review to challenge a patent\u2019s validity because  an adverse final decision by the Board generally prohibits them from  challenging the patent\u2019s validity again in court. These representatives  said that they consider this to be a major flaw in post-grant review.  However, a few other stakeholders said that patent owners need certainty  in their patent\u2019s validity and that the same party should not be able to  challenge the patent\u2019s validity through post-grant review and in the federal  courts. Judges at the Board said they were aware of this issue and would  continue to monitor it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Public discussion surrounding patent infringement litigation often focuses  on the increasing role of NPEs. However, our analysis indicates that  regardless of the type of litigant, lawsuits involving software-related  patents accounted for about 89 percent of the increase in defendants  between 2007 and 2011, and most of the suits brought by PMEs involved  software-related patents. This suggests that the focus on the identity of  the litigant\u2014rather than the type of patent\u2014may be misplaced. PTO\u2019s  recent efforts to work with the software industry to more uniformly define  software terminology and make it easier to identify relevant patents and  patent owners may strengthen the U.S. patent system. Further, PTO has  available internal data on the patent examination process that could be  linked to litigation data, and a 2003 National Academies study reported  that using these types of data together could provide useful insights into  patent quality.

Lex Machina maintains a database created from public electronic court filings for all patent infringement lawsuits filed in U.S.  federal district courts, beginning in the year 2000. From this database,  Lex Machina selected a random, generalizable sample of 100 lawsuits  per year from 2007 through 2011, identifying for each lawsuit the  patent(s) being litigated, the court hearing the lawsuit, and the lawsuit\u2019s  outcome. The sample size allowed us to draw conclusions about patent  infringement lawsuits filed in each of these years, with a margin of error of  no more than plus or minus 5 percentage points over all these years and  no more than plus or minus 10 percentage points for any particular year.  Each sample element was subsequently weighted in the analysis to  account statistically for all the members of the population, including those  that were not selected. To assess the reliability of data from Lex Machina,  we met with Lex Machina staff, examined documentation, and tested and  reviewed the sample data for completeness and accuracy. We found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also obtained patent  infringement data from RPX, another firm that collects data on patent  infringement lawsuits, in an effort to verify Lex Machina\u2019s litigant  categorizations.", "For the plaintiffs named in each lawsuit, Lex Machina also provided an  entity description, classifying the plaintiffs as follows: an operating company, or a likely operating company; an entity related to an operating company; a PME or a likely PME; a university; an individual or trust; or a research firm.", "To classify a plaintiff, Lex Machina placed more weight on statements  made by the plaintiff in official documents, such as its own court and  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and statements  appearing on a website maintained by the plaintiff. From these sources  Lex Machina obtained information that would help it to determine the  entity type, such as statements indicating that the plaintiff made or sold a  product or offered services, or evidence that the plaintiff shared corporate  ownership with such an entity. Some statements, such as a statement  describing a plaintiff\u2019s business as focused on patent licensing, indicated  that the plaintiff was in the business of patent monetization.", "In some cases, the plaintiffs\u2019 own statements did not lead to a definitive  classification, and Lex Machina consulted other sources to obtain relevant  information about the plaintiff\u2019s business activities. To the extent possible,  Lex Machina relied on additional sources they characterized as \u201cverified  and objective,\u201d such as corporate databases and articles of incorporation.  To the extent that Lex Machina lacked official information, it used  professional judgment to classify plaintiffs based on information from  other sources, such as news articles, blogs, court filings by opposing  parties, and Lex Machina\u2019s own database. Examples of information from  these other sources that were used to classify plaintiffs include: (1) the  number of patent infringement lawsuits filed by the plaintiff; (2) whether  the plaintiff had been sued for patent infringement in other lawsuits or  counterclaims; (3) whether the plaintiff had been subject to a declaratory  judgment lawsuit for noninfringement or invalidity; (4) the number of  defendants sued in each lawsuit and in total; (5) statements about the  plaintiff in news articles, blogs, or in court filings by an opposing party,  such as a statement characterizing the plaintiff as a patent monetization  entity; (6) whether the plaintiff was represented by an attorney known to  represent patent monetization entities; and (7) evidence of linkages  between the plaintiff and a patent monetization entity, such as a common  principal or a street address shared in common. In some cases, the  difficulty of finding information about the plaintiffs, their business activities,  and their corporate relationships led Lex Machina to choose no entity  classification at all.

We found 29 cases where we  differed with Lex Machina\u2019s original classification. They adjusted their  classifications in all but five of the cases.
