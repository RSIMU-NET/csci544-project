As a result of funding and governance challenges-- such as untimely contributions, a lack of performance metrics, unclear lines of authority, and confusion over roles and responsibilities among Grants.gov's governance bodies-- that have adversely affected operations, GAO is required to examine (1) key factors HHS should consider when proposing a funding model for Grants.gov, and (2) how the Grants.gov governance bodies could address Grants.gov's previously identified governance challenges. To do this, GAO analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials at HHS, OMB, the Grants Executive Board (GEB), three case study agencies that manage similar E-Gov initiatives and three Grants.gov partner agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In keeping with OMB's expectation to move toward a fee-for-service model, starting with the fiscal year 2010 budget, the Grants.gov contribution calculation changed to better reflect agencies' use of Grants.gov's services. However, GAO found that the calculation results in different contribution amounts for agencies with similar usage profiles because the calculation includes a measure of agency size that does not correlate well with an agency's use of Grants.gov. For example, usage data for the fiscal year 2011 contributions indicates that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, a large agency) posted 40 grant opportunities and received 4,817 applications through the Grants.gov Web site while the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH, a small agency) posted 42 opportunities and received 4,577 applications. However, HUD's contribution is $414,422 while NEH's is $155,159. In addition, GAO found that the Grants.gov Program Management Office (PMO) does not track and report on certain key costs, limiting partner agencies' ability to understand the relationship between services received and amounts paid for that service. Grants.gov also does not charge partner agencies for all known costs, which can result in some agencies subsidizing other agencies' use of the system. Finally, Grants.gov continues to suffer from untimely agency contributions. While the other EGov initiatives GAO spoke with report similar challenges, some take mitigating steps that aid them in managing delays. They are: (1) depositing partner fees/contributions into multiyear appropriation accounts and (2) receiving some form of funds from their managing partners until partner agency contributions become available. Accountability and responsibility for Grants.gov performance among its governance bodies--the PMO, GEB and HHS's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)--remains unclear. Since GAO first reported on these issues in July 2009, some progress has been made clarifying roles and responsibilities, developing performance measures to track important aspects of system performance, and providing partner agencies with key performance and cost information. However, although the GEB and the OCIO continue to share responsibility for approving major changes to, and funding for, the Grants.gov system, there remains little evidence that the GEB-approved funding for Grants.gov is considered in HHS's review of Grants.gov as an IT investment as required by OMB guidance. In addition, Grants.gov's performance measures have not changed since GAO reported on them and still do not provide a clear picture of system performance. Finally, Grants.gov does not communicate some key performance and activity cost information with its partner agencies. A new federal grants governance model under OMB review would merge various Grants.gov governance entities and serve as the federal grants advisory body responsible for establishing the direction for and coordinating all governmentwide grants initiatives, including Grants.gov. As a preliminary, concept document, it is understandable that it contains few implementation details; however, the proposal lacks even an overview of several critical elements, such as how grants initiatives would be managed as IT investments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to HHS aimed at improving Grants.gov's funding calculation, cost tracking, and annual and strategic plan; and knowledgesharing with other E-Gov initiatives.

However, as we have previously reported, the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), Grants.gov\u2019s managing partner, has  faced funding and governance challenges that have adversely affected  Grants.gov operations. For example, we said that Grants.gov\u2019s challenges  had in some cases led to late or incomplete applications and lost  opportunities for both grantees and the population that may have  benefited from the grantee\u2019s programs and services.  In March 2009, the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also noted that the Grants.gov  system had experienced periods of noticeably degraded performance and  described the system as being at serious risk for failure. Concerned about  the impending influx of Recovery Act-related grant applications, OMB  instructed federal grant-making agencies with viable alternatives to  identify temporary, alternate methods for accepting grant applications and  in April 2009, instructed the agencies to cover the additional costs of  urgent improvements to the system. In a July 2009 report, we  recommended that the Director of OMB work with HHS to develop  Grants.gov system performance measures, guidance clarifying the  governance structure, a structured means for applicant input, and uniform  policies for processing grant applications.

The GEB stated  that gauging actual system use would require a longitudinal analysis of  factors, including opportunities posted, applications submitted, and  applications received. HHS and PMO officials told us that they consider  agency size to correlate with an agency\u2019s use of the Grants.gov system;  however, we found only a moderate correlation between partner agencies\u2019  use of the Grants.gov Web site (as defined by the Grants.gov contribution  calculation) and agency size.  When we analyzed fiscal year 2011  Grants.gov data for agency size, grants posted, and applications submitted,  we found no clear pattern of increased system usage as agency size  increased. While the average number of grants posted and applications  accepted was the lowest for extra small agencies and highest for HHS (the  only extra large agency), the relationship was inconsistent for small,  medium, and large agencies.

Further, to the extent that agencies receive goods and services from  HHS under the Economy Act, the amount paid must be based on the actual  cost of goods or services provided. The Economy Act is the authority  cited by most agencies as the legal basis for transferring funds to HHS for  Grants.gov services. In 2008, we reported that better allocation of system  costs among users also promotes efficiency and perceived equity.

For example, the Grants.gov PMO  updates GEB members at bimonthly board meetings with spending  information on contracted activities and staff salaries but, according to  HHS, detailed spending information by program activity or agency-specific  requests are not provided. Absent this information, partner agencies\u2019  ability to link the services they received to their Grants.gov payments is  limited, and the Grants.gov PMO cannot easily justify proposed increases  to the Grants.gov budget or explain how changes in agency  contributions\u2014either stemming from changes in the contribution  calculation or the total budget amount\u2014align with services agencies will  receive. One partner agency said that the inability to link services received  to their Grants.gov payments causes delays in processing the Grants.gov  MOU because the agency\u2019s MOU approval procedures require a  documented link between costs incurred and payments made. The  Grants.gov PMO told us that if asked to do so, they could track activity  costs in greater detail, but that they are not set up to track costs by  agency.", "The type of cost tracking in our case study initiatives varied. For example,  the Benefits.gov PMO prepares a strategic plan for partner agencies that  links activities to system goals and costs. According to the Benefits.gov  PMO, this type of reporting gives partner agencies the information to  decide what system activities they would have to curtail to achieve lower  payments. Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) officials we spoke  with said that in addition to tracking costs by each of the eight systems  they manage, they also provide annual reports describing the services  partner agencies receive as well as the cost savings they realize through  their participation in the IAE systems. None of the initiatives we spoke  with, however, track costs by agency.", "Further, although Grants.gov tracks the costs of providing on-line grant  application forms to partner agencies for internal management purposes, it  does not charge partner agencies commensurate with their use of these  forms. Grant application packages can include multiple custom or  standard on-line grant application forms, which the PMO creates and  maintains at the request of partner agencies. According to the Grants.gov  PMO, the cost of developing and maintaining these forms is increasing.  Development of each custom form creates additional cost for the PMO,  and Grants.gov incurs maintenance costs (e.g., license fees) for all active  forms. Currently, each partner agency is allowed two new forms each year.  However, some partner agencies request and receive more than two forms  per year; others request new forms but also request that the old forms  remain active. Since partner agencies\u2019 payments do not change based on  their form usage, partner agencies that request fewer than two new forms  each year subsidize agencies that request more than two forms. The PMO  reports that the increasing cost of forms puts pressure on its ability to  deliver other required services. The PMO said that it would like to include  a measure of form activity in the contribution calculation, so that partner  agencies with more form activity pay a higher share of system costs. The  PMO has discussed this informally with members of the GEB but has not  made a proposal to capture forms activity in the contribution calculation.", "Lastly, because the Grants.gov contribution calculation does not account  for all of Grants.gov\u2019s activity costs, it is unclear whether the weights  assigned to the three measures in the contribution calculation actually  represent the relative cost of each activity. For example, as mentioned  above, the measure for posting grant opportunities accounts for 40 percent  of the Grants.gov budget in the contribution calculation; however, the cost  data necessary to make this linkage is not tracked or reported.

In addition, HHS and OMB have cited  delayed funding as a management risk to Grants.gov. In 2009, according  to the PMO, delayed funding nearly resulted in Grants.gov suspending  operations. As we have previously reported, this funding pattern is not  unusual for Grants.gov specifically or for legacy E-Gov initiatives in  general.", "The Grants.gov PMO reported that collection delays complicate its ability  to manage Grants.gov efficiently. Until it receives its contributions,  Grants.gov is generally not permitted to expend funds for system  maintenance, upgrades, or any other activities or purchases. HHS and  PMO officials said that to date, they have met all federal standards for  executing contracts and eventually are able to obligate all partner agency  contributions each fiscal year, but face difficulties, especially with small  but crucial contracts, that are restricted by acquisition rules from crossing  fiscal years. For example, the PMO said that for the first several months of  fiscal year 2010, it was difficult and expensive to make changes to the Web  site because the contract option period for the contractor who supported  those changes had ended and there were no funds available to exercise the  next option period. This resulted in many Web pages becoming outdated  and required approximately 90 changes to Web pages when funds became  available and support was restored.", "Various factors contribute to funding delays. According to OMB, reasons  for late or nonpayment of partner agency funds include internal agency  issues and statutory requirements governing agencies\u2019 transfer of funds for  E-Gov initiatives. Additionally, the Grants.gov PMO and officials from  other legacy E-Gov initiatives we interviewed reported that the process of  managing the MOUs\u2014which are the vehicles that lay out the amount and  timing of contributions to be made in support of these E-Gov initiatives\u2014 is time consuming and contributes to funding delays. For example, both  the Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) and Benefits.gov  PMOs noted that delays in collections from partner agencies posed a  serious threat to their respective systems and all three case study  managing partners stated that the enforcement of these agreements is  costly to the PMOs. Managing recurring risks is a multistep process that  includes evaluating and selecting risk management alternatives. As we  have previously reported, OMB staff recognize the risks the PMO faces in  compelling agencies to pay on time, but said that with proper management  such risks can be greatly mitigated. They added that other E-Gov  initiatives face similar challenges but still run successful systems with  higher levels of customer satisfaction, such as Business Gateway  (www.business.gov) and Benefits.gov (www.benefits.gov).", "The E-Gov initiatives in our review use various strategies to manage  collection delays. For example, all of them\u2014including Grants.gov\u2014 prepare and distribute agency MOUs early in the fiscal year to facilitate  rapid collection, as well as time contracts to begin mid or late in the fiscal  year rather than at the start of the fiscal year. However, the IAE and DAIP  PMOs report that two additional strategies are also useful in managing  delays. They are: (1) depositing partner fees/contributions into multiyear  appropriation accounts and (2) receiving some form of funds from their  managing partners until partner agency contributions become available.", "Multiyear Appropriation Accounts. Integrated Acquisition  Environment (IAE) and DAIP deposit their multiyear or no-year  partner agency contributions into multiyear accounts. This allows the  agency to carry over unobligated funds from one year to the next,  which can help with cash flow issues during the early part of the fiscal  year before current year funds become available. The IAE PMO reports  depositing partner agency contributions into a revolving fund, and said  that in previous years it was able to use unobligated funds (i.e., carry- over) in the revolving fund to mitigate the adverse impact of receiving  contributions later in the fiscal year. The DAIP PMO uses a different  type of account\u2014a multiyear, reimbursable account\u2014to achieve the  same outcome.", "Timing of Managing Partner Contributions. Both IAE and DAIP  have the benefit of receiving funds from their managing partner to tide  them over between the beginning of a fiscal year and the point at  which partner agency contributions are made available. The IAE PMO  reports being able to borrow funds from GSA prior to receiving its  partner agency contributions; it reimburses GSA once it receives its  partner agency contributions.  DAIP receives their managing partner\u2019s  contribution in advance of the OMB E-Gov Benefits report issuance\u2014 in January of fiscal year 2010 for example\u2014which eases cash flow  issues caused by receiving partner agency contributions late in the  fiscal year.", "Grants.gov\u2019s contributions are deposited into an annual appropriation  account. The PMO treats all contributions, including contributions from  agencies that pay with multi- or no-year funds as being available for  obligation only in the fiscal year of the contribution. That is, because the  contributions are deposited into an account that closes at the end of each  fiscal year, the Grants.gov PMO either obligates all of these funds by the  end of each fiscal year, or returns them. Our review of available agency  agreements found that 7 partner agencies in fiscal year 2008 and 10 partner  agencies in fiscal year 2009 reported contributing multiyear or no-year  funds to Grants.gov.  These funds accounted for at least 20 percent of the  Grants.gov budget in both years. To create a more reliable funding  stream for Grants.gov, PMO and HHS officials said that they are exploring  several alternatives to the current system, including the use of revolving  funds, multiyear reimbursable accounts, and direct appropriations. They  are also exploring the possibility of keeping the funds in an annual  appropriation account but having partner agencies delay transferring their  no- or multiyear funds until the first quarter of the following fiscal year;  these funds would be available in the fiscal year following the year for  which the contribution was made. To date, HHS has not implemented  these or other alternatives.", "Experiences and lessons learned from other similar legacy E-Gov  initiatives could help inform Grants.gov\u2019s deliberations as it considers  options for addressing its funding-related challenges. HHS acknowledges  the value in sharing information and met with the National Science  Foundation, which serves as managing partner for the Grants Management  Line of Business initiative in December 2010. The purpose of the meeting  was to discuss Grants.gov\u2019s funding challenges and to explore potential  funding alternatives.  HHS also reported attending an April 2010  Grants/Acquisition Community collaboration meeting which included GSA  IAE managing partner officials. Part of the purpose of the meeting was to  discuss governance and IT funding of E-Government projects. However,  HHS does not regularly meet with its counterparts in other legacy E-Gov  initiatives. We have previously reported on the benefits of knowledge- sharing in a variety of government programs. OMB encourages legacy E- Gov initiatives to share good practices, such as strategies used to manage  collection delays, and has referred HHS to other E-Gov initiatives to seek  guidance on this issue. Other E-Gov managing partners have also noted  the benefits of such collaboration.  For example, the DAIP and  Benefits.gov PMOs have a long-standing collaborative relationship that,  according to DAIP officials, includes sharing best practice information and  lessons learned.

Since we first reported on these issues in July 2009, some progress has  been made in these areas. As previously discussed, although OMB and  HHS have taken some steps to implement our recommendations to (1)  develop and review performance metrics related to system availability,  usability, and data integrity; and (2) develop guidance that defines roles  and responsibilities of various governance bodies and ensures that the  Grants.gov budget and funding model adequately supports the package of  IT services approved by HHS\u2019s OCIO, these recommendations have not  been fully implemented. Given the number of entities with management  and oversight responsibilities for Grants.gov, clear roles and  responsibilities for each and coordination among these entities is critical.  In addition, information on system performance and costs is necessary to  clearly link the benefits partner agencies receive with the costs they pay  and may foster partner agency support for Grants.gov.", "Unclear Roles and Responsibilities. As we previously reported, the  GEB and HHS\u2019s OCIO share responsibility for reviewing and approving  major changes to, and funding for, the Grants.gov system. In October 2009,  the PMO indicated that it was working with the HHS Chief Information  Office to ensure full adherence to the HHS Capital Planning and  Investment Control Process (CPIC); in December 2010, the PMO told us  that Grants.gov is subject to all HHS IT Investment Control and Security  policies appropriate to major IT investments. The PMO also described a  closer working relationship with the OCIO and said that since early 2009,  HHS executives in the Grants, Budget, and CIO offices have been regularly  briefed on Grants.gov status. In addition, HHS as the managing partner of  Grants.gov attends OCIO and IT Review Board meetings and  communicates information back to the Grants.gov PMO. According to a  PMO official, the GEB continues to provide IT capital planning  governance. However, HHS officials also told us that there is a disconnect  between system requirements and the funding to meet those requirements.  As an example, HHS officials cited the GEB\u2019s historical inability to fund an  adequate disaster recovery capability. In commenting on a draft of this  report, HHS provided additional information on its CPIC process after we  completed our work on this engagement, including a new IT acquisition  approval process implemented as of February 24, 2011. The process  applies to all IT acquisitions greater than $10,000\u2014including Grants.gov\u2014 and includes an IT Acquisition Approval Checklist\u2014which requires  reporting the total cost of the acquisition. These new policies above make  it more likely that Grants.gov will be reviewed through the CPIC process.  However, until HHS's OCIO can demonstrate that it directly receives and  reviews the GEB-approved budget for Grants.gov and approves Grants.gov  activities based on the GEB-approved funding levels, HHS lacks assurance  that Grants.gov's funding levels will support the functions approved  through CPIC.", "Key System Performance Measures. Since our July 2009 report, the  Grants.gov PMO has made progress in developing improved system  performance measures. In commenting on a draft of this report, an HHS  official said that in December 2010 they launched an initiative to  implement Foglight, a system performance monitoring tool. As part of this  effort, HHS developed a draft set of performance metrics for service  availability, system performance, and system usage, and is in the process  of discussing the draft measures with its stakeholders to solicit input on  potential performance metrics for the Grants.gov system. However, until  HHS finalizes and deploys a set of well-designed performance measures it  will continue to lack a clear picture of system performance and  information about how well applicants are being served. Further, as we  previously reported, in response to the recurring difficulties with the  Grants.gov system some agencies continue to accept applications through  agency-specific electronic systems, by e-mail, or mail, under at least some  circumstances. Absent better information on the health of the Grants.gov  system\u2014and a means to use that information to improve system  performance\u2014partner agencies have little incentive to reduce their  reliance on potentially duplicative agency-specific grant application  systems.", "Grants.gov\u2019s current strategic plan contains high-level statements on  strategic vision, mission, and goals, but does not include specific  performance goals or information on current and planned initiatives. HHS  officials acknowledged that they should update their strategic plan; the  Grants.gov PMO told us that it initiated planning activities during the first  quarter of fiscal year 2011, such as developing a documented annual work  plan, that would include proposed PMO activities for each quarter and its  progress in completing those activities.", "Communication with Partner Agencies. HHS provides partner agencies  with feedback opportunities but does not communicate some key  performance and cost information. In an effort to better inform partner  agencies about Grants.gov operations, a PMO official said that the  Grants.gov Agency User group meets monthly, and helps provide an open  line of communication between the PMO and partner agencies. The PMO  official noted that, as part of an effort to increase transparency and  provide more substantive opportunities for two-way feedback between  Grants.gov and partner agencies, HHS sponsored forums held in January  and February 2010, attended by 21 of the 26 partners. During these  sessions, HHS solicited feedback and provided updates on the status of  past partner agency recommendations. The PMO also surveyed partner  agencies about their priorities for new system requirements.", "In spite of these efforts, Grants.gov partner agencies have expressed  interest in obtaining more information on system performance and costs.  For example, an official from one agency said that he would like to see  more information about performance metrics for the Grants.gov Web site  and call-in center and more transparency about program activity costs,  such as agency-specific costs. The PMO does not routinely provide partner  agencies with detailed spending plans or reports linking costs to activity,  program goal, or agency-requested services because, as previously  discussed, it generally does not track information in this way. Absent this  information, agencies lack a clear picture of the benefits they receive from  Grants.gov compared to the costs they pay, hampering their support of  and satisfaction with Grants.gov. The PMO said that it does report on the  costs and trade-offs of significant changes to system operations when  significant realignments of program resources are required by statute,  regulation, best practice, or when proposed by the GEB.", "We have previously reported that agreeing on roles and responsibilities  and developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results  can help increase the success of interagency collaborative efforts such as  Grants.gov. By doing so, federal agencies can better address their partner  agencies\u2019 expectations and gain their support in achieving joint objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Federal Grants Governance Model Is Under OMB Review", "paragraphs": ["In December 2009, the Grants Task Force, a group composed of  representatives from the GEB and the GPC, including a representative  from HHS, submitted a proposal for a Federal Grants Governance  Framework to OMB. In February 2010, the Task Force met with OMB to  further discuss the issue. As of April 2011, the proposal remains under  OMB review. The framework describes a new governance body that would  replace the GEB and the GPC. The new body would report directly to  OMB and would serve as the federal grants advisory body responsible for  establishing the direction for and coordinating all governmentwide grants  initiatives, including Grants.gov.  The framework calls for a single point of  contact in OMB. A GPC official said that a single point of contact (\u201ca  champion for the grants community\u201d) in OMB would encourage  decisiveness and clear communication.  In addition to consolidating the  GEB and GPC, the proposed framework would integrate the policy, IT,  operations, and oversight functions of both bodies and includes an OMB  representative as a co-chair or sponsor.  The Grants.gov PMO would be  represented on an operations committee. Finally, the proposed framework  will foster involvement by the external grantee community and encourage  collaboration between federal grant-making agencies as well as between  those agencies and the public.  OMB has not provided a time frame for  finishing its review. We note that significant changes to the Grants.gov  governance model are unlikely until OMB completes its review and  announces a new Grants.gov governance framework.", "As a preliminary, high-level concept document, it is understandable that  the proposal does not flesh out details as to how the framework would be  implemented, but it lacks even a high-level overview of several critical  elements. For example, while the proposal appears to clarify the roles of  the GEB and PMO, and provide structure for their interaction it does not  address the role of the managing partner CIO\u2014a critical entity in  managing the Grants.gov system as an IT system\u2014nor the relationship  between the CIO and the new governance bodies.  Importantly, the  proposed governance framework does not appear to address the  challenges that emerge when different entities are responsible for  approving system funding and system requirements, as is currently the  case with Grants.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Grants.gov system has faced funding and governance challenges that  have adversely affected Grants.gov operations. HHS and OMB have  worked diligently to manage and mitigate these issues in the short run.  However, concerns about Grants.gov\u2019s funding calculation and governance  persist, and some partner agencies also maintain their own, potentially  duplicative grants management systems\u2014contrary to the streamlining and  cost-saving intent behind Grants.gov and the federal grants streamlining  legislation on which it is based. OMB and the Grants.gov governance  entities continue to consider longer-term improvements to Grants.gov\u2014 such as potentially consolidating the separate grants and contracts  application systems and implementing a new advisory body for  governmentwide grants initiatives. While we recognize that the Grants.gov  PMO\u2019s ability to address governance issues is somewhat limited until OMB  completes its review of the proposed governance framework, we believe  that the time is ripe to reconsider whether a number of factors\u2014the  package of activity costs charged to users, how those costs are distributed  among users, and the PMO\u2019s strategies for managing persistent collection  delays\u2014will help or hinder Public Law 106-107\u2019s goals of simplifying and  streamlining grant administration. It is also an opportune time for  Grants.gov to consider whether there are lessons to be learned from  similar legacy E-Gov systems that could inform improvements in these  areas.", "Grants.gov has taken steps to move closer to a fee-for-service funding  model. However, three significant issues remain. First, the current method  of distributing costs among partner agencies results in agencies that use  Grants.gov to similar degrees paying vastly different amounts for service;  second, the contribution calculation does not account for the development  and maintenance of grant application forms\u2014a reportedly growing cost  for the PMO. Third, the Grants.gov PMO does not report costs by key  program activities to its partner agencies, and it does not track or report  on costs attributable to each partner agency. As such, agencies\u2019 payments  for Grants.gov\u2019s services may be misaligned with the costs they impose on  the system. The importance of analyzing and understanding system costs  is not limited to Grants.gov; it will also be a critical issue for GSA\u2019s Federal  Opportunities system so that GSA, partner agencies, and Congress have  the best possible information available to them when considering how\u2014 and at what level\u2014to fund the new system. Absent a well-designed  funding mechanism, Federal Opportunities runs the risk of the same kind  of funding challenges currently facing Grants.gov.", "Grants.gov continues to suffer from untimely agency contributions and the  PMO continues to report this issue as a serious threat to its continuing  operations. This issue is not unique to Grants.gov. However, while  Grants.gov and other E-Gov managing partners employ some of the same  risk management strategies to mitigate the effects of delayed funding,  some take mitigating steps by: (1) depositing partner fees/contributions  into multiyear appropriation accounts and (2) receiving funds from their  managing partners before partner agency contributions are made available  for use. We believe that, to the extent that they are available to Grants.gov,  these strategies could significantly improve Grants.gov\u2019s cash flow and  allow for more efficient operations in the earlier part of each fiscal year.", "Although a proposal to restructure federal grants management systems  remains under OMB review we believe that HHS can take interim steps to  address immediate Grants.gov governance and performance issues.  Although HHS has taken important steps to gather information on  potential performance measures, more needs to be done. Grants.gov\u2019s  performance measures remain in draft form; the Grants.gov strategic plan  does not include specific performance goals and information on current or  planned initiatives, and the Grants.gov PMO does not communicate key  system performance information to partner agencies. Absent full  implementation of these initiatives information gaps about the health of  the Grants.gov system will persist. However, collecting performance  information is not enough; unless this information is made available to  stakeholders and used to inform decision making, the Grants.gov  governance entities will lack a valuable management tool for developing  strategies to better achieve results.", "Lastly, we continue to believe in the value of knowledge-sharing between  Grants.gov and similar legacy E-Gov initiatives.
