The Group of 24 (G-24) countries committed approximately $26.8 billion in bilateral assistance to Poland and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) committed about $8.9 billion.

Donor coordination is generally handled by the Polish government\u2019s Council of Ministers\u2019 Foreign Aid Office. However, donors often bypass this office and deal directly with the relevant ministries, or rely on organizations outside the government of Poland to implement their programs.

However, this approach changed in 1993 as USAID devolved many of the management responsibilities to the field at the direction of Congress. The USAID/Poland representative said that he now has an understanding with USAID/Washington that no projects will be initiated in Washington without the field office\u2019s concurrence. The USAID representative also said that he has requested control over all contracts and work orders, indicating that this oversight and control was necessary to coordinate and develop strategic plans for future work in Poland.", "As shown in figure 1.1, the majority of U.S. assistance to Poland has been devoted to economic restructuring and assisting in Poland\u2019s transformation to a market-based economy. The remainder of the funds have been obligated to support democratic initiatives and quality of life issues.

The Polish government took a wide range of actions to encourage stabilization, including tightening fiscal and monetary policy, liberalizing prices, devaluing the currency, and controlling the growth of debt. Western donors provided important support for such reforms and the United States played a key role in initiating these forms of assistance. Poland\u2019s economy is now experiencing healthy growth."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early Polish Stabilization Measures Created Basis for Market Economy", "paragraphs": ["In October 1989, the Polish government began implementing macroeconomic stabilization and liberalization measures, and accelerated the reform movement in January 1990. Subsidies to industry and households, for example, food subsidies, were sharply cut. Public investment spending was substantially reduced. Money growth was tightly controlled; the zloty was sharply devalued and made convertible. Wage growth was controlled with an excess wage tax designed to limit the rate of increase in the wage bills of state enterprises. Prices were liberalized, bringing about a one-time jump in the price level corresponding to the reduction in the real value of the zloty. Additional liberalization measures included the establishment of a free-trade regime and liberalization of legal requirements for setting up private enterprises.", "Together, these efforts gave Poland the basic operating features of a market economy and were widely considered to be essential first steps toward overall economic restructuring. The stabilization measures decreased inflationary pressures, lowered government expenditures, and improved the balance of payments. However, these measures also contributed to declines in economic output and corresponding growth in unemployment. The liberalization measures freed most of the domestic price system, allowed for corrections in the relative prices of goods still under state control, removed the state from large-scale detailed direction of the economy, and provided an environment conducive to the growth of a new private sector.", "Some benefits resulted from important linkages between specific measures. For example, Poland\u2019s liberalization of trade subjected the state sector to foreign competition. Such competition provided international relative prices that the previous monopolistic Polish firms would not have offered, thus enabling the government to liberalize prices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Donors Provided Important Support for Polish Measures", "paragraphs": ["Western support for early Polish stabilization measures is cited by Polish and donor officials as among the most significant assistance provided to Poland. For example, the Director of Poland\u2019s Bureau for Foreign Assistance asserted that some of the most important assistance efforts to date involved donor support for early Polish macroeconomic stabilization actions in the form of the stabilization fund, balance of payments support, and debt restructuring and forgiveness. The IMF\u2019s senior resident representative in Poland said that these forms of assistance were timely and critical to Polish macroeconomic stabilization efforts.", "The United States took the initiative in 1989 to mobilize $1 billion from the international community for a Polish Stabilization Fund to (1) support a relatively fixed exchange rate for the zloty after sharp devaluation and (2) help ensure that the zloty was convertible for current account transactions by creating additional foreign exchange reserves. Poland\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were further bolstered by a $700 million standby arrangement with the IMF. This balance of payments support helped allow Polish authorities to introduce in January 1990 a convertible and stable exchange rate, and the additional backing for the zloty made defense of the currency more credible.", "Another important form of early assistance to Poland was temporary cash flow relief from external indebtedness. To increase the chances of successful stabilization, some believed it was important that debt service payments be minimized in the early stages of transition. Poland\u2019s external debt in convertible currencies at the end of 1990 was about $44 billion. An estimated $33 billion was owed to official bilateral creditors, referred to as the Paris Club, and $10.7 billion, including $1.2 billion of short-term revolving credit, was owed to Western commercial banks, known as the London Club. Poland\u2019s gross debt service in 1990 was about $9 billion, or about 80 percent of its convertible currency merchandise export earnings.", "In March 1991, under U.S. leadership, the members of the Paris Club agreed to forgive 50 percent of Poland\u2019s official debt. In the first stage, which was contingent on Poland\u2019s signing an agreement with the IMF to restructure its economy, the official debt was reduced by 30 percent. In the second stage, which was contingent upon Poland\u2019s fulfillment of the terms of the IMF agreement, an additional 20-percent reduction was authorized in April 1994. As part of the initial 30-percent reduction, annual interest payments during the first 3 years were reduced by 80 percent. Principal payments were also limited to less than $600 million annually. For its part in the agreement, the United States agreed to forgive  70 percent of its bilateral debt with Poland, 50 percent in the first stage, and 20 percent in the second, which reduced Polish debt to the  U.S. government from $3.4 billion to about $1 billion.", "Under the Paris Club agreement, Poland also committed to seeking from the London Club of commercial banks a debt reorganization on terms comparable to the Paris Club, allowing Poland to cease servicing this debt in the interim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poland\u2019s Economy Is Experiencing Healthy Growth", "paragraphs": ["After suffering substantial declines in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first 2 years of transition, Poland now leads post-communist Europe in economic growth.

Although Polish exports increased in 1994, Poland continues to run a large trade deficit with the EU. Despite the importance of Poland\u2019s trade with the EU, West European trade barriers continue to hinder Polish exports of certain products to that market, thereby hampering restructuring efforts.

In addition to increased imports resulting from opening up its own markets to Western products, Poland achieved dramatic increases in exports to the West, beginning in 1990. As Poland entered the initial stages of reform, exports to the industrialized market economies were essential to preventing even larger declines in output than had already occurred as a result of the collapse of trade with former CMEA countries and the drop in Poland\u2019s internal demand. According to OECD, access to the more stable OECD area markets is vital for Poland\u2019s continued economic growth and political stability. The ECE has reported that increased access to Western markets can also act as a powerful stimulant to foreign investment seeking an eastern base for exporting.", "Of the OECD area markets, the large and geographically close EU market represents Poland\u2019s most important trade partner. For example, in 1994, about 53 percent of Poland\u2019s exports and 54 percent of its imports consisted of trade with the EU. Though the United States represents a potential market for Polish products, it accounts for only 2 to 4 percent of Poland\u2019s trade.

Although a Central European Free Trade Area (CEFTA) agreement was negotiated among Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, and Hungary and went into effect in March 1993, the ECE reported that the significance of the agreement has been downplayed within the CEFTA countries and that few steps have been taken to promote these trade links. OECD officials echoed that sentiment, explaining that while eastern markets could be very important to Poland in the future, Polish companies engaging in restructuring currently do not have enough \u201cmargin for error\u201d to emphasize dealings in countries with small markets and little ability to pay for products."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Deficit With the EU", "paragraphs": ["Although Polish exports increased in 1994 to over $17 billion, Poland continues to run a large trade deficit with the West, primarily the EU.

Major improvement in Poland\u2019s access to agricultural markets in the EU is not expected soon.Further, Polish officials maintain that the EU continues to limit access to its markets through contingent protective measures such as anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, and safeguard actions.", "The Association Agreement is considered a precursor to Poland\u2019s eventual membership in the EU, and a key feature is the gradual elimination of tariffs over a 10-year period, leading to a free trade area between the EU and Poland. The agreement is considered to be asymmetric in that the EU is required to grant immediate duty free access on many goods, while Poland has a longer period of time to grant full reciprocity.", "The Association Agreement also provides for immediate elimination of quantitative restrictions on many industrial products, with the exception of textiles, coal and steel, which are accorded special treatment as \u201csensitive products.\u201d Tariff reductions and phase-out of quantitative restrictions for these sensitive products will take place more gradually.Customs duties levied on exports are also slated for eventual elimination. While the agreement provides for limited trade preference for selected agricultural products over 5 years, in many cases, tariffs and tariff rate quotas will remain in place at the end of the phase-in period, with the agreement merely calling for the parties to consult on the possibility of granting further concessions.", "According to a report published by the IMF, the EU decided in 1993 to further improve market access for Poland and other CEFTA countries in response to criticism that, under the Association Agreement, the EU was delaying access to those markets in which CEFTA countries have the highest export potential. The IMF and ECE reported that this EU decision (1) accelerated by 2 years the scheduled reduction of EU customs duties on certain imports of sensitive basic industrial products, (2) increased by 10 percentage points the annual expansion in quotas and ceilings for certain industrial products, (3) implemented 6 months earlier than scheduled a reduction in levies/duties on certain agricultural products subject to quotas, and (4) began exempting from customs duties outward processing operations in 1994. The IMF report indicated that the most important remaining restrictions appeared to be quotas on textiles, nontariff barriers on agricultural products, and the threat of resorting to safeguard provisions or anti-dumping actions.", "Under the Association Agreement, tariffs existing in the EU and Poland as of February 29, 1992, served as the base from which reductions were to occur. Reduced tariff levels agreed to in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round replace these tariffs as the base once such reductions go into effect. Certain trade liberalization clauses in the Association Agreement are contingent on agreements reached in the Uruguay Round. For example, the ECE reported that, for textiles and clothing, the agreement provides for the elimination of EU quotas on imports from Poland over a period equaling half of that agreed to in the Uruguay Round, but not less than 5 years.", "Poland was a member of GATT before undertaking economic reforms; however, it was required to accept special terms reflecting the state-controlled nature of its economy. According to a Polish official, Poland is now renegotiating its terms of accession with GATT to reflect its economic reforms, and the country became a founding member of the new World Trade Organization, an outcome of the Uruguay Round agreements, on July 1, 1995.", "Under the Association Agreement, anti-dumping actions and other contingent protective measures are permitted in accordance with GATT articles. The EU no longer includes Poland in its list of state-trading economies for purposes of determining \u201cnormal prices\u201d in anti-dumping actions, but the ECE has reported that a country\u2019s classification as a market economy does not necessarily imply that it will be subject to fewer actions.", "On the other hand, the ECE reported that transition countries such as Poland will benefit from a Uruguay Round strengthening and extension of GATT rules and authority, especially if this leads to stricter control of anti-dumping procedures and contingent protective measures. A recent and as yet unpublished OECD study reported that the Uruguay Round agreement should bring more clarity and certainty regarding the initiation of anti-dumping actions. However, another recent, unpublished OECD study reported that how the new rules are implemented will determine their actual impact and that Uruguay Round results will probably make only modest changes to the way anti-dumping regulations are applied to transition economies such as Poland\u2019s. The report also said that less stringent conditions on safeguards may cause sufferers of import competition to choose this method of protection rather than an anti-dumping investigation.", "Polish government and ECE officials told us that Poland\u2019s membership in the World Trade Organization will help the country become more fully integrated into the world economy. Poland\u2019s representative for GATT issues at the Polish Mission in Geneva said that Poland hoped to benefit from the Uruguay Round and membership in the World Trade Organization in that it would help the country consolidate its own reforms in trade-related management and systems, rendering such systems more stable, predictable, and coherent. An ECE official added that this development means that Poland is becoming more fully grounded in the market system, making it more difficult to backtrack on market reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers Hamper Restructuring Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Directors of Poland\u2019s Bureau for European Integration and Bureau for Foreign Assistance, the Director of the Trade Instruments Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and the Economic and Commercial Counselors of the Polish Embassy in London told us that they support the EU-Poland Association Agreement. However, they maintained that the EU continues to limit Polish access to its markets through contingent protective measures (anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, and safeguard actions) or the threat of such measures. These officials said that when Poland proves to be competitive in a particular area, these barriers often come into play. The ECE reported that imports of certain sensitive eastern goods generated complaints in West European countries that culminated in a number of import restrictions. The result was that while standard measures of protection (such as tariffs and quotas) diminished, contingent protection measures were used more frequently. They also reported that a steady stream of warnings in addition to official actions may result in eastern exporters making voluntary reductions in the growth of sales to reduce the probability of formal complaints being lodged. Table 3.3 lists EU protectionist measures against Polish imports between July 1992 and December 1993, as reported by the IMF.", "As earlier noted, Polish exports to the EU grew substantially in recent years. (See table 3.1.) For example, between 1990 and 1993, Poland\u2019s total exports to the EU increased at an annually compounded rate of  11.5 percent. However, for the selected commodities that were targeted by the EU contingent protective measures listed in table 3.3, Poland\u2019s exports to the EU declined at an average annual rate of 8.1 percent during the same period. In 1990, these exports, valued at $429 million, accounted for 6.5 percent of Poland\u2019s total exports to the EU. By 1993, the value of these exports had declined to $334 million, or 3.6 percent of Poland\u2019s total exports to the EU. These data indicate that although EU protectionist measures did not prevent Poland from expanding its total exports to the EU, such measures did have an adverse impact on Polish exports of the targeted products.", "According to the Director of Poland\u2019s Bureau for European Integration, one of the most unfair examples of contingent protection measures involves the filing of anti-dumping cases. A study prepared for the OECD found that although EU authorities had agreed to speed up tariff reductions and enlarge zero-duty ceilings and quotas for some sensitive goods, EU anti-dumping investigations had the effect of minimizing these actions.The above-mentioned Polish official and the Economic and Commercial Counselors of the Polish Embassy in London said that the idea that Polish companies can afford to engage in predatory dumping on the EU markets is not logical.", "Another example of contingent measures involves the use of EU health and sanitation standards to restrict Polish agricultural exports. OECD officials told us that some EU countries abuse these standards to protect their own industries, while technically complying with GATT rules. For example, in May 1993 the EU imposed a 1-month ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk, and dairy products from across Eastern Europe for sanitary reasons. The OECD reported that, although EU officials portrayed the action as an urgent health measure, Polish and other East European officials described it as a protectionist measure. The Director of Poland\u2019s Bureau for Foreign Assistance told us that his government had estimated Poland\u2019s losses related to the temporary ban at $60 to $80 million. The ECE quotes reported estimates of Poland\u2019s losses related to the ban at closer to $30 million.", "Polish officials pointed out that now, when Poland is engaging in the painful aspects of economic restructuring, the country is in need of export markets. Limited market access could necessitate extremely disruptive scaling down, which may be of a magnitude greater than necessary in some industries. Such disruption makes it more difficult for Polish politicians to maintain support for reforms. Polish officials added that barriers such as anti-dumping mechanisms are being employed by the EU in areas where Poland is undergoing some of the deepest and most disruptive economic restructuring. Polish officials noted the irony in the fact that it is necessary to use EU technical assistance to obtain advice on how to shrink Polish industries that have been negatively affected by EU trade barriers.", "Another problem with barriers to Polish exports is that it makes it difficult for Polish politicians to resist demands for increased Polish protectionism. Polish officials told us that recently the government of Poland has paid increased attention to calls for protecting certain of its own markets. Indeed, the IMF reported that, in 1992, Poland raised duties on a variety of products and that, in 1993, Poland further revised its tariff structure, lowering duties on imported raw materials and semi-finished products and increasing it on finished products and agricultural goods.

In the process, the portfolios of the state-owned commercial banks were improved, and the banks were recapitalized in preparation for privatization. In September 1993, the Polish government recapitalized these banks using special government restructuring bonds.

While Poland continues to face a number of impediments to its restructuring efforts, the country has made significant progress toward economic restructuring in key areas such as macroeconomic stabilization, foreign trade and investment, privatization, and banking. The United States and other donors have actively supported Poland in its transition efforts, although this assistance has been more useful in some areas than in others.", "After 5 years of reforms, Poland\u2019s experience in transitioning to a market-oriented system offers some lessons that could be of interest to countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and others not as far along the reform path as Poland. Because there are tremendous differences among transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as to the size of their economies and populations, their political situations, their ethnic compositions, and a host of other variables, the lessons of Poland have differing applicability to each of the other transition countries. Nevertheless, there are a number of lessons learned from Poland\u2019s restructuring efforts in several key areas that, at a minimum, merit consideration by the other transition countries and those involved in assisting these countries.", "Two such lessons involve Poland\u2019s early efforts to stabilize and liberalize its economy. The first is that Poland\u2019s own efforts in coupling tough reform measures with consistent macroeconomic policy over several years were critical to the country\u2019s current economic recovery. The second is that some of the most important forms of donor assistance provided in support of Poland\u2019s transition were those that backed Poland\u2019s early macroeconomic stabilization and liberalization measures. The Polish government took a wide range of actions, including cutting subsidies to industry and households, tightening monetary policy, devaluing the currency, liberalizing prices, establishing a free-trade regime, and liberalizing the legal requirements for setting up private enterprises. Donors supported these measures in the form of the Polish Stabilization Fund, balance of payments support, and debt restructuring and forgiveness. By creating the basic operating features of a market economy, Poland effectively set the stage for further economic restructuring and integration into the world economy. The country is now experiencing healthy economic growth.", "While Poland\u2019s economy is currently among the fastest growing in Europe, the country\u2019s continued economic growth and integration into the world economy is widely considered to depend at least in part upon increased foreign trade and investment. Some of the most important factors for improvement in these areas require Polish or donor government actions beyond the confines of assistance. Poland has achieved dramatic increases in its exports to the West, and a number of U.S. and other foreign companies have recently made significant investments in the country. However, Poland continues to run a large trade deficit, trade barriers hamper its exports of certain products to the EU, and a number of obstacles continue to impede foreign investment. Some of the most persistent investment impediments, such as bureaucratic and tax uncertainties, demand the attention of the Polish government rather than of donors. On the other hand, further reducing EU trade barriers could help Poland increase its exports, diminish its trade deficit with the EU, and earn additional foreign exchange for further restructuring.", "In addition to its long-term importance for economic growth, foreign trade had a more immediate bearing on the success of early reform measures, and early liberalization of foreign trade played a critical role in helping state-owned enterprises adapt to market conditions. Poland liberalized foreign trade regimes as an element of the country\u2019s early stabilization and liberalization measures. By doing so, Poland subjected its state sector to foreign competition and provided international relative prices that monopolistic Polish firms would not have offered in an environment of liberalized prices. The opening of the economy to international competition, the removal of state subsidies, and the discontinuance of central bank soft money policies encouraged some state-owned enterprises to become more cost conscious and search out market opportunities.", "Poland\u2019s experience in creating market conditions suggests another important lesson\u2014that encouraging the early development of a dynamic private sector is at least as important as the timing for undertaking large-scale privatization. While the pace of privatization for Poland\u2019s larger state-owned enterprises has been slower than expected, this slow progress has been offset by the success of the country\u2019s private sector. Poland\u2019s early measures to remove the state from large-scale detailed direction of the economy and to provide an environment conducive to private sector development resulted in a rapidly growing private sector. Many new businesses have emerged and a large number of small- and medium-sized retail businesses have been privatized. Poland\u2019s private sector is now the primary source of the country\u2019s economic growth and a substantial base of Polish employment.", "Notwithstanding the success of Poland\u2019s private sector, significant portions of Polish productive capacity and employment remain in the hands of the government. Some are concerned that without the certainty of the eventual privatization of larger state-owned enterprises, such firms might not continue restructuring but instead might lobby the government to reinstate subsidies. Donors have actively supported Poland\u2019 efforts to restructure enterprises and implement the country\u2019s Mass Privatization Program despite waning public and governmental support. However, donors are concerned about continued delays in implementing the program. If the Polish government fails to follow through on its promise to move forward on the Mass Privatization Program in 1995, donor support for the program may erode.", "Poland\u2019s experience in restructuring its banking sector offers some additional lessons. Although several major problems remain in this area, the country\u2019s banking sector has undergone fundamental changes since the beginning of reforms in 1989. Nevertheless, even when faced with hard budget contraints and other market reforms that included curtailed government-to-industry subsidies, many state-owned enterprises were able to circumvent the constraints and continue financing loss-making operations through their relationships with state-owned banks. When the profitability of state-owned firms deteriorated following the collapse of Poland\u2019s trade with its former CMEA partners, many such firms relied increasingly on debt to finance operations while their ability to service such debt diminished. The state-owned banks reacted by continuing to lend, rolling over credits, and in many cases capitalizing unpaid interest, contributing to a high percentage of problem loans and technical insolvency.", "Poland\u2019s experience in restructuring its banking sector shows that donors were able to play a useful role in supporting the country\u2019s reform efforts in this area. Multilateral and bilateral donors provided strong support for Polish efforts to recapitalize and restructure the problem loan portfolios of state-owned banks, and considerable progress has been made under this plan. In addition to recapitalizing the banks, the program has contributed to the restructuring of many of the indebted state-owned enterprises. Donor technical assistance has also been useful in the banking sector.", "Although a great deal of economic restructuring remains to be done in Poland, the country has made impressive progress toward the goal of transforming its economy into a full-fledged, market-oriented system. Poland\u2019s task would certainly have been more difficult without donor support in certain key areas; however, donor assistance is not a guarantee of success. Without Poland\u2019s consistent commitment to reforms, its determination to take early and decisive reform actions, and its persistence in building the basic institutions and legal infrastructure required for a functioning market economy, the country\u2019s progress could not have been as substantial. Poland\u2019s experience suggests that the ultimate success or failure of reform efforts is far more dependent upon the actions of the transition country than it is upon those of outside participants."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
