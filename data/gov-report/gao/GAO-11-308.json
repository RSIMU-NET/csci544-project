As part of its audit of IRS's fiscal years 2010 and 2009 financial statements, GAO assessed whether controls over key financial and tax processing systems are effective in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. To do this, GAO examined IRS information security policies, plans, and procedures; tested controls over key financial applications; and interviewed key agency officials at four sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS made progress in correcting previously reported information security weaknesses, control weaknesses over key financial and tax processing systems continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. Specifically, IRS did not consistently implement controls that were intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to its financial systems and information. For example, the agency did not sufficiently (1) restrict users' access to databases to only the access needed to perform their jobs; (2) secure the system it uses to support and manage its computer access request, approval, and review processes; (3) update database software residing on servers that support its general ledger system; and (4) enable certain auditing features on databases supporting several key systems. In addition, 65 of 88--about 74 percent--of previously reported weaknesses remain unresolved or unmitigated. An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that IRS has not yet fully implemented key components of its comprehensive information security program. Although IRS has processes in place intended to monitor and assess its internal controls, these processes were not always effective. For example, IRS's testing did not detect many of the vulnerabilities GAO identified during this audit and did not assess a key application in its current environment. Further, the agency had not effectively validated corrective actions reported to resolve previously identified weaknesses. Although IRS had a process in place for verifying whether each weakness had been corrected, this process was not always working as intended. For example, the agency reported that it had resolved 39 of the 88 previously identified weaknesses; however, 16 of the 39 weaknesses had not been mitigated. IRS has various initiatives underway to bolster security over its networks and systems; however, until the agency corrects the identified weaknesses, its financial systems and information remain unnecessarily vulnerable to insider threats, including errors or mistakes and fraudulent or malevolent acts by insiders. As a result, financial and taxpayer information are at increased risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction; financial data is at increased risk of errors that result in misstatement; and the agency's management decisions may be based on unreliable or inaccurate financial information. These weaknesses, considered collectively, are the basis for GAO's determination that IRS had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to information security in fiscal year 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS take eight actions to fully implement key components of its comprehensive information security program.

The risk to these systems are well-founded for a number of  reasons, including the increase in reports of security incidents, the ease of  obtaining and using hacking tools, and steady advances in the  sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology. The Federal Bureau  of Investigation has identified multiple sources of threats, including  foreign entities engaged in intelligence gathering and information warfare,  domestic criminals, hackers, virus writers, and disgruntled employees or  contractors working within an organization. In addition, the U.S. Secret  Service and the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center studied insider threats in the  government sector and stated in a January 2008 report that \u201cgovernment  sector insiders have the potential to pose a substantial threat by virtue of  their knowledge of, and access to, employer systems and/or databases.\u201d  Insider threats include errors or mistakes and fraudulent or malevolent  acts by insiders.", "Our previous reports, and those by federal inspectors general, describe  persistent information security weaknesses that place federal agencies,  including IRS, at risk of disruption, fraud, or inappropriate disclosure of  sensitive information.

The term internal control is synonymous with the  term management control, which covers all aspects of an agency\u2019s  operations (programmatic, financial, and compliance). The attitude and  philosophy of management toward information systems can have a  profound effect on internal control. Information system controls consist of  those internal controls that are dependent on information systems  processing and include general controls at the entitywide, system, and  business process application levels (security management, access  controls, configuration management, segregation of duties, and  contingency planning); business process application controls (input,  processing, output, master file, interface, and data management system  controls); and user controls (controls performed by people interacting  with information systems).", "Recognizing the importance of securing federal agencies\u2019 information  systems, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) in December 2002 to strengthen the security of information  and systems within federal agencies.
