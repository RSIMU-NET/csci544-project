The Air Force plans to begin initial operational test and evaluation in March 2004 and to seek full rate production approval in December 2004. The F/A-22 program has experienced several significant changes since it began development in 1986. First, the Air Force cannot afford to purchase the quantities of aircraft that were planned 18 years ago. The Air Force had originally planned to buy 750 aircraft, but it now estimates it can only afford 218 aircraft. Second, in order to develop the expanded air-to-ground attack capability, the Office of Secretary of Defense estimates that the Air Force will need $11.7 billion in modernization funding. Lastly, the Air Force has determined that new avionics computer processors and architecture are needed to support most planned enhancements, which will further increase program costs and risk. Further, the development test program continues to experience problems and risks further delays. The F/A-22's avionics continue to experience shutdowns and failures. Moreover, the F/A-22 has not met its reliability requirements and has experienced failures in its computerized maintenance support system. This has led to aircraft spending more time on the ground undergoing maintenance. Due to the risks of future cost increases and schedule delays, a congressional subcommittee requested that DOD provide business case information on the F/A-22. However, the information DOD provided did not address why this aircraft is needed given current and projected threats. The business case also did not address how many aircraft the Air Force needs to accomplish its missions, how many the Air Force can afford considering the full life-cycle costs, whether investments in new air-to-ground capabilities are needed, and what are the opportunity costs associated with purchasing any proposed quantities of this aircraft. While the response stated that the Air Force still plans to buy 277 F/A-22 aircraft, the Air Force estimates that only 218 aircraft are affordable within congressionally imposed funding limitations. In addition, significant investment decisions remain and could affect another $40 billion to support this program through full rate production and implementation of the spiraled improvement efforts. In light of the uncertainty concerning how many aircraft are needed in today's environment, the large investments that remain, and unknown outcomes of planned operational testing, GAO continues to have concerns regarding the DOD's readiness to make a full rate production decision."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force is developing the F/A-22 aircraft to be an air superiority and  ground attack aircraft with advanced features to make it less detectable to  adversaries, capable of high speeds for long ranges, and able to provide a  pilot with improved awareness of the surrounding situation.

Leading  commercial firms that we studied employ an acquisition approach that  evolves a product to its ultimate capabilities on the basis of mature  technologies and available resources. Further, product enhancements are  planned for subsequent development efforts only when technologies are  proven to be mature and other resources are available. Our work has  shown that commercial firms ensure that high levels of knowledge exist  at three critical junctures in a development program. First, a match  must be made between a customer\u2019s needs and the available resources\u2014 technology, engineering knowledge, time, and funding\u2014before a new  development program is launched. Second, a product\u2019s design must  demonstrate its ability to meet performance requirements and be stable  about midway through development. Third, the developer must show that  the product can be manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets  and is demonstrated to be reliable before production begins.", "In contrast, the F-22 acquisition strategy from the outset was to achieve  full capability in a \u201cbig bang\u201d approach instead of evolving development in  manageable increments of new capability. By not using an evolutionary  approach, the Air Force took on significant risk and onerous technology  challenges. The three critical technologies that were immature at the  start of the program included low-observable materials, propulsion,  and integrated avionics. Integrated avionics has been a source of major  schedule delays and cost increases in the F/A-22 program. Starting the  program with these immature technologies prevented the program from  knowing cost, schedule, and performance ramifications until late in the  development program, after significant investments had already been  made. Efforts to mature technology cascaded into development, delaying  attainment of design and production maturity. The overall result has been  significant delays and substantially higher investments to buy over  60 percent fewer aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Investments Needed to Expand F/A-22 Capability", "paragraphs": ["Developing an expanded air-to-ground attack capability for the F/A-22 will  be costly and add risk to the program. The Air Force began development  of the F/A-22 as a replacement for the F-15 air superiority fighter with  primary emphasis on the air-to-air role. It was never intended to have  robust air-to-ground capability. Its need was based on a projection that  the Soviet Union would develop and produce large numbers of advanced  fighter aircraft. The F/A-22 was intended to identify, track, and kill  advanced fighters before it was targeted, giving it the edge and making it  a more lethal and survivable aircraft than an F-15. However, the original  Soviet threat never materialized. To enhance the utility of the F/A-22, the  Air Force plans to develop a robust air-to-ground attack capability to be  able to engage a greater variety of ground targets, such as surface-to-air  missile systems, that have posed a significant threat to U.S. aircraft in  recent years.", "The Air Force has a modernization program to improve the capabilities of  the F/A-22 focused largely on a new robust air-to-ground capability.

Current processors are old and obsolete, cannot be supported, and do not  have sufficient capacity to meet the increased processing demands  required for planned new air-to-ground capabilities beyond Global Strike  Enhanced. As a bridge to meet this expanded capability, the Air Force  plans to modify some avionics processors and purchase sufficient  quantities to support production of the first 155 F/A-22 aircraft.", "The F/A-22 is dependent on its onboard computers and software to  perform its mission. Unlike other fighter aircraft, it has a highly advanced,  integrated avionics system capable of detecting, identifying, and engaging  the enemy at ranges beyond a pilot\u2019s vision. The key to the F/A-22 avionics  lies in its fully integrated core architecture and its two central, networked  computers called common integrated processors (CIP). CIPs use very  high-speed integrated circuits to collect, process, and integrate data and  signals from the aircraft\u2019s sensors. CIP serves as the \u201cbrains\u201d for the  F/A-22\u2019s integrated avionics system and is unique to this aircraft.", "The primary processor in CIP is the Intel i960MX microprocessor, which  is used strictly for avionics processing. This microprocessor is based on  1990\u2019s technology and has a 32-bit processor that operates at speeds of  25mhz. By today\u2019s technology standards, the processor is considered  obsolete and cannot support spiral developments beyond the Global Strike  Enhanced. In mid-2003, the manufacturer of the microprocessor informed  the Air Force that it planned to permanently shut down the i960MX  production line by January 2004 because the microprocessor was no  longer a viable product for the company.", "As a result, the Air Force decided in November 2003 to replace its  computer architecture and avionics processors to support the F/A-22\u2019s  expanded capabilities. In December 2003, the Air Force purchased its last  i960MX microprocessors when it bought 820 of the microprocessors.  According to program officials, this quantity and previously purchased  quantities are sufficient to support production of 155 F/A-22 aircraft. These  officials believe that with some minor upgrades to improve processing  capacity, these processors will be able to support the baseline aircraft  and the developmental spirals\u2014Global Strike Basic and Global Strike  Enhanced.

Rather than start a new  development program, the program office plans to leverage two other  ongoing Air Force development or modification programs for this  processing capability: the new architecture being developed for the F-35  and the new commercial off-the-shelf general-purpose processors  designed for newer versions of the F-16. According to F/A-22 program  officials, this new architecture will be state-of-the-art and will have ample  processing capacity to accommodate all future air-to-ground capabilities  as currently planned. These officials do not expect the new architecture to  be fully developed and ready for installation in the F/A-22 for at least 5 to  6 years.", "F/A-22 program officials acknowledge that this mass changeover of  the F/A-22 computer architecture and avionics processor will be a  time-consuming and costly effort and will likely create additional program  risks. Air Force cost estimates are not yet available. Nevertheless, program  officials estimate the nonrecurring engineering costs alone could be at  least $300 million. At the time of our review, the Air Force had not made  a decision about retrofitting aircraft equipped with the i960MX  microprocessor. Additional risks are likely because the new processor and  architecture are being developed by other major aircraft programs and will  require extensive integration and operational testing to ensure that the  F/A-22 program does not encounter similar problems that have delayed  integration and testing of the F/A-22\u2019s current avionics suite."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Remaining Development and Operational Testing Could Impact F/A-22 Program Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The F/A-22 program did not meet key testing goals established for fiscal  year 2003 and required for the aircraft to begin IOT&E testing.

As a result, the Air Force  Operational Test and Evaluation Center wanted assurances that the  avionics would work before it was willing to start the IOT&E program. It  established a requirement for a 20-hour performance metric that was to be  demonstrated before IOT&E would begin. The metric was Mean Time  Between Instability Events (MTBIE) and tracked two distinct types of  avionics software failures:    Hard failures (type 1) that were the most serious resulting in a complete  avionics system shutdown requiring the need to restart the avionics  system.", "Significant failures (type 2) that were less serious failures but required the  pilot to restart an individual subsystem that failed versus the complete  avionics system.", "Using personal computers as an analogy, a type 1 failure would be  equivalent to a failure of one\u2019s personal computer that requires it to be  shut down and rebooted, except that the time to restart the F/A-22  avionics system could take substantially longer. A type 2 failure would  be equivalent to a failure in a particular application, such as the word  processing program shutting down. Even with such a failure, other  software applications could still be operated while the word processing  software was restarted. Likewise, in the case of the F/A-22, other  applications would still be operable despite the failure of any single  application, such as a shutdown in the communication, navigation, and  identification system.", "In July 2003, the Air Force decided to switch to a different metric\u2014Mean  Time Between Avionics Anomaly (MTBAA)\u2014to measure the performance  of the avionics software for the start of IOT&E. Two main differences  between the new metric and its predecessor are the new metric  (1) includes hardware and some subsystem software failures not  previously counted and (2) requires a failure rate based on an average of  5 hours without experiencing avionics anomalies, instead of 20 hours.  According to Air Force operational test officials, they adopted this new  metric because they believe it is a better measure of the avionics  operational performance needed to start IOT&E, whereas the previous  metric was more technically focused on software performance, excluding  hardware failures. They also said the 5-hour criterion would provide a  minimum amount of effective operational test time to efficiently conduct  IOT&E. In turn, Congress included the new metric in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. Testing as of January 2004  showed the program had achieved 2.7 hours\u201454 percent of the  requirement. Once this criterion is achieved, the avionics must still  undergo rigorous operational testing to demonstrate its effectiveness and  suitability in a realistic environment. Figure 1 shows the status of the  MTBIE and MTBAA metrics.", "The figure shows that MTBIE, the previous criterion, was demonstrated  at about 67 percent of the requirement. In addition, the type 1 failures,  causing a complete shutdown of the avionics system, have significantly  diminished. They are occurring only about once every 25 hours on  average. This is the result of a substantial effort on the part of the  Air Force and the contractor to identify and fix problems that led to  the instability in the F/A-22 avionics software. Type 2 failures are still  occurring frequently. While less serious when compared to the entire  avionics suite shutting down, type 2 failures become serious if critical  subsystem software shuts down when its function is needed for the  success of the mission or survivability of the aircraft.", "In September 2003, the F/A-22 contractor reported a high number of  outstanding avionics Common Problem Reports. Of the 231 reports  of problems not resolved, about 25 (or 11 percent) were identified as  stability-related problems. The remaining 206 reports (89 percent) were  the result of avionics performance or functional problems. For example,  the communication, navigation, and identification subsystem accounted  for nearly 36 percent of the total reports. Because the avionics system is  essential to the success of the F/A-22, the integrated avionics still needs  to be demonstrated to meet design specifications and operational  requirements.

As a measure of the system\u2019s overall reliability,  the Air Force established a requirement for 1.95-hours mean time between  maintenance by the completion of development, and 3-hours mean time  between maintenance at system maturity. This measure of reliability  represents the average flight time between maintenance actions. As of  October 2003, the Air Force had only been able to demonstrate a reliability  of about 0.5 flying hours between maintenance actions or about 26 percent  of the development requirement and 17 percent of system maturity  requirement.

Commercial firms understand that once a system enters  production, the costs to achieve reliability through this iterative design  change process become significantly more expensive.

Tests will be  performed on the redesigned tail in late 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Did Not Provide Congress Sufficient Business Case Information to Justify Current Aircraft Quantities or Modernization Investment Plans", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not provided Congress with sufficient information to support the  business case for buying and modernizing the F/A-22 program. In our  testimony of April 11, 2003, before the Subcommittee on National Security,  Emerging Threats, and International Relations, House Committee on  Government Reform, we stressed that the issue was not whether the  F/A-22 should be produced, but rather in what quantities it is needed\u2014as  justified by a business case. We discussed the current and future  environments in which the F/A-22 investment decision would have to be  made, including the need to consider opportunity costs inside and outside  DOD. DOD has planned investments over the next several years, on  average $150 billion a year, to keep legacy systems working while at  the same time modernizing and transforming U.S. national defense  capabilities for the future. The F/A-22 program represents a sizable  investment and must compete with other demands within the defense  budget. This competition requires a knowledge-based approach to justify  acquisition investment decisions and an efficient acquisition process to  ensure programs are implemented within expectations set in associated  business cases.", "Since the start of the F/A-22 program, acquisition costs have increased,  the aircraft\u2019s mission and key capabilities have expanded, fewer quantities  are affordable, and delivery to the user has been delayed. The Air Force  currently estimates the total F/A-22 acquisition program will cost about  $72 billion, excluding all costs estimated to complete the spiral  improvement effort. Including these costs brings the estimated total  investment for the F/A-22 program to about $80 billion. Through fiscal year  2004, about one-half this investment has been funded.", "In light of the changes in the program and investments that remain, the  Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International  Relations, House Committee on Government Reform, asked DOD to  provide a business case justifying the Air Force\u2019s planned number of  F/A-22s (276 at that time) as well as how many F/A-22s are affordable. In  its response, DOD did not sufficiently address key business case questions  such as how many F/A-22s are needed, how many are affordable, and if  alternatives to planned investments increasing the F/A-22 air-to-ground  capabilities exist.", "Instead, DOD stated it planned to buy 277 F/A-22s based on a \u201cbuy to  budget\u201d concept that determines quantities on the availability and efficient  use of funds by the F/A-22 program office. Furthermore, justification for  expanding the capability, for an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion  investment, was not addressed in DOD\u2019s response. While ground targets  such as surface-to-air missile systems are acknowledged to be a significant  threat today, the business case did not establish a justification for this  investment or state what alternatives were considered. For example, the  F-35 aircraft is also expected to have an air-to-ground role as are planned  future unmanned combat air vehicles. These could be viable alternatives  to this additional investment in F/A-22 capability.", "While the business case information submitted to Congress called for  277 aircraft, DOD stated it could only afford to acquire between 216  and 218 aircraft within the congressionally imposed cap on production  costs\u2014currently at $36.8 billion. DOD expects improvements in  manufacturing efficiencies and other areas will provide it with sufficient  funds to buy additional F/A-22 aircraft. However, this seems to be an  unlikely scenario given the program\u2019s history. Under the \u201cbuy to budget\u201d  approach, the previous $876 million increase in development costs was  funded by taking funds mostly from production, thus reducing aircraft  quantities by 49. With testing still incomplete and many important  performance areas not yet demonstrated, the possibility for additional  increases in development costs is likely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While DOD and the Air Force are focused on completing IOT&E and  making a decision to go into full rate production, a more basic issue needs  to be addressed. The conditions driving the business case that spurred the  major investment decision to initially develop and buy 750 F-22 aircraft  have changed. A revised and comprehensive business case assessment has  not been completed and shared with congressional defense oversight  committees. At the present time, it is uncertain how many F/A-22s are  needed. The program has been in development for about 18 years, and  DOD has invested over $40 billion. This investment represents about one- half the estimated costs projected for the entire F/A-22 program.  Therefore, DOD must still make investment decisions affecting another  $40 billion to support this program through full rate production and  implementation of the spiraled modernization effort. Based on current  design problems and the development efforts that remain, the F/A-22  program\u2019s affordability is uncertain. Current conditions suggest the Air  Force cannot afford to buy much more than 218 aircraft within the cost  limitation imposed by Congress.", "In light of the uncertainty concerning how many aircraft are needed in  today\u2019s environment, the large investments that remain, and the unknown  outcomes of planned initial operational testing, we continue to be  concerned with DOD\u2019s readiness to address a December 2004 decision to  enter full rate production. Furthermore, IOT&E, intended to demonstrate  the F/A-22 effectiveness and suitability, has not started and may not be  completed as planned, which may delay the full rate production decision.

Specifically, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take  the following two actions:    Complete a new business case analysis that determines the continued  need for the F/A-22 and that specifically (a) addresses the need for an  expanded air-to-ground capability and an assessment of alternatives, to  include the feasibility of using other assets like the F-35 and unmanned  aerial vehicles planned for the future; (b) justifies the quantity of  F/A-22 aircraft needed to satisfy requirements for air-to-air and  air-to-ground missions; and (c) provides evidence that the planned  quantity is affordable within current budgets and the congressional  funding limitation. The Secretary should provide the results of the  business case analysis to the defense committees before the decision  to start full rate production.", "Before the full rate production decision is made and in conjunction with  the Beyond Low-Rate Initial Production Report, provide the defense  committees a plan that shows how the Air Force will correct and fund any  major problems identified and still open after IOT&E is completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it partially  concurred with our two recommendations. Regarding our first  recommendation on completing a new business case for the F/A-22, DOD  stated that it evaluates the F/A-22 business case elements as part of the  annual budget process. Additionally, DOD\u2019s response acknowledged that  this year the department is undertaking a broader set of reviews under the  Joint Capabilities Review process; the F/A-22 will be a part of this review.", "The President\u2019s budget submission to Congress will reflect the results of  these review efforts of the F/A-22 business case.", "We believe that the various reviews and assessments in the budget process  along with the Joint Capabilities Review process present excellent  opportunities for DOD to conduct a business case analysis. Other  opportunities for completing the business case analysis include the  independent and in-depth study requested by the Office of Management  and Budget for the Comanche and F/A-22 programs. It is important,  however, that the analysis sufficiently address the specific business case  elements included in our recommendation\u2014analysis of continued need,  need for expanded air-to-ground capability, assessment of alternatives,  justification of needed quantities, and evidence that planned quantities are  affordable. In addition, it is important that the outcomes of the business  case analysis are provided to the Congress prior to the full rate production  decision.", "Regarding our second recommendation on providing Congress the plans  to resolve outstanding problems after the completion of IOT&E, DOD  stated that the law already requires the Director, Operational Test and  Evaluation, to submit to Congress a Beyond Low Rate Initial Production  Report that includes the results of operational testing. Since this report is  an independent assessment of test results, the department did not believe  it appropriate to include in it Air Force plans and costs for corrective  actions stemming from operational testing. However, DOD will present  these actions and costs to the Defense Acquisition Board for decisions on  the F/A-22 program that will be included in the President\u2019s budget  submission to Congress.", "We understand the legal requirements for submitting the Beyond Low Rate  Initial Production Report. We also recognize that this is an independent  report submitted by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation. The  intent of our recommendation is not to modify the report itself, but to  ensure corrective actions and resultant costs are identified and reported in  a timely fashion and before the full rate production decision is made.
