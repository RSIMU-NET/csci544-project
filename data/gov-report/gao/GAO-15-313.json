According to CMS, the hub can verify key application information, including state residency, incarceration status, and immigration status. However, additional guidance from CMS to states might further enhance program-integrity efforts beyond using the hub. Specifically, CMS regulations do not require states to periodically review Medicaid beneficiary files for deceased individuals more frequently than annually, nor specify whether states should consider using the more-comprehensive Social Security Administration Death Master File in conjunction with state-reported death data when doing so. As a result, states may not be able to detect individuals that have moved to and died in other states, or prevent the payment of potentially fraudulent benefits to individuals using these identities.", "In 2011, CMS issued regulations to strengthen Medicaid provider-enrollment screening. For example, CMS now requires states to screen providers and suppliers to ensure they have active licenses in the state where they provide Medicaid services. CMS's regulations also allow states to use Medicare's enrollment database\u2014the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS)\u2014to screen Medicaid providers so that duplication of effort is reduced. In April 2012, CMS gave each state manual access to certain information in PECOS.

Medicaid is an entitlement  program, under which the federal government pays its share of  expenditures for any necessary, covered service for eligible individuals  under each state\u2019s federally approved Medicaid plan, as described below.  States pay qualified health-care providers for covered services provided  to eligible beneficiaries and then seek reimbursement for the federal  share of those payments.", "Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows flexibility in the states\u2019 Medicaid  plans. Although the federal government establishes broad federal  requirements for the Medicaid program, states can elect to cover a range  of optional populations and benefits. Guidelines established by federal  statutes, regulations, and policies allow each state some flexibility to (1)  broaden eligibility standards; (2) determine the type, amount, duration,  and scope of services; (3) set the rate of payment for services; and (4)  administer its own program, including processing and monitoring of  medical claims and payment of claims. Differences in program design can  lead to differences in state programs\u2019 vulnerabilities to improper payments  and state approaches to protecting the program. States are required to  submit plans to CMS to outline their plans to verify Medicaid eligibility  factors, including income, residency, age, Social Security numbers (SSN),  citizenship, and household composition. With more than 50 distinct state- based programs that are partially federally financed, overseeing Medicaid  is a complex challenge for CMS and states.", "In order to participate in Medicaid, federal law requires states to cover  certain population groups (mandatory-eligibility groups) and gives the  states the flexibility to cover other population groups (optional-eligibility  groups). States set individual eligibility criteria within federal minimum  standards. There are other nonfinancial eligibility criteria that are used in  determining Medicaid eligibility. In order to be eligible for Medicaid,  individuals need to satisfy federal and state requirements regarding  residency, immigration status, and documentation of U.S. citizenship.  Beginning in October 2013, states were required to use available  electronic data sources to confirm information included on the application,  while minimizing the amount of paper documentation that consumers  need to provide.", "As of March 25, 2011, federal regulations require that certain ordering  and referring physicians or other professionals providing services under  the state plan or under a waiver of the plan must be enrolled as  participating providers, which includes screening the providers upon initial  enrollment and when follow-up verification occurs (at least every 5 years).  The follow-up verification is referred to as revalidation or reenrollment.  As part of the enrollment process, and depending on the provider\u2019s risk  level, states may be required to collect certain information about the  providers\u2019 ownership interests and criminal background, search exclusion  and debarment lists, and take action to exclude those providers who  appear on those lists. When state officials discover potentially fraudulent  activity in the enrollment process, states must refer that activity or  providers to law-enforcement entities for investigation and possible  prosecution.", "In May 2014 we reported that states have historically provided Medicaid  benefits using a fee-for-service system, in which health-care providers are  paid for each service. However, according to CMS, in the past 15 years,  states have more frequently implemented a managed-care delivery  system for Medicaid benefits. In a managed-care delivery system,  beneficiaries obtain some portion of their Medicaid services from an  organization under contract with the state, and payments to MCOs are  typically made on a predetermined, per person, per month basis.  Currently, two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries receive some of their  services from MCOs, and many states are expanding their use of  managed care to additional geographic areas and Medicaid populations.According to HHS, approximately 27 percent, or $74.7 billion, of  nationwide federal Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2011 (the fiscal  year our review focused on) were attributable to Medicaid managed care.

One  provision in the 2011 HHS regulation allowed states to rely on the results  of provider screening by Medicare contractors to determine provider  eligibility for Medicaid. According to HHS, this provision would eliminate  additional screening and enrollment requirements for Medicaid providers,  and also eliminate additional costs and burdens for separate screening  for state Medicaid programs.", "To administer the provider screening, application fee, and revalidation  requirements successfully, as specified in federal regulations, CMS  determined that states must have access to Medicare enrollment data to  determine whether a provider is currently enrolled in the Medicare  program, has been denied enrollment, or is currently enrolling. According  to CMS, in April 2012, CMS established a process by which states would  have direct access to Medicare\u2019s enrollment database\u2014the Provider  Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS). Each state is given  \u201cread only,\u201d manual access to PECOS. CMS provided the states access  to PECOS in hopes that the states will be able to use these data in  minimizing the amount of screening and costs that are associated with  providers that are already enrolled in Medicare.", "However, according to our discussions with officials in the four selected  states, the states are using PECOS to screen a segment of their provider  population but none currently utilize PECOS for their entire provider  population. Arizona officials stated that they use PECOS in the screening  of out-of-state providers. Michigan officials stated that they use PECOS  on medium- or high-risk providers to determine whether a site visit is  warranted. New Jersey officials stated they use PECOS to confirm an  out-of-state provider\u2019s Medicare provider status and view the results of  the most-recent site-visit inspection. Florida officials said that they do not  screen all providers using PECOS. With regard to using PECOS for all  Medicaid providers in their screening processes, we determined the  following:", "State officials told us that PECOS required manual lookups of  individual providers, a task that one state characterized as inefficient  and administratively burdensome. According to CMS officials, as of  October 2013, CMS began providing all interested states access to a  monthly PECOS data-extract file that contains basic Medicare  enrollment information; the state officials we interviewed were  unaware that they could obtain automated data extracts from PECOS.", "Additionally, state officials from Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey  said that they use a limited amount of pertinent information,  specifically site-visit information, from PECOS to perform the  necessary provider screening. However, there is additional  information in PECOS, such as ownership information, that is  necessary for state Medicaid agencies to screen providers properly  and that is not included in the information that they use. Only Arizona  officials stated they are able to utilize PECOS ownership information  for providers. According to CMS officials, ownership information on  providers can be obtained through a detailed-level view of PECOS.  However, CMS has not made ownership information available to the  states through the monthly PECOS data-extract file.", "Some state officials noted that full electronic access to all information in  the PECOS system would streamline provider-screening efforts, resulting  in a more-efficient and more-effective process. Additional CMS guidance  to the states on requesting automated information through PECOS and  ensuring that such information includes key ownership information could  help states improve efficiency of provider screening."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Medicaid program is a significant expenditure for the federal  government and the states, representing over $310 billion in federal  outlays in fiscal year 2014. Because of the size and continued expansion  of the Medicaid program, it is important that the federal government and  the states continue to find ways to prevent and reduce improper  payments, including fraud, in the program. Since 2011, CMS has taken  steps to strengthen Medicaid beneficiary and provider enrollment- screening controls. As part of this ongoing endeavor, increasing  information and data-sharing efforts between the federal government and  state Medicaid programs could help enhance efforts to identify improper  payments and potentially fraudulent activities. As the federal overseer of  the Medicaid program, CMS is well positioned to provide additional  guidance on accessing information in federal databases, such as SSA  information about deceased individuals and automated information on  providers through Medicare\u2019s enrollment database\u2014the Provider  Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS)\u2014that would help  identify and prevent benefits and payments to those individuals and  providers who are ineligible to participate in Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further improve efforts to limit improper payments, including fraud, in  the Medicaid program, we recommend that the Acting Administrator of  CMS take the following two actions:  issue guidance to states to better identify beneficiaries who are  deceased; and provide guidance to states on the availability of automated information  through Medicare\u2019s enrollment database\u2014the Provider Enrollment,  Chain and Ownership System (PECOS)\u2014and full access to all  pertinent PECOS information, such as ownership information, to help  screen Medicaid providers more efficiently and effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to HHS, SSA, and state Medicaid  program offices for Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey. Written  comments from HHS, SSA, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment  System (AHCCCS), the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration,  and the Michigan Department of Community Health are summarized  below and reprinted in appendixes II\u2013VI. HHS concurred with our  recommendations. SSA did not comment on the findings and  recommendations but provided clarifying comments on the full DMF.  AHCCCS disagreed with out methodology and provided detailed  comments on our findings, as described below. The Florida Agency for  Healthcare Administration said it supports our efforts to identify provider  and beneficiary fraud. The Michigan Department of Community Health  agreed with our findings and supports our recommendations. In an e-mail  received on March 24, 2015, the Chief of Investigations of the New  Jersey Office of the State Comptroller, Medicaid Fraud Division, did not  provide comments on the findings but provided a technical comment,  which we incorporated as appropriate. The Florida Department of  Children and Families also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "HHS concurred with both of our recommendations. Regarding our first  recommendation, to issue guidance to states to better identify  beneficiaries who are deceased, HHS stated that it will work with states to  determine additional approaches to better identify deceased beneficiaries  and continue to provide state-specific technical assistance as needed. In  response to our second recommendation, HHS indicated that it will  continue to educate states about the availability of PECOS information  and how to use that information to help screen Medicaid providers more  effectively and efficiently. HHS also outlined steps the agency has taken  to address beneficiary and provider eligibility fraud since fiscal year  2011\u2014the time frame for the data used in our study\u2014many of which were  mentioned in our report. As described in our report, we used fiscal year  2011 data because it was the most-recent consistently comparable data  available.", "In its written comments, SSA did not comment on the report\u2019s findings  and recommendations but provided clarifying information regarding  access to the full Death Master File (DMF), which we incorporated as  appropriate. Additionally, SSA stated that CMS already has access to the  full DMF and can share that information with states to ensure proper  payment of Medicaid benefits. We believe that such action by CMS could  address our first recommendation.", "In its written comments, AHCCCS said that it takes exception to being  included in a series of findings that are global in nature and offer no state- specific detail. As we noted in our meetings with all state agencies  included in our study, we did not provide state-level detail for two primary  reasons. First, because CMS was the audited agency for our work,  conducting analysis at the state-level would be outside the scope of our  work and would put the focus on a comparison between the states, rather  than on CMS oversight. In addition, due to the age and limitations of the  data, as noted in the report, we would not be referring specific cases for  follow-up. AHCCCS further stated that our report contained  misstatements that cannot be attributed to either state. Because  AHCCCS did not provide any examples, we cannot address this assertion  but stand by the findings and recommendations in our report.", "AHCCCS also stated that most of the findings on our report are derived  from data sources that are considered unreliable. In our report, we outline  the steps we took to assess the reliability of our data and determine that  they were sufficiently reliable for performing our work. Additionally, we  note the key limitations of the data sources we use for our report and  provide the appropriate caveats, as applicable, for the findings from our  data analysis. Further, AHCCCS uses several of the same data sources  for its eligibility screening as we used in our report. For example,  AHCCCS notes that Arizona has found that the SSA death file is  unreliable. It further notes that it uses SSA\u2019s real-time State Online Query  system to obtain date of death information. According to SSA in its written  response to the draft report, the source for the State Online Query system  data used by Arizona is the SSA DMF.", "AHCCCS also states that the findings of our report do not reflect the  current eligibility-screening process in Arizona. We acknowledge the  limitations stemming from the age of the MSIS data (fiscal year 2011) and  the passage of PPACA in 2011. Furthermore, we directly address this  limitation in the report where we discuss actions CMS has taken to  strengthen certain Medicaid enrollment-screening controls. Specifically,  we state that CMS has taken regulatory action since 2011 to enhance  beneficiary-screening procedures and provider-screening procedures that  may address the improper-payment indicators found in our report. We  then discuss the current eligibility-screening process at the federal and  state level. We did not make any changes to the report based on these  AHCCCS comments, because we believe the essence of the comments  was already acknowledged within the report.", "AHCCCS also provided comments on specific sections of our analysis,  beginning with incarcerated beneficiaries. First, AHCCCS identified  reliability and timeliness issues with the SSA incarceration file. This  comment is not pertinent to our work, as this file was not a data source  used in our analysis. As we note in appendix I, we used each state\u2019s  department of corrections prisoner database for individuals incarcerated  for any period during fiscal year 2011. Second, AHCCCS states that we  failed to distinguish whether incarcerated individuals were hospitalized.  To the contrary, we note that we reviewed these claims\u2019 type of service to  determine that none qualified for federal matching funds. Accordingly, this  would exclude individuals that were hospitalized.", "Regarding our analysis using the USPS address-management tool,  AHCCCS incorrectly states that our report assumes that all physical  addresses are known to USPS. We do not state this in our report.  Specifically, the report notes that federal law requires states to make  Medicaid available to eligible individuals who do not reside in a  permanent dwelling or do not have a fixed home or mailing address.  Therefore, there are no requirements related to listing actual physical  addresses for beneficiary enrollment and eligibility determinations.  Further, the focus of our analysis was CMRAs used as the residential  address, not the validity of all addresses listed on beneficiary  applications. As such, the comment from AHCCCS is not supported by  the actual content and analyses in our report.", "AHCCCS notes that our analysis of provider controls is an extrapolation  from the combined set of states\u2019 data. This is incorrect. Our report does  not extrapolate, or make any population estimates, of provider eligibility  fraud. We provided a descriptive analysis of potential improper payments  and provider-eligibility fraud based on the data from fiscal year 2011. As  stated earlier, we listed the appropriate caveats to our findings to ensure  that the results of our analysis were not taken in an inappropriate context,  as implied by AHCCCS.", "Finally, AHCCCS identified three recommendations that it believes would  improve Medicaid program-integrity issues. Specifically AHCCCS stated  CMS should allow states to use disclosures conducted by Medicare or another  state Medicaid program in the enrollment of Medicaid providers, allow states to access the federal criminal database to conduct initial  and periodic background checks on providers, and promote other national initiatives for data sharing on Medicare and  provider license verifications.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Medicaid payments to these states constituted about 13 percent of all  Medicaid payments made during fiscal year 2011. These four states were  selected primarily because they had reliable data and were among states  with the highest Medicaid enrollment. The results of our analysis of  these states cannot be generalized to other states. We obtained Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid Statistical Information  System (MSIS) beneficiary, provider, and other services claims data, as  well as state Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) claims  identification data to perform our work. Managed-care organizations   As a result, the Medicaid  (MCO) receive a monthly capitated payment.paid amounts associated with managed care may not be reflected in the  state claims that were submitted to CMS for medical services, and hence  our estimate is likely understated. All of the states included in our  review\u2014Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey\u2014had MCO  arrangements in place.", "To identify beneficiaries that submitted applications with identification  information (name, date of birth, and Social Security number ) that  did not match with Social Security Administration (SSA) records, we used  the SSA Enumeration Verification System. Specifically, we processed  unique beneficiary identification information from the MSIS and MMIS  files through the SSA Enumeration Verification System to determine the  extent to which SSN information in the MSIS files was accurate. We  analyzed the output codes from the SSA Enumeration Verification System  to identify unique individuals who had Medicaid application identification  information that did not match SSA records. Applications may have  inaccuracies due to simple errors such as inaccurate data entry or  incomplete sections, making it difficult to determine whether these cases  involve fraud through data matching alone. In addition, there may be  situations where an individual does not have an SSN (for example, a  newborn child). Nonetheless, these applications pose a higher risk of  fraud because there is no complete electronic record of beneficiaries\u2019  identities.", "To identify providers and beneficiaries with identities associated with  deceased individuals at the time of their Medicaid services, we matched  Medicaid data\u2014MMIS and MSIS\u2014to the SSA complete file of death  information from October 2012. We matched records using the SSN and  full name of the individual. We then identified unique individuals who had  Medicaid claims processed where the date of death in the SSA file  occurred before the beginning service date in the Medicaid claims file.", "To identify providers and beneficiaries with identities associated with  incarcerated individuals at the time of their Medicaid services, we  matched our selected states\u2019 MMIS data to the states\u2019 departments of  corrections prisoner databases. Prisoner data included individuals  incarcerated for any period during fiscal year 2011. For Arizona, Florida,  and New Jersey, we identified provider and beneficiary records for which  the Medicaid SSN and names matched that of a person who was  incarcerated in fiscal year 2011 in any of the four states. Michigan did not  provide SSNs in its incarceration data. For Michigan, we identified  provider and beneficiary records for which the Medicaid name and birth  day exactly matched that of a person who was incarcerated in fiscal year  2011 in any of the four states. We then identified Medicaid claims  associated with the identified individuals by matching to the MSIS data.  We compared the beginning service date of the claims to the individual\u2019s  admittance and release date to identify all claims that occurred while the  associated beneficiary or provider identity was incarcerated. Additionally,  we reviewed these claims\u2019 type of service to determine that none qualified  for federal matching funds.", "It is not possible to determine from data matching alone whether these  matches definitively identify recipients who were deceased or  incarcerated without reviewing the facts and circumstances of each case.  For example, it is possible that individuals can be erroneously listed in the  full Death Master File (DMF). Similarly, a provider or beneficiary may  have an SSN, name, and date of birth similar to an individual in state  prison records. Alternatively, our matches may also understate the  number of deceased or incarcerated individuals receiving assistance  because matching would not detect applicants whose identifying  information in the Medicaid data differed slightly from their identifying  information in other databases.", "To identify claims that are associated with missing or invalid addresses,  we used the United States Postal Service (USPS) Address Matching  System Application Programming Interface (USPS address-management  tool). To identify providers and beneficiaries with invalid addresses, we  submitted all MMIS data through that USPS address-management tool for  fiscal year 2014. The USPS address-management tool provides  information such as whether an address is undeliverable, unknown, a  Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA), or contains an invalid city,  state, or ZIP code. Additionally, the address-management tool  standardized and corrected addresses based on the information  submitted. We considered invalid addresses to be unknown/blank,  CMRAs, or foreign addresses. To identify providers with CMRAs, we  identified all records where the address-management tool identified and  confirmed the address with private-mailbox-number information. We  conducted further analysis to remove any provider records that were not  for the physical service location of their business, such as a billing or  correspondence address for a provider. To identify beneficiaries with  commercial addresses, we identified all records where the address- management tool identified the residential address as a commercial  address with or without private-mailbox-number information. To identify  providers and beneficiaries with unknown addresses, we identified all  records where the USPS address-management tool identified the address  as not found or blank. To identify providers and beneficiaries with foreign  addresses, we identified and reviewed all records where the USPS  address-management tool identified the address as having an invalid city  or state. We removed records that had been corrected by the USPS  address-management tool as well as military bases. We then conducted  additional analysis to identify MSIS claims associated with both the  providers and beneficiaries with invalid addresses. It is not possible to  determine through data matching alone whether the identified claims  were definitely associated with invalid addresses without reviewing  additional information for each claim due to the difference in MMIS and  address-management tool data age. For example, it is possible that an  address was valid in fiscal year 2011 and was no longer recognized in  fiscal year 2014.", "To identify Medicaid beneficiaries who received benefits in two or more  states concurrently, we identified all beneficiary SSNs that appeared in  two or more states\u2019 MMIS data in fiscal year 2011. We then found all  claims associated with the beneficiary identities. We conducted further  analysis to determine the states in which each beneficiary identity  appears and the service ranges\u2014first and last date of service\u2014for those  states. We defined a concurrent claim as a claim that occurred within the  service range of a second state for the same beneficiary identity. For  each claim, we compared its date of service to the service ranges for the  beneficiary identity to determine whether it was a concurrent claim. It is  not possible to definitely say through data matching alone that a  beneficiary was improperly receiving Medicaid benefits in two or more  states concurrently without looking into further information for each claim  and beneficiary. For example, a beneficiary could have been a resident in  one state and received services, then changed residency to a second  state and received benefits for a brief period, before finally relocating  again back to the original state and receiving additional services. In this  case, the claims could have been identified as a concurrent claim even if  the beneficiary did not receive any services from the original state during  his or her relocation period in the second state.", "To identify claims that might have been improperly processed and paid by  the Medicaid program because the federal government had excluded  these providers from providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries, we  compared the Medicaid claims to the exclusion and debarment files from  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector  General (OIG) and the General Services Administration (GSA).  Specifically, we used the HHS List of Excluded Individuals and Entities  (LEIE) file from September 2012 and the GSA Excluded Parties List  System (EPLS) database extract from October 2011 to perform our  match. We matched MMIS and MSIS Medicaid data using SSN and  individual name with both the LEIE and the EPLS data extracts. We then  identified unique individuals who had Medicaid claims processed where  the date of exclusion occurred before the beginning service date in the  Medicaid claims file.", "To identify claims that might be improperly processed and paid by the  Medicaid program because the provider had a revoked or suspended  license, we compared Medicaid claims data to the Federation of State  Medical Boards (FSMB) Physician Data Center database extract from  calendar year 2014. We identified providers with actions that, in some  cases, may be prohibited under federal Medicaid regulations that resulted  in a suspended or revoked license. We matched these providers with our  Medicaid claims data by SSN and provider name. We identified unique  individuals who had Medicaid claims processed where the date of license  action occurred before the beginning service date in the Medicaid claims  file.", "To identify federal and state oversight policies, controls, and processes in  place to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in determining eligibility for  Medicaid beneficiaries and enrolling providers, we reviewed federal  statutes, CMS regulations, and state Medicaid policies pertinent to  program-integrity structures, met with agency officials, and visited state  Medicaid offices that perform oversight functions.
