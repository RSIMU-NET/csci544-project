GPRAMA calls for the creation of a list (inventory) of all federal programs, along with related budget and performance information, which could make it easier to determine the scope of the federal government's involvement in particular areas and, therefore, where action is needed to address crosscutting issues, including instances of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication.", "GPRAMA requires GAO to periodically review its implementation. This report is part of GAO's response to that mandate and examines (1) how OMB and agencies defined programs, (2) the extent to which inventories provide useful information for decision makers, and (3) the extent to which inventories provide a coherent picture of the scope of federal involvement in particular areas. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed the 24 inventories using GPRAMA requirements, OMB guidance, and related leading practices from GAO's past work, and interviewed OMB staff and agency officials. For the first objective, GAO also selected two areas of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication identified in past GAO work\u2014STEM education and nuclear nonproliferation\u2014and compared the lists of programs developed in its past work to those contained in agency inventories. The two areas were selected based on various factors, including the number of agencies involved and whether those agencies published an inventory."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To date, the approach used by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies has not led to the inventory of all federal programs, along with related budget and performance information, envisioned in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). In developing the inventory, OMB allowed for significant discretion in several areas\u2014leading to a variety of approaches for defining programs and inconsistencies in the type of information reported. The inconsistent definitions, along with agencies not following an expected consultation process, led to challenges in identifying similar programs in different agencies. As a result of these limitations, the inventory is not a useful tool for decision making. OMB is considering options for enhancing the inventory.", "GPRAMA requires OMB to publish a list of all federal programs on a central governmentwide website. It also requires OMB to issue guidance, and agencies to identify and provide to OMB for publication information about each program\u2014 including how they defined their programs in line with OMB's guidance. OMB is taking an iterative approach to implement these requirements. Based on experiences from a pilot involving 11 agencies in 2012, OMB issued guidance allowing agencies flexibility to define their programs using different approaches, but within a broad definition of what constitutes a program\u2014a set of related activities directed toward a common purpose or goal. According to OMB staff, this was based on a lesson learned from the pilot effort: a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well; agencies and their stakeholders use the term \u201cprogram\u201d in different ways because agencies achieve their missions through different programmatic approaches. In May 2013, OMB published the inventories developed by 24 agencies, which used various approaches to define and identify 1,524 programs (see table below).", "Because agencies used different approaches, similar programs across agencies may not be identifiable. To illustrate the shortcomings of the inventory, GAO attempted to locate in relevant agencies' inventories the various science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and nuclear nonproliferation programs identified in GAO's past work. GAO was unable to identify in the inventories a large majority of the programs previously identified in its work: 9 of the 179 programs matched exactly and 51 others were identified based on program descriptions.", "The lack of comparability may also be the result of agencies not working with each other when developing their inventories. One of OMB's stated purposes for the inventories is to facilitate coordination among programs that contribute to similar outcomes. However, agencies did not work together to consistently define their programs. Increased coordination could help agencies identify where they have programs that contribute to similar goals and thus, opportunities to collaborate in achieving desired outcomes.", "The 24 inventories developed by agencies in 2013 did not provide the programs and related budget and performance information required by GPRAMA. This limits the usefulness of the inventories to various decision makers, including Congress and stakeholders. To be useful, the inventories must meet various users' needs for accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability, and validity, among other factors. Specific steps OMB and agencies could take to ensure the inventories are more useful to decision makers include:", "Presenting program-level budget information. Although GPRAMA requires agencies to identify program-level funding, OMB did not direct agencies to include this information in their 2013 inventories\u2014it was to be part of a planned May 2014 update. However, OMB subsequently put the 2014 update on hold to determine how to merge these requirements with implementation of the federal spending information to be reported under the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). Reporting for both laws is web-based, which could more easily enable linkages between the two sites or incorporating information from each other. The Senate version of a bill, the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act of 2014, which is currently under consideration, would require this linkage in lieu of incorporating budget information on the program inventory site.", "Providing complete performance information . GPRAMA and OMB's guidance require agencies to describe each program's contribution to the agency's goals. However, there are instances where agencies omitted that information. For example, agencies did not consistently show how some or all of their programs supported strategic goals (in 7 of 24 inventories) or strategic objectives (in 13 of 24 inventories). Ensuring agencies illustrate this alignment would better explain how programs support the results agencies are achieving.", "Consulting with stakeholders . None of the agencies sought input on their inventories from external stakeholders, such as Congress, state and local governments, and third-party service providers, although OMB's 2012 guidance instructed agencies to do so. In several instances, agency officials stated that they thought OMB was soliciting feedback on all inventories. By consulting with stakeholders to understand their needs, agencies would better ensure that the information provided in the inventories is useful for stakeholder decision making.", "Other features of OMB's approach further limit the program inventories' ability to present a coherent picture of all federal programs, as required by GPRAMA. First, to date, OMB has only included 24 agencies in this effort. Second, while not specified by GPRAMA, tax expenditures were not included in the 2013 inventory. Tax expenditures, which represent a reduction in a taxpayer's tax liability through credits, deductions, or other means, resulted in $1.1 trillion in forgone revenue in fiscal year 2013, nearly the same amount as discretionary spending that year. By including tax expenditures, OMB could help ensure that agencies are properly identifying their contributions to the achievement of agency goals, as OMB's guidance directs them to do. Finally, OMB's guidance and staff have stated that eventually the inventory will move to a more dynamic, web-based presentation. This could make it easier to tag and sort related or similar programs, for instance, by type of program or contribution to the same or similar goals. Covering additional agencies and tax expenditures in the federal program inventory, along with web-based sorting capabilities, would help decision makers determine the scope of the federal government's involvement in a particular area, and therefore where action is needed to better address fragmentation, overlap, or duplication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes several recommendations to OMB. To present a more coherent picture of all federal programs, GAO recommends OMB revise its guidance to direct agencies to collaborate when defining and identifying programs that contribute to a common outcome, define plans for expanding implementation beyond the current 24 agencies, and include tax expenditures in the federal program inventory. In addition, to improve the usefulness of the information in inventories GAO recommends OMB ensure agencies consistently identify the various goals each program supports, and consult with stakeholders when developing or updating their inventories.", "OMB staff generally agreed with these recommendations, although they neither agreed nor disagreed with three of GAO's recommendations related to including tax expenditures and additional performance information. OMB staff stated that until they had firmer plans on how program inventory and DATA Act implementation would be merged, they could not determine if implementing those recommendations would be feasible."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many of the meaningful results that the federal government seeks to  achieve, such as those related to protecting food and agriculture and  providing homeland security, require the coordinated efforts of more than  one federal agency, level of government, or sector.

We are required to review  implementation of GPRAMA at several critical junctures. This report is  part of our response to that mandate. Our specific objectives for this  report were to (1) assess how OMB and agencies defined and identified  the programs contained in the inventories, (2) examine the extent to  which the inventories provide useful information for federal decision  makers, and (3) examine the extent to which the inventories provide a  coherent picture of the scope of federal involvement in particular areas.", "To address all three objectives, we assessed the 24 agency program  inventories published by OMB on Performance.gov in May 2013 using  relevant GPRAMA requirements, OMB guidance, and related leading  practices from our past work on managing for results, such as those  related to involving Congress and stakeholders in performance  management activities and ensuring performance information is useful to  decision makers. We also developed a structured set of questions and  conducted interviews with, or received written responses from, officials  involved in developing the inventories at each of the 24 agencies. We  also interviewed staff from OMB\u2019s Office of Performance and Personnel  Management who led governmentwide implementation of these  requirements and developed guidance for the agencies.", "In addition, to address our first objective, we selected two areas of  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication from our annual reports\u2014science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and nuclear  nonproliferation programs\u2014and compared the lists of programs  developed by our work to those contained in agency inventories.

Because the two selected areas are a non-generalizable  sample of instances where fragmentation, overlap, and duplication exist,  our results cannot be generalized more broadly.

According to OMB\u2019s memorandum, pilot  agencies were to identify an inventory of programs and map them to  established programmatic and organizational structures as well as the  agency\u2019s strategic plan and performance goals. In addition, agencies  were to provide program purpose and funding information for each  program. The memorandum noted that, based on the pilot, OMB would  issue guidance to all federal agencies detailing the approach for  developing a governmentwide inventory.", "In its August 2012 update to its guidance for implementing GPRAMA,  OMB included guidance for broader implementation of the inventory  requirements. Initial implementation was limited to the 24 agencies that  developed agency priority goals (APG) for fiscal years 2012-2013. In  addition, the guidance provided a phased approach for these 24  agencies. For the first phase, for publication in May 2013, agencies were  to describe their program definition approach, identify their programs, and  provide limited funding and performance information. OMB subsequently  published 24 separate inventory documents on the central  governmentwide website required under GPRAMA, which it has  implemented as Performance.gov. For the second phase, originally  planned for publication in May 2014, the 24 agencies were to update their  inventories based on any stakeholder feedback they received and provide  additional program-level funding and performance information. OMB\u2019s  guidance also stated that at that time the inventory information was to be  presented in a more dynamic, web-based approach.", "However, agencies did not publish updated inventories in May 2014.  According to OMB staff, plans for updating the inventories are on  indefinite hold as OMB re-evaluates next steps for what type of  information will be presented in the inventories and how it will be  presented based on (1) recent legislative actions that could affect the  information required for the inventories; (2) a lack of stakeholder  feedback; and (3) insufficient funding for,related to, presenting the inventories in a web-based format on   and technological challenges  Performance.gov. Regarding legislative action, OMB staff are considering  how implementation of the expanded reporting requirements for federal  spending information under the recently-enacted Digital Accountability  and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) could be tied to the program  inventories. The DATA Act is intended to increase accountability and  transparency in federal spending. It requires federal agencies to publicly  report, on at least a quarterly basis, information about any funding made  available to, or expended by, an agency or a component of the agency.  This reporting covers a variety of budget information\u2014budget authority,  obligations, unobligated balances, outlays, and any other budgetary  resources\u2014at different levels of aggregation and disaggregation:  appropriations account, program activities, and object class. Reporting  under the act is required to begin no later than 3 years after enactment  (no later than May 9, 2017). In addition, the DATA Act provides for the  establishment of government-wide financial data standards to, among  other things, produce consistent and comparable data across program  activities. The act also holds agencies more accountable for the quality of  the information disclosed. As we reported in April 2014, such increased  transparency provides opportunities for improving the efficiency and  effectiveness of federal spending and improving oversight to prevent and  detect fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds.", "In addition, the House has passed and the Senate is considering a bill  that would amend the program inventory provisions of GPRAMA.

State operations programs follow a budget approach while State and U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance  programs follow both a budget and outcome-based approach.

The lack of comparability of similar programs across agencies in part  could be due to differences in the way we previously defined \u201cprogram\u201d  and the way each agency defined its programs, such as different levels of  aggregation of related activities to constitute a program. The flexibility  OMB\u2019s guidance afforded in defining programs allows agencies to align  their definitions with multiple purposes, including carrying out their  mission and goals; serving beneficiaries, customers, and other target  populations; and providing benefits, services, and products.

These  provisions are important because they show how agencies are  coordinating efforts toward a common outcome.

As noted in the Senate Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report that accompanied  GPRAMA, this provision, among others, was intended to help describe  the strategies to be used to achieve results and the resources to be  applied to those strategies. This information can help Congress  understand and assess the relationship between the agency\u2019s resources  and results.

In commenting on a  draft of the report, OMB staff agreed with this recommendation. As of July 2014, OMB  and the PIC have taken some initial steps to address this recommendation. According to  OMB staff, this includes efforts related to achieving several of the CAP goals.

According to OMB  staff, once they move forward with the next inventory update and move to  a web-based presentation, this would allow users to sort programs by the  goals to which they contribute. This approach also would allow users to  identify programs that contribute to broader themes on Performance.gov.  The themes generally align with budget functions from the President\u2019s  Budget and include administration of justice; general science, space, and  technology; national defense; and transportation, among others.

This is underscored by our annual reports on fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication, which to date have identified over 90 areas,  each of which involves a patchwork of federal agencies, programs, and  activities that attempt to address the same issue. Executive branch and  congressional efforts to identify, manage, or resolve instances of  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication are hindered by the lack of a  comprehensive list of all federal programs. Such a list, along with related  budget and performance information, could help decision makers  determine the scope of the federal government\u2019s involvement,  investment, and performance in a particular area, which in turn could help  pinpoint where action is needed to better address or avoid fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication. Therefore, effective implementation of  GPRAMA\u2019s federal program inventory requirements could provide  decision makers with critical information that could be used to better  address crosscutting issues, among other purposes.", "The executive branch has taken some initial steps to develop program  inventories with related budget and performance information. In 2012,  OMB involved 11 agencies in a pilot program inventory effort for federal  trade, export, and competiveness programs and subsequently developed  guidance\u2014based on lessons learned from the pilot\u2014for broader  implementation at 24 agencies. In May 2013, the 24 agencies published  inventories, providing information about 1,524 programs they collectively  identified. Despite these initial efforts, we have identified a number of  areas where implementation should be improved.", "OMB needs to take further actions to effectively meet GPRAMA\u2019s  requirement for the inventories to present a coherent picture of all federal  programs. First, OMB\u2019s guidance provides agencies with flexibility in how  they defined their programs. As a result, agencies used different  approaches to identify their programs, which, in turn, led to a lack of  comparability for similar programs across agencies. This was illustrated  by our analysis of agency inventories for STEM education and nuclear  nonproliferation programs, in which we could only exactly match a small  fraction of the programs covered by our past work on fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication in those areas. According to OMB staff, the  flexibility provided in guidance is derived from lessons learned from the  pilot effort\u2014that agencies are different for valid and legitimate reasons  and a one-size-fits-all approach would not work for all agencies. While  this may be true, OMB could do more to direct agencies to find common  ground on similar programs. One of OMB\u2019s stated purposes for the  inventories is to facilitate coordination across programs that contribute to  similar outcomes. However, as we discovered through our interviews with  agency officials involved with the inventory efforts, none of the agencies  sought input from other agencies on how they defined and identified their  programs. If agencies worked together to more consistently define their  programs, it could also help them identify where they have programs that  contribute to similar outcomes, and therefore opportunities to collaborate.", "Second, OMB\u2019s plans to date do not adequately ensure that the  inventories include all federal programs. It has yet to provide firm plans on  when implementation of GPRAMA\u2019s inventory requirements will be  expanded beyond the current 24 agencies. OMB\u2019s guidance does not  provide a clear time frame for how long activities must persist to be  considered programs, which may have resulted in agencies excluding  certain activities from their inventories. In addition, OMB did not include  tax expenditures in the inventory effort. Although GPRAMA does not  specify that tax expenditures should be included in the program inventory,  our work over the past 20 years has shown the need for tax expenditures  to be held to the same scrutiny as spending programs, given the sizeable  federal investment they represent. The omission of these agencies,  programs, and activities severely limits the usefulness of the inventory as  a tool for addressing crosscutting issues.", "In addition, other factors limit the usefulness of the inventory as a source  of information for decision makers. To be useful, information must meet  various users\u2019 needs for accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability,  and validity, among other factors. Agency officials also told us they did  not consult with external stakeholders, including Congress. Although  OMB\u2019s 2012 guidance instructed agencies to seek this input, none of  them did. Subsequently, OMB has removed this direction from its  guidance. By consulting with stakeholders to understand their needs,  agencies would better ensure that the information provided in the  inventories is useful for stakeholder decision making. Involving  congressional stakeholders is of critical importance given Congress\u2019s  power to create and fund programs.", "Our work also identified limitations with the performance information  contained within the inventories. Agencies did not consistently identify the  strategic goals, strategic objectives, agency priority goals, and cross- agency priority goals that each program supports, as directed by OMB  guidance. These omissions were not always identified during OMB\u2019s  review of each agency\u2019s inventory. In addition, OMB\u2019s guidance does not  direct agencies to identify in their inventories the performance goals to  which each program contributes. Although not required for the  inventories, GPRAMA requires this type of connection\u2014albeit by  performance goal rather than by program\u2014in agency performance plans.  This information can help Congress and others understand and assess  the relationship between the agency\u2019s resources and results.

We identified possible matches in two different manners. First, we identified instances in which program names  exactly matched between the lists developed for our past work and the  agency\u2019s inventory. In addition, we also reviewed the program  descriptions contained in the relevant inventories to determine if they  would lead one to programs/activities related to STEM education or  nuclear nonproliferation. For example, if the program description  contained language such as \u201cscience education\u201d or \u201ctechnology  education,\u201d we included that program as a broader match.
