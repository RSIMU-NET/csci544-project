In general, GAO could not adequately determine Treasury's progress on five key outcomes because the fiscal year 2000 performance report lacked at least some measures needed to directly assess each of the outcomes. However, other information that GAO reviewed and GAO's past work suggest that Treasury may be at risk of not achieving these outcomes. In assessing Treasury's strategies, GAO identified shortcomings in its plans for each of the outcomes it reviewed. Chief among the limitations common to both the Treasury's fiscal year 1999 and 2000 performance reports was that the performance goals and measures of Treasury's agencies were not always directly reflected in the broader departmental goals, limiting the reports' usefulness in determining whether these agencies are making progress in meeting their strategic goals in general and the outcomes GAO reviewed in particular. Treasury improved the fiscal year 2000 report by elevating its objective of Improve Customer Satisfaction to a strategic goal and adding a strategic goal of Improve Employee Satisfaction.

IRS is modernizing all aspects of the agency\u2019s operations, such as its organizational structure, business processes, technology, and performance management. As part of its modernization, IRS developed three agencywide strategic goals, which we used to assess this outcome. The goals are top quality service to each taxpayer in every interaction, top quality service to all taxpayers through fair and uniform application of the law, and   productivity through a quality work environment.", "In fiscal year 2000, Treasury reported that the IRS made progress in conceptualizing and identifying the measures it needs for its goals.Currently the IRS has only an employee satisfaction measure, which relates to the third goal.", "While IRS-wide strategic measures to assess this outcome are not available, our work on measures dealing with collecting revenues, providing taxpayer service, and enforcing tax laws indicated mixed results. On the plus side, during fiscal year 2000, IRS issued refunds without significant problems and taxpayers had an easier time getting through to telephone assistors. On the down side, the quality of service for taxpayers who visited taxpayer assistance centers and trends in enforcement functions continue to be troubling. For example, Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report listed five IRS-wide measures that Treasury designated as key performance indicators related to the outcome. The agency did not meet its target for four of the five indicators including all three measures of quality. Treasury\u2019s explanations for not meeting its targets included reasons such as the decline \u201c\u2026was caused by a failure to meet any one, several, or all of the standards measured in this category, thus resulting in a lower overall composite score.\u201d Figure 1 shows IRS\u2019 performance over time on the five key indicators.", "In its fiscal year 2002 plan for IRS, Treasury lacked specific strategies to demonstrate how it would achieve its strategic goals and objectives and, thereby, be ensured of effectively and fairly administering the tax laws. Instead, IRS\u2019 plan included individual strategies for meeting each of the 73 measures in the plan. Of those measures, 18 are outcome-oriented and focused on quality, timeliness, customer satisfaction, or employee satisfaction. While 5 of these measures will establish baseline data, the strategies to implement the remaining 13 measures are, in general, continuations of those used in the previous year. For example, the strategy for improving field collection quality in fiscal year 2001 included using data analysis to target areas for improvement, planning training around identified needs, and delivering a redesigned, web-based manual. For fiscal year 2002, the strategy to improve quality in that area included continued data analysis and training and added a strategy to develop a system for embedding responsibilities for quality at the organizational level closest to customers. Treasury did not explain why it was likely to be more successful in fiscal year 2002 by continuing similar strategies for the five measures where the targets were not met. In February 2001, we again recommended that IRS more clearly link its measures to its goals and objectives.

We first identified this program as a high-risk area in 1995 and, more recently, noted in our December 2000 report that the overall impact of the compliance initiative remained unclear despite its success in identifying hundreds of millions of dollars in erroneous EITC claims in fiscal year 2000. Yet, no performance measures specific to EITC activities are planned at the agency level. Although IRS already collects some data for an internal quarterly tracking report, Treasury does not plan to use that data to assess and report program performance.", "Treasury plans to continue emphasizing increased customer service for and compliance activities affecting both taxpayers and preparers in its current strategy for reducing problems in the EITC program. However, Treasury\u2019s performance plan for IRS does not include measures for those areas or others related to this outcome. The 5-year strategy for EITC, instituted in 1998, includes expanding customer service and taxpayer education, reviewing preparers\u2019 compliance, and improving return selection methods for audits, among others.

However, other available information showed continuing declines in most of IRS\u2019 collection actions to collect delinquent tax debt and roughly stable collections by FMS of non-tax debts.

However, based on other information about collection programs at the IRS\u2014the Treasury agency responsible for the relevant programs\u2014we are troubled by the performance with respect to this outcome. Treasury\u2019s performance report measures output for this effort in terms of volume of collection cases closed and timeliness of certain types of collection actions. Treasury did not report performance measures that would provide perspective on whether IRS is collecting the correct amount of taxes under proper collection procedures. For example, the performance report did not contain measures for amounts collected as a percentage of the total value of the collection cases that were closed, or at the IRS-wide level, a measure for enforcement revenue collected as a percent of unpaid taxes. Such measures, over time, would give a clearer indication than case closure data as to whether Treasury is making any headway in improving delinquent tax collections. As figure 2 illustrates, enforcement revenue collected has not kept pace with the growth in the levels of unpaid taxes.", "Furthermore, our recent work showed declines in important collection actions including seizures, liens, and levies. Although the Commissioner of Internal Revenue predicted last year that the downward trends for these actions would be reversed, by and large, they were not. In addition, the reliability and accuracy of these output measures in Treasury\u2019s performance report is questionable. Our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 2000 financial statements found that IRS was unable to provide documentation that it had performed validation and verification procedures on its key performance indicators.", "Treasury\u2019s strategy in its fiscal year 2002 IRS plan for increasing collections of tax debts focused on reducing the diversion to noncompliance duties of staff who are experienced in compliance efforts and enhancing the efficiency of the delinquent tax account management. This included (1) adopting a risk-based approach for identifying better yielding accounts for collection and examination and (2) making more effective use of technology and specialization for processing unpaid tax transactions through IRS systems. However, although these strategies potentially could improve tax debt collections, the performance plans did not contain performance measures for assessing its progress. In addition, we previously reported that IRS does not have adequate records on its unpaid assessments to properly manage its accounts receivable inventory. Without such information, IRS may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and, therefore, not achieve the desired outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-tax Debt Collection", "paragraphs": ["While Treasury reported that it had many significant accomplishments in improving non-tax delinquent debt collection in fiscal year 2000, the non- tax debt collections in fiscal year 2000 were about the same as in fiscal year 1999\u2014about $2.6 billion, primarily from tax refund offsets. The performance target for fiscal year 2000 was to collect $2.08 billion. These collections came from primary collection programs administered by FMS\u2014Treasury Offset Program and Cross-servicing. Of the total collected, about $41 million was collected through the cross-servicing program. Treasury also measured non-tax debt collection progress in terms of the amount of debt referred to FMS for collection. For example, as of September 30, 2000, agencies had referred 83 percent of delinquent debts over 180 days old reported as eligible for the Treasury Offset and Cross-servicing programs. Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2000 target was to refer 75 percent of the amount eligible for referral.", "While the performance measure for total collections is a good indicator of the overall progress being made in collecting non-tax debt, it does not adequately capture important distinctions between the offset and cross- servicing programs. We suggested in our June 2000 report that combining the performance achievements of the two programs can mask potential performance issues with cross-servicing. By breaking out\u2014in the performance report\u2014the total collections amounts by the results of the offset program and the cross-servicing program would give decision- makers a better indication of the effectiveness of the two programs relative to the resources being applied to each program. Our prior report also suggested that breaking out total non-tax collections by amounts collected as a result of federal delinquent non-tax debt referrals and amounts collected for debts associated with state child support would give decision-makers more information on the types of debt that is being collected. As we previously reported, collections for child support represent a significant percentage of total collections and are forwarded to the states. Reporting such collections separately from amounts related to the collection of federal delinquent non-tax debts would provide a more accurate indication of FMS\u2019 performance. In addition, the amount of delinquent non-tax debt that is referred to Treasury for collection as compared with the amount of delinquent non-tax debt that is eligible for referral is not fully indicative of FMS\u2019 performance. Specifically, since the measure is an indicator of the efforts of other agencies to participate in the program, it might be unduly influenced by factors outside FMS\u2019 full control. Therefore, it could be difficult to attribute changes in the measure to the effectiveness of FMS\u2019 debt collection efforts.", "Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2002 strategies in its FMS plan for increasing non-tax debt collections revolved around efforts to improve the efficiency of the cross-servicing program. For example, FMS plans to analyze the types of cross-servicing debts collected, review cross-servicing costs and fee structure, and develop a methodology to periodically evaluate the process of distributing debts to private collection agencies. FMS is also preparing audit guidance on procedures to monitor agency debt referrals. Regarding the offset program, FMS plans to expand the program by including federal salary and other payment types. However, while FMS has strategies to increase non-tax debt collections, it did not discuss a timeframe for incorporating these payments into the program. FMS\u2019 target for total non- tax debt collections is $2.3 billion for fiscal year 2001 and $2.4 billion for fiscal year 2002. Both of these targets are less than the $2.6 billion FMS collected in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. As such, it does not appear that FMS expects its planned actions for these programs to result in increased collections."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Availability and/or Use of Illegal Drugs", "paragraphs": ["It was difficult to fully gauge Treasury\u2019s progress in reducing the availability and/or use of illegal drugs because some of its performance measures did not directly measure Treasury's progress toward achieving this outcome. Treasury acknowledges that some of its measures used to track performance may not provide the best performance information and indicated that it is working toward improving performance measures. Given the measures that Treasury did use, it made some progress in reducing the availability and/or use of illegal drugs. For example, the U.S. Customs Service (Customs)\u2014the Treasury agency primarily responsible for programs related to this outcome\u2014exceeded its targets for three of its nine measures of illegal drugs seized. For the targets that were not met, Treasury attributed this shortfall to external factors such as \u201can expanding cocaine market in Europe where prices and profit margins are higher than in the United States.\u201d However, Treasury\u2019s report did not identify actions to evaluate the effects of external factors on Treasury\u2019s seizure targets and programs although it acknowledged that it would work with various federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies on this crosscutting outcome.", "Measures of illegal drugs seized provided only a partial assessment of Customs\u2019 success in reducing the availability and/or use of illegal drugs. Without an underlying measure of the amount of drugs moving into the country in total, interpretations of measures of drugs seized is problematic. This overall measure, given the clandestine and diffused nature of illegal drug traffic, is illusive even with rigorous measurement efforts. In its performance report, Treasury noted that the Office of National Drug Control Policy is developing models that will better estimate the amount of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana being smuggled into the U.S. In the meantime, Customs plans to rely on its targeting efficiency measures to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the criteria to target potential violators\u2014a measure applied to both air passengers and vehicles. Until better measures of Customs\u2019 performance are developed, Treasury may want to explore the relative effectiveness of several Customs anti-smuggling programs. Customs relies on intelligence, surveillance, investigations, random inspections of incoming passengers and cargo, technology, and arrangements with exporters, importers, and carriers to increase the likelihood that it will detect drugs being smuggled into the U.S. For example, Customs could compare the difference in drug detection at different border crossings where one site had a new scanning technology and another site did not have the technology.", "As we noted in our September 2000 report, agencies could use program evaluation for several purposes such as exploring the benefits of programs, measuring program performance, and explaining performance results. While program evaluations will also be hampered by the lack of underlying data about the flow of drugs, they might provide some indications of the comparative effectiveness of different interdiction programs. In addition, we noted in a March 2000 report that Treasury could improve processes related to its performance measures for target efficiency. In response to our recommendations, Customs stated it would collect more complete and accurate data on persons subjected to personal searches as well as closely monitor data on personal searches. While Treasury\u2019s report notes that one of its actions to increase the targeting efficiency and effectiveness is to improve training, Treasury\u2019s performance report for these measures could have included a discussion on either progress to date for collecting this data or results of its data evaluations of passengers targeted for searches in relation to its efforts to seize drugs.", "Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2002 plan for Customs provided specific strategies and programs for fiscal year 2002 designed to help Customs reduce the availability and use of illegal drugs. For example, Customs plans to reduce the availability and/or use of illegal drugs by using air and sea interdiction units designed to protect our borders from the continually shifting narcotics and contraband smuggling threat. However, some measures for the strategies and programs that are designed to achieve this outcome provide an incomplete measure of performance. For example, the agency plans to measure the number of landings made by suspect aircraft that occur shortly before the aircraft crosses the border into the U.S., called short landings. The agency could refine its measure by using information about planes that are found after landing in the U.S. to have carried illegal drugs. In addition, Customs did not identify actions that are to be taken to mitigate the effects on its activities of external influences such as changes in drug smuggling routes in response to law enforcement pressures. The fiscal year 2002 performance plan does not discuss any human capital initiatives as strategies to support this outcome nor does it include information on technology initiatives for this outcome.

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF)\u2014the Treasury agency responsible for programs related to this outcome\u2014the tracing process assists law enforcement agencies in identifying possessors of recovered crime guns, and it enables ATF to develop investigative leads to identify illegal suppliers of firearms. However, neither of these measures provided an assessment of the extent to which tracing activities by ATF helped deny criminals access to firearms or reduced crime. In addition, the measures do not address one issue stated in the performance goal\u2014community exposure to firearms-related crime.

However, this strategy is not currently addressed by the ATF performance measures, as none of these measures determine how successful the IVRS will be at denying criminals access to firearms and reducing related crimes. For example, one ATF performance measure tracks the number of firearm trace requests submitted during the fiscal year, a measure that does not provide sufficient information regarding IVRS\u2019 success at helping deny access to firearms.

However, as we note in the report, without performance measures and an evaluation strategy, Treasury will not be able to assess progress in achieving less waste, fraud, and error in the program.", "Delinquent Tax Collection. Treasury commented that IRS' reorganization, new mission, and strategic goals caused IRS to find methods of measuring success without considering dollars collected.  Treasury went on to note that for various reasons, IRS' traditional debt collection activities have declined and that with additional staffing it has been authorized, IRS believes it will realize significant improvement in critical debt collection areas by the end of fiscal year 2002.  While IRS' current performance measures provide some perspective on its collections success, we believe, as explained in our report, that some measures that consider whether IRS is collecting the correct amount of taxes under proper collection procedures would provide a more balanced performance perspective.", "Non-tax Debt Collection. Treasury disagreed with our assessment that one of its measures--involving a comparison of delinquent non-tax debts referred and eligible for referral--for this outcome is not a good gauge of success. While we agree that FMS has spent considerable resources working with other agencies so that the agencies will refer their debt, it is also true that the measure is unduly influenced by factors outside FMS' full control. We modified the wording in our report to better reflect our concern about that measure.", "Customs Drug Interdiction Program. Treasury disagreed with our statement that some of its performance measures were not linked directly to its goals. In response, we revised our wording to better articulate our assessment of the progress Treasury has made in achieving its outcomes.", "Personal Search Data. Treasury provided additional perspective on its efforts in response to our previous recommendation related to its performance measures for target efficiency.", "Short Landings. Treasury disagreed with our assessment that some of its drug interdiction performance measures do not support the outcome of reduced drug availability. It also took issue with our use of an example regarding the performance measure on the number of suspect aircraft that land shortly before crossing the border into the U.S. The intent of the example was to illustrate the need for better outcome measures, a need that Treasury acknowledged in its comments. We clarified our wording in the report.", "Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). We deleted reference to the development of the ACE initiative, as suggested by Treasury.", "Data Accuracy, Incomplete Assessment. At Treasury's request, we revised the report to include an example of components of an assessment of data issues.", "FMS' Computer Security. Treasury provided information in its comments about the performance measures it established for its Information Technology Security Program in the Self- Assessment Framework. While that action is commendable, it does not substitute for performance measures in Treasury's performance report or plan. We clarified this point in our report.", "FMS Non-compliance with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA). Treasury acknowledged that its financial management systems did not comply with FFMIA and that it is addressing deficiencies through a remediation plan and corrective actions.  While those actions are commendable, they do not substitute for performance measures in Treasury's performance report or plan.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to appropriate congressional committees; the Honorable Paul H. O\u2019Neill; and the Honorable Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., Director, Office of Management and Budget.

The first column of the table lists the management challenges that we and/or the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) or Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) have identified. Treasury has two offices of Inspector General\u2014 TIGTA, which covers the Internal Revenue Service and the OIG, which covers all other Treasury bureaus. The second column discusses what progress, as discussed in its fiscal year 2000 performance report, Treasury made in resolving its challenges. The third column discusses the extent to which Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan includes performance goals and measures to address the challenges that we and the two Treasury IGs identified. We found that Treasury\u2019s performance report discussed the agency\u2019s progress in resolving many of its challenges, but it did not discuss the agency\u2019s progress in resolving the following challenge: Strategic Human Capital Management. Of the agency\u2019s 16 major management challenges, its performance plan had goals and measures that were directly related to five of the challenges, goals and measures that were indirectly applicable to five of the challenges and no goals and measures related to six of the challenges, but discussed strategies to address them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named in the report, Mark T.
