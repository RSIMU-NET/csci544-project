The Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2010 criminalized cell phone possession in federal prisons and mandated that GAO study related issues. In response to the mandate, this report addresses (1) how telephone rates for BOP inmates compare with other correctional systems and the implications of lowering rates; (2) the number of cell phones confiscated in BOP and selected states, and any reported impact; and (3) the extent to which BOP and selected states have taken actions to minimize cell phone smuggling, these actions' effectiveness, and how BOP has coordinated internal and state information sharing. GAO reviewed BOP's policies, procedures, and cell phone confiscation data (2008-2010).

The results are not generalizable, but provide insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["BOP's rates for inmate telephone calls typically are lower than selected state and military branch systems that also use telephone revenues to support inmate activities; lowering rates would have several implications. Inmates would benefit from the ability to make cheaper phone calls, but lower rates could result in less revenue and lower profits, and therefore fewer funds available for inmate wages and recreational activities. According to BOP officials, when inmates have fewer opportunities for physical activity, idleness increases, and the risk of violence, escapes, and other disruptions also rises. BOP and selected states confiscated thousands of cell phones in 2010, and these entities believe that rising inmate cell phone use threatens institutional safety and expands criminal activity. All of the BOP officials, as well as officials from all eight of the state departments of correction with whom GAO spoke, cited cell phones as a major security concern, given the potential the phones provide for inmates to have unmonitored conversations that could further criminal activity, such as selling drugs or harassing other individuals. BOP and selected states have taken actions to address contraband cell phone use in their correctional institutions, but BOP could better evaluate existing technologies to maximize its investment decisions. BOP screens visitors and staff to detect contraband and has also tested multiple cell-phone detection technologies. However, BOP has not developed evaluation plans for institutional use to measure the effectiveness of these tests, which could help ensure that such tests generate information needed to make effective policy decisions. Moreover, while BOP has shared detection strategies with state agencies to some extent, BOP's regional offices have only had limited interaction with states, and could increase coordination and knowledge sharing to better identify and benefit from other strategies being used. This is a public version of a sensitive but unclassified - law enforcement sensitive report that GAO issued in July 2011.

Research has shown that such contact reduces the likelihood of inmates\u2019  return to prison once they complete their sentences. BOP records  inmates\u2019 calls and charges inmates rates for telephone use. In recent  years, there have been rising incidents of federal and state inmates using  contraband cell phones to circumvent correctional institutions\u2019 telephone  systems. Some prisoner advocates believe that inmates are increasingly  using contraband cell phones because of the rates correctional  institutions charge for telephone service. However, by circumventing the  correctional institutions\u2019 telephone systems, inmates also avoid the  monitoring of their calls, and a number of reports have demonstrated that  inmates are smuggling in cell phones to coordinate criminal activity, such  as drug sales, assault, and murder. Various federal entities and state  departments of corrections (DOC) have voiced concerns over the  increasing number of contraband cell phones in correctional institutions,  stressing the potential for these devices to facilitate further criminal  misconduct. To help address this issue, the Cell Phone Contraband Act of  2010 criminalized possession of cell phones in federal prisons by defining  them as a \u201cprohibited object\u201d punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not  more than 1 year or both.", "The Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2010 also mandated that we study  both telephone rates and contraband cell phones in prisons. Thus, this  report addresses the following questions:  1. How do BOP\u2019s inmate telephone rates compare to those charged by  other correctional systems; how does BOP use the revenues generated  by its telephone charges; and what are the implications of lowering its  rates?  2. How many cell phones have been confiscated within BOP and selected  state institutions, and what is the reported impact, if any, of cell phone  use on overall prison security and criminal activity?  3. To what extent have BOP and selected state prisons taken actions to  prevent or minimize cell phone smuggling and use; what is known about  the actions\u2019 effectiveness; and how has BOP coordinated information  sharing internally and with states?", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you. DOJ deemed some of the information in the prior report  as sensitive but unclassified - law enforcement sensitive, which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive  information about methods by which cell phones are smuggled into  prisons. In addition, at DOJ\u2019s request, we have omitted information  regarding BOP conclusions on strategies tested and implemented by  BOP to address cell phone smuggling and use. Although the information  provided in this report is more limited in scope, it addresses the same  questions as the sensitive report. Also, the overall methodology used for  both reports is the same.", "To determine how BOP\u2019s prison telephone rates compare to those  charged by other correctional systems, BOP\u2019s use of telephone revenues,  and the implications of lowering rates, we reviewed BOP\u2019s policies and  procedures related to its inmate telephone system, the costs and  revenues of this system, the rates BOP charges inmates, inmate  amenities funded through the system, and data on phone services from  2008 through 2010. We also interviewed and gathered data from BOP  management\u2014including officials with the BOP Trust Fund, which  manages the finances of the inmate telephone system\u2014as well as  officials with the Department of Defense, which also provides phone  services to inmates, in order to determine how their rates compare with  those charged by BOP.

We obtained information  from relevant officials about the steps taken to ensure the accuracy of all  of the above data and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also interviewed BOP officials in the Correctional Programs  Division, which is responsible for ensuring a safe institutional  environment; BOP\u2019s Office of Security Technology (OST), which identifies  and evaluates security technology equipment within BOP, among other  things; and each of BOP\u2019s six regions and four of its institutions. We  selected these institutions based on specific technologies adopted to  defeat cell phones, as well as other challenges posed by inmate  communications. In addition, we interviewed officials from eight state  DOCs. The views of the officials from these BOP institutions and state  departments are not generalizable to other BOP institutions or states, but  do provide valuable insights into issues surrounding cell phones in  prisons. We also researched state laws to gain an understanding of the  types of state statutory provisions that have been adopted to penalize  possession or smuggling of contraband cell phones.", "To determine actions being taken to prevent or minimize cell phone  smuggling, the effectiveness of these actions, and BOP\u2019s coordination of  information sharing, we interviewed and gathered documents from  officials in BOP\u2019s OST, regional offices, and our selected institutions to  learn about agency efforts in testing and evaluating cell phone detection  equipment and how it shares such information internally. We then  compared these efforts with BOP\u2019s program statements governing  technology evaluations, as well as GAO\u2019s internal control standards and  GAO criteria on evaluation plans for new technology tests and  collaboration with other agencies. We also interviewed state correctional  department officials and met with a nonprobability sample of officials from  DOJ\u2019s National Institute of Justice (NIJ); NIJ\u2019s National Law Enforcement  and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC) system; the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC); the Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA); the  Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA); CTIA-the  Wireless Association; and two companies that make cell phone detection  and defeat equipment.

However, limitations and  conditions may be imposed upon an inmate\u2019s telephone privileges to  ensure that these are consistent with other aspects of BOP\u2019s correctional  management responsibilities. For example, the length of telephone calls  is generally limited to 15 minutes, and the warden may restrict or suspend  temporarily an inmate\u2019s regular telephone privilege when there is  reasonable suspicion that the inmate has acted in a way that threatens  the safety, security, or good order of the institution, or the protection of  the public. For many years, BOP provided inmates with collect-call  service only\u2014whereby the receiving party, and not the inmate, bore the  cost of the call. In 1988, BOP began to shift to its current Inmate  Telephone System (ITS), which provides both a collect call and a direct- dial option, emphasizing inmates\u2019 financial responsibility and reducing the  burden on others of inmates\u2019 calls.", "BOP personnel within the individual prisons maintain the ITS. Specifically,  BOP staff are responsible for installing, maintaining, and repairing the  telephone system. Vendors provide the hardware and software that  enable ITS, also known as TRUFONE, to perform the following:  \uf0b7  use voice recognition to identify inmates placing calls;  \uf0b7  provide each inmate with a \u201cpersonal access code,\u201d which allows  inmates\u2019 TRUFONE accounts to be debited for the cost of their calls;  check the inmate\u2019s TRUFONE account to make sure the inmate has  sufficient funds for a one-minute phone call;  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  deny particular inmates access to telephones as warranted; and  \uf0b7 terminate all prison telephone service if security needs dictate.  record all calls automatically;  restrict inmates\u2019 calls to numbers on the inmates\u2019 contact lists;  require placement of calls only from specific telephones;  In addition to direct-dial telephone service, BOP has recently made e-mail  available to inmates in all of its institutions through an electronic- messaging system. Through this electronic-messaging system, inmates  can communicate with a list of contacts, but they cannot access the  Internet. Both inmates and persons in the community with whom they  correspond must consent to having all incoming and outgoing electronic  messages monitored and retained by staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOP\u2019s Trust Fund and the Inmate Amenities It Supports", "paragraphs": ["BOP established commissaries to allow inmates to purchase items not  issued by prisons. Inmates purchase commissary items with funds  available in individual inmate accounts managed by BOP. Funds are  placed into these accounts by friends and family members (through  BOP), or may be earned as wages through work performed in Federal  Prison Industries or other on-site work at an institution (e.g., food service,  laundry). In 1998, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 provided BOP with the authority  to accept revenues and make expenditures from the Commissary Fund of  the Federal Prison System in order to pay for ITS as well as other  prisoner amenities. This authorized trust fund is a self-sustaining  revolving fund account in which BOP deposits revenues generated by  inmate telephone charges through ITS and pays the expenses of ITS  operations\u2014rather than through appropriations. BOP uses the profits (the  amount of revenue that exceeds expenses) from operating the inmate  telephone service, as well as those from the commissary and other  services, to provide inmate amenities, such as employment opportunities  and educational and recreational activities, that are not currently  supported through appropriations. By providing amenities like these  through telephone system profits, BOP is similar to other federal  correctional institutions like those within the Department of Defense. In  particular, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps all charge inmates  rates above cost for telephone service. The Navy uses the profits to  provide items or activities, such as movies and sports contests, for the  benefit of the inmates exclusively, while the Army and the Marine Corps  use the funds to provide amenities to all persons on the base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2010 and BOP\u2019s Process for Addressing Cell Phone Possession", "paragraphs": ["In August 2010, the Cell Phone Contraband Act of 2010 was passed and  amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 to prohibit an inmate of a prison from  possessing, obtaining, or attempting to obtain a cell phone. The Cell  Phone Contraband Act also provided for punishing such possession with  a fine or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. BOP stated that  cell phones are considered hazardous tools, as defined by BOP policy as  tools most likely to be used in an escape attempt or to serve as weapons  capable of doing serious bodily harm to others; or those hazardous to  institutional security or personal safety. According to officials in BOP\u2019s  Correctional Programs Division, when an inmate is caught with a cell  phone, an incident report is filed and the inmate is subject to BOP\u2019s  disciplinary process, which involves an administrative hearing. The  inmate ultimately could face a range of sanctions from transfer to a  higher-security institution to loss of \u201cgood time\u201d or other privileges.

Further, at its 2010  National Conference, NIJ convened a plenary panel to discuss the  detection and defeat of cell phone use in prisons. NIJ also funds the  National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center  (NLECTC) system, which assists state, local, tribal, and federal  correctional agencies, as well as law enforcement and criminal justice  agencies, in addressing technology needs and challenges, such as  contraband cell phones.", "NIJ also hopes to soon establish an interagency working group with  representatives from BOP, the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), and the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA), to continue working on solutions to overcome illicit  cell phone use in prisons, subject to the availability of funds. In  particular, the FCC maintains an important role in combating illicit cell  phone use in prisons because the FCC, in general, executes and  enforces the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, which  prohibits nonfederal entities\u2014such as state correctional institutions\u2014from  intentionally interfering with or blocking radio communications signals,  which include cell phone transmissions. In addition, NTIA is a critical  partner for the research capacity it possesses. Specifically, in December  2009, Congress directed NTIA, in coordination with BOP, FCC, and NIJ,  to develop a plan to investigate and evaluate how wireless jamming,  detection, and other technologies might be used for corrections  applications in federal and state prison institutions. In response to this  congressional direction, in May 2010, NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry  seeking public comment on \u201ctechnologies that would significantly reduce  or eliminate contraband cell phone use without negatively affecting  commercial wireless and public safety services \u2026 in areas surrounding  prisons.\u201d These technologies include the following:  \uf0b7  Jammers: Devices that transmit on the same radio frequencies as  cell phones, disrupting the communication link between the phone  and the cell phone tower, essentially rendering the cell phone  unusable until the jamming stops.  \uf0b7  Managed access systems: Those that intercept, or re-route, certain  cell phone calls (i.e., unauthorized calls that inmates attempt) away  from carrier networks, preventing them from reaching towers and  completing the call.  \uf0b7  Detection systems/devices: Those that locate, track, or identify  unauthorized cell phones by, for example, scanning frequencies within  correctional institutions to detect the location of a caller.", "After analyzing the comments it received, NTIA issued observations on  advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies, as detailed in  appendix I.

According to BOP officials, over the past  12\u201318 months, the inmate telephone service has generated significantly  less revenue as inmates purchased more local minutes and fewer long  distance minutes. Figure 1\u2014which shows the local and long distance  phone minutes used and phone-system revenues for the first quarters of  2009, 2010, and 2011\u2014illustrates this trend.", "BOP officials attribute this shift from long distance to local minute calls to  the emergence of technology that allows inmates\u2019 friends and family who  do not live within the inmates\u2019 local calling area to acquire telephone  numbers local to the inmates\u2019 prison locations. As a result, long distance  calls that previously cost inmates $0.23 per minute can now be made for  the local rate of $0.06 per minute\u2014a savings of more than 70 percent on  a 15-minute call. BOP officials told us that this trend has prompted them  to consider eliminating the distinction between local and long distance call  rates and instead set a uniform price for calls of either type that would fall  somewhere between the current local and long distance rates. According  to officials, this would lower rates for approximately 84 percent of the calls  made by inmates that are long distance. BOP officials told us that while  they anticipate losing some of the revenue generated by long distance  minutes, they believe the sale of access minutes for their electronic  messaging system, which has recently become available in all federal  prisons, will compensate for some lost revenue. BOP officials told us  that the number of electronic message minutes sold in 2010, at $0.05 per  minute, was more than twice the number sold in 2009, and they expect  even more minutes to be sold in 2011.", "With respect to telephone system costs, in fiscal year 2010, BOP spent  approximately $39 million to operate the telephone system. About   $9.7 million of this amount covered the costs of the telephone system\u2019s  physical resources, including hardware and software, which were  purchased through competitively bid, governmentwide contracts. Just  over $22 million covered labor costs, including technical, operational, and  administrative costs of the inmate telephone system at each of the  institutions. Another $7.5 million covered personnel salaries and benefits  of headquarters staff, who provide administration and program  management, including policy and procedures development, and training.", "BOP\u2019s telephone system generated more than $34 million in profits in  fiscal year 2010. Since BOP both receives and disburses money to pay  for telephone service operations through its Trust Fund, profits from  telephone service are also retained therein. In fiscal year 2010, BOP\u2019s  Trust Fund had total revenues, which included collections from BOP\u2019s  commissary services, of $331 million. After paying all related costs for  phones and commissary provisions, there were Trust Fund revenues in  excess of expenses of over $46 million and BOP\u2019s phone service was  responsible for $34 million, or 74 percent of this amount, while Trust Fund  profits from all other sources amounted to almost $12 million, as shown in  figure 2.", "BOP officials told us that BOP uses revenue from its Trust Fund to pay for  various inmate amenities, such as wages to inmates and recreational  materials\u2014as illustrated by table 2. However, by law, there are some  specific inmate amenities, among other items, that cannot be purchased  with Trust Fund revenues. BOP officials told us that all aspects of  BOP\u2019s work are audited annually by an independent auditing and  accounting firm, including BOP\u2019s financial records; officials told us that  BOP has been certified as in compliance since 1999.", "Lowering the rates it charges inmates for phone calls would have several  implications for BOP and inmates. The primary advantage would be that  inmates would incur lower costs for making calls. This could possibly  encourage greater communication between inmates and their families,  which BOP has stated facilitates the reintegration of inmates into society  upon release from prison. In contrast, reducing inmate telephone rates  could also have some disadvantages. BOP officials told us that lowered  rates would likely result in lower revenues for the Trust Fund and  therefore less profit, unless some provision was made to replace the lost  revenue. With fewer profits, BOP would have less Trust Fund money to  spend on inmate amenities. As a result, unless BOP recouped these  revenues from other sources, BOP would have to reduce the wages it  pays inmates for their labor and/or scale back the number and type of  other educational and recreational activities it currently offers using  revenue from the Trust Fund. According to BOP officials, such reductions  could make prisons more dangerous to manage and more expensive to  operate. For example, BOP officials said that inmates perform electrical  work, which keeps prisons well lighted, as well as janitorial services,  which preserve order and cleanliness\u2014both of which contribute to  institutional safety and reduce inmate idleness. According to BOP  officials, inmate idleness increases the risk of violence, escapes, and  other disruptions. BOP officials also reported that inmate work  programs\u2014which teach inmates, many of whom have never held a  traditional job before, work skills and a work ethic (e.g., coming to work on  time, taking directions from a supervisor, working effectively with co- workers)\u2014can help inmates assimilate back into society upon completion  of their prison sentence. This helps to reduce recidivism and thus  contributes to public safety.", "If BOP wanted to lower inmate telephone rates while maintaining the  current level of inmate services, BOP could explore one of two  approaches: (1) recoup lost revenue resulting from lowered telephone  rates by increasing prices inmates pay for other services, such as  commissary items or electronic messaging system access, or (2) seek  authorization allowing BOP\u2019s general appropriation to be available for  inmate amenities in addition to the funds from the Trust Fund. Regarding  the first approach, BOP officials told us that they already receive inmate  complaints related to current commissary prices, and as a result, the  officials indicated reluctance to choose this option. In addition, raising  commissary prices could result in inmates purchasing fewer items, and  coupled with decreased telephone rates, overall Trust Fund revenues  could decline, resulting in less funding available for inmate amenities,  including wages. With respect to the second approach, if BOP reduced  rates for telephone service and was given authority to replace the lost  revenue with its appropriations, BOP could maintain both the inmate  wage rate and the type and variation of inmate activity, and keep the  prices inmates pay for other services from increasing. However, to  accomplish this, BOP would have to seek authorization allowing BOP\u2019s  general appropriation to be available for inmate amenities, in addition to  the funds from the Trust Fund.

For example, officials we interviewed  from two of the eight states indicated that based on their experience,  most phones were found in prison camps, while officials from five other  states said that their states have confiscated greater numbers of cell  phones in more secure institutions. Officials from the eighth state said the  number of cell phones found in camps and secure institutions was about  equal. Three states also attribute the increase in cell phone confiscations  to the availability of smaller, cheaper cell phones and additional search  and detection efforts they have employed to identify cell phones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOP and Officials from Selected States Reported That Contraband Cell Phones Can Threaten the Safety within Institutions and Expand Criminal Activity", "paragraphs": ["Officials we contacted from BOP\u2019s Correctional Programs Division, six  regional offices, and four institutions\u2014as well as from each of the eight  states we selected for our review\u2014all cited contraband cell phones as an  issue of serious concern. According to BOP officials in particular, inmates  with cell phones are able to circumvent the approved prison telephone  system and thus are able to hold unmonitored conversations. This, the  BOP officials reported, could lead to several actions that threaten the  security of prisons and expand criminal activity both inside and outside of  a prison institution. For example, inmates could use cell phones to  arrange the delivery of contraband drugs or other goods, transmit  information on prison staff to or from noninmates, harass witnesses or  other individuals, or potentially coordinate an escape.", "BOP management does not currently compile any specific data or  prepare comprehensive reports of situations where contraband cell  phones were used to conduct criminal activity in federal prisons\u2014nor do  DOJ or the Cell Phone Contraband Act require that these things be done.  However, BOP officials we interviewed from two of the regions provided  examples of criminal activity linked to cell phones. In one case, in January  2011, an inmate at a federal institution was sentenced to an additional 14  years in prison for running an identity-theft ring using a contraband cell  phone. This inmate and his accomplices obtained personal information on  credit card holders at various retailers and impersonated these account  holders to fraudulently purchase over $254,000 worth of merchandise.", "In addition, officials from seven of our selected eight states provided  examples of specific criminal actions that occurred as a result of inmate  cell phone use. For example, in October 2008, a death row inmate in a  Texas state prison used a smuggled cell phone to threaten a state  Senator and his family. This same phone was also used by a number of  other inmates within the prison. In addition, in 2007, an inmate in a  Maryland detention center ordered the murder of a state witness via a cell  phone. In 2005, an inmate in a New Jersey state prison\u2014serving time for  previously shooting at two police officers\u2014used a contraband cell phone  to order the murder of his girlfriend, who had previously testified against  him during a trial.", "BOP and officials in selected states acknowledged that definitively linking  the possession of a contraband cell phone to an individual can be  challenging. For example, officials we interviewed from BOP\u2019s  Correctional Programs Division, and two of the four BOP institutions that  we interviewed say that cell phones are often found on the grounds of an  institution or in \u201ccommon areas\u201d such as bathrooms or television rooms  rather than in the possession of an inmate directly. Cell phones are also  frequently passed around and used by several different inmates, making  it difficult to link the ownership of a cell phone to a particular inmate.", "In order to gain useful information\u2014such as phone numbers or text  messages\u2014that could link a cell phone to an individual inmate or related  criminal activity, BOP conducts forensic investigations of the cell phones  it confiscates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BOP and Selected States Have Implemented Cell Phone Search and Detection Technologies, but BOP Could Evaluate Technologies Better and Increase Coordination", "paragraphs": ["BOP and the eight selected states we contacted have taken steps to  address growing contraband cell phone smuggling and use in their  correctional institutions, but BOP could evaluate existing technologies  better to maximize its investment decisions. BOP has tested multiple cell  phone detection technologies; however, it has not developed evaluation  plans to measure the effectiveness of these tests. Moreover, BOP has  shared information with state agencies to some extent on strategies for  combating contraband cell phones, but BOP\u2019s regional offices could  pursue more direct connections with states in accordance with relevant  BOP policy that encourages them to do so. By enhancing information  sharing, BOP could gain knowledge from states\u2019 practices and lessons  learned and likewise, states\u2019 practices could be better informed by  learning more about BOP\u2019s efforts related to cell phone detection."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BOP and Selected States Have Implemented a Variety of Strategies to Prevent and Minimize Cell Phone Smuggling and Use", "paragraphs": ["BOP and officials from all eight selected state correctional departments  we contacted have developed multiple methods for preventing cell  phones from entering prison institutions and being used by inmates.  These include search procedures for visitors and correctional staff as well  as cell phone detection technologies, which identify the use of cell phones  once they have reached the inmate population.", "Through policy memorandums and program statements that govern its  protocols, BOP has implemented agencywide screening procedures for  all visitors, contractors, and staff for detecting contraband items. These  procedures include the use of x-ray screening machines, walk-through  metal detectors, and hand-held metal detectors. Though these  procedures are not cell phone specific, BOP officials told us they  represent a concerted effort in keeping contraband out of prisons in  general. See appendix II for more information on the direction that BOP  provides for screening of visitors, staff, and inmates.", "In addition to its search procedures, BOP has employed technology to  stem the rise in cell phone smuggling. In particular, BOP has  implemented two large-scale sensor-based cell phone detection systems  at two of its prison institutions, a technology BOP officials described as  being the only effective solution at this time. The Radio Frequency (RF)  sensor based system detects the presence of cell phones and displays  their approximate location using a monitored computer screen.", "In April 2007, BOP installed the original prototype sensor system in three  housing units within one building, which included the purchase of a  server, computer work station, and switches. According to BOP officials,  the manufacturer provided the actual sensors and software at minimal  costs in order to assist in research and development for the project, while  other fiber and wiring were obtained from surplus supplies at no cost to  BOP. Additionally, BOP officials told us that BOP staff installed the sensor  system, helping cut costs that an outside party might have otherwise  charged for installation. Because of these factors, BOP officials said a  similar system installed by a contractor at other prison institutions would  be more expensive. For example, BOP officials told us that it cost them  approximately seven times more than the original system to install  equipment for a newer-generation version of BOP\u2019s prototype RF sensor  system at a second prison institution in December 2010, even though  BOP officials were able to install it themselves as they had in the first  location. According to BOP officials, the second system covers 11  housing units in both an institution and prison camp, and is also  configured so that officials throughout the prison can view areas of cell  phone detection, which BOP officials said accounted for a higher  installation cost.", "We found that all eight of the selected state officials we interviewed cited  using entrance screening practices such as use of walk-through metal  detectors or x-ray machines at their secure institutions; and, six of these  states are using different cell phone detection techniques that BOP has  not yet employed, such as canines and managed access.", "Additional information on cell phone detection strategies tested or  deployed by BOP and selected state DOCs\u2014as well as these officials\u2019  perspectives on their utility\u2014is deemed law enforcement sensitive and  not included in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOP Has Steps in Place to Identify Promising Cell Phone Detection Technologies, but Lacks Sound Evaluation Plans", "paragraphs": ["BOP takes several steps to determine which cell phone detection  technologies to test. BOP\u2019s OST is tasked with identifying promising  technology in the area of cell phone detection, and all five OST staff  share responsibility for testing and evaluating technology security  initiatives throughout BOP. To make determinations about which  technology BOP should test, OST officials told us that they familiarize  themselves through working groups with other federal and state  organizations and discussions with all interested product vendors with  equipment that other federal or state correctional entities use. OST  officials also explained that they have developed criteria over several  years that they believe should be met before they will test any given  approach. These four criteria are:  1.  The equipment must work without affecting or collecting information  from the general public located outside the correctional facilities\u2019  secure perimeter.  2.  The solution should have no legal restrictions.  3.  The equipment must work with all cellular phone protocols.  4.  The overall cost of equipment and installation must be fair and  reasonable.", "Once OST is satisfied that the technology meets most of these criteria,  OST tests the equipment at BOP headquarters and then sends it out to  one or more prison institutions for testing by staff in a prison environment.  Once tested, institutional staff then provide OST with a brief written  response or phone call regarding their views of the equipment\u2019s  effectiveness. Once OST receives feedback from the prison institution,  OST may then send the equipment to another institution for further testing  by prison staff.", "While BOP has put the above criteria in place, it does not have a sound  evaluation plan that includes, among other dimensions, criteria or  standards for determining how well the technology works. OST officials  told us that they rely on the process discussed above to make decisions  regarding the effectiveness of cell phone detection equipment, but they  acknowledged that the tests each institution conducts may vary in scope  and rigor and that they have no evaluation plan to govern this process.  OST officials told us they previously attempted to distribute consistent  evaluation questions to institutional staff testing each technology, using  an \u201cInitial Technology Assessment\u201d form, but that OST abandoned this  practice because it rarely received the form back from prison institutions.  Further, officials told us that when institutions do respond with technology  test results, OST receives very little feedback. OST officials told us that  institutional staff have limited time and resources for assisting them with  cell phone detection technology evaluations because such testing is in  addition to their normal duties. Also, OST has stated that some  institutions are more eager than others for the opportunity to test new  technology; thus, some institutions may not have the interest or expertise  to contribute information to a technology assessment. In addition,  according to OST, the role of the individual conducting the test can vary  by institution. Specifically, equipment could be tested by a correctional  officer, a lieutenant, or a computer specialist, a situation that OST officials  said results in inconsistent testing methods because these individuals  have different skills and knowledge levels. In addition, the OST official  tasked with addressing contraband cell phone detection issues told us  that BOP regions and local prison institutions regularly test cell phone  detection devices and approaches, as well as other types of equipment,  without OST\u2019s knowledge and most often do not inform OST of their  findings. For example, the official explained that in some instances,  vendors notify OST of technology tests conducted at local prison  institutions that OST was unaware of at the time. GAO\u2019s internal control  standards require that an agency\u2019s organizational structure clearly define  key areas of authority and responsibility, and establish appropriate lines  of reporting. Thus, while OST applies its criteria to screen new  technologies before sending them to prison institutions for testing, it lacks  clearly defined responsibilities for the individuals conducting tests and  sound evaluation methods to fully evaluate such technologies once  institutional testing has been completed. As a result, BOP has  implemented\u2014and discarded\u2014some technologies without fully evaluating  them and documenting results as discussed below.", "We have previously reported that for tests of new technology, a sound,  well-developed and documented evaluation plan should include:  1.  well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  2.  criteria or standards for determining program performance;  3.  clearly articulated methodology, including sound sampling methods,  determination of appropriate sample size for the evaluation design,  and a strategy for comparing the pilot results with other efforts;  4.  a clear plan that details the type and source of data necessary to  evaluate the pilot, methods for data collection, and the timing and  frequency of data collection; and  5.  a detailed data analysis plan to track the program\u2019s performance and  evaluate the final results of the project.", "Certain details on the tests OST has conducted and the conclusions it  has drawn have not been included here due to law enforcement  sensitivities.", "OST officials explained that BOP has a policy, called Pilot Initiatives,  Approval and Evaluation, that identifies numerous criteria that should be  followed when implementing and evaluating pilot programs. The policy  includes practices such as defining goals and objectives, developing an  evaluation plan, describing costs for the program, and identifying  advantages and disadvantages related to a broader implementation of the  technology, all of which align with established best practices. According to  OST officials, however, they have not designated the testing phase of any  cell phone technologies as \u201ca pilot\u201d by the definition included in their  policy, and OST does not apply the policy to any of their testing. In our  view, BOP could benefit by using its pilot initiative-evaluation criteria as a  best practice when evaluating cell phone detection tests to better inform  decisions about whether investments on a larger scale are warranted.", "When we requested reports and documentation\u2014including evaluation  plans and reports\u2014resulting from tests of the technologies that OST  explained to us, officials sometimes provided us with brief overviews of  testing methods that did not meet best practices. For example, OST told  us it has not subjected its RF sensor system\u2014currently deployed in two  institutions\u2014to any final assessment or evaluation outlining when and  how BOP would determine whether adopting this system on a wider scale  would be feasible and effective. On the other hand, in one instance, OST  officials told us BOP did adhere to more rigorous evaluation procedures.  Specifically, with assistance from OST, one prison institution has  deployed the Ground Observation Reconnaissance Transmitter (GORT)  in one of its institutions. When testing the GORT system, officials  identified system goals and objectives; identified criteria for determining  program performance; completed a final product evaluation that  documented advantages and disadvantages of the system; and  concluded that GORT successfully reduced smuggling of contraband  including cell phones at the test location. OST officials told us the  assessment of the GORT differed from assessments of its other  technologies because the level of evaluation performed was at the  discretion of the local prison institution implementing the system. OST  officials agree that developing a sound evaluation approach that could be  used by prison institution staff for testing cell phone detection  technologies would strengthen BOP\u2019s approach for combating the issue  of contraband cell phones in prisons. Having an evaluation plan for  selected cell phone detection technology that follows BOP pilot evaluation  criteria or other best practices could help BOP more effectively measure  how well each piece of equipment functions. Moreover, these steps could  better allow OST to better inform BOP leadership\u2019s decisions regarding  the adoption of such technology and the associated resource allocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOP Could Take Steps to Enhance Information Sharing with States", "paragraphs": ["BOP reports that OST collaborates with various state-level agencies, but  has opportunities to improve coordination between its regional offices and  states in identifying effective strategies and technologies for combating  contraband cell phones in prisons.

This policy notes that  \u201ccommunication and understanding among  institutions and regional  offices and their local communities will be enhanced by formal and  informal contacts between  staff and local agencies and  organizations.\u201d It further states that \u201cRegional Directors and Wardens  shall include in their lists of annual accomplishments a summary of all  organizations with which their institutions or regional offices are formally  associated, including a general statement about any significant  contribution to  operations or criminal justice relationships that have  resulted from those associations.\u201d Further, we have previously reported  on the importance of interagency coordination and information sharing  across federal, regional, state, and local government entities. We also  previously reported that making efficient use of security technology to  supplement and reinforce other security measures is a key practice for  protecting federal institutions, but that the type of technology to use  should be carefully analyzed.", "OST, located at BOP headquarters in Washington, D.C., reported  coordination with state-level agencies through direct information sharing,  professional organizations, and established working groups. In particular,  ASCA officials told us BOP coordinates with their group through panels,  demonstrations, and briefings. For example, OST also participates in  multiple NIJ/NLECTC technology working groups (TWG) involving cell  phone detection. OST also coordinates with representatives from  multiple state DOCs on an individual basis after establishing relationships  as members of professional organizations, committees, and working  groups. For example, OST provided the New York correctional  department with 30-day access to a cell phone detection device after the  state demonstrated interest in the technology. According to OST, BOP  has also shared information on its practices for detecting contraband cell  phones with states such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Florida.", "We corroborated BOP headquarters\u2019 level of coordination with these  groups and multiple state DOCs. At the regional level, we found that  BOP\u2019s regional offices had limited coordination with states regarding  contraband cell phone issues. For example, one BOP regional director  stated that his region coordinated with officials from ASCA, but said he  has not coordinated with state entities because such coordination occurs  through BOP officials in headquarters. Another regional director  concurred, reporting that nobody in his region participates in any task  forces, working groups, or other collaborative efforts with federal or state  entities concerning cell phone detection issues because this should be  occurring through headquarters\u2019 outreach. As discussed earlier, some  states have taken efforts that BOP does not currently use to combat  contraband cell phones, such as canine detection units. Thus, enhanced  coordination could allow BOP to better leverage information on potentially  employing these state efforts to combat contraband cell phones.  Likewise, while BOP has shared practices with states in the past, OST  officials agreed that BOP could improve coordination efforts by its  regional offices as well.", "In addition, while BOP policy states that \u201cover the years, formal and  informal employee relationships with organizations, such as advisory  committees, law enforcement coordinating councils, criminal justice  councils, and state and local planning organizations, have enhanced   operations,\u201d we found limited BOP regional-office interaction with  state and local government agencies concerning contraband cell-phone  smuggling and use. For example, according to BOP officials, Regional  Directors and Wardens annually prepare a Performance Work Plan that  lists, among other things, efforts made in establishing relations and  collaborating with other state and local correctional and law enforcement  entities in their communities. However, BOP officials have informed us  that these plans do not provide a level of detail\u2014such as including  lessons learned on cell-phone-smuggling approaches and the  technologies to address them\u2014to inform BOP\u2019s central office of the  nature of issues discussed. Our review of the three work plans with which  BOP provided us confirmed the limitations in the information they  contained. As we have previously reported, by having a process in place  to obtain and share information on potential threats, agencies can better  understand the risk they face and more effectively determine what  preventive measures should be implemented. Regularly reaching out to  coordinate with key stakeholders, particularly at the state level, to learn  about their cell phone\u2013combating efforts could help improve BOP\u2019s ability  to address cell phone smuggling and use in prisons. Conversely, BOP\u2019s  outreach and coordination with states at the regional level\u2014to highlight  practices BOP believes are useful\u2014could help inform state practices as  well.

BOP has reviewed a number of technologies and adopted large- scale sensor detection systems at two of its institutions in an attempt to  combat this problem. BOP does have opportunities, however, to enhance  assessments of how well these technologies can work. For example, if  BOP formulated well-developed and well-documented plans for testing  and evaluating cell phone detection and defeat technologies\u2014including  the establishment of goals, objectives, and criteria\u2014and defined  evaluation-related responsibilities for individuals performing the tests, it  would be better positioned to make decisions before adopting these  technologies. BOP also has opportunities to better leverage what states  are learning in their attempts to better detect and prevent cell phone  smuggling. In particular, if BOP encouraged its regional offices to improve  coordination with its local counterparts, BOP could be better positioned to  track and monitor what states were experimenting with and what their  evaluation results have been.
