More than 1,000 ASM gold mine  sites of varying size operate in the DRC, primarily in remote provinces in  the eastern region, commonly employing groups of 30 to 300 miners (see  app. II for a map showing DRC provinces). In parts of the DRC, artisanal  and small-scale mining provides alternative employment opportunities in  the absence of a viable agricultural sector. In addition, mining\u2014including  ASM gold mining\u2014provides miners with cash-on-hand and requires little  or no specialized knowledge.", "ASM gold miners work as diggers, rock crushers, sorters, and traders.  Most ASM gold miners use shovels, picks, and other rudimentary tools,  such as mining pans. Because of the scarcity of mechanical equipment in  some areas, ASM gold miners grind the mined gold manually into a  powder, often with a pair of rocks or a tire rim, and extract gold from this  powder using a sluice, mining pan, and washing pool and sometimes  using hazardous chemicals such as mercury (see fig. 1).", "According to a 2016 study by the International Peace Information Service  (IPIS), ASM gold mining sites in the eastern DRC annually produced a  combined total of about 12 metric tons of gold, with an estimated value of  $437 million, in 2013 through 2015. This study found that a miner  produced an average of 0.17 grams per day, worth about $6.07 on global  markets, but retained earnings of $1.84 to $2.75 per day. However,  significant portions of many miners\u2019 wages went toward paying off loans  (i.e., prefinancing) that the miners incurred for food, tools, and other basic  necessities. As a result, when production levels were low, miners could  easily enter a cycle of indebtedness.", "According to the government of the DRC, the average annual official ASM  gold production in 2010 through 2016 was about 279 kilograms (0.28  metric tons) of gold, with an estimated value of $10.1 million per year.

Generally, there are two types of local traders: petit  negociants, who buy and sell small quantities (one-half gram or less),  and grande negociants, who buy and sell larger quantities (1 to 50  kilograms) of gold. According to a USAID report, registered local  traders in these provinces are subject to an average provincial tax of  about 1 percent on sales volume.", "National exporters, known as comptoirs, register with the national  government to export gold purchased from the local traders.

These sources  indicate that smuggling activities often begin at the mine site and involve  both registered and unregistered actors. For example, ASM gold miners  mine for gold at undesignated sites and sell it to both registered and  unregistered local traders. Unregistered traders purchase gold at or  near mining areas and either sell the gold to larger registered or  unregistered traders or exporters located in regional trading centers in the  DRC\u2014for example, in Bukavu, South Kivu Province, or Butembo, North  Kivu Province\u2014or smuggle the gold from the DRC themselves, according  to USAID and UNGoE reports reflecting fieldwork completed in 2014 and  2016. Registered local traders also participate in smuggling by selling  gold to unregistered exporters and to regional and global buyers outside  the DRC. Additionally, registered exporters participate in smuggling by  underreporting their exports of ASM gold to avoid taxes, according to  reports reflecting fieldwork completed in 2014 through 2016. A UNGoE  study estimated that unreported exports of ASM gold from the DRC and  neighboring countries in the first 9 months of 2015 amounted to about  $200 million. Some of the factors that contribute to smuggling include  limited government control over the remote areas where ASM gold is  primarily produced, inadequate infrastructure, and corruption, according  to reports we reviewed and DRC government officials we interviewed.  DRC government officials told us that smuggling is also a consequence of  weak border enforcement. Reports we reviewed indicate that the  smuggling of ASM gold from the DRC has resulted in a substantial loss of  tax revenue.", "Most ASM gold produced in the DRC is smuggled through regional  buyers in neighboring African countries and then to Dubai, UAE,  according to several reports. UNGoE, OECD, and NGO officials told us  that gold buyers located outside the DRC\u2014for example, in Uganda\u2014 often rely on networks of traders who purchase gold at mines in the  eastern DRC and smuggle it out of the country. These sometimes- complex supply chain networks include traders and exporters who are  often from other countries in the region or from China, India, the Middle  East, or Europe, according to an OECD representative. Reports we  reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed also noted that ASM gold  smuggled from the DRC is typically transported from Dubai to other  international markets such as India or Switzerland.", "Since 2012, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, a UAE government  entity, has provided guidelines on responsible sourcing to gold refiners  through its accreditation program. However, joining the program is  voluntary, and the entity\u2019s jurisdiction does not include all refineries in the  UAE, according to Dubai Multi Commodities Centre officials. In  interviews, Dubai government officials and refiners and a representative  of an auditing firm told us that accredited refiners generally do not  purchase gold directly from the DRC or most adjoining countries (see  app. II for a map showing the countries adjoining the DRC). Furthermore,  these individuals noted that refiners take various actions to ensure that  gold sourced from these countries does not enter their supply chains.  However, the refiners also acknowledged having purchased gold in the  local gold market in Dubai (known as the gold souk), despite the fact that,  according to a UNGoE report, traders and jewelers operating in the souk  may have purchased gold from the DRC. In interviews, traders and  jewelers at the gold souk told us that they required minimal  documentation and generally did not ask questions about country of origin  when buying gold. For example, one trader told us he was willing to  purchase up to 50 kilograms of gold without any source-of-origin  documentation.

However, the widespread availability  of gold in remote, difficult-to-access areas of the eastern DRC and the  lack of a functioning traceability system allow armed groups to operate at  gold mine sites with minimal government and international oversight.  According to reports we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed,  interference by armed groups of state and nonstate actors occurs  primarily at mine sites through, among other things, illegal taxation and  control of mining areas, pillaging, and forced labor. For example, a 2016  IPIS study found that, as of 2015, an estimated 64 percent of ASM gold  miners worked at mines with state and nonstate armed group  interference. Armed groups have also been known to operate illegal  road barriers, where they collect revenue from miners or traders  transporting gold. Furthermore, according to the IPIS study and UNGoE  officials, most instances of armed group interference at mining sites  involve illegal taxation. As of 2016, among the conflict minerals, gold  provided by far the most significant financial benefit to armed groups,  according to UNGoE.", "Elements of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  (FARDC) constitute the largest armed presence and source of  interference at gold mine sites, according to the 2016 IPIS study.  According to DRC government officials, although FARDC is present to  maintain security at or around gold mine sites, some undisciplined  FARDC elements have interfered at mining sites. However, these officials  noted that the military is working to bring such elements under control by  taking legal action against FARDC officers and soldiers found to be in  violation of the law. In addition, a report by the Congo Research Group,  based on fieldwork conducted in 2015, indicates that fragmentation has  greatly increased among illegal nonstate armed groups in eastern DRC.  With the disappearance or weakening of armed groups such as the  March 23 Movement and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of  Rwanda from the DRC, illegal armed groups are now smaller and more  fragmented, tending to pillage mines rather than impose permanent  control, according to IPIS representatives.

ITOA relies on a system of tamper- proof envelopes and agents to track and certify the source and chain of  custody of gold. The DRC government seeks to implement ITOA at  mining sites that have been validated as \u201cgreen\u201d (i.e., conflict free, with no  child labor) and are located in officially designated ZEAs. According to  USAID documents, the DRC government aims to pilot ITOA at two mine  sites in the Maniema and South Kivu provinces and to scale the system  on the basis of the pilot. DRC officials told us that they expect the ITOA  pilot to be launched in the summer of 2017.", "However, the limited number of mine sites that have been validated and  thus licensed to operate, as well as the relatively high provincial taxes in  the mining sector in the DRC compared with taxes in neighboring  countries, as reported by USAID and UNGoE, continue to limit incentives  for sourcing conflict-free ASM gold. For example, as of April 2016, only  37 of more than 1,000 ASM gold mine sites had been validated as green,  according to a DRC government accredited joint validated mission. The  government\u2019s ability to validate mines has been hindered by factors such  as insecure conditions and lack of funding, according to a 2015 report by  the Enough Project. Furthermore, relatively high government taxes  discourage actors along the supply chain from selling gold through legal  channels, according to reports we reviewed and stakeholders we  interviewed. A USAID report found that regional tax rates in the DRC and  neighboring countries had been largely equalized but that provincial taxes  in the DRC remained high.

USAID officials explained that their current focus is on identifying London  Bullion Market Association (LBMA) refiners, who examine their supply  chains more closely. Additionally, ongoing security risks affect the  implementation of pilot projects, according to USAID progress reports.

This official also noted that in 2014, the  DRC government appointed a Personal Representative to the President  on Sexual Violence and Child Recruitment to advise the President on  sexual violence issues, ensuring that sexual violence remains on the  government\u2019s agenda. More recently, the DRC government and the  United Nations have expressed interest in exploring linkages between  mining and sexual violence, according to this official. However, the official  told us that while reports suggest a link between mining and sexual  violence in the region, the UN and the DRC government have not been  able to prove such a linkage because of limited resources for travel to the  areas where mining occurs and the limited availability of women with  specialized knowledge to investigate these issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the SEC, State, and USAID for  comment.

We reviewed these reports for methodological rigor, relevance, and  timeliness to ensure that they were sufficiently reliable to support their  own conclusions or conclusions we made based on their work. We also  reviewed these reports\u2019 methodologies related to site selection, sources  and quality of evidence, and the nature and timing of fieldwork in the  DRC. We reviewed U.S. agency documents, such as a 2015 USAID- funded report related to conflict minerals in the DRC, as well as USAID  internal documents that included a program implementation plan and  annual and quarterly internal progress reports on responsible sourcing of  ASM gold in the DRC. We also reviewed annual reports by the United  Nations Group of Experts (UNGoE) from 2011 through 2016, annual  baseline reports on the DRC by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) from 2014 and 2015, and reports by  NGOs such as the Enough Project and Global Witness. (For a complete  listing of the documents we reviewed, see the bibliography at the end of  this report.) In reviewing these reports, we focused on discussion of the  ASM gold supply chain; associated barriers and incentives, if any; and  efforts to encourage responsible sourcing. We also interviewed  Department of State (State), USAID, and United Nations (UN) officials  and OECD and NGO representatives. We traveled to Dubai, United Arab  Emirates, where we interviewed officials from the Ministry of Economy  and Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, representatives of gold refineries,  accounting firms, local traders, and jewelers. We interviewed DRC  government officials in Santa Clara, California, and Washington, D.C.,  regarding the local supply chain for gold and efforts to ensure responsible  sourcing.", "To address our third objective, we identified and assessed any  information on sexual violence in eastern DRC and the three adjoining  countries\u2014Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi\u2014that had been published or  become otherwise available since we issued our August 2016 report on  sexual violence in these areas. We discussed the collection of sexual  violence-related data in the DRC and adjoining countries, including  population-based survey data and case-file data, during interviews with  State and USAID officials and with NGO representatives and researchers  whom we interviewed for our prior review of sexual violence rates in  eastern DRC and adjoining countries.
