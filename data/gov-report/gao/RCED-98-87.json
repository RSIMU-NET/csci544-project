Partly because of the potentially high costs to clean contaminated sites in accordance with federal and state environmental laws, businesses have often chosen to locate on uncontaminated sites outside of urban areas, known as greenfields. Consequently, cities can lose tax revenues and employment opportunities. The Congress has been very interested in supporting initiatives to promote the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields and has considered several legislative proposals to address this goal. In the meantime, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented several brownfield initiatives and has been setting aside portions of its budget to fund them.", "To help ensure that EPA is using these funds to maximize the abilities of state, local, and tribal governments to assess, clean up, and redevelop brownfields, you first asked us to determine the activities EPA has supported with funds targeted for brownfields in its budgets for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Subsequently, you asked us to focus specifically on two program categories of brownfield expenditures\u2014the outreach, technical assistance, and research category and the job training category\u2014because they are not as directly related to assessing sites for the extent of contamination present, a key first step toward cleanup, as the other program categories. Specifically, for the two program categories, you asked us to identify any grants and agreements EPA awarded since fiscal year 1993\u2014the first year the agency began its brownfield efforts\u2014to determine (1) the criteria and process EPA used to award these grants and agreements, (2) the uses recipients made of these funds, and (3) the monitoring and the oversight EPA provided for them. In responding to these audit objectives, we reviewed EPA\u2019s files for the 24 grants and agreements in these two program categories that had been exclusively or partially used for brownfield activities.

Usually, the contamination is less extensive than sites on EPA\u2019s priority list for cleanup. We have reported that liability and other concerns have deterred many potential developers from using brownfields and that, instead, they use uncontaminated sites in suburban areas referred to as greenfields. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) authorizes EPA to clean up hazardous waste sites and to compel parties responsible for contamination to perform or pay for the cleanups. Developers\u2019 avoidance of brownfields has contributed to a loss of employment opportunities for city residents, a loss of tax revenues for city governments, and an increase in urban sprawl.", "To encourage more redevelopment of brownfields and promote cleanups, the Congress has considered several legislative proposals, both as separate bills and as part of legislation to reauthorize the Superfund program, that would help address liability concerns and provide economic incentives. In November 1993, EPA introduced the Brownfield Economic Redevelopment Initiative, for which the Outreach and Special Projects Staff\u2014referred to in this report as the brownfield program office\u2014has primary responsibility. This office reports to the Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response, who also manages the Superfund program. The brownfield initiative is a commitment by EPA to help communities revitalize brownfields, both environmentally and economically, and mitigate potential health risks. EPA has begun four major efforts to implement this initiative: (1) providing grants for brownfield pilot projects for site assessment and cleanup planning; (2) clarifying liability and other issues associated with cleaning up sites to return them to productive use; (3) building partnerships and outreach for brownfield redevelopment among federal agencies, state and local governments, and communities; and (4) fostering local job development and training initiatives related to brownfield activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Is Using Most of Its Brownfield Funding to Help State, Local, and Tribal Governments Assess Sites and Build Voluntary Cleanup Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessment Pilot Projects", "paragraphs": ["EPA funds assessment pilot projects through cooperative agreements with state, local, and tribal governments, which use the funds to assess, identify, characterize, and plan cleanup activities at contaminated sites targeted for redevelopment.

EPA\u2019s Outreach and Special Projects Staff awarded funds to nonprofit organizations if their unsolicited proposals addressed one of the following four broad criteria:increase community involvement in brownfields; promote the redevelopment of brownfields; provide for site assessment and cleanup; and promote the principal of sustainable development\u2014that future economic well-being depends on the ability to sustain a healthy environment and productive, renewable natural resources.", "The managers said they often rejected proposals that did not meet at least one of the four criteria, but they could not document the number and type of rejected proposals.", "According to the brownfield program managers, they used the following process to approve the 24 awards we reviewed. If a proposal met at least one of the four criteria, it went through an internal EPA and, under some circumstances, an external review process. The brownfield program managers first checked their computerized tracking system of all federally funded outreach, technical assistance, research, and job training activities to ensure that the proposal would not duplicate ongoing awards. They then sent various proposals to other EPA offices, such as the Office of Research and Development and the Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, that had conducted similar activities for their concurrence. They also sent proposals to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to determine if the action complied with existing law, although they were not required to do this to approve an award. Furthermore, they sent certain proposals to other federal agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that had conducted similar activities for review of the proposals\u2019 technical and scientific merit.", "The brownfield program managers explained that EPA did not use a process whereby organizations had to compete for outreach, technical assistance, research, and job training funds as it used to make funding awards in some of the other brownfield program categories, such as assessment pilot projects. This is because, generally, the organization submitting an outreach or job training proposal serves a unique group of constituents that is affected by brownfields or has unique brownfield expertise. EPA guidance allows the agency to use unique qualifications as a justification for a noncompetitive award. The EPA brownfield program managers maintained that going through the expense of widely publicizing available funding and conducting a competitive process to screen hundreds of applications is not cost-effective, especially given the small amounts of the awards.", "For example, these managers explained that one recipient, the International City/County Management Association, represents city and county managers nationwide whose jurisdictions are directly affected by brownfields. EPA believes this association could more quickly poll its members to determine what brownfield assistance they need EPA to provide and more quickly disseminate information to them about successful brownfield redevelopment efforts than EPA could. According to the program managers, EPA also provided a cooperative agreement to the Institute for Responsible Management because its director has years of experience in brownfields. They explained that because of this experience, the director can help the pilot communities organize themselves and focus on brownfield cleanup and redevelopment options. The director can also provide research, information, and troubleshooting to these groups as well as document the lessons learned and success stories so other communities can benefit from them.", "EPA has used the same approval process for the five grants it had awarded for job training at the time of our review. For example, the agency provided funds in fiscal year 1997 to the Hazardous Materials Training and Research Institute at East Iowa Community College District to conduct workshops for community college faculty on how to build environmental curricula for job training, especially relating to cleaning up contaminated sites. According to the program managers, this award was made because of the Institute\u2019s success in developing training programs through awards from EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development. They said that EPA is now working on a strategic plan for its training activities and will use it to determine whether or not to fund future job training proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recipients Used Funds Primarily to Sponsor Forums, Conduct Research, and Publish Documents on Brownfield Issues and on Redevelopment Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["The 24 awards made since 1993 that we reviewed with brownfield-related activities totaled $9.6 million. These funds came from the allotment to the brownfield program office, the Superfund Trust Fund, and general funds from either the brownfield or other EPA program offices. Recipients used these awards to provide outreach, technical assistance, research, and job training to support both brownfields specifically and Superfund or other programs more generally. We determined that about $3.7 million of these funds were for the following more specific brownfield activities, although some portion of the activities provided by the remaining funds could also indirectly benefit brownfields: issue reports or other documents on redevelopment activities; sponsor forums, conferences, or other meetings to disseminate research regarding brownfield issues and policies; conduct or sponsor workshops on brownfield issues or policies and on developing environmental curricula for job training related to hazardous waste cleanup; conduct research on brownfield and redevelopment issues, such as insurance coverage for entities conducting cleanups; and establish or develop programs to identify barriers to brownfield development.", "Recipients also used the awards to perform other activities, including the development of educational materials or tools and databases on redevelopment case studies. Appendix II provides a more detailed description of the activities funded under each of the 24 grants and agreements.", "In conducting these activities, recipients have spent most of the awarded funds on (1) their own personnel costs, including fringe benefits; (2) indirect costs, such as overhead; and (3) contractual services, such as any consultants used. They also have spent smaller portions of their funds on expenses for travel to enable their staff and participants to attend conferences and forums; equipment, such as copying machines; and supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Officers Were Monitoring the Brownfield Grants and Agreements, but the Awards Will Not Likely Be Subject to Financial Audits Because of Their Small Dollar Value", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the files for each of the 24 awards and our interviews with various members of the Outreach and Special Projects Staff responsible for managing some of the individual awards showed that project officers were monitoring recipients\u2019 activities. This monitoring consisted primarily of project officers\u2019 making periodic telephone calls to recipients to discuss the status of funded activities, attending some of the functions sponsored by the recipients, meeting with recipients at EPA headquarters, and reviewing quarterly and final reports that the recipients were required to submit to EPA. In these reports, recipients give detailed descriptions of the activities that were accomplished under their awards, and, in some cases, describe the status of the overall budget, if EPA had made this a specific reporting requirement. While EPA\u2019s Office of Administration and Resources Management encouraged project officers to conduct both on-site visits to recipients and more formal semiannual or annual project reviews, the files for our sample of 24 awards did not document that project officers were conducting these activities. Although the brownfield program managers stated that project officers were meeting informally with recipients, the project officers for two of the three recipients we audited had not visited them. The brownfield program managers explained that because of the relatively small monetary value of these awards, ranging from $20,000 to $2.7 million with a median of $168,000, the formal on-site visits were not cost-effective and that more formal reviews were not necessary because the project officers\u2019 other monitoring activities were adequate.", "Once a grant or agreement has been completed, each project officer is also responsible for conducting a final closeout review to determine whether the recipient has completed all technical work and met all requirements before EPA makes or denies the final payment to the recipient and recovers any unused funds. We determined that 2 of the 11 completed awards in our sample were due to be closed out\u2014closeout must occur within 180 days of a completed grant or agreement\u2014and EPA had conducted both closeouts. For example, to close out a cooperative agreement issued to the Northeast-Midwest Institute, whose project period ended on March 31, 1997, the recipient submitted its final financial status report on April 25, 1997, certifying that it had spent the funds. The project officer for this cooperative agreement reviewed this report along with the recipient\u2019s final quarterly report to close out the agreement on May 5, 1997.", "Project officers are not required to conduct a detailed financial audit of the recipients\u2019 expenditures as part of the closeout review. The brownfield program mangers stated that an audit would not be cost-effective because the awards have relatively small monetary values. Instead, EPA\u2019s regulations require recipients to maintain supporting financial records of all expenditures, such as receipts and invoices, on-site for 3 years after completion of a grant or agreement. During that period, recipients can be subject to an audit either by EPA\u2019s OIG or a single audit under provisions in OMB Circular A-133, entitled \u201cAudits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.\u201d According to this guidance, a recipient that spends at least $300,000 in federal funds in 1 year shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year. The federal agency that has provided the most funds to the recipient for that year is responsible for coordinating that audit. The grant and agreement files we reviewed contained information that verified such single audits were being conducted, however, EPA\u2019s awards were not sampled during these audits because of their relatively low monetary amounts. In addition, EPA OIG staff stated that they were unlikely to audit these grants and agreements unless they received information of wrongdoing. In our detailed on-site audit of the financial records for three recipients, we determined that, overall, they were spending the funds in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA\u2019s General Counsel Raised Questions About the Statutory Basis for Some Awards", "paragraphs": ["During our review of agency files for the 24 awards, we noted that EPA\u2019s OGC had cautioned the program offices that initiated the awards that external reviewers might determine that some of the activities were not allowable under the statute EPA had used to make the awards. If so, recipients would have to return all funds, even if they had completed the agreed-to activities. EPA used section 311(c) of CERCLA as authority for awarding at least portions of 14 of the awards we reviewed. This section authorizes EPA to use grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to conduct and support research on ways to detect hazardous substances and evaluate the risks they pose to human health. However, in internal memorandums to the program offices that initiated 9 of the 14 awards, EPA\u2019s OGC stated that, while section 311(c) can be construed to authorize those awards, it did not explicitly authorize the proposed activities and thus warned that subsequent reviewers could question whether those activities were really health-related research and disallow the expenditures. For example, OGC raised this issue on a $1 million cooperative agreement authorized under section 311(c), whose recipient conducted meetings and training and issued publications to educate local communities on issues regarding Superfund, brownfields, and special concerns of minority communities located near hazardous waste sites. OGC has encouraged the program offices to seek explicit statutory authority from the Congress for the activities funded through the nine awards.", "According to the brownfield program managers and OGC representatives, because the statutory language is relatively broad, EPA has interpreted it to authorize the use of funds for these types of brownfield research activities. They also said that as a result, OGC did not disapprove the awards and the program offices went forward with them. Because the activities being conducted are mainly related to the Superfund program and funded with trust fund money, EPA has had to use CERCLA authority to make these awards rather than other environmental statutes, even though these other statutes more clearly provide for the types of sociological, economic, and policy research EPA has conducted with these awards. The program managers stated that although the administration, in its 1994 Superfund reauthorization proposal, did include language to clarify the authority, the bill did not pass, and the agency is considering whether to pursue clearer statutory authority through other means. We did not try to independently determine whether the nine awards were made in accordance with CERCLA because EPA\u2019s OIG is addressing this issue as part of an ongoing review covering a broader sample of grants and agreements across numerous EPA programs and environmental statutes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to EPA for review and comment.

For example, the agency noted that it used either CERCLA section 311(c) or RCRA section 8001 to make awards for brownfield research. The authority used depended on whether the activities were to detect and assess hazardous substances and evaluate their effects on the environment or were related to more general solid and hazardous waste management activities. In response, where appropriate, we noted the statutory bases used to fund brownfield awards. The agency also noted that only portions of several of the awards we discuss in appendix II, such as its award with the University of Maryland at Baltimore for training regarding hazardous substances, are being used for brownfield activities. We had already noted this in several sections of the report because the scope of our work included any award that supported brownfield activities, either wholly or in part.

We focused on completed, rather than ongoing, grants and agreements because they would allow us to more fully cover all our review objectives, including questions on oversight. We focused on grants and agreements from 1993 through 1996 because 1993 was the earliest year EPA had made brownfield awards, and awards from 1997 did not have a long history of recipients\u2019 expenditures. We audited three awards with the highest total dollar value\u2014one within the EPA program category of outreach, technical assistance, and research; the second within the EPA program category of job training; and a third that had been awarded by an EPA regional office within either category to determine if the region used criteria and oversight that differed from headquarters.
