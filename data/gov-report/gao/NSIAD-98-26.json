As explained in our previous reports, about 80 percent of DOD\u2019s infrastructure activities are paid for from the military personnel and operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts. Therefore, if DOD is to free up dollars for weapons modernization, it must reduce funding requirements for these accounts.", "The FYDP is an authoritative record of current and projected force structure, costs, and personnel levels that have been approved by the Secretary of Defense.

It considered potential threats, strategy, force structure, readiness posture, military modernization programs, defense infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program. The QDR is intended to provide a blueprint for a strategy-based, balanced, and affordable defense program.

Specifically, the 1998 FYDP adds about $1 billion to the military personnel accounts, $3.7 billion to O&M accounts, and $4.9 billion to RDT&E accounts and reduces planned procurement spending by $2.8 billion. Increases in the O&M accounts and decreases in the procurement accounts are inverse to DOD\u2019s goals since the bottom-up review, which have been to reduce infrastructure and increase funding for weapons modernization. This is the fourth straight budget year since 1995 that DOD has not met procurement goals established in previous FYDPs.", "Savings achieved from infrastructure reductions have too often not been as large as anticipated and tended to be absorbed by unplanned or underestimated expenses in day-to-day operations. According to DOD, the most prevalent underestimated expenses are for depot maintenance, real property maintenance, military construction, and medical care. Because of unrealized savings, weapons modernization plans have repeatedly been delayed.", "Defense budgets are planned to remain relatively flat in inflation-adjusted terms through 2003 as part of the balanced budget agreement. Therefore, if DOD is to achieve real growth in the procurement accounts, it must reduce funding for its infrastructure activities.", "The 1997 FYDP projected that spending for infrastructure would decline slightly from 58 percent to 57 percent of DOD\u2019s budget during 1998-2001.

This planned decline in infrastructure spending is predicated primarily on planned reductions in O&M accounts.

Migration in that range would undermine much of the planned increase in procurement. Instead of growing to $60 billion, procurement funding could be expected to stall in the range of $45 to $50 billion. Some growth from the FY 1998 level could be expected from ongoing efforts to reduce the cost of defense infrastructure and from the natural transition of several major programs from development to production. Absent any further changes to the defense program, however, growth above $50 billion would be highly unlikely.\u201d", "A principal resource management objective of the QDR was to understand the financial risk in DOD\u2019s program plans and devise ways to manage that risk. In the QDR report, the Secretary recognizes the sources of instability that are built into the current FYDP and presents plans to mitigate that instability through more realistic planning assumptions in the 1999 FYDP. Those assumptions include making some force structure reductions and greater personnel reductions, shedding additional excess facilities through more base closures and realignments, streamlining operations, and proceeding more prudently on the acquisitions of new weapons.

DOD recognizes the challenge it faces to achieve its modernization goals.", "To address the problem of migrating funds, DOD plans to redirect about $6 billion to $7 billion in resources annually by the end of 2003 from savings made available by reducing the force structure, streamlining infrastructure, and adjusting modernization plans. While DOD has retained its goal of increasing procurement funding to roughly $60 billion by fiscal year 2001, it plans to moderate the intermediate targets to $49 billion in 1999 and $54 billion in 2000. The QDR also suggests reducing some purchases that were planned beyond 2000.", "Some of the QDR procurement proposals are as follows:", "Reduce purchases of the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System from 19 to 13 aircraft.", "Decrease the total procurement of F-22 aircraft from 438 to 339 and slow the maximum planned annual production rate from 48 to 36.", "Reduce the maximum production rate of F/A-18E/F aircraft from 60 to 48 per year.

Underwriting DOD\u2019s extensive modernization effort and the Revolution in Military Affairs are plans for substantial future investments in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E). DOD acknowledges that some of these major investments, while deemed essential to meet national goals, will involve very high financial and technological risks. Therefore, it is likely that billions of additional dollars will be directed to these programs over the coming years. But according to DOD, the precise amount and allocation of these dollars are still under review. Some of these programs were identified in the QDR report and include the following:", "Theater Ballistic Missile Defense Programs. According to DOD, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Program is expected to take longer and cost more than the 1998 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) anticipated. DOD has decided to slow the Army\u2019s portion of the THAAD program because of serious technical problems and shift the deployment date from 2004 to 2006. According to DOD, this action will improve the stability of the program and lower program risk.", "National Missile Defense. This high-priority program with the executive branch and Congress is on an accelerated research and development path. However, the QDR analysis concluded that this program could not be deployed by the planned date of 2000 within the current program budget. As a result, DOD decided it will direct additional funds to national missile defense. DOD acknowledges in the QDR report that even with the additional funding, this program will remain a high risk.", "Cruise Missile Defense. According to DOD, intelligence estimates have revealed that a cruise missile threat to U.S. forces may emerge after 2000. Therefore, over the next several years, DOD plans to increase emphasis on a national cruise missile defense.", "Navigation. Upgrades to the space-based Global Positioning System and compliance with global air traffic management rules to become effective over the next several years will require significant future expenditures, which are yet to be determined. According to DOD, its very large fleet of aircraft will need to be properly equipped with new navigation equipment to comply with new procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization.", "Counterproliferation. DOD said that it will increase planned spending on counterproliferation by approximately $1 billion over the 1999 FYDP, particularly for protective measures against chemical weapons.", "Force Protection and Combating Terrorism. According to the QDR, DOD is increasing its research and development funding in this area. The funding will support state-of-the-art programs, including systems to detect, assess, and disable large vehicle bombs; standoff explosive detection capabilities; capabilities to maintain surveillance of and tag and track harmful materials that can be used in terrorist attacks; and improvements to robotic vehicles used in counterterrorism operations.
