Although the SSAs for the remaining four sectors had not determined cyber risks to be significant during their 2010 sector-specific planning process, they subsequently reconsidered the significance of cyber risks to the sector. For example, commercial facilities sector\u2013specific agency officials stated that they recognized cyber risk as a high-priority concern for the sector as part of the updated sector planning process. SSAs and their sector partners are to include an overview of current and emerging cyber risks in their updated sector-specific plans for 2015.", "SSAs generally took actions to mitigate cyber risks and vulnerabilities for their respective sectors. SSAs developed, implemented, or supported efforts to enhance cybersecurity and mitigate cyber risk with activities that aligned with a majority of actions called for by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). SSAs for 12 of the 15 sectors had not identified incentives to promote cybersecurity in their sectors as proposed in the NIPP; however, the SSAs are participating in a working group to identify appropriate incentives. In addition, SSAs for 3 of 15 sectors had not yet made significant progress in advancing cyber-based research and development within their sectors because it had not been an area of focus for their sector. Department of Homeland Security guidance for updating the sector-specific plans directs the SSAs to incorporate the NIPP's actions to guide their cyber risk mitigation activities, including cybersecurity-related actions to identify incentives and promote research and development.", "All SSAs that GAO reviewed used multiple public-private and cross-sector collaboration mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity-related information. For example, the SSAs used councils of federal and nonfederal stakeholders, including coordinating councils and cybersecurity and industrial control system working groups, to coordinate with each other. In addition, SSAs participated in the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, a national center at the Department of Homeland Security, to receive and disseminate cyber-related information for public and private sector partners.", "The Departments of Defense, Energy, and Health and Human Services established performance metrics for their three sectors. However, the SSAs for the other 12 sectors had not developed metrics to measure and report on the effectiveness of all of their cyber risk mitigation activities or their sectors' cybersecurity posture. This was because, among other reasons, the SSAs rely on their private sector partners to voluntarily share information needed to measure efforts. The NIPP directs SSAs and their sector partners to identify high-level outcomes to facilitate progress towards national goals and priorities. Until SSAs develop performance metrics and collect data to report on the progress of their efforts to enhance the sectors' cybersecurity posture, they may be unable to adequately monitor the effectiveness of their cyber risk mitigation activities and document the resulting sector-wide cybersecurity progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that certain SSAs collaborate with sector partners to develop performance metrics and determine how to overcome challenges to reporting the results of their cyber risk mitigation activities.

Based on these analyses, we  identified nine federal agencies designated as the sector-specific  agencies for the critical infrastructure sectors. For this review, we focused  on eight of the nine sector-specific agencies responsible for 15 of the 16  critical infrastructure sectors. We included the 15 sectors that involve  private sector stakeholders in their efforts to implement activities to  address sector security and resiliency goals. We excluded the General  Services Administration, the sector-specific agency for the government  facilities sector, as the sector is uniquely governmental with facilities  either owned or leased by government entities. See Table 8 for the  sectors and sector-specific agencies included in our review.", "To determine how sector-specific agencies prioritized cyber risks, we  analyzed their efforts to identify and document cyber risks. We reviewed  the risk assessment methodologies employed as documented in the 2010  sector-specific plans and other supplementary documentation such as  formal risk assessments, strategy documents, and annual reports. We  also interviewed officials responsible for carrying out the sector-specific  agency roles and responsibilities to further understand their determination  of the significance of cyber-related risks to their respective sectors.", "To identify SSAs\u2019 activities to mitigate cyber risks, we compared sector- specific planning documents and actions to fulfill roles and responsibilities  as identified in federal policy and the 2013 National Infrastructure  Protection Plan (NIPP) Call to Action steps related to cyber risks. The  NIPP steps are suggested practices to guide sector-specific agencies\u2019  actions. The NIPP presented a total of 12 steps; however, we excluded 2  steps that we determined did not have a cybersecurity-related nexus. We  analyzed the latest sector-specific plans, which were released in 2010,  and other sector-specific planning documents including risk assessments  and strategies for each of the sectors. We also interviewed officials from  the SSAs and obtained related documentation to identify cyber risk  mitigation activities. Additionally, we interviewed private sector  stakeholders representing the sector coordinating councils to corroborate  the sector-specific agencies cyber risk mitigation activities. We used all of  this information to determine the extent to which each of the sector- specific agencies conducted activities for the 9 of the NIPP Call to Action  steps.", "To determine the extent of the sector-specific agencies\u2019 collaborative  efforts to enhance their sectors\u2019 cybersecurity environment, we reviewed  documentation related to the collaboration mechanisms utilized by the  sector-specific agencies. We also identified the collaborative groups,  councils, and working groups that were utilized most frequently by SSAs  to share cybersecurity-related information across the sectors. We  analyzed documentation of cross-sector collaboration from the sector,  government, and cross-sector coordinating councils. Additionally, we  interviewed SSA officials and private sector stakeholders representing the  sector coordinating councils.", "To identify performance measures used by SSAs to monitor cybersecurity  in their respective sectors, we analyzed the sector-specific plans and  cybersecurity-related performance reporting documents and interviewed  SSA officials. We reviewed performance evaluation guidance related to  national security and resiliency goals provided to the SSAs for past and  future planning efforts. Additionally, we reviewed past sector annual  reports, which tracked actions of the sector against goals established in  the 2010 sector-specific plans, as well as strategic documents or  roadmaps used to track sector performance. We reviewed reports of  cyber incidents and data breaches provided as examples of indicators for  SSAs to monitor sector cybersecurity. We also interviewed private sector  partners to identify sources of cybersecurity-related data being reported  to the sector-specific agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to November 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Sector-Specific Agencies\u2019 Cyber Risk Mitigation Activities by Sector", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides further details on cyber risk mitigation activities  sector-specific agencies (SSA) developed for the 15 sectors in our review  based on analysis of documentation and statements from SSA officials.
