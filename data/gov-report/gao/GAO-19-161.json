However, the adoption of this technology depends on factors such as technological limitations and public acceptance.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed predicted two main scenarios for how the adoption of automated trucks could affect the trucking workforce, which varied depending on the future role of drivers or operators. Technology developers, among others, described one scenario in which self-driving trucks are used on highway portions of long-haul trips. Stakeholders noted this scenario would likely reduce the number of long-haul truck drivers needed and could decrease wages because of lower demand for such drivers. In contrast, groups representing truck drivers, among others, predicted a scenario in which a truck would have an operator at all times for complex driving and other non-driving tasks, and the number of drivers or operators would not change as significantly. However, stakeholders lacked consensus on the potential effect this scenario might have on wages and driver retention. Most stakeholders said automated trucking could create new jobs, and that any workforce effects would take time\u2014providing an opportunity for a federal response, such as any needed policy changes.", "The Department of Transportation (DOT) is consulting with the Department of Labor (DOL) to conduct a congressionally-directed analysis of the workforce impacts of automated trucking by March 2019.

Specifically, several stakeholders and a study noted that automated  trucks may require simpler operating environments, such as highways, in  the near term because they are less complex for the technology to  navigate than roads in an urban setting, for example. Even so, a  highway presents its own challenges, several stakeholders said. For  instance, a developer, a manufacturer, and a researcher we spoke with  told us that Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)\u2014a costly and complex  technology\u2014may not be as useful at higher speeds due to its limited  range and its inability to process information about the surrounding  environment as quickly as needed at these speeds. Further, one  manufacturer told us that LIDAR is not as durable as it needs to be for  commercial trucking\u2014for example, able to withstand dirt and debris.  Stakeholders also discussed the need to have backup systems built into  trucks\u2019 automated systems in case of technology failures, including the  ability to guide the truck to a safe stop.", "Stakeholders identified several operational factors that may pose  challenges for the deployment of automated trucks. For example, several  stakeholders said that there may be challenges with self-driving trucks  with no person inside when responding to a tire blowout or other  mechanical problems. Likewise, several stakeholders said there must be  ways for a self-driving truck to respond to required safety inspections and  communicate with inspectors. Representatives from a safety  organization noted that a truck could potentially communicate a unique  identification number through an electronic device. This number would  give the inspector information about the truck, such as safety information  from the sensors on automated trucks. Additionally, several stakeholders  said platooning may not be practical for logistical reasons, for instance, if  trucks are not traveling on the same routes or if cargo is not ready to  depart at the same time. In addition, according to stakeholders we spoke  with and literature we reviewed, the lead truck in a platoon will save less  on fuel than the following trucks. If trucking fleets adopt platooning  systems that work on commercial trucks across different companies\u2014i.e.,  systems that are interoperable\u2014distributing fuel savings in a manner  agreeable to all parties involved may be challenging. Representatives  from two fleet owners and one industry association we spoke with raised  concerns about platooning across different companies, including that  companies might not partner with other fleets to platoon trucks because  they would be primarily concerned with their own fuel savings, not with  saving fuel for their competitors. In addition to these operational factors,  stakeholders noted that automated trucks may be prohibitively expensive  for some smaller fleet owners, including owner-operators, particularly  when these trucks are first deployed.", "Several stakeholders and relevant literature noted that certain  infrastructure factors may affect the development, testing, and  deployment of automated trucks. For example, a few stakeholders said if  one truck picks up or drops off trailers for another truck at a location near  highways, land acquisition near these highways may be an issue.  Representatives from a developer that planned to acquire land for its  business model said the land acquisition could take 5 to 10 years. The  representatives explained that they found enabling direct access to  freeways is more difficult than simply acquiring vacant land. They planned  to partner with states to create hubs on under-utilized land with existing  freeway access by, for example, repurposing abandoned rest stops. In  addition to land acquisition, two technology developers and a study  identified the need for widely available data connectivity and the related  ability to use connected vehicle technologies as an infrastructure  challenge. Connected technologies allow vehicles to communicate with  other vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle), roadway infrastructure (vehicle-to- infrastructure), and personal communication devices. Connectivity has  potential implications for, among other things, the maps self-driving trucks  use to navigate routes and obstacles, as well as the ability for trucks in a  platoon to communicate with one another effectively. However, because  the ability for vehicles to communicate with infrastructure is not  ubiquitous, two of the developers we spoke with are not taking into  account connected infrastructure as they develop and test their  automated trucks. Two stakeholders also expressed concern about  platooning trucks and the stress they could place on bridges, for example,  that were not designed to hold the weight of two or more heavy trucks at  once. In addition, stakeholders noted that automated trucks may  encounter difficulties with things like road work or construction zones.  This may be because the truck relies on pre-built maps, in addition to  sensors, that would potentially be outdated or might not reflect current  road conditions, including any recent or temporary changes.", "Several legal factors may affect the timing of development, testing, and  deployment for automated trucks, according to our stakeholder interviews  and literature review. Many stakeholders expressed concern about the  possibility of a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state laws related to automated trucks that  could affect interstate trucking, with some saying they would like to see a  shared national framework. For example, one technology developer said  that this emerging patchwork can make it difficult for an automated truck  to travel across the country without a driver, because some states  specifically prohibit self-driving vehicles, including trucks. However, this  same developer said that some states are less restrictive regarding the  need for a driver in a self-driving truck, and that others have ambiguous  regulations. Several stakeholders we spoke with and two studies we  reviewed noted that liability issues may arise and become more complex  for automated trucks. This may be because, for example, more parties  may become involved. One of these stakeholders\u2014a fleet owner\u2014said  that these parties could include the software developer, the truck  manufacturer, the owner of the truck, and, if applicable, the truck driver.  These issues could be addressed under the current liability system, and  courts would decide the various liability issues on a case-by-case basis.", "In addition, several stakeholders have requested that DOT clarify whether  existing regulations require that human drivers always be present in  automated trucks, particularly those capable of Level 4 and 5 driving  automation, in which at least some of the driving is done by the  automated truck. Two technology developers have requested that DOT  confirm that regulations that apply to human drivers do not apply to  automated trucks, and one of these developers also requested  confirmation that a truck capable of at least Level 4 automation is allowed  to operate without a human on board, which could permit testing without a  person in the truck. In Preparing for the Future of Transportation:  Automated Vehicles 3.0, DOT\u2019s automated vehicles voluntary guidance,  the agency laid out its approach to its automated vehicles policy. DOT\u2019s  guidance stated that, going forward, DOT will interpret and, consistent  with all applicable notice and comment requirements, adapt the  definitions of \u201cdriver\u201d and \u201coperator\u201d to recognize that such terms do not  refer exclusively to a human, but may include an automated system. In  the same guidance document, DOT also noted that regulations will no  longer assume that the driver of a commercial truck is always human or  that a human is necessarily present inside of a truck during its operation.", "A few stakeholders also said that DOT may have to clarify the hours of  service rules if a human driver is in an automated truck that is self-driving  for part or all of a route. This is because under current hours of service  regulations, a human driver may drive a maximum of 11 total hours within  a 14-hour window after coming on duty. However, if a truck self-drives  for at least part of a route, it is unclear if a human driver would need to  comply with the existing hours of service requirements and, if not, how  the driver would account for worked time. For example, if the human  driver is not actively engaged in the driving task, whether monitoring the  automated driving system or even sleeping, there could be a question  about whether that time would be counted toward \u201cdriving,\u201d according to  the requirements. For a list of potential legal factors identified by  stakeholders or in literature that may affect timing for the development  and deployment of automated commercial trucks, and related DOT  information, see appendix II.", "Stakeholders and relevant literature identified several other factors, such  as public perception and cybersecurity, that could affect timing for the  development and deployment of automated trucks. Several stakeholders  we interviewed and a study we reviewed noted that public acceptance  concerning the safety of platooning and self-driving trucks may pose a  challenge to the deployment of these trucks. One researcher we spoke  with said interactions between truck platoons and cars may be  problematic, because drivers may need to speed in order to change lanes  around the platoons of trucks following each other closely. Similarly, other  stakeholders told us that it may be difficult for the public to accept large  automated commercial trucks. Two of these stakeholders said this is  particularly true for a heavy truck without a human driver on board\u2014 implying that vehicle size and weight play roles in the public\u2019s acceptance  of these types of automated vehicles.

Several technology developers and  researchers, along with two studies, said trucks that are self-driving for  part of a route could decrease the number of long-haul drivers, and  perhaps decrease wages and affect retention as well. Additionally, any  displaced drivers may need new skills if they change jobs, according to  several stakeholders we spoke with and studies we reviewed.", "Employment levels: Technology developers we interviewed  generally predicted the number of long-haul jobs would decrease with  the adoption of trucks that are self-driving for part of a route. Drivers  constitute a significant operational cost, so part of the reported  economic rationale for self-driving trucks is to employ fewer drivers,  allowing companies to transport the same amount of freight\u2014or  more\u2014at lower labor costs. Several studies have analyzed the  potential number of driving jobs that might be eliminated in this  scenario, but the studies specifically noted the speculative, long-term  nature of those estimates and the inability to identify the number of  current long-haul truck drivers whose jobs could be lost sometime in  the future. Estimates in the studies we reviewed ranged from under  300,000 driver jobs lost to over 900,000 jobs lost\u2014out of a total of  nearly 1.9 million heavy and tractor-trailer truck driver jobs, according  to BLS data\u2014and in each case over periods of 10 to 20 years or  more.", "Although long-haul jobs would decrease in this scenario, local-haul  jobs could increase and offset those losses, according to a study and  several stakeholders, including two technology developers. The  study, for example, said that automated trucking would drive long-haul  trucking costs down, leading more companies to use trucking to ship  goods. As a result, demand for trucking could increase, leading to an  increased demand for local-haul truck drivers on either end of the  long-haul routes, two studies noted.", "Several stakeholders we spoke with agreed that any decrease in long- haul jobs would likely not affect many current drivers because most  will have voluntarily left driving for a different job or retired by the time  self-driving trucks are widely deployed. According to the Census  Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey data, the average age of truck  and sales delivery drivers from 2012 through 2016 was 46. Many  stakeholders also said that trucking fleets are currently having  difficulty hiring and retaining qualified drivers, and two technology  developers said automation could help move goods in an environment  in which it is difficult to find workers.", "Technology developers also told us they are focusing the initial  development of automated trucking technology in the southwest  United States because of its good weather and long highways. As a  result, any future job losses could first occur there. Additionally, BLS  data show that the estimated concentration of truck driving jobs varies  in different areas of the country (see fig. 7). One study noted that  trucking job losses in more regionally concentrated occupations are  likely to pose more challenges for workers, because more workers  with similar skills in the same labor markets will be out of work at the  same time, and thus the whole local economy will be more likely to  suffer.", "Wages: If the truck is self-driving for parts of a route, wages for long- haul drivers could decrease because there would be lower demand  for\u2014or greater supply of\u2014such drivers, according to several  stakeholders. Moreover, one study noted that average long-haul  wages could decrease because the jobs most likely to be automated  include those that tend to be unionized and have higher wages and  benefits, such as jobs at parcel delivery companies and some private  carriers. Similarly, drivers changing occupations might face  significant wage reductions in new occupations that do not require  retraining, according to a researcher and one study. Wages for  local-haul drivers\u2014generally lower than for long-haul drivers\u2014could  decrease as well, because transitioning long-haul drivers could  increase competition for those jobs, according to two studies. One  technology developer presented a different perspective, saying that  wages for local-haul drivers could increase from current levels due to  increased overall demand for trucking.", "Retention: Overall, retention of truck drivers could improve if the  long-haul portion of the route becomes self-driving, lessening time  drivers spend away from home\u2014a key reason long-haul drivers leave  the profession, according to many stakeholders. However, retention  may depend on several factors, including wages, time at home, and  other working conditions, making it more difficult to predict self-driving  trucks\u2019 effect on retention.", "Skills: Long-haul drivers have skills that would transfer to local-haul  routes, so additional training may not be needed for those who move  to local-haul routes. However, displaced long-haul drivers seeking to  move to a different occupation or industry may need additional  training, according to several stakeholders and two studies.

Automated trucking with an operator in the truck would have  a more limited effect on the numbers of truck drivers, but would still result  in workforce changes, according to several stakeholders. As with the  driverless scenario, many stakeholders said future developments were so  uncertain that they could not predict how automated trucking would affect  various aspects of the workforce, such as wages or retention.", "Employment levels: Under this scenario, automated trucking would  have a more limited effect on employment levels. Several  stakeholders noted, for example, that a person would still be needed  in the truck to manage emergencies, repair flat tires, and secure  cargo, among other duties. (See text box.) For example, one study  noted that even for trucking jobs identified as the most likely to be  automated, driving may represent only about half of drivers\u2019 total work  time. Additionally, particular kinds of long-haul trucking may present  different non-driving tasks that could make automating those driving  jobs more difficult.", "Wages: If the truck has an operator, several stakeholders said that  wages might increase if increased skills are needed to operate more  sophisticated equipment. However, several other stakeholders said  wages might not change significantly or could decrease with fewer  driving tasks. Two studies noted that wage changes were difficult to  predict and could be affected by specific policy interventions.", "Truck Drivers: Responsible for More than Just Driving   Truck drivers have many responsibilities other than driving a truck. Non-driving tasks for  heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers can include:  checking vehicles to ensure that mechanical, safety, and emergency equipment is in  good working order;  loading or unloading trucks, including checking contents for any damage;  inspecting loads to ensure that cargo is secure; and  performing basic vehicle maintenance tasks, such as adding fuel or radiator fluid;  performing minor repairs; or removing debris from loaded trailers.", "Retention: Many stakeholders said new technology could help the  trucking industry bring in and retain more people\u2014such as women  and younger workers\u2014if it could, for example, make truck driving  safer, less stressful, and less physically demanding. Others  cautioned that automated technology may not decrease truck  operators\u2019 time away from home, because they would still have to be  in the truck for the entirety of long-haul routes. One stakeholder, who  was also a truck driver, said that many truck drivers enjoy driving, so  automating aspects of that task would not necessarily entice those  drivers to stay in the job. Two other stakeholders noted that some  drivers may not want to learn how the new technology works and  could leave the field rather than drive automated trucks.", "Skills: Future truck operators may need new skills to work with  automated technology that assists rather than replaces them, many  stakeholders noted. For example, operators may need to adapt to  technology that takes over a number of the standard driving functions,  such as braking, staying in a designated lane, and keeping a safe  distance from other vehicles. Operators may also need to understand  how to monitor software and hardware used to automate the driving  function and how to make appropriate use of advanced safety  systems. Furthermore, officials from many truck driver training schools  and workforce development boards said additional certification  beyond the standard CDL may be needed in order to demonstrate an  understanding of how to operate the technology in automated trucks.

DOT officials said their role  during these discussions was to hear stakeholder concerns. They also  said that their ongoing goal is to identify barriers in their regulations to  safe deployment of automated driving technology. Stakeholders have  raised concerns about the potential workforce effects of automated trucks  at DOT\u2019s listening sessions. For example, after participants questioned  potential job losses at a listening session in August 2018, DOT officials  said that automation may eventually change the role of a truck driver from  driver to technician and that any changes would probably not be  immediate. DOL officials said they have participated in some of DOT\u2019s  listening sessions.", "For its part, DOL has taken steps to study how automated trucking may  affect the near-term demand for truck drivers as part of their standard,  biennial employment projections for all occupations. DOL officials said they consulted experts and economic studies prior to publishing their  most recent projections, covering 2016 to 2026, and included information  on possible effects of automation in projections for heavy and tractor- trailer truck drivers. The projections state that the demand for these  drivers is expected to grow by 5.8 percent between 2016 and 2026, with  an average of over 200,000 job openings each year, of which 10,000 are  projected to be new jobs. DOL\u2019s analysis anticipated that automation  will not reduce the number of drivers by 2026. DOL officials said that  they expect automation to assist drivers rather than displace them in the  near term. Unlike estimates developed by other researchers, these  numbers do not include potential job losses after 2026, though DOL  officials noted that the agency\u2019s next projections, for 2018 to 2028, will  incorporate information on how automated trucking technology has  evolved since the 2016-2026 projections.

Congress directed DOT to include stakeholder outreach in its  analysis and provide information on workers who may be displaced as a  result of such technology, as well as minimum and recommended training  requirements for operating vehicles with these systems. DOL officials told  us that they have begun collaborating with DOT on this study by  consulting with organized labor and other stakeholders. In October 2018,  DOT issued a request for information to solicit comments on the scope of  this analysis and detailed several potential research questions, including  which commercial drivers are likely to be affected and what skills might be  needed to operate new vehicles or transition to new jobs. DOT also  announced that it is planning to coordinate with the Departments of  Commerce and Health and Human Services, in addition to consulting with  DOL to conduct this analysis.

However, DOL and DOT have not made plans to continue collaborating to  convene key groups of stakeholders as the technology evolves to gather  information about potential workforce effects of automated trucking.  Insofar as automated trucking technology is still evolving, convening  stakeholders solely to inform the March 2019 analysis will not provide  agency officials with sufficient information about important developments  that may occur after the analysis is completed. This analysis will be an  important step. However, DOT must complete it before potential  workforce effects can be more fully predicted. After its completion,  developers will likely continue to test their technologies, and issues  related to operational and other factors that will affect the deployment of  automated trucks may change or be resolved. For the agencies to more  fully understand these developments and clarify the range of associated  workforce effects, they would need to collaborate and to continue to  gather information in the future, for example by continuing to convene key  groups of stakeholders as the technology evolves. The majority of  stakeholders we spoke with, including representatives from local  workforce development boards, truck driver training schools, technology  developers, and groups representing truck drivers, told us it would be  helpful for federal agencies to play a convening role so that DOL and  DOT can better anticipate and understand any potential workforce  changes. Several stakeholders also said that convening stakeholders  would enable DOL and DOT to surface different parties\u2019 concerns.  Additionally, our recent report on emerging technologies found that  federal agencies can play an important role in convening stakeholders to  gather information in areas where technology is still under development,  including information on the research plans of industry stakeholders and  ways to address national needs.", "Continuing to convene stakeholders could also help agencies to identify  any information or data gaps that may need to be addressed to  understand the potential workforce effects of automated trucking. DOL  officials said that because the technology is still advancing, the related  workforce effects, including the magnitude of any job losses, are  uncertain. They also said they do not have information to identify the  number of long-haul truck drivers, whose jobs may be the most likely to  be affected by automation. Specifically, the occupational code DOL uses  to classify heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers captures drivers who  operate any type of heavy truck. Along with long-haul drivers, this code  includes other drivers whose jobs may be harder to automate, such as  tow truck operators. Experts who participated in the National Science  Foundation-sponsored workshop on the potential workforce effects of  automated trucking also identified information gaps. They noted that  more information is needed in several areas, including a better  understanding of current truck drivers\u2019 skills beyond driving, how those  skills might translate to other occupational areas, and new jobs and skills  that will be required with the deployment of automated trucks. DOL  officials said that the agency provides information on knowledge, skills,  and abilities for various driver occupations, as well as detailed work  activities, on its Occupational Information Network (O*NET). However,  that information is based on surveys to current workers and therefore  does not include what skills future drivers may need as automated  technology evolves.", "DOL officials told us they do not typically convene stakeholders on an  industry-specific basis. They also said that state and local workforce  development boards are best positioned to identify and respond to  changes in their local economy and employment needs, because these  boards include members from the local business community who know  which industries are growing in their local labor markets. However, there  are close to 1.9 million heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers across the  country, making the trucking industry an important segment of the  national workforce. In addition, one of DOL\u2019s objectives in its fiscal year  2018-2022 strategic plan is to provide timely, accurate, and relevant  information on labor market activity, working conditions, and price  changes. While DOL officials said they consider the agency\u2019s national  labor statistics as the primary tool in understanding macroeconomic  changes, they acknowledged that gathering information from local boards  and other stakeholders may complement those statistics. DOL officials  said they may consider continuing to convene stakeholders to learn more  about automated trucking if they find that their current efforts with DOT  provide fruitful information, but they currently do not have plans to do so.  If DOL waits until the effects of automated trucking on the workforce are  widespread enough to affect multiple local economies, the agency will  have missed the opportunity to proactively gather information that could  help it anticipate large-scale workforce changes in this important industry  before they take effect.", "DOT officials told us they have likewise not made plans to work with DOL  to convene stakeholders on an ongoing basis to gather information.  Rather, they said they have concentrated on developing the analysis  described by the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018 and they do not plan to update that analysis  after it is completed. Nonetheless, one of the objectives outlined by DOT  in its fiscal year 2018-2022 strategic plan is to promote economic  competitiveness by supporting the development of appropriately skilled  transportation workers (including truck drivers who transport freight) and  strategies to meet emerging workforce challenges. Working with DOL to  gather and analyze information from stakeholders as technology  continues to develop could assist DOT in meeting this goal. DOT has  previously collaborated with DOL on transportation workforce issues. For  example, in 2015, DOT and DOL worked with the Department of  Education on a blueprint for aligning investments in transportation,  including trucking, with career pathways. The report highlighted  potential future growth areas in the transportation industry and identified  potential jobs that may be in demand through 2022. Unless DOL and  DOT continue to gather information from stakeholders as automated  trucking technology evolves, they may be unable to fully anticipate the  emerging workforce challenges that may result. DOT\u2019s prior efforts to  convene stakeholders to address automated vehicles could serve as a  model for gathering information from stakeholders about automated  trucking. For example, DOT held a series of meetings across the country  to gather information, identify key issues, and support the transportation  community to integrate automated vehicles onto roads for its National  Dialogue on Highway Automation. Further, analyzing information from  ongoing meetings with stakeholders could help DOT as it considers  potential workforce-related regulatory changes that might be affected by  automated truck technologies, such as the requirements to obtain a  commercial driver\u2019s license or the maximum number of hours commercial  truck drivers are permitted to work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sharing Information", "paragraphs": ["DOL has not provided information to stakeholders about the potential  workforce effects of automated trucking technology, including how the  skills needed to operate a truck may change in the future.

Representatives from all of the truck driver training schools and training  associations we interviewed said they expect drivers to need new skills to  operate or maintain automated trucks, and that future truck drivers may  need an additional certification or endorsement to their commercial driver\u2019s license. However, in the absence of specific information about  future skill changes, they all said they did not know what specific  adjustments would be needed to their curriculum. Additionally, nearly all  stakeholders we spoke with\u2014including representatives of technology  developers, truck driver training schools, and local workforce  development boards\u2014told us that federal agencies can help prepare the  future workforce by sharing information with stakeholders about  impending workforce changes. In particular, some workforce officials we  spoke with said they would benefit from information about technology  developers\u2019 plans that would affect future demand or skills for truck  drivers.", "Furthermore, DOL officials told us that heavy and tractor-trailer truck  driving was the most common type of occupational training funded  through the WIOA Adult and Dislocated Worker programs between April  2017 and March 2018, the most recent period for which data are  available. Specifically, local workforce development boards provided  funding from these programs to roughly 17,000 individuals for heavy and  tractor-trailer truck driver training during that year, or about 15 percent of  all individuals who received training services that began within that  timeframe. This was more than twice as many individuals as those who  received funding for nursing assistant training, the second most frequently  funded type of training through these programs.", "As previously noted, one of DOL\u2019s strategic objectives is to provide timely  and accurate labor market information.

This includes  communicating quality information so that external parties can help the  entity address related risks. Additionally, our work has shown that federal  agencies can play an important role in sharing information. We have  noted that such information sharing is important to help maintain U.S.  competiveness. DOT\u2019s strategic plan highlights the agency\u2019s concern  that the lack of credentialed workers, combined with projected  retirements, threaten to cause significant worker shortages, and that the  introduction of innovations and new technologies adds additional  complexity for workforce development.

For example, Rapid Response, which is carried out  by states and local workforce development agencies, can provide  services to employees after a layoff, including career counseling, job  search assistance, and information about unemployment insurance and  training opportunities. Additionally, under WIOA, local workforce  development boards can use up to 20 percent of their Adult and  Dislocated Worker allocations to help fund the cost of providing  incumbent worker training designed to help avert potential layoffs or  increase the skill levels of employees. While these programs may help  mitigate any future job losses due to automated trucking, DOL would be  better positioned to help local economies leverage them effectively if the  agency continued to convene stakeholders, building on its efforts to  gather and share good information on when and how those workforce  effects are likely to materialize as technology evolves."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Automated and self-driving technology for commercial trucks could make  the industry safer and more efficient, but it also introduces significant  uncertainties for the trucking workforce that DOL and DOT, in  consultation with other federal agencies and stakeholders, can help  navigate.

We used the  following criteria to select interviewees:  1.  authored a report, article, book, or paper regarding automated  trucking technology or its potential workforce effects;  2.  participated in panels, hearings, or roundtables regarding automated  trucking or its potential workforce effects; or  3.  was recommended by at least one of our interviewees.", "We interviewed organized labor representatives; researchers; and  representatives from three truck manufacturers and three companies  operating their own trucking fleet; two national industry organizations; one  national safety organization; four truck driver training schools; an  association of state and local workforce organizations; and four local  workforce development boards. We selected the schools in part based on  recommendations from an association of truck driver training schools, and  included two accredited and two non-accredited schools in our selection.  We selected three of the workforce development boards due to the  prevalence of trucking jobs in their areas and the other board because it  was in an area that several stakeholders suggested could be early to  adopt automated trucking technology.", "Additionally, we visited California, where we interviewed representatives  of four automated truck technology developers and a manufacturer, and  viewed demonstrations of automated trucking technology. We selected  California because it had the largest number of technology developers  that we identified through our research efforts.", "We asked all of these stakeholders a core set of questions, as well as  tailored questions based on their expertise. Some of the questions we  asked stakeholders varied, and some stakeholders chose not to answer  every question we asked because they either did not think they had  sufficient knowledge about the specific question or did not want to make  predictions about future industry developments. Therefore, we generally  did not report the specific number of stakeholder responses in this report.  The views of the stakeholders we interviewed are illustrative examples  and may not be generalizable. For a full list of stakeholders we  interviewed, see table 1.", "Analyzed federal data. To examine how the adoption of automated  trucks could affect the current and future trucking workforce, we  analyzed relevant data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and  the Census Bureau on the current trucking workforce. Specifically, we  examined BLS\u2019s Occupational Employment Statistics to obtain  employment level and wage data for heavy and tractor-trailer truck  drivers (Standard Occupational Classification code 53-3032). The  Occupational Employment Statistics survey is a federal-state  cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics and  State Workforce Agencies. The survey provides estimates regarding  occupational employment and wage rates for the nation as a whole,  by state, by metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area, and by industry or  ownership. Data from self-employed persons are not included in the  estimates. For our analysis of geographic concentration of heavy and  tractor-trailer truck driving jobs, we carried out a one-sided test at the  0.05 percent level of significance of the null hypothesis that a region\u2019s  concentration is equal to or less than twice the national concentration  versus the alternative hypothesis, that the region\u2019s concentration is  greater than twice the national concentration. We classified the  results, excluding any unreliable areas (i.e., areas with a 95 percent  confidence level margin of error for the estimated number of truck  drivers that was larger than 30 percent of the estimate itself). We used  Poisson tests because these are more appropriate for event  occurrences in smaller populations or on a small number of cases. In  addition, we analyzed data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American  Community Survey regarding the education level, sex, and age of  current truck drivers and other drivers. The American Community  Survey is an ongoing survey that collects information about the U.S.  population such as jobs and occupations, educational attainment,  income and earnings and other topics. According to the Census  Bureau\u2019s description of the American Community Survey, this survey  uses a series of monthly samples to produce annually updated  estimates for the same small areas (census tracts and block groups)  formerly surveyed via the decennial census long-form sample. Based  on our review of related documents and interviews with  knowledgeable agency officials, we found the data to be reliable for  our purposes.", "Synthesized literature. To explore how and when automated vehicle  technologies could affect the current fleet of commercial trucks and  gather information about the possible employment effects of this  technology, we conducted a review of key research related to  automated vehicle technologies for commercial trucks. We searched  bibliographic databases for articles that were published between  January 1, 2014 and May 22, 2018 and included key terms such as  \u201cautonomous\u201d, \u201cautomated\u201d, \u201cdriverless\u201d, and \u201ctruck platoon\u201d to  describe the trucking technology. We also asked the researchers we  interviewed to identify any studies that may be relevant to our work.", "Our search initially resulted in over 250 articles with potential  relevance to our objectives. Two analysts reviewed the abstracts of  these articles to determine if the articles in this initial search were  germane to our objectives. We excluded any articles that were not  relevant to our objectives or did not meet our standards for empirical  analysis.", "We included articles that were published in peer review journals, by  industry, or by government agencies, as well as articles that were  recommended by researchers we interviewed. We identified a final list  of 12 studies that met our criteria. Although we reviewed each study\u2019s  methodological approach, we did not independently assess the  evidence in the articles or verify the analysis of the evidence that was  used to come to the conclusions these studies reached."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Potential Legal Factors That May Affect Timing of Automated Trucking", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": ["Cindy Brown Barnes or Susan Fleming, (202) 512-7215 or  brownbarnesc@gao.gov or flemings@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["GAO staff who made major contributions to this report include Brandon  Haller (Assistant Director), Rebecca Woiwode (Assistant Director), Drew  Nelson (Analyst-in-Charge), MacKenzie Cooper, Marcia Fernandez, and  Hedieh Fusfield.
