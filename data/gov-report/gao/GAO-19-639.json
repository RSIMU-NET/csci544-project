According to FAA data, the rate of reported runway incursions nearly doubled from fiscal years 2011 through 2018, with most of this increase due to a rise in reports of less severe incursions, or those without immediate safety consequences. However, GAO found that FAA has not identified or removed all duplicates from its data on runway \u201cexcursions\u201d\u2014when an aircraft veers off or overruns a runway\u2014which limits FAA's ability to accurately analyze these incidents.

For example, FAA has funded multiple technologies to improve runway safety, such as Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X)\u2014a ground surveillance system that enables air traffic controllers to track landing and departing aircraft and alerts controllers of potential collisions. However, FAA has not assessed the effectiveness of ASDE-X. Similarly, FAA has not assessed the effectiveness of its Runway Safety Program, whereby FAA staff, along with local airport stakeholders, provide data and support to local air traffic managers to help identify and manage terminal area safety incidents. FAA has taken steps to evaluate some of its terminal-area safety efforts, such as tracking the number of runway excursions safely stopped by a lightweight, crushable concrete designed to stop or greatly slow an aircraft that overruns the runway.

In addition, in fiscal year 2018, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) recorded over 1,800 incidents of planes,  vehicles, or pedestrians entering runways when they were not authorized  to do so. Since establishing runway safety as a strategic objective in  2002, FAA has undertaken many efforts to address this issue, including  collecting and sharing information on incidents and deploying  technologies that can alert air traffic controllers of potential collisions.  Additionally, FAA has implemented a data-driven, risk-based safety  oversight approach that is designed to identify hazards, manage risks,  and take corrective action before an accident occurs.

We  interviewed officials from these agencies as well as the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), airport and airline associations,  and aviation safety organizations. We conducted semi-structured  interviews with airport operators and air traffic controllers from 10 airports  selected from certificated airports to include those with high runway  incident rates in the last 3 years, certain runway safety technologies in  place, and variation in geography. We interviewed officials in person and  observed facility operations at 4 of these 10 airports\u2014Los Angeles  International Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (Washington, D.C.); San Antonio International Airport; and William P.

For example, a team of representatives from the Air Traffic  Organization, the Office of Airports, and the Office of Flight Standards,  uses information on each incursion to classify its severity into one of four  categories\u2014A through D. An example of a category A incursion  occurred in June 2018 in Springfield, Missouri, when an aircraft with 53  people on board accelerated for takeoff before noticing an airport  operations vehicle crossing the runway. No injuries or damage were  reported, but a collision was narrowly avoided. An example of a Category  C or D incursion is a pilot entering a runway without authorization, but  without significant potential for a collision. FAA reports the rate of severe  category A and B incursions to Congress and the public in its annual  performance plan.", "FAA also uses data to analyze runway incursions over time. For example,  FAA data show that the number and rate of reported runway incursions  nearly doubled from 954 in fiscal year 2011 to 1804 in fiscal year 2018  (see fig. 4). The majority of reported runway incursions (62 percent) were  pilot deviations followed by operational incidents (20 percent) and  vehicle/pedestrian deviations (18 percent).", "According to our analysis of FAA data, the increase in reported incursions  was largely due to an increase in less severe incursions. Our analysis  showed that severe incursions (category A and B) in which there is a  significant potential for a collision, are relatively infrequent. Category C  and D incursions, in which there is less potential for a collision, are more  frequent. According to FAA officials, the increase in less severe  incursions may be due to increased reporting of these incidents, which we  also noted in our 2011 report on terminal area safety. However, the  number and rate of reported runway incursions has continued to steadily  increase since then, and may also indicate an increase in the actual  occurrence of incidents.", "In 2017, FAA developed a new metric to analyze excursions and other  incidents, as well as incursions. According to FAA officials, the new metric  (\u201cSurface Safety Metric\u201d) measures the relative riskiness of terminal area  incidents by assigning a different severity weight to each incursion,  excursion, or other incident depending on its proximity to a fatal accident.  For example, FAA documentation states that the new metric assigns a  severity weight of 1 to incidents that result in a fatal injury, 0.6 to incidents  with serious injuries, and 0.3 to incidents with minor injuries. Incidents in  which there are no injuries are assigned even lower severity weights\u2014for  example 0.003 for a category A incursion and 0.002 for a category B  incursion. FAA officials said they will analyze these severity weights  year-to-year, so they can identify trends in each type of incident and  across all incidents. For example, FAA officials noted that despite an  increase in the number of runway incursions from fiscal years 2011  through 2018, the estimated risk of these incidents, as measured by their  severity weights, declined. FAA has developed new performance goals  tied to this metric, which it plans to report to Congress and the public by  the end of fiscal year 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duplicate Data May Affect FAA\u2019s Ability to Analyze Excursions", "paragraphs": ["FAA has analyzed excursion data through special FAA task teams and  other joint industry efforts with airlines, associations, and other  government agencies. Excursions occur when an aircraft veers off the  side or end of a runway, and can result in serious injury, death, or  property damage. For example, on September 27, 2018, a small aircraft  slid off the side of the runway at Greenville Downtown Airport in South  Carolina shortly after landing. The aircraft continued down a 50-foot cliff,  resulting in the deaths of two people. According to data FAA provided to  us, nearly 700 excursions were reported in fiscal year 2018. Additionally,  several joint industry efforts and special task teams have recently  analyzed excursions. For example, the Commercial Aviation Safety  Team (CAST), which FAA co-leads, found that about a third of the  commercial accidents in the U.S. that resulted in fatalities or irreparable  damage to the aircraft from 2006 through 2015 were attributed to runway  excursions.", "In 2013, FAA began collecting additional data on excursions, but our  review of FAA\u2019s data found the excursion data FAA has collected since  then contain duplicates. In 2011, we found that FAA was not formally  tracking runway excursions and recommended that FAA develop a plan  to track and assess them, which FAA began doing in 2013. Prior to  2013, FAA collected excursion data from two sources\u2014the NTSB  Aviation Accident Database, which contains information gathered during  NTSB investigations, and FAA\u2019s own Aviation Safety Information Analysis  and Sharing (ASIAS) database, which includes information on incidents  that may not reach the level of an NTSB investigation, such as an incident  without serious injuries or fatalities. In 2013, FAA began identifying  excursions in a third source\u2014mandatory occurrence reports that FAA  requires air traffic controllers to file when they observe an incident. FAA  officials said that the additional excursions they identified through these  mandatory occurrence reports added 15 percent more annual reports to  those that they had identified through only the other two sources.", "However, FAA officials said there are likely duplicate records in their  excursion data as a single excursion could be reported in more than one  of these three sources. Although we did not have enough identifying  information in the excursion data FAA provided to confirm the number of  duplicate reports, our analysis of excursion data did identify possible  duplicates. Further, despite containing possible duplicates, FAA recently  began using these excursion data in its new surface safety metric.  Federal standards for internal control state that data should be  appropriate, current, complete, and accurate. A 2017 FAA internal  analysis also noted the importance of identifying duplicates in order to  ensure accurate runway excursion data. FAA officials said that they do  not know how many duplicate records there are, and that they do not  have an automated way to identify (and remove) all duplicates. FAA  officials said that they could manually identify and remove duplicates, but  that they do not currently do this nor plan to do so because duplicate  excursion records would not affect their assessment of excursion risk.  FAA officials said that excursions captured solely by the mandatory  occurrence reports tend to be minor, lower-risk events. However, without  a process to identify duplicates, FAA is not able to verify that this  statement is true, and therefore cannot accurately assess and mitigate  the risk excursions pose to terminal area safety."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Does Not Use Data to Analyze Ramp Area Incidents", "paragraphs": ["FAA does not use data to analyze most ramp area incidents, and does  not plan to do so in its new surface safety metric. While the manager of  the Runway Safety Group said FAA analyzes fatal ramp accidents  through its participation in CAST, it does not analyze non-fatal ramp  incidents, which are estimated to occur more frequently. In addition to  some airport and airline officials telling us that they likely collect ramp  data, FAA\u2019s Runway Safety Group manager said that FAA likely has data  on some non-fatal ramp incidents. For example, some air traffic  controllers we interviewed said that they would report any ramp area  incidents they observed through FAA\u2019s mandatory reporting process, and  officials from a pilot association told us they would also report such  incidents. However, FAA officials said that FAA does not plan to analyze  ramp incidents in the agency\u2019s new surface safety metric. FAA\u2019s Runway  Safety Program Manager said that FAA has not analyzed most ramp area  incidents because the risk of these incidents is lower than that in other  areas, such as runways, and therefore does not merit analysis. For  example, the manager said that aircraft speed in the ramp area is  generally slower than take-off or landing speed, and fatalities are  infrequent.", "However, we have previously reported that ramp areas are typically  small, congested areas in which departing and arriving aircraft are  serviced by ramp workers, who include baggage, catering, and fueling  personnel. These areas can be dangerous for ground workers and  passengers. The Flight Safety Foundation, which has collected its own  data on ramp safety, estimated that each year 27,000 ramp accidents and  incidents occur worldwide and can be costly due to effects such as  damage to aircraft and schedule disruptions. In addition, ramp areas are  complex because safety responsibilities in these areas vary by airport and  even by terminal. For example, officials at Boston Logan International  Airport told us that the airport operator shares some responsibilities with  airlines but maintains control over all ramp areas. By contrast, officials at  Los Angeles International Airport told us that in terminals leased by  individual airlines, the airline controls the ramp area, while the airport  operator controls the ramp areas in terminals where multiple airlines  operate. Officials from the Air Line Pilots Association told us that ramp  areas are the \u201cscariest part of airports.\u201d One official gave an example of  inconsistencies between airports that can cause confusion and risk, such  as some airport ramp areas being marked with painted lines while others  are not.", "Federal internal control standards state that data should be appropriate,  current, complete, and accurate. In addition, FAA\u2019s own SMS calls for  FAA to use a data-driven approach to analyze safety risks so that it can  control that risk. As part of those efforts, FAA began the rulemaking  process in 2010 to require airports to implement SMS, through which  airports would analyze risks in runways, taxiways, and ramp areas, but as  of August 2019 this rule had not been finalized. Although some airport  officials we interviewed said they are voluntarily implementing SMS and  could be collecting data on ramp area incidents, FAA\u2014with its role in  overseeing safety at all commercial airports\u2014is better positioned to take  steps to analyze ramp incidents across all U.S. airports. For example, an  individual airport implementing SMS would analyze ramp area incidents  at that airport, but FAA could analyze ramp area incidents and identify  trends across hundreds of airports as it does for other terminal area  incidents described above. Beginning to analyze ramp area incidents, for  example in its new metric, would provide FAA with information necessary  to mitigate ramp area incidents and ensure that it is directing its efforts to  the riskiest parts of the terminal area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA and Others Have Implemented Multiple Efforts to Address Terminal Area Safety, but FAA Has Not Assessed the Effectiveness of Many of Its Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA, Airports, and Airlines Have Implemented Multiple Efforts to Improve Terminal Area Safety", "paragraphs": ["FAA, airports, and airlines have implemented multiple efforts, including  technologies, to improve runway, taxiway, and ramp safety; FAA\u2019s efforts,  which are coordinated by the Runway Safety Group, focus primarily on  runway and taxiway safety."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Runway Safety-Related Programs", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s primary runway and taxiway safety effort is the Runway Safety  Program, whereby staff develop national and regional runway safety  plans, analyze data on runway and taxiway incidents, and help local air  traffic control managers organize annual Runway Safety Action Team  (RSAT) meetings at which FAA, airport operator, and other stakeholders  at each airport discuss recent runway and taxiway incidents. Prior to each  RSAT, FAA\u2019s Regional Runway Safety Program Managers we met with  told us they compile and share available information on each incident that  occurred in the last year at the airport with the local air traffic manager.  This information may include trends in incursions, the location of each  incident on an airport map, and results from vehicle/pedestrian deviation  investigations conducted by the FAA Office of Airports. Each air traffic  manager then presents this information to attendees, who may include  staff from FAA\u2019s Office of Airports or Flights Standards, the airport  operator, and local pilots.", "Participants discuss the prior year\u2019s incidents, identify risks, and develop  a plan to mitigate these risks. For example, attendees at an RSAT in  Phoenix, Arizona, discussed risk factors that could be contributing to pilot  deviations, and identified that pilots could be missing taxiway markings  that instruct pilots to stop before proceeding onto a runway.  Consequently, these RSAT attendees developed a plan to add lights to  the surrounding area to improve visibility. The attendees also tasked air  traffic managers with developing a program to provide annual tours of the  tower and airfield to local pilots and personnel working on the airfield to  show both parties what the other sees during flight operations.", "Another important FAA effort is the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM)  Program established by the Office of Airports in 2015 to identify strategies  to mitigate areas of airport runways or taxiways that do not meet current  FAA airport design standards and have high incursions rates (\u201cRIM  locations\u201d). There can be multiple RIM locations at a single airport. FAA  considers locations for inclusion in the RIM inventory based on whether  the location has a non-standard design and has experienced three or  more incursions in a given calendar year, or averaged at least one  incursion per year over the course of the RIM program. At RIM  locations, FAA provides funding and technical assistance to airports to  mitigate the risk of incursions, such as by changing airport design and by  improving runway and taxiway signage. For example, the airport may  reconfigure a taxiway to intersect a runway at a 90-degree angle (the FAA  standard), or install \u201chold position\u201d signs at intersections between two  runways. According to FAA, at the end of fiscal year 2018, FAA had  helped airports mitigate 33 RIM locations through the program, leaving  135 locations across 79 airports that still needed to be mitigated.", "FAA also collaborates with industry stakeholders to identify and address  runway and taxiway safety issues. For example, FAA serves as Co-Chair  of CAST, which analyzes data across airports to identify root causes of  incidents and develop and track mitigations to address those causes. For  instance, through CAST, FAA and industry stakeholders developed  training for air traffic controllers to mitigate the risk of runway excursions.  The training described factors that can contribute to runway excursions  such as adverse winds, wet or contaminated runways, or unstable aircraft  approaches. In addition, in 2015, FAA convened a forum of aviation  stakeholders representing government, industry, and labor called the  Runway Safety Call to Action which developed 22 short-, medium-, and  long-range mitigations to address the rising number of reported runway  incursions. In 2018, the DOT Office of Inspector General reviewed FAA\u2019s  progress in implementing these 22 mitigations and made three  recommendations to address implementation challenges it identified,  including consolidating duplicate mitigations and, as mentioned below,  developing a plan to measure their effectiveness. As of August 2019,  FAA had not implemented these recommendations.", "Individual airport operators and airlines have implemented their own  efforts to improve runway, taxiway, and ramp safety. For example,  officials who manage Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu,  Hawaii, told us that they changed the location of markings in an airport  area known to be confusing to some pilots, which reduced incursions at  this location. In addition, officials from Airlines for America and the  Regional Airlines Association told us airlines host safety meetings where  they leverage their collective data to identify and address industry-wide  safety trends.

In some instances, FAA has taken steps to evaluate its terminal-area  safety efforts. For example, FAA tracks the Runway Incursion Mitigation  Program\u2019s outcomes and the number of runway excursions safely  stopped by an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). FAA also  contracted with a research organization in 2017 to evaluate the  effectiveness of Runway Status Lights on the runway incursion rate at 15  airports. Further, the Runway Safety Program manager described other  instances in which local airport officials have taken steps to evaluate the  effect of mitigations at those airports.

Evaluating a program\u2019s effectiveness can  include methods such as surveying a program\u2019s managers (e.g., regional  runway safety program managers), or comparing a program\u2019s  performance to an evaluative criterion (e.g., a measure of terminal area  safety). Without assessing the effectiveness of its range of efforts, FAA  cannot determine the extent to which each of its efforts contribute to its  goal of improving runway and taxiway safety, or whether other actions are  needed. As discussed previously, FAA has efforts designed to increase  runway and taxiway safety that range from periodic stakeholder meetings  to multi-million dollar ground surveillance systems.

The manager of the  Runway Safety Group told us that Regional Runway Safety Program  Managers may request individual investigations from regional Flight  Standards officials, but that it would be time consuming for these regional  managers to make such requests for every pilot deviation.", "One of FAA\u2019s objectives is to improve runway and taxiway safety, and  federal internal control standards state that management should internally  communicate the information necessary to help meet its objectives.  Without timely access to the results of Flight Standards\u2019 incident  investigations, Regional Runway Safety Program Managers\u2014and  therefore, local air traffic control managers\u2014may not have all of the  relevant information they need to develop appropriate runway and  taxiway safety mitigation strategies and plans.", "Selected airport operators we interviewed also reported that they may not  have all information they need to develop appropriate terminal area safety  mitigation strategies. Specifically, most of those we interviewed reported  that air traffic control managers did not provide them with complete and  timely information on all runway and taxiway incidents. Six of 10 airport  operators we interviewed told us that air traffic control managers did not  notify them of all runway and taxiway incidents as they happened.  Further, some airport operators told us that they were not aware of all  incidents until the annual RSAT meeting. For example, the operator of  one airport told us that the air traffic manager notifies the airport of  vehicle/pedestrian deviations immediately, but not of operational incidents  or pilot deviations. The Manager of the Runway Safety Program also  confirmed that communication varies by airport operator and air traffic  manager.", "According to federal internal control standards, management should  communicate quality information externally so that external parties can  help the entity achieve its objectives and address related risks. Further,  according to air traffic control procedures, controllers are required to  report as soon as possible to airport managers and others \u201cany  information which may have an adverse effect on air safety.\u201d However,  this requirement does not specify the types of terminal area safety  incidents to which this applies. Also, through a 2018 internal risk  management process, FAA identified the need for enhanced  communication among airport management, the FAA Air Traffic  Organization, and pilots at towered airport facilities, in order to mitigate  the safety risks associated with runway incursions. Lacking complete  information on runway and taxiway incidents at their airports could  hamper airport operators\u2019 ability to develop appropriate safety strategies  or make investment decisions related to safety in a timely manner. For  example, the operator of one airport told us that not being notified of  operational incidents means the airport does not have a complete picture  of the safety incidents there, which limits their ability to identify trends or  training needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s safety oversight approach is designed to use data to identify  hazards, manage risks, and mitigate them before an accident occurs.", "FAA uses data to analyze runway incursions, and recently developed a  new metric to track the risk of terminal-area incidents. However, without  leveraging data to analyze all terminal-area incidents, FAA may be  missing opportunities to better target the agency\u2019s resources, and  ultimately to further improve safety. For example, because FAA does not  have a process to eliminate all duplicates from its excursion data, it does  not have assurance that its excursion data are accurate, and it may be  missing opportunities to mitigate the risks excursions pose. Similarly,  taking steps to analyze ramp area incidents by identifying such incidents  in its new metric would help FAA determine whether it needs to focus  more on improving safety in ramp areas. In addition, establishing a plan  to evaluate all of its runway and taxiway safety efforts would help FAA  direct its resources toward activities and technologies proven to enhance  safety and identify ways to strengthen those efforts. Moreover, improving  internal communication among FAA offices could make the annual  Runway Safety Action Team meetings\u2014a key component of FAA\u2019s  terminal area safety efforts\u2014more effective. And last, improving external  communication between air traffic managers and airport operators would  help airports identify and implement needed mitigations more quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to FAA:  1.
