The Cellular Telecommunication & Internet Association (CTIA) and FDA will jointly conduct research on mobile phone health affects. Although the initiative is funded solely by CTIA, FDA's active role in setting the research agenda and providing scientific oversight should help alleviate concerns about the objectivity of the report. The media has widely reported on the debate over whether mobile phones can cause health problems. Thus, the federal government's role in providing the public with clear information on this issue is particularly important. FDA has a consumer information update on mobile phone health issues but has not revised that data since October 1999.

The rapid adoption of wireless telephones, especially handheld mobile phones, has occurred amidst controversy over whether this technology poses a risk to human health. Like other devices that transmit radio signals, mobile phones emit radiofrequency energy. At high power levels, radiofrequency energy can rapidly heat biological tissue and cause damage, such as burns. Mobile phones operate at power levels well below the level at which such heating effects occur. However, an issue that has been the subject of research and debate for several years is whether long-term exposure to low-level radiofrequency energy from mobile phones could cause other types of adverse health effects, such as cancer.", "In 1994, we reported on the status of scientific knowledge about potential health risks of radiofrequency emissions by mobile phones and the federal government\u2019s regulatory actions to ensure the safety of mobile phones.We noted at the time that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believed that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether exposure to low-level radiofrequency energy presents a human health risk. Given the state of scientific knowledge, they told us that they did not have a basis for taking regulatory actions on mobile phones.

We also interviewed representatives of these organizations, as well as other scientists prominent in the field of radiofrequency energy health effects in government, industry, and academia. To determine the federal government\u2019s role in sponsoring, conducting, or overseeing research on mobile phone health effects, we gathered information from federal agencies\u2014including the Air Force, Army, EPA, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), FDA, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Science Foundation, Navy, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2014on their activities, if any, in this area.", "To describe and assess the cooperative research agreement between FDA and CTIA, we conducted interviews with officials of these two organizations.

We also discussed the cooperative research agreement with parties outside of FDA and CTIA, including officials at several federal agencies and individual mobile phone manufacturers, as well as independent research scientists and public interest groups. This research agreement follows up on an earlier industry- funded, 5-year research effort run by Wireless Technology Research (WTR). We spoke to the former chairman of WTR, as well as several members of its peer review board and some of the research scientists that WTR funded.

We also met with officials at FCC, FDA, EPA, and other agencies to discuss their regulatory roles and activities, and with industry representatives to discuss their views and activities. To gain greater context on all of the objectives, we also interviewed representatives of nonindustry, nongovernment organizations with an interest in mobile phone safety, including consumer groups, advocates, and labor unions.", "Our review focused on health issues related to the radiofrequency energy emitted from handheld mobile phones.

In 1994, 16 million Americans were subscribers. By 2001, subscribership had reached an estimated 110 million (see fig. 1) and is projected to have strong growth for the foreseeable future. Growth has been strong in other countries as well, with some experts projecting that worldwide subscribership will reach about 1.2 billion by 2005. In countries such as Austria, Finland, Italy, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden, more than half the population are already subscribers.", "The pocket-sized mobile phone in common use today is a low-powered radio transceiver (a combination transmitter and receiver) that uses radio waves to communicate with fixed installations, called base stations or cell towers. The base stations are networked to a central switching station that directs a mobile phone call to the desired location, whether that is another mobile phone or a traditional landline phone. The radio waves used by mobile phones are a form electromagnetic radiation\u2014a series of waves of electric and magnetic energy that move together through space. The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation comprises a range of frequencies from very-low-frequency energy (such as electrical power), through visible light, to extremely high-frequency radiation (such as X-rays and gamma rays), as shown in figure 2. The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used by mobile phones\u2014as well as other telecommunications services, such as radio and television broadcasting\u2014is generally referred to as the \u201cradiofrequency spectrum.\u201d Frequencies in this part of the spectrum are also used for some noncommunications applications, such as microwave ovens and radar.", "As figure 2 shows, the electromagnetic spectrum includes ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, has energy levels high enough to strip electrons from atoms and molecules. Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause serious biological damage, including the production of cancers. Radiofrequencies, on the other hand, are in the \u201cnon-ionizing\u201d portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which lacks the energy needed to cause ionization. However, radiofrequency energy can produce other types of biological effects. For example, it has been known for many years that exposure to high levels of radiofrequency energy, particularly at microwave frequencies, can rapidly heat biological tissue. This heating (\u201cthermal\u201d effect) can cause harm by increasing body temperature, disrupting behavior, and damaging biological tissue. The heating effect can also be usefully harnessed for household and industrial applications, such as cooking food and molding plastics.", "Mobile phones are designed to operate at power levels well below the threshold for known thermal effects.", "A mobile phone is designed to operate at a maximum power level of 0.6 watts\u2014less than the amount of power needed to light a flashlight bulb\u2014and generally uses less than maximum power when operating close to a base station. By contrast, household microwave ovens use between 600 and 1,100 watts of power. head absorbs some radiofrequency energy when the phone is held to the ear during a call.", "The mobile phone health issue came to national attention in 1993 after a lawsuit was brought against some mobile phone companies by a Florida man claiming that his wife\u2019s use of a mobile phone caused her brain cancer.

A relatively large body of research exists on the health effects of radiofrequency energy in general, but most of this research has focused on short-term exposure of the entire body, not on the longer-term exposure of the head that is characteristic of mobile phone use. In addition, much of the research to date has investigated the health effects of emissions at frequencies different from those used by mobile phones; it is not clear how possible health effects found at one frequency on the radiofrequency spectrum apply to other frequencies on the spectrum. Furthermore, much of the research focusing on mobile phones has tested the emissions of analog phones rather than of digital phones, which are rapidly becoming the standard technology. A few researchers have hypothesized that digital phones, which transmit messages as discontinuous pulses, could have different biological effects from analog phones, which transmit messages using a continuously varying radio wave. However, according to FDA, at this point the available scientific literature does not demonstrate convincingly that the biological effects of radiofrequency exposure differ based on specific frequency, or on whether the signal is analog or digital.", "Two major categories of studies are used by scientists to assess whether mobile phones present a health risk: epidemiological studies and laboratory studies. Epidemiological studies, sometimes called human health studies, investigate the associations between health effects and the characteristics of people and their environment. Laboratory studies, which can include studies on animals, biological tissue samples, isolated cells, or human volunteers, are used to try to determine a causal relationship between a risk factor and human health, and the mechanism through which that relationship occurs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts Under Way to Conduct Additional Research", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations, established the International Electromagnetic Fields Project, which seeks to assess the health and environmental effects of exposure to electric and magnetic fields, including radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile phones. The agency notes that because the number of people using mobile phones has grown so large, even small adverse effects on health could have major public health implications. The goals of the project include coordinating international research efforts in the area, assessing the scientific literature, and identifying gaps in knowledge needing further research.", "In 1998, the project developed an agenda for research priorities on the health effects of electromagnetic fields. This agenda was developed in collaboration with a number of international organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the European Commission, as well as independent scientific institutions in several countries. FDA officials told us that they participated heavily in the development of this research agenda and that they concur with it. Among the research priorities identified were (1) additional large-scale animal studies that test the effect of long-term exposure to radiofrequency energy; (2) studies that test health effects other than cancer, such as memory loss and effects on the eye or inner ear; and (3) at least two additional large-scale epidemiological studies of people exposed to radiofrequency energy, including mobile phone users.", "Officials at the World Health Organization and FDA told us that most of these research needs are being addressed by ongoing or planned studies in countries around the world. Because of the nature of many of these studies, however, it may be several years before results are reported. Highlights of efforts currently under way or planned include the following.", "The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a part of the World Health Organization, is coordinating a series of large epidemiological studies looking at whether there is an association between mobile phone use and brain cancer.

Officials at the program are determining how their efforts should be coordinated with the European Commission\u2019s planned animal studies.", "The United Kingdom\u2019s Department of Health announced in December 2000 a research program of up to $10 million on the possible health effects of mobile phone emissions. While the specific areas of research to be conducted are still under review, one strong area of focus is expected to be noncancer effects, such as effects on brain function. In addition to these efforts, there are various other government-supported national research programs on mobile phone health issues, including programs in Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden. Most of these programs are being coordinated with, or are being conducted in collaboration with, the programs of the World Health Organization and/or the European Commission.", "Many of the initiatives in mobile phone research are funded through a combination of government and industry money. For example, mobile phone research being done under the Fifth Framework Programme is being financed 40 percent by the European Commission and 60 percent by the mobile phone industry. Similarly, the United Kingdom\u2019s effort is being financed half by the government and half by the industry. Much of the industry funding is done through the GSM Association, which represents the wireless communications industry, and the Mobile Manufacturers Forum, an international consortium of mobile phone manufacturers that funds and coordinates research efforts on the public health effects of mobile phones and base stations. In addition, some individual mobile phone manufacturing companies conduct their own internal research programs.

FDA proposed that the two organizations engage in a cooperative research effort, but CTIA declined primarily because, they told us, they feared that government involvement would add bureaucratic complexity that would slow down the effort. Instead, on its own, CTIA established the Scientific Advisory Group on Cellular Telephone Research, whose goal was to develop, fund, and manage a research program assessing whether mobile phones pose a public health risk and, if so, what should be done to mitigate that risk. CTIA committed $25 million over 5 years to the group. Using input from outside scientists, the Scientific Advisory Group developed a research agenda that included multidisciplinary studies involving epidemiology, cell cultures, test animals, and dosimetry (the measurement of radiation). The group\u2019s activities were reviewed by the Peer Review Board on Cellular Telephones, a board of outside scientists coordinated through Harvard University\u2019s Center for Risk Analysis.", "In our 1994 report on mobile phone safety, we noted that the Scientific Advisory Group was being directly funded by CTIA on a month-by-month basis, an arrangement that could have raised questions about the objectivity and credibility of the research effort. In 1995, the Scientific Advisory Group was transformed into Wireless Technology Research, L.L.C. (WTR), a nonprofit organization financed by, but autonomous from, CTIA. WTR\u2019s structure was designed to maintain independence from industry control. However, several representatives of federal agencies and industry, as well as members of WTR\u2019s Peer Review Board, told us they believe that the structure set up for WTR resulted in too little accountability. WTR had a three-person board of directors, but the chairman of this board also served as the day-to-day manager of WTR\u2019s activities and did not report directly to CTIA or to any other body.", "Our 1994 report recommended that FDA and EPA, in coordination with FCC, work with the Scientific Advisory Group to maximize the usefulness, independence, and objectivity of the group\u2019s research effort. However, in the end, no federal agency had a role overseeing WTR\u2019s research activities. FDA officials told us that they did not take an oversight role in WTR because it was a private organization not under FDA\u2019s control and that, in any case, WTR rarely solicited input from FDA and did not always follow the input that was given.", "WTR spent about $28 million over 5 years, including about $25 million for research on the health effects of mobile phone emissions. A broad array of scientists and government and industry officials we spoke with said that some of the research sponsored by WTR was useful. However, they questioned both the type of projects WTR selected and the amount of research that was produced, given the financial resources it had available. In addition, WTR\u2019s Peer Review Board raised concerns about WTR\u2019s management in a July 1997 letter to the chairman of WTR. Among other issues, the board expressed concern that WTR was not always open and transparent, particularly with regard to its finances, and that decisions about the direction of its research agenda did not always follow the advice of outside experts. The chairman of WTR told us that in retrospect WTR should have been more transparent about its work and its finances. However, he said that WTR\u2019s research agenda incorporated the input of a wide number of outside experts. He also said that WTR\u2019s mission was broader in scope than just sponsoring research; it included tracking the emerging scientific information on the topic and identifying strategies for mitigating any public risk.", "The WTR effort eventually became caught up in public controversy. In May 1999, near the end of WTR\u2019s funding period, the chairman of WTR issued a statement that while the results of WTR research did not show a need for public health intervention, the preliminary findings of two studies raised concerns that warranted follow-up research. The chairman stated that one study (see fn. 14) had found that human blood cells exposed to mobile phone frequency radiation showed genetic damage in the form of micronuclei, which is often considered a precursor to cancer. The second study (see fn. 11) was an epidemiological study that, according to the chairman, found a statistically significant risk of a certain rare type of tumor. However, the findings of this study were preliminary, the analysis of the data had not yet been completed, and the study had not yet been fully peer-reviewed or published. In addition, the principal researcher of this study disagreed with the chairman\u2019s interpretation of his findings.

In contrast to WTR, which had a broad mission, the scope of the CRADA is limited to addressing the concerns raised by the two previous studies and assessing what further research might be needed. Overall, the research planned under the CRADA represents a small piece of the ongoing research worldwide related to mobile phone safety, government officials and scientists in the area told us.", "Unlike the WTR effort, the CRADA involves the direct participation of FDA. CTIA officials told us that their experience with WTR taught them that FDA involvement would be beneficial because it would add accountability and scientific credibility to the new research effort. FDA\u2019s role in the CRADA is to (1) determine what types of research studies should be conducted, (2) evaluate and prioritize the research proposals received, and (3) review and assess the results of the research.

Variations also occur because laboratories can use different testing procedures. When FCC established its mobile phone radiofrequency exposure limit in 1996, the industry did not have uniform standards for testing SAR levels.

FDA rules state that microwave oven manufacturers must take all measurement errors and uncertainty into account when demonstrating compliance with FDA\u2019s radiofrequency energy performance standard for these devices. An FDA official said that this rule essentially lowers a microwave oven\u2019s maximum level of allowable radiofrequency energy leakage by the margin of measurement uncertainty. FCC, on the other hand, considers a phone to be in compliance if the manufacturer\u2019s SAR test result is within FCC\u2019s exposure limit, without incorporating the measurement uncertainty associated with the test result.

In February 1997, IEEE began an effort to set uniform industrywide testing standards. Staff from FDA and FCC participate in this effort. After 4 years of work, IEEE\u2019s standards-setting committee has made considerable progress in developing draft standards. Agreement appears to have been reached on many of the important issues, including standardizing the properties of the mixture that simulates human tissue and the testing positions of the phone. However, IEEE\u2019s draft standards have not yet been finalized because some technical issues still need to be resolved within the committee.", "FCC considers the lack of uniform SAR testing standards to be a major concern. In October 1999, following a media report raising questions about SAR testing, FCC issued a press release stating that if the industry standard-setting committees did not act promptly to finalize standardized testing procedures, FCC would mandate action on its own. In keeping with this statement, FCC officials said that they have developed a draft revision of their 1997 guidance, which is more inclusive and incorporates features of the testing standards that IEEE is developing. FCC officials said that the issuance of their revised guidance is currently on hold pending the completion of IEEE\u2019s testing standards. When we asked if FCC could immediately issue guidance based on those IEEE testing procedures that have already been agreed upon, FCC officials said that this could be done through an FCC public notice. They noted that they have already begun informally advising applicants to use certain of the most widely accepted elements of the test procedures under consideration by IEEE.", "FCC officials said that although IEEE\u2019s new testing standards will reduce the variations in test results due to the use of different procedures, some level of measurement uncertainty is unavoidable. Thus, FCC officials said that, as with any measurement system, SAR tests can provide only a best estimate of a phone\u2019s maximum SAR level. As noted above, the degree of measurement uncertainty depends on a number of factors, including the calibration of the equipment, the precision with which the technician makes the measurements, and the errors due to system instrumentation. Because of these measurement uncertainties, FCC officials said that a phone\u2019s actual maximum SAR level could fall somewhere within a range of 30 percent above or below the phone\u2019s test results (at a confidence interval of 95 percent), even with uniform IEEE testing procedures in place. An industry-funded project conducted by the University of Maryland in cooperation with FDA will attempt to determine more precisely the degree of measurement uncertainty that can be expected with the new IEEE testing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Plans to Test Some Phones", "paragraphs": ["To verify the test data provided by mobile phone manufacturers, FCC is planning to conduct spot tests of some phones\u2019 SAR levels at its Office of Engineering and Technology laboratory. Although FCC officials had hoped to have the facility operational by fall 2000, some needed equipment was still being procured at the time of our review.", "FCC officials noted that because FCC does not have the staff resources to test every mobile phone model that it authorizes, they can only test a sample of these phones. Even so, FCC faces a serious staffing problem in carrying out this initiative. Currently, FCC has only one radiofrequency exposure specialist to both oversee reviews of equipment authorization applications that involve radiofrequency exposure evaluation (about 50 a month, of which 15 to 20 are for mobile phones) and run the new testing facility. FCC and FDA officials have characterized this one specialist as being FCC\u2019s key quality control point for determining whether mobile phones comply with FCC\u2019s exposure limits. FCC officials said that they have tried to recruit another radiofrequency exposure specialist but were unable to find a suitable candidate because it is difficult to compete with the private sector for qualified individuals. They stated that they plan to continue their recruiting effort. To help cope with the current staffing situation, FCC recently trained members of its engineering staff to take over reviewing SAR testing reports under the supervision of the specialist. The goal is to have the specialist spend about half of his time overseeing SAR reviews and the rest of his time on the actual testing of phones\u2019 SAR levels.", "FCC has also turned to Telecommunications Certification Bodies (TCB) to help process equipment authorization applications. A TCB is a private organization that FCC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the American National Standards Institute have accredited to review applications and issue product authorization grants on behalf of FCC. TCBs are processing approximately half of equipment authorization applications, none of which involve SAR tests. Eventually, FCC plans to move the bulk of its application processing to TCBs, including the approval of applications that include SAR tests, while retaining oversight of the TCBs\u2019 activities. At the time of our review, however, the transfer of additional authority to the TCBs had been placed on hold because of a lack of published uniform test procedures. In addition, FCC officials said that TCBs have experienced more difficulties in their application reviews than initially anticipated. FCC officials indicated that they are continuing their training and guidance efforts to improve TCBs\u2019 overall performance. In the near term, all SAR reviews will be performed at the FCC laboratory."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key FDA and FCC Consumer Information Efforts Have Shortcomings", "paragraphs": ["During the past year, as new research studies were published, the print and broadcast media have presented a variety of assessments about the potential health effects of mobile phones.

FDA\u2019s consumer information on mobile phone health issues, however, has not been revised since 1999 and does not reflect more recent studies and research developments. Both FCC\u2019s Office of Engineering and Technology and its Consumer Information Bureau provide the public with information on radiofrequency exposure issues but do not meet general consumers\u2019 need for clear and concise information.

However, FDA adds that there is not enough evidence to know for sure, either way, whether handheld mobile phones might be harmful. The document discusses several research studies, including the two WTR studies that are being followed up under the cooperative research and development agreement between FDA and CTIA. For consumers who want to take simple precautions to limit their exposure to mobile phone radiofrequency emissions, FDA\u2019s update mentions some steps, such as avoiding extended conversations or using a headset while carrying the phone at the waist.", "Although informative, the update has not been revised since 1999, and consequently does not discuss the significance of major, recently published research studies that have been reported and debated in the media. An FDA official told us that the update had not been revised because the scientific picture had not changed significantly since then. Consumers, however, have no way of knowing this from the update and may be left in doubt about FDA\u2019s views on recent research developments. Another problem with the update is that much of its discussion of health research is written in a technical manner that may be confusing to the general public. This issue is particularly important because CTIA has been using FDA\u2019s consumer update as part of its voluntary program that enables manufacturers of mobile phones to receive CTIA certification that their phones meet certain performance, safety, and labeling standards. CTIA officials estimate that 70 to 75 percent of the mobile phones currently sold in the United States are certified under this program. One of the requirements for CTIA certification is that manufacturers include the text of FDA\u2019s \u201cConsumer Update on Mobile Phones\u201d in the packaging of the phones. According to FDA, however, this document was not designed for mass distribution as an insert in mobile phone packaging.

However, we found that this information does not provide adequate consumer-oriented information on radiofrequency exposure and SAR issues. In addition, consumers may access the database directly, without first accessing any other FCC material, because organizations outside of FCC are providing the database\u2019s Web address to consumers. For example, CTIA announced last summer that all new mobile phones receiving CTIA certification after August 1, 2000, would include labeling on the outside of the phone\u2019s box that includes both the phone\u2019s FCC identification number and the Internet address for the equipment authorization database.", "These CTIA-certified phones will also include text material inside the boxes that provides each phone\u2019s SAR number and information on radiofrequency exposure issues. is no scientific evidence that proves wireless phone usage can cause cancer, increased blood pressure, memory loss, or other health problems,\u201d though research is continuing. When they were asked to comment on it, OET officials shared our concern that this characterization could be misleading, because it implies that the health issue is settled. We also pointed out that the Bureau\u2019s Web page did not direct consumers to information resources on radiofrequency exposure issues found elsewhere on the FCC Web site, such as OET\u2019s documents. After we brought these issues to the attention of officials in the Consumer Information Bureau and OET, they began discussions to improve this situation. By the time we concluded our review, the Bureau had created Web links between its consumer Web page and OET\u2019s RF Safety Web page and began working with OET to revise the Market Sense brochure.

Although the initiative is being funded solely by the industry, FDA\u2019s active role in setting the research agenda and providing scientific oversight should help alleviate concerns about the objectivity of industry- funded research. However, FDA has not yet decided the extent to which it will make public its recommendations to CTIA as to which specific research proposals should be funded.
