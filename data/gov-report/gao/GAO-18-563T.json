For example, TSA's Airport Operations Center (AOC) monitors daily wait times and passenger throughput from 28 airports that TSA officials say represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. Furthermore, TSA officials at airports are required to report to the AOC when an event occurs--such as equipment malfunctions--that affects airport screening operations and results in wait times that are greater than 30 minutes in standard screening lanes. For its February 2018 report, GAO analyzed wait time data for the AOC-monitored airports for the period of January 2015 through May 2017 and found that TSA's reported wait times met its standard of less than 30 minutes in standard screening 99 percent of the time. Within that time frame, two airports accounted for the longest wait times in the spring of 2016. TSA officials also identified several tools, such as passenger screening canines, that they reported using to respond to increases in passenger wait times at these airports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Transportation Security  Administration\u2019s (TSA) efforts to monitor passenger wait times and the  number of passengers that are screened at each airport checkpoint,  known as throughput, at airports throughout the United States. As you  know, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s TSA is responsible for  protecting the nation\u2019s transportation systems while also ensuring the free  movement of people and commerce. TSA employs about 43,000  Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) who screen over 2 million  passengers and their accessible and checked baggage each day at  nearly 440 airports across the United States. In the spring of 2016,  unusually long screening checkpoint lines at certain major U.S. airports  raised questions about TSA\u2019s process for allocating TSOs to airports and  managing passenger wait times.", "My testimony today addresses (1) how TSA collects and monitors  passenger wait time and throughput data and (2) tools TSA uses to  respond to increases in passenger wait times. This statement is based on  selected findings from our February 2018 report on staffing allocation and  managing wait times. To perform the work from our previous report, we  analyzed TSA documentation, reports, and data on wait times and  passenger throughput from January 2015 through May 2017 for 28  airports that, according to TSA headquarters officials, represent the  majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally  significant. We also interviewed headquarters officials responsible for  overseeing TSA\u2019s collection and use of wait time and throughput data as  well as Federal Security Directors (FSD) and their designees at eight  selected airports to determine the tools they use to respond to increases  in passenger wait times and throughput.  Further detail on the scope and  methodology for the previously issued report is available within the  published product. The work upon which this testimony is based was  conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

To implement  passenger screening and pursue efficient operations, in addition to relying  on TSOs, TSA works with officials from airlines and airports, as well as  officials from associations that represent airlines and airports. At airports,  FSDs and their designees work with individual airport operators and  airlines to, among other things, adjust TSA resources (i.e., TSOs and  screening assets such as metal detectors) in response to increases in  passenger throughput at each checkpoint, and monitor passenger wait  times at checkpoints.", "At TSA headquarters, the Office of Security Operations (OSO) has  primary responsibility for operation of the Resource Allocation Plan and  allocation of TSOs across airports. To allocate staff to the nearly 440  TSA-regulated airports in the United States, OSO is to use a combination  of computer-based modeling and line-item adjustments based on airport- specific information. First, the agency is to work with a contractor to  evaluate the assumptions\u2014such as rates of expedited screening\u2014used  by the computer-based staffing allocation model to determine the optimal  number of TSOs at each airport based on airport size and configuration,  flight schedules, and the time it takes to perform checkpoint and baggage  screening tasks. Second, after the model has determined how many  TSOs are required for each airport, headquarters-level staff are to make  line item adjustments to account for factors such as differences in staff  availability and training needs that affect each airport.", "In 2007, we reviewed the Resource Allocation Plan (referred to as the  Staffing Allocation Model at that time) and recommended, among other  things, that TSA establish a mechanism to ensure periodic assessment of  the assumptions, such as passenger and checked baggage screening  rates, underlying the plan. TSA agreed with the recommendation, and in  December 2007 developed and implemented a plan to periodically  assess the plan\u2019s assumptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Processes for Collecting Wait Time and Throughput Data at Airports", "paragraphs": ["At each airport, TSA is to collect throughput data on the number of  passengers screened under both expedited and standard screening and  monitor passenger wait times at screening checkpoints. TSA airport  officials are to submit passenger throughput and wait time data on a daily  basis to OSO\u2019s Performance Management Division at TSA headquarters,  which compiles the data through the Performance Measurement  Information System, TSA\u2019s web-based data collection system. TSA  required FSDs and their designees to collect actual wait times from 2002  through 2007 and beginning again in July 2014. From 2008 through June  2014, TSA required that FSDs collect data on wait time ranges, such as  between 20 to 29 minutes or greater than 30 minutes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Information Sharing Efforts with Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["In February 2018, we reported that TSA headquarters officials have taken  steps intended to improve information sharing with stakeholders\u2014officials  from airlines and airports, as well as officials from associations that  represent airlines and airports\u2014about staffing and related screening  procedures at airports. For example, we reported that TSA holds daily  conference calls with stakeholders at selected airports intended to ensure  timely communication and to help identify and address challenges in  airport operations such as increases in passenger wait times.  Additionally, we reported that TSA conducted a series of presentations  and meetings to discuss the Resource Allocation Plan, security  enhancements at airports, and airport screening processes, among other  things."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Uses Passenger Wait Time and Throughput Data to Monitor Airport Operations on a Daily Basis", "paragraphs": ["In February 2018, we reported that TSA collects passenger wait time and  throughput data and uses those data to monitor daily operations at  airports. TSA\u2019s Operations Directive (directive), Reporting Customer  Throughput and Wait Times, provides instructions for collecting and  reporting wait time and passenger throughput data for TSA screening  lanes. Regarding wait time data, according to the directive, FSDs or their  designees at all Category X, I, and II airports must measure wait times  every operational hour in all TSA expedited and standard screening  lanes. The directive requires wait times to be measured in actual time,  using a verifiable system such as wait time cards, closed circuit television  monitoring, or another confirmable method. The directive indicates that  wait times should be measured from the end of the line in which  passengers are waiting to the walk through metal detector or advanced  imaging technology units.", "According to TSA officials at that time, at the beginning of each hour, wait  time cards are handed to passengers at the end of the checkpoint line  and are collected when a passenger reaches the metal detector or  imaging unit. Closed circuit television is monitored from a location other  than the checkpoint, such as at the airport\u2019s coordination center.  According to TSA headquarters officials, TSA does not require FSDs or  their designees to collect wait times from a statistical sample of  passengers throughout the hour, but rather requires that one wait time is  collected for every operational hour in all screening lanes. If more than  one wait time is collected during the hour, the directive indicates that the  maximum wait time should be reported. TSA officials at airports we visited  for our February 2018 report stated that TSOs return completed wait time  cards to supervisors, who then enter the information into a shared  spreadsheet and eventually into the Performance Measurement  Information System. Each hour\u2019s reported wait time is then applied to all  of a lane\u2019s throughput for that given hour. FSDs or their designees at  Category III and IV airports may estimate wait times initially, but the  directive requires them to measure actual wait times when wait times are  estimated at 10 minutes or greater.", "The directive also requires FSDs or their designees to collect passenger  throughput data directly from the walkthrough metal detectors and  advanced imaging technology units. According to TSA headquarters  officials, the machines have sensors that collect the number of  passengers who pass through each hour, and TSOs retrieve the data  directly from the units. All airports regardless of category are required to  enter their wait time and throughput data daily into the information system  no later than 3:30 AM Eastern Time of the next calendar day so that the  data can be included in the morning\u2019s Daily Leadership Report (discussed  in more detail below).", "To monitor operations for all airports, TSA compiles a daily report utilizing  a variety of data points from the information system, including wait time  and throughput data. The Office of Security Operations\u2019 Performance  Management Division disseminates the Daily Leadership Report to TSA  officials, including regional directors and FSDs and their designees every  morning detailing the previous day\u2019s wait times and throughput figures,  among other data points. The Performance Management Division  includes a quality assurance addendum with each Daily Leadership  Report, indicating missing or incorrect data, to include wait time and  throughput data, and TSA has procedures in place intended to ensure  officials at the airports correct the data in the Performance Measurement  Information System within 2 weeks.", "In addition to the Daily Leadership Report, we reported that TSA utilizes  wait time and throughput data to monitor airport operations at 28 airports  in near real time. In May 2016, TSA established the Airport Operations  Center partly in response to the long screening checkpoint lines in the  spring of 2016 at certain airports. The center conducts near real time  monitoring of the operations of 28 airports that, according to TSA  headquarters officials, represent the majority of passenger throughput  nationwide or are operationally significant. TSA requires the 28 airports monitored by the center to enter passenger wait time data and throughput  data hourly (whereas the remaining airports are only required to submit  data once daily, by 3:30 AM Eastern Time, as described above) so that  officials can monitor the operations in near real time. In addition, TSA  officials at airports are required to report to the center when an event  occurs\u2014such as equipment malfunctions, weather-related events, or  unusually high passenger throughput\u2014that affects airport screening  operations and results in wait times that are greater than TSA\u2019s standards  of 30 minutes in standard screening lanes or greater than 15 minutes in  expedited screening lanes.", "If an airport is undergoing a period of prolonged wait times, we found that  officials at the Airport Operations Center reported coordinating with the  Regional Director and the FSD to assist in deploying resources. For  example, over the course of the summer of 2016, after certain airports  experienced long wait times in the spring of 2016 as confirmed by our  analysis, the center assisted in deploying additional passenger screening  canines and TSOs to those airports that experienced longer wait times.  The center disseminates a morning and evening situational report to TSA  airport-level officials and airport stakeholders summarizing nationwide  wait times, highlighting wait times at the top airports and any hot spots  (unexpected passenger volume or other operational challenges) that may  have occurred since the most recent report was issued. In addition to the  near real-time monitoring of 28 airports, the center also monitors  operations at all other airports and disseminates information to airports  and stakeholders as needed.", "For our February 2018 report, to determine the extent to which TSA  exceeded its wait time standards, we analyzed wait time data for the 28  airports monitored by the Airport Operations Center for the period of  January 2015 through May 2017 for both standard and expedited  screening. Our analysis showed that TSA met its wait time standard of  less than 30 minutes in standard screening at the 28 airports 99.3 percent  of the time for the period of January 2015 through May 2017. For  expedited screening for the same time period at the same airports, we  found that 100 percent of the time passengers were reported to have  waited 19 minutes or less.", "Additionally, our analysis confirmed that the percentage of passengers in  standard screening who waited over 30 minutes increased in 2016 during  the months of March, April, and May as compared to 2015 at all 28  airports. Our analysis also confirmed that reported wait times increased in  the spring of 2016 at selected airports, as mentioned in the news media.  For example, in May 2016, approximately 22 percent of passengers at  Chicago O\u2019Hare International airport and 26 percent of passengers at  Chicago Midway International airport waited over 30 minutes in standard  screening as opposed to zero percent for both airports in May 2015,  which accounted for the longest wait times in the spring of 2016. These  two airports were part of the 28 airports for which we analyzed wait time  data for the period of January 2015 through May 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Airport Officials Reported Using a Variety of Tools to Respond to Increases in Passenger Wait Times and Throughput", "paragraphs": ["In February 2018, we reported that FSDs and their staff at the airports we  visited identified a variety of tools that they utilize to respond to increases  in passenger wait times and/or throughput.", "TSOs from the National Deployment Force \u2014teams of additional  TSOs\u2014are available for deployment to airports to support screening  operations during major events and seasonal increases in  passengers. For example, TSA officials at one airport we visited  received National Deployment Force officers during busy holiday  seasons and officials at another airport received officers during the  increase in wait times in the spring and summer of 2016.", "TSA officials at selected airports used passenger screening canines  to expedite the screening process and support screening operations  during increased passenger throughput and wait time periods. For  example, TSA officials at one airport we visited emphasized the  importance of passenger screening canines as a useful tool to  minimize wait times and meet passenger screening demands at times  when throughput is high. Officials at another airport we visited relied  on these canines in busy terminals during peak periods. According to  officials at two of the airports we visited, the use of passenger  screening canines helped them to reduce wait times due to increased  passenger volumes in the spring and summer of 2016.", "TSA officials at selected airports also utilize part-time TSOs and  overtime hours to accommodate increases in passenger throughput  and wait times. For example, according to officials at all eight of the  airports we visited, they used overtime during peak travel times, such  as holiday travel seasons, and officials usually planned the use of  overtime in advance. Additionally, TSA officials at four of the airports  we visited told us they used part-time TSOs to help manage peak  throughput times throughout the day.", "According to TSA officials at two of the airports we visited, they  moved TSOs between checkpoints to accommodate increases in  passenger throughput at certain checkpoints and to expedite  screening operations. For example, TSA officials at one airport we  visited have a team of TSOs that terminal managers can request on  short notice. Officials at the other airport estimated that they move  TSOs between terminals about 40 times per day.", "Chairman Katko, Ranking Member Watson Coleman and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
