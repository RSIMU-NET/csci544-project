In response to a BIPA mandate, GAO reviewed states' implementation of the new payment requirements, the need to rebase or refine the BIPA PPS, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) oversight of states' implementation. GAO surveyed the states about their payment methodologies, did a targeted review in four states, and reviewed indexes used to reflect medical care inflation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's review of states' implementation of Medicaid's new payment system--the BIPA PPS and alternative methodologies--for FQHCs and RHCs identified certain issues regarding the appropriateness of some states' methodologies. Most states used the BIPA PPS and about half of states used an alternative methodology--generally cost-based reimbursement or a PPS with features slightly different from those required for the BIPA PPS--to pay at least some of their FQHCs, RHCs, or both. States took an average of slightly more than a year from the legislation's January 1, 2001, effective date to implement their BIPA PPS, and a few states had not completed implementation as of June 1, 2004. GAO identified three significant issues with states' new Medicaid payment systems. First, some states' BIPA PPS payment rates may be inappropriate because they did not include all Medicaid-covered FQHC and RHC services in the rates as required by law. Second, as of June 1, 2004, over half the states using the BIPA PPS had not determined how they would make the required adjustment to BIPA PPS rates for a change in scope of services. Third, some states did not ensure that their alternative methodologies resulted in payments no lower than what the FQHCs and RHCs would have received under the BIPA PPS. Evidence to date is insufficient to determine the need to rebase or refine the BIPA PPS. Concerns exist that the statutorily specified annual inflation index used to adjust the BIPA PPS is inappropriate because it not only increases more slowly than do many FQHCs' and RHCs' costs but also does not reflect the services these providers deliver. Other indexes GAO reviewed had a similar shortcoming. GAO's analysis determined that no inflation index has been developed that reflects the services typically provided by FQHCs and RHCs. Because many states no longer require FQHCs and RHCs to submit cost reports, comprehensive and current Medicaid cost data are no longer available to help inform an evaluation of the need to rebase or refine the BIPA PPS. Although GAO's comparison of cost-based and BIPA PPS rates from four states showed that cost-based rates generally exceeded BIPA PPS rates, not all factors contributing to the higher rates are known. Differences between cost-based and BIPA PPS rates varied widely within and among the states reviewed, which also limited the ability to draw conclusions about the need to rebase or refine rates. CMS guidance and oversight regarding the new BIPA payment requirements were inadequate to ensure consistent state compliance with the law. CMS guidance did not fully address certain requirements, and as states developed their new payment systems, they lacked important information clarifying the new requirements. As a result, uncertainties exist regarding how states were to implement some BIPA requirements, such as how to adjust BIPA PPS rates to account for a change in scope of services. CMS has conducted limited oversight of states' implementation and therefore was unaware of compliance issues with some states' payment systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To increase the accessibility of primary and preventive health services for  low-income people living in medically underserved areas, Congress made  Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics  (RHC) eligible for payments from Medicaid, a joint federal-state program  that finances health insurance for certain low-income adults and children.  FQHCs are urban or rural centers that provide comprehensive community- based primary care services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay.  In 2003, there were approximately 900 FQHCs. The nation\u2019s approximately  3,600 RHCs provide similar primary care services in underserved rural  areas, but unlike FQHCs, RHCs are not required to provide services to all  individuals, such as those who are uninsured. Medicaid is a significant  revenue source for FQHCs and RHCs; according to the most recent data  available, it accounted for about 35 percent of total revenues for FQHCs  and 24 percent for RHCs. In fiscal year 2003, Medicaid payments to  FQHCs and RHCs were almost $1.5 billion.", "Historically, federal law required state Medicaid programs to reimburse  FQHCs and RHCs on the basis of reasonable costs\u2014that is, costs that are  not excessive for a type of service provided to Medicaid beneficiaries.  While this basis for reimbursement may have ensured that service  providers were paid for necessary costs, it was also regarded as potentially  inflationary because providers may have increased their payments by  raising their costs. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits  Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) changed Medicaid  payment requirements by establishing a new prospective payment system  (PPS) effective for services provided by FQHCs and RHCs on or after  January 1, 2001. Unlike cost-based reimbursement, a PPS creates financial  incentives for providers to operate more efficiently. Providers that keep  their costs below their payment amount profit; conversely, providers lose  money if their service costs exceed the payment amount.", "Although not typical of other PPSs, the BIPA PPS established a provider- specific rate for the first year\u2019s payment rate (2001). Specifically, states  were to set the base rate at the average of each FQHC\u2019s or RHC\u2019s fiscal  year 1999 and fiscal year 2000 reasonable costs per visit. In subsequent  years, states were to use the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) to increase  payment rates annually for inflation and were to adjust rates when  necessary to reflect a change in scope of services. States may use an  alternative methodology to reimburse some or all of their FQHCs and  RHCs if they can demonstrate that the alternative payment methodology  would result in payments no lower than under the BIPA PPS payment rate  and if the FQHC or RHC agrees to its use.", "BIPA required that we study the need for, and how to, rebase and refine  costs for making Medicaid payments to FQHCs and RHCs. We   (1) reviewed states\u2019 implementation of the Medicaid payment system  under BIPA for FQHCs and RHCs, (2) evaluated the need for rebasing or  refining costs for making payment under the BIPA PPS, and (3) reviewed  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) oversight of states\u2019  Medicaid payment systems for FQHCs and RHCs.", "To examine these issues, we surveyed Medicaid officials in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia regarding their FQHC and RHC  reimbursement policies and practices as of June 1, 2004. States also  submitted documentation describing their methodologies, which we  reviewed to corroborate their survey responses. In addition to conducting  the survey, we reviewed the MEI, the index required by statute to annually  adjust BIPA PPS rates for inflation, as well as other indexes often used to  reflect changes in medical care inflation. To identify these other indexes,  we reviewed literature on medical care indexes and information from  organizations typically involved in developing and updating these indexes.  We also conducted a targeted review of FQHC and RHC payment rates in  four states\u2014Iowa, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014that used cost- based reimbursement as an alternative methodology. (See app. I for details  about the methodology of our targeted review.) We interviewed officials  from CMS and its regional offices; CMS is the agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees states\u2019  Medicaid programs. We also interviewed officials from HHS\u2019s Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is responsible for  reviewing FQHC grant applications and disbursing federal public health  grant funds to FQHCs. To provide contextual information, we interviewed  various stakeholders. Specifically, we interviewed officials from the  National Association of Community Health Centers (an organization  representing FQHCs), the National Association of Rural Health Clinics,  George Washington University\u2019s Center for Health Services and Policy (an  organization that has conducted research on FQHCs), and a judgmentally  selected sample of eight FQHCs and eight RHCs.

In fiscal year 2002, the President  launched the Health Center Initiative with the goal of adding 1,200 new or  expanded health center sites and increasing the number of patients served  from about 10 million in fiscal year 2001 to 16 million by 2006. In 2003, the  approximately 900 FQHCs provided services to over 12 million people.", "FQHCs include community health centers, migrant health centers, public  housing and homeless programs, FQHC look-alikes, and certain facilities  operated by tribes or tribal organizations. A distinguishing feature of  FQHCs is that they provide enabling services such as outreach, translation,  and transportation, which help patients gain access to health care. FQHCs  vary considerably in their geographic location; their revenue mix; and the  size of the uninsured and Medicaid populations and degree of managed  care penetration in the surrounding area. For example, an FQHC may be  located in an urban area with a large uninsured or Medicaid population  and a high Medicaid managed care penetration, or in a rural area, where it  serves as the only source of primary care for several communities.", "Unlike FQHCs, RHCs are not required to provide services to all  individuals, such as those who are uninsured, but they are required to  operate in rural areas that are designated as underserved. RHCs can  operate either independently or as part of a larger organization, such as a  hospital, skilled nursing facility, or home health agency. RHCs can be  specialty clinics, focusing their services on particular populations or  medical specialties such as pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology. In  addition to being located in a rural, underserved area, to be certified by  CMS as an RHC, a provider must primarily offer outpatient primary  medical care, employ at least one nonphysician practitioner at least half  the time the clinic is open, and have a physician on-site at least once every  2 weeks. As of August 2004, approximately 3,600 RHCs operated in 44  states.", "In 2003, Medicaid reimbursement and HRSA grant funds were the two  largest single sources of revenue for FQHCs and accounted for 35 percent  and 22 percent of these providers\u2019 total revenue, respectively. FQHCs also  received revenues from state, local, and private grants as well as other  insurance programs. In contrast, RHCs received a smaller proportion of  their total revenues from Medicaid (24 percent) but a higher proportion  from Medicare, commercial insurance, and directly from patients (self- pay). Although Medicaid is a large revenue source for FQHCs and RHCs,  payments to these providers represent a very small percentage of overall  Medicaid expenditures. In fiscal year 2003, Medicaid payments to FQHCs  and RHCs totaled almost $1.5 billion combined, which accounted for less  than 1 percent of Medicaid expenditures for medical care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Reimbursement for FQHCs and RHCs", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 2001, federal law required state Medicaid programs to pay FQHCs  and RHCs using a cost-based reimbursement methodology. To determine  cost-based payments, states required FQHCs and RHCs to submit cost  reports, which states reviewed to determine which reported costs were  allowable (related to providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries) and  reasonable (not excessive for the type of service). The Medicaid statute  directed states to follow the Medicare statute to reimburse FQHCs and  RHCs. This meant that states were to reimburse FQHCs and RHCs  according to CMS Medicare regulations, which provide guidance on the  types of allowable costs, such as compensation for physicians and other  staff, supplies, administrative overhead, and other items. The regulations  allowed states to establish their own definition of what constituted  \u201creasonable costs,\u201d which could include a ceiling on costs per service,  such as a medical visit, or a limit on a type of cost, such as administrative  costs.", "In December 2000, BIPA established a PPS to pay for Medicaid-covered  services provided by FQHCs and RHCs. While BIPA did not specify when  states had to implement the PPS, the statute required that the BIPA PPS be  effective for services provided by FQHCs and RHCs on or after January 1,  2001. Unlike the prior cost-based reimbursement system, a PPS establishes  payment rates in advance of service delivery and creates incentives for  providers to operate more efficiently. Generally, the payment is not  contingent on an individual provider\u2019s actual cost of delivering care.  Providers that, on average, deliver care for less than the payment amount  can retain the portion of the payment amount exceeding their costs;  conversely, providers will lose money if their service costs are higher than  the payment. (See app. II for additional general information on PPSs,  including how the BIPA PPS compares with selected other PPSs.)", "Under the PPS mandated by BIPA, the 2001 payment rate, called the base  rate, was effective for services provided beginning January 1, 2001. The  2001 payment rate was to be the average of each FQHC\u2019s and RHC\u2019s fiscal  year 1999 and fiscal year 2000 reasonable costs per visit, which states were  allowed to determine using their prior definitions of reasonable costs.  Beginning in fiscal year 2002, BIPA PPS payment rates were to be adjusted  annually for inflation by the MEI. In addition, BIPA required that payments  to FQHCs and RHCs be adjusted for increases or decreases in the scope of  services provided. States also were required to make supplemental  payments to FQHCs and RHCs that provide services to Medicaid patients  enrolled in a capitated managed care plan. BIPA allowed states to use an  alternative methodology to pay an FQHC or RHC as long as the FQHC or  RHC agreed to the alternative methodology and the methodology resulted  in payment to the FQHC or RHC of an amount that was no lower than the  amount otherwise required under the BIPA PPS.", "In June 2001, we reported that payments to FQHCs and RHCs under the  new BIPA PPS would likely be constrained. The report noted that  because states were allowed to continue to use their prior methods for  determining reasonable costs in establishing the 2001 base payment rate  under the BIPA PPS, the initial PPS rates for FQHCs and RHCs might be  below their actual costs. Additionally, the 2001 base PPS rate could be  lower than what an FQHC or RHC received in 2000 because the base rate  was an average of fiscal years\u2019 1999 and 2000 costs. Furthermore, BIPA did  not specify that the initial 2001 payment rates be updated for inflation  from 1999 through 2001.

Implementation time periods ranged from 3  months to about 3 years (see fig. 1). Although Minnesota intended to  implement the BIPA PPS for all of its FQHCs, as of June 1, 2004, the state  had implemented this methodology for only 30 percent of its FQHCs.  Minnesota was paying the remaining FQHCs an interim rate until the state  determined these providers\u2019 BIPA PPS rates. Regardless of the actual  implementation date, most states implementing a BIPA PPS (30 of 33  states) made the payment rates retroactive to January 1, 2001. The three  remaining states had an alternative payment methodology initially but  subsequently implemented the BIPA PPS.", "Although BIPA specified how states were to determine the base payment  rate and which inflation index to use, states designed their systems  differently within these parameters. For example, BIPA specified that  beginning in fiscal year 2002, the BIPA PPS base rate was to be increased  annually for inflation using the MEI, but the law did not define which 12- month period constituted the 2002 fiscal year. States had the option of  using the federal, state, or FQHC fiscal year and varied as to the month  they first inflated the PPS rates. Most states first inflated their FQHCs\u2019  base payment rates in either October 2001, which corresponds to the  federal and one state\u2019s fiscal year, or January 2002, the beginning of the  calendar year. A few states inflated FQHC payment rates earlier in 2001,  and one state\u2014Louisiana\u2014did not inflate rates until July 2002. (See table  2.) States also varied in the number of PPS rates they established for each  FQHC. Specifically, 10 states decided to establish more than one PPS rate  for each FQHC, depending on the type of service provided. For example,  FQHCs in Maryland had two rates\u2014one for medical services and one for  dental services. In Ohio, FQHCs could have as many as nine PPS rates  depending on the specific services provided.", "Of the 44 states with RHCs, 33 states reported using the BIPA PPS to pay  some portion of their RHCs.

On the basis  of this assessment, Missouri found that over half of the FQHCs reviewed  and about 40 percent of the RHCs reviewed would fare better under the  BIPA PPS, yet the state continued to pay them under the alternative  methodology. In 2001, the FQHCs and RHCs that would have fared better  under the BIPA PPS would have received on average about $12 more and  about $25 more per visit, respectively. New Hampshire compared only the  fiscal year 2001 BIPA PPS rates for its FQHCs and RHCs with the cost- based rates; although the state found that the BIPA PPS rates were higher  for some RHCs, a state official told us in October 2004 that the state had  not reimbursed these providers for the difference.

On the  basis of those rates, we estimated the 2002 and 2003 BIPA PPS rates for  Vermont\u2019s FQHCs and RHCs and found that some RHCs would likely have  fared better under the BIPA PPS.

Wisconsin  compared the fiscal year 2001, 2002, and 2003 BIPA PPS rates for its  FQHCs and RHCs with the cost-based rates used for those fiscal years and  found that an RHC would have fared better under the BIPA PPS each year,  yet Wisconsin continued to pay that RHC under the alternative  methodology.

As such, the MEI is intended to be an equitable measure  of cost changes associated with physician time and operating expenses.", "We reported in 2001 that the MEI increased at a lower rate than indexes  some states had used previously to adjust payment rates for FQHCs.", "Since the MEI adjustment is the only automatic update of BIPA PPS  rates, an FQHC\u2019s or RHC\u2019s ability to manage under the BIPA PPS depends  on its initial payment rate as well as its ability to hold cost growth at or  below the MEI.", "Some stakeholders we contacted expressed concern about the use of the  MEI to update BIPA PPS payments to FQHCs and RHCs. Officials from the  National Association of Community Health Centers told us that the MEI  was not an adequate measure of FQHCs\u2019 increasing costs. These officials  pointed to data from the Uniform Data System (UDS), a database of self- reported FQHC data, which suggested that the MEI increased at a lower  rate than FQHCs\u2019 costs. Specifically, the data showed that FQHCs\u2019 total  costs per patient encounter increased approximately 5 to 6 percent  annually between 2001 and 2003, while the MEI increased about 2 to   3 percent annually during the same time period. This concern was echoed  by officials we spoke with from FQHCs and RHCs and by CMS officials  from four regional offices. For example, an official from a Florida FQHC  reported that his center\u2019s costs over the past 3 years had increased by   4.5 to 7 percent a year, while an official from a Florida RHC reported cost  increases of over 10 percent annually. An important objective of a PPS,  however, is to encourage efficiency, so equivalent increases in a provider\u2019s  payment adjustments and its cost trends may not be desirable.", "The MEI may not be an ideal index to adjust FQHCs\u2019 and RHCs\u2019 payment  rates for inflation, but other indexes often used to reflect medical care  inflation also have a similar shortcoming. As mentioned earlier, the MEI  was designed to measure the changing costs for the average physician.  However, FQHCs\u2019 and RHCs\u2019 costs may not be comparable to those of the  average physician. FQHCs provide additional services, including enabling  services (such as outreach and translation), and a significant portion of  RHC services may be provided by nonphysician practitioners. Like the  MEI, four other indexes commonly used to reflect changes in medical care  inflation do not reflect the services typically provided by FQHCs and  RHCs. The 2001 to 2003 cumulative increase for the MEI was greater than  the cumulative increases of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for Physician  Offices and the CPI for Urban Consumers for the same period, although  neither of the latter indexes reflect the same services provided by FQHCs  and RHCs. The cumulative increase for the MEI was less than the  cumulative increases for two other indexes\u2014the PPI for General Medical  and Surgical Hospitals and the CPI for Medical Care\u2014but the latter two  indexes included a set of hospital-related services that for the most part  neither FQHCs nor RHCs provided.

Other PPSs,  however, often incorporate an inflation index specifically designed to  reflect changes in the cost of services provided by or the price of  resources used by the providers paid under that PPS. For example, under  the Medicare home health PPS, the payment rate is inflated using a home  health market basket that measures the changes in the prices of goods and  services bought by home health agencies.

Among  states with defined procedures, definitions of what constituted a change in  scope of services varied considerably and several included factors that are  not directly related to the provision of services. For example,  documentation from 5 of these states specified relocation, remodeling, the  opening of a new site, or a combination of these as criteria to adjust the  BIPA PPS rate under this provision. However, CMS told us that factors  such as relocation do not constitute a change in scope of services unless  there is a corresponding change in the type, intensity, duration, or amount  of services. Furthermore, CMS has not offered guidance regarding the  requirement for states to adjust base BIPA PPS rates of FQHCs and RHCs  that are paid under an alternative payment methodology in the event of a  change in scope of services.

In our draft report we  acknowledged that, in its guidance, CMS defined a change in scope of  services as \u201ca change in type, intensity, duration and/or amount of  services.\u201d The guidance also stated that \u201ca change in the cost of a service  is not considered in and of itself a change in the scope of services.\u201d  However, as noted in our draft report, many states have yet to define  procedures for changes in scope of services and those with defined  procedures sometimes included factors, such as remodeling or relocation,  that were not directly related to the provision of services. Therefore, we  continue to believe that additional guidance, including the definition of the  specific elements that affect a change in scope of services, is necessary.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the Administrator of CMS, the Administrator of HRSA, and other  interested parties.

We followed this approach since the Medicare, Medicaid, and  SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) required  states using an alternative payment methodology to ensure that their  methodology resulted in payment no lower than payment under the BIPA  PPS. We therefore assumed that these states would have data available on  their cost-based payment rates as well as comparative BIPA PPS rates.  Having both rates for each FQHC and RHC in the selected states would  enable us to assess the extent to which FQHCs\u2019 and RHCs\u2019 reasonable  costs were covered under the PPS.", "We selected states for the targeted review if, according to their responses  to our survey, they met the following four criteria for both FQHCs and  RHCs:  implemented cost-based reimbursement as their alternative payment  methodology,  required FQHCs and RHCs to submit cost reports and the state audited  them,    had at least 1 year of audited cost reports following the implementation of  their alternative payment methodologies, and    determined what the FQHCs\u2019 and RHCs\u2019 payments would have been if the  state had implemented the BIPA PPS.", "According to their survey responses, five states met all of these criteria\u2014 Iowa, Missouri, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.", "We requested that the five states provide us the 2001, 2002, and 2003 cost- based and BIPA PPS payment rates for each of their FQHCs and RHCs.  On the basis of their responses we excluded Missouri from further  analysis. Missouri had determined the 2001 BIPA PPS rates for only a  portion of FQHCs and RHCs in the state and had not determined the 2002  or 2003 BIPA PPS rates for any FQHCs or RHCs. Additionally, Missouri  was unable to provide us with 2002 and 2003 per visit cost-based rates.  While we found that Vermont had not determined the 2002 and 2003 BIPA  PPS rates for its FQHCs and RHCs, we were able to estimate those rates  by inflating the 2001 BIPA PPS rates for each FQHC and RHC by the  Medicare Economic Index (MEI), the annual inflation adjustment required  by BIPA.", "For our analysis, we included FQHCs and RHCs in the four states for  which 3 full years of data were available\u20142001, 2002, and 2003. While we  generally relied on and did not independently verify the data provided to  us by the states, we did review the data for reasonableness and to identify  unusual patterns, including outliers. We identified some data that required  follow-up with state Medicaid officials to obtain a better understanding of  the reason for these patterns. As a result of these additional inquiries, one  RHC was excluded from the analysis.", "We analyzed the data by state and type of provider (FQHC or RHC). We  assessed (1) the percentage and dollar difference between the cost-based  and BIPA PPS rates and (2) the number of providers whose cost-based  rates exceeded their BIPA PPS rates.
