This was due to, among other  things, limited coordination with and commitment from DHS\u2019s  components. To address this problem, in 2010 the DHS Deputy Secretary  issued a memorandum emphasizing that DHS\u2019s wide variety of human  resources processes and IT systems inhibited the ability to unify DHS and  negatively impacted operating costs. The memorandum stated that,  without an enterprise operating model, support for DHS\u2019s core mission  was at risk and valuable workforce management information remained  difficult to acquire across the department. Accordingly, the Deputy  Secretary stated that DHS could no longer sustain a component-centric  approach when acquiring or enhancing human resources systems, and  prohibited component spending on enhancements to existing human  resources systems or acquisitions of new solutions, unless those  expenditures were approved by OCHCO or OCIO. The memorandum  also directed these offices to develop a department-wide human  resources architecture.", "In 2011, in response to the Deputy Secretary\u2019s direction, DHS completed  an effort called the Human Capital Segment Architecture, which,  according to DHS, defined the department\u2019s current (or as-is) state of  human capital management processes, technology, data, and relevant  personnel. Further, from this current state, the department developed a  comprehensive future state (or target state) and a document referred to  as the Human Capital Segment Architecture blueprint that redefined the  HRIT investment\u2019s scope and implementation time frames. As part of this  effort, DHS conducted a system inventory and determined that it had 422  human resources systems and applications, many of which were single- use solutions developed to respond to a small need or links to enable  disparate systems to work together. DHS reported that these numerous,  antiquated, and fragmented systems inhibited its ability to perform basic  workforce management functions necessary to support mission critical  programs.", "To address this issue, the blueprint articulated that HRIT would be  comprised of 15 strategic improvement opportunity areas (e.g., enabling  seamless, efficient, and transparent end-to-end hiring) and outlined 77  associated projects (e.g., deploying a department-wide hiring system,  establishing an integrated data repository and reporting mechanism, and  developing a centralized learning center for all personnel action  processing information) to implement these 15 opportunities.

Also during this time period HRIT\u2019s only ongoing  program\u2014PALMS\u2014was experiencing significant problems, including  schedule slippages and frequent turnover in its program manager  position (i.e., PALMS had five different program managers during the  time that the HRIT executive steering committee was minimally  involved). As a result of the executive steering committee not meeting,  key governance activities were not completed on HRIT. For example,  the committee did not approve HRIT\u2019s notional operational plan for  fiscal years 2014 through 2019. OCHCO and OCIO officials  attributed the lack of HRIT executive steering committee meetings  and committee involvement in HRIT to the investment\u2019s focus being  only on the PALMS program to address its issues, as discussed  earlier. However, by not regularly meeting and providing oversight  during a time when a new co-chair for the executive steering  committee assumed responsibility and PALMS was experiencing such  problems, the committee\u2019s guidance to the troubled program was  limited.", "More recently, the HRIT executive steering committee met in June  and October 2015, and OCIO and OCHCO officials stated that the  committee planned to meet quarterly going forward.

According to the analysis of alternatives, the  nine systems at the department were disconnected from each other and  did not exchange information. The components had independently  purchased these learning management systems and, in some cases, had  done so before DHS was established in 2002. However, DHS determined  that a unified strategy for learning management systems at the  department was needed, rather than disparate, component-centric efforts.

As part of the analysis, the Institute assessed the  alternative approaches based on five evaluative categories, including  cost, benefits, and risks.

This industry  information validated DHS officials\u2019 understanding that a combined  solution for learning and performance management at the department  was consistent with prevailing industry offerings. According to OCHCO  officials, the department\u2019s request for information from industry to help  justify its preferred approach allowed for competition within industry for  supplying a solution to the department.

According to program officials, as part of this  effort, each component is to follow the risk management processes  documented in PALMS\u2019s vendor-developed risk management plan (which  is a separate plan from the HRIT-level risk management plan used by the  program management office, as discussed earlier). While the PALMS  vendor-developed risk management plan directed each component to  track risks in a component-specific risk register, the plan did not establish  criteria for when component-level risks need to be elevated to the PALMS  PMO at headquarters.", "In September 2015, the PALMS program manager stated that all  component-level risks that are rated red (i.e., high-probability and high- impact risks) are reported to headquarters. However, this guidance was  not documented and, as such, the PALMS PMO did not have reasonable  assurance that the components were knowledgeable about which risks to  elevate, and whether the components were appropriately elevating such  risks. Program officials were unable to explain why this criterion was not  documented, but in response to our concern, the program officials  directed the vendor to update the PALMS risk management plan to  document this criterion; the vendor completed this update in October  2015. In particular, the plan now specifies that all component-level risks  that could impact when the PALMS system is to be deployed at each of  the components should be elevated to the PALMS PMO and given a  priority of high.", "Documenting the criteria for when risks need to be elevated to the  PALMS PMO should help ensure that all appropriate risks are being  elevated for review. However, until the program prioritizes its risks by  determining each risk\u2019s relative priority and overall risk level, DHS is  hampered in its ability to ensure that the program\u2019s attention and  resources for risk mitigation are used in the most effective manner."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although the HRIT investment was initiated about 12 years ago with the  intent to consolidate, integrate, and modernize the department\u2019s human  resources IT infrastructure, DHS has made very limited progress in  achieving these goals. HRIT\u2019s minimally involved executive steering  committee during a time when significant problems were occurring was a  key factor in the lack of progress. This is particularly problematic given  that the department\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively carry out its  mission is significantly hampered by its fragmented human resources  system environment and duplicative and paper-based processes.", "Moreover, DHS\u2019s ineffective management of HRIT, such as the lack of an  updated schedule and a life-cycle cost estimate, also contributed to the  neglect this investment has experienced. Until DHS, among other things,  maintains a schedule, develops a life-cycle cost estimate, tracks costs,  and re-evaluates and updates the Human Capital Segment Architecture  blueprint, the department will continue to be plagued by duplicative  systems and an inefficient and ineffective human resources environment  impacting in its ability to perform its mission.", "Additionally, until the PALMS program effectively addresses identified  weaknesses in its project planning, project monitoring, and risk  management practices and implements PALMS department-wide, DHS\u2019s  performance management processes will continue to be cumbersome,  time-consuming, and primarily paper-based.

Specifically,  we compared the completed and in-progress HRIT projects against the  strategic improvement opportunities and projects that were outlined in the  blueprint to determine which of the improvement opportunities and  projects had been fully implemented or were in-progress. We also  compared DHS\u2019s planned schedule for implementing the improvement  opportunities and projects against DHS\u2019s current planned schedule for  implementing them as of November 2015. Additionally, we interviewed  DHS officials from the HRIT investment, Office of the Chief Information  Officer (OCIO), Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), and  DHS\u2019s components to discuss the steps taken to implement HRIT,  address the strategic improvement opportunities and projects in the  blueprint, and meet the goals of the investment.", "In addressing the second part of our first objective\u2014to evaluate how  effectively DHS managed the investment\u2014we analyzed documentation,  such as the investment\u2019s planned and updated completion dates,  program management briefings, the blueprint, cost estimates, and budget  documentation, and compared it against relevant cost and schedule best  practices identified by GAO, CMMI-ACQ, and the PMBOK\u00ae Guide. These  best practices included developing and maintaining a schedule estimate;  developing a life-cycle cost estimate; and tracking program expenditures.  To determine the amount spent to date on HRIT, we asked officials from  DHS headquarters and each of the eight components to provide  expenditure information on HRIT since the investment began in 2003;  officials were unable to provide complete information. As such, we were  unable to identify the total amount spent on the investment and discuss  this limitation earlier in the report.", "We also analyzed DHS\u2019s human capital investment guidance, including  the 2010 Deputy Secretary memorandum that prohibited component  spending on enhancements to existing human resources systems or  acquisitions of new human resources solutions, unless those  expenditures have been approved by OCHCO or OCIO, and compared it  to the components\u2019 current investments in human resources systems,  such as those listed in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2016 human capital portfolio.

Additionally, we  reviewed program management briefings provided to the HRIT Executive  Steering Committee that outlined, for example, the proposed solution and  rationale for such a solution.
