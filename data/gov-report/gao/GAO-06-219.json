To further assist DOD, Congress included provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 aimed at ensuring that DOD develop a well-defined business enterprise architecture and transition plan by September 30, 2005, as well as establish and implement effective structures and processes for managing information technology (IT) business system investments. In response to the act's mandate, GAO is reporting on DOD's compliance with requirements relating to DOD's architecture, transition plan, budgetary disclosure, and business system review and approval structures and processes. Given GAO's existing recommendations, it is not making additional recommendations at this time. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD recognized that GAO has been a constructive player in its business transformation efforts. While not specifically commenting on most of the report's findings and its conclusions, DOD also said that it disagreed with two points: the level of development for its \"As Is\" architecture and instances of nonintegration within the architecture and transition plan. However, it also commented that it is committed to addressing what GAO views to be the underlying basis of both points."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its efforts to comply with the act's provisions, DOD has made important progress in establishing needed modernization management capabilities. However, much more remains to be done. The latest version of the business enterprise architecture (Version 3.0), which the department approved on September 28, 2005, partially satisfies the conditions of the act, but not entirely. For example, while Version 3.0 includes a target or \"To Be\" architecture, as required, it does not include a current (\"As Is\") architecture. Without this element, DOD could not analyze the gaps between the two architectures--critical input to a comprehensive transition plan. However, this version of the architecture represents significant progress and provides a foundation upon which the department can build. The transition plan associated with the current version of the architecture partially satisfies the act, but improvements are needed. Specifically, although it includes certain required information (such as milestones for major projects), it is inconsistent with the architecture in various ways. For instance, it identifies target systems (those that are to be included in the \"To Be\" architecture), but these are not always the same as those identified in the architecture itself. In addition, the transition plan does not include system performance metrics aligned with the plan's strategic goals and objectives. The department's fiscal year 2006 budget discloses some but not all required information. For example, it does not identify the approval authority for all business systems investments. DOD has satisfied some of the act's requirements regarding its business systems investments, but it either has not satisfied or is still in the process of satisfying others. For example, the department has fulfilled the act's requirement for delegating IT system responsibility and accountability to designated approval authorities as specified. In addition, DOD has largely satisfied the act's requirement to establish certain structures and define certain processes to review and approve IT investments. However, some of these structures are not yet in place, and some reviews and approvals to date have not followed the criteria in the act. DOD agrees that additional work is required and states that under its incremental approach to developing the architecture and transition plan, and under its tiered accountability structure for reviewing and approving business system investments, improvements will occur in its architecture, transition plan, budgetary disclosure, and investment management and oversight. If these improvements do not occur, DOD's business systems modernization will continue to be a high-risk program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not been successful in  repeated attempts to modernize its timeworn business systems and  operations.

They stated that they have nevertheless examined the  \u201cAs Is\u201d conditions in identifying the \u201cTo Be\u201d solutions in the  architecture. They also stated that they recognize that these \u201cAs Is\u201d  conditions are not in the architecture and they have yet to be  provided to us, and that they need to link this information to the \u201cTo  Be\u201d architecture.", "With respect to the act\u2019s second requirement, that the architecture includes  policies, procedures, data standards, and system interface requirements to  be applied departmentwide, Version 3.0 partially complies. In particular,  the architecture identifies federal guidance relevant to core business  missions, such as the financial management and the human resources  missions. In addition, the architecture identifies a specific policy entitled  \u201cSupply Chain Materiel Management Policy\u201d\u2014dated April 22, 2004\u2014that is  relevant to guiding and controlling the department\u2019s core business mission  and business processes for materiel and logistics. Moreover, the  architecture identifies conceptual, operational, and automated business  rules that can be used to govern the implementation of systems  investments in accordance with policies. However, not all relevant policies  are included in the architecture. For example, policies governing the  development, maintenance, and implementation of the architecture are not  included. Program officials agreed, and stated that the decision  memorandums that were used to guide the development of Version 3.0 will  be formalized as a departmental policy.", "In addition, Version 3.0 of the architecture includes a logical data model  (OV-7) that contains data entities, attributes, and their relationships and an  enterprise Technical Standards Profile (TV-1) that comprises a list of data  standards (e.g. Extensible Markup Language 1.0 data exchange standard);  however, the architecture does not include a systems standards profile that  would ensure data sharing and interoperability among departmentwide  business systems. Version 3.0 also identifies some, but not all, system  interface requirements. For example, the architecture has yet to identify  interface requirements with DOD systems that provide infrastructure  services, such as network routing. Program officials acknowledged that the  architecture does not include a systems standards profile and all system  interface requirements and stated that they will address this in future  versions.", "With respect to the act\u2019s third requirement, that the architecture be  consistent with OMB policies and procedures, Version 3.0 partially  complies. According to OMB guidance, an enterprise architecture should  describe the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments and a transition plan.  Further, this guidance requires the architecture to include, among other  things, the following:  Business processes. The work performed to support the agency\u2019s  mission, vision, and performance goals. Agencies must also  document change agents, such as legislation or new technologies  that will drive architecture changes.", "Information flow and relationships. The information used by the  agency in its business processes, including where it is used and its  movement among locations. These information flows are intended to  show what information is needed where and how the information is  shared to support mission functions.", "Technology infrastructure. The functional characteristics,  capabilities, and interconnections of the hardware, software, and  telecommunications.", "Security architecture. The support provided to secure information,  systems, and operations.", "Version 3.0 of the architecture includes a \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture and a  transition plan; however, it does not include an \u201cAs Is\u201d architecture, which  is essential to performing a gap analysis to identify capability and system  performance shortfalls that the transition plan is to address. As previously  discussed, program officials agreed and stated that they plan to address  this. In addition:   Version 3.0 defines some of the business processes at a high level.", "However, it does not include all business processes. For example, the  architecture does not describe key aspects of the planning,  programming, budgeting, and execution processes. In particular, the  architecture does not yet define a clear planning process that  balances requirements with resources and provides direction for  execution.", "It includes information flows and relationships.", "It does not include a description of the technology infrastructure.", "It does not include a security architecture.", "Beyond the above described areas in which Version 3.0 of the business  enterprise architecture does not fully satisfy the requirements in the fiscal  year 2005 defense authorization act, Version 3.0 has other limitations.  Specifically:   The scope of Version 3.0 is not fully consistent with the scope of the  enterprise transition plan. For example, we identified 21 systems in the  architecture that are not included in the transition plan\u2019s \u201cMaster List of  Systems and Initiatives\u201d that support the business enterprise priorities  and should therefore be funded. Instead of being on this master list, 19  of these 21 systems are included in the transition plan as part of a  master list of \u201cNon-priority DOD programs.\u201d Therefore, the systems  identified as targeted solutions in the architecture are not being  recognized in the transition plan as systems to be funded to provide the  needed business capabilities. The remaining 2 of the 21 systems,  \u201cIndustry System\u201d and \u201cUnstructured Data Sources,\u201d are not identified  at all in the transition plan. As a result, the transition plan does not yet  explicitly recognize the need to transition to the capabilities implied by  these two systems, or else these systems exceed the scope of the  transition plan, the Overview and Summary Information product (AV-1),  or both.", "In addition, the AV-1 states that the scope of Version 3.0 is limited to  the six DOD business enterprise priorities. In contrast, the list of  \u201cNon-priority DOD programs\u201d in the transition plan is described as a  listing of systems \u201cthat are not DOD Enterprise or Component  Priority Programs\u201d and thus would not be targeted solutions for the  business enterprise priorities. As a result, the stated scope of the   AV-1 is narrower than the implied scope of the transition plan.", "The transition plan treats certain entities, such as the Financial  Management System Entity, as system solutions in the Master List of  Systems, whereas Version 3.0 treats these entities as contextual  placeholders. This difference is not explained.", "Finally, another system (the Expeditionary Combat Support System)  is explicitly related to four business enterprise priorities (Financial  Visibility, Acquisition Visibility, Materiel Visibility, and Common  Supplier Engagement) in the Master List of Systems in the transition  plan, but it is not included in the architecture.", "Version 3.0 refers to \u201cRecruit Candidate\u201d as a needed business  capability, but this capability is not reflected in the transition plan. This  is important because needed capabilities in the architecture should be  reflected in the transition plan to ensure that they are addressed. As  another example, \u201cAccess Candidate\u201d is referred to as a needed business  capability in the transition plan, but it is defined as an existing  operational activity in the architecture. If it is in fact an operational  activity, this means that the department plans to invest resources to  achieve a business capability to address a performance shortfall that  does not exist. Program officials stated that these are errors and that  they will be corrected.", "Version 3.0 does not explicitly state the time frame covered for the \u201cTo Be\u201d  environment. Rather, it describes the time frame as being \u201cnear-term To  Be,\u201d but it does not clearly define what is meant by \u201cnear-term,\u201d nor does it  link this time frame to the milestones associated with the business  enterprise priorities or the capabilities and systems in the transition plan.  According to relevant guidance, the \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture should be  fiscally and technologically achievable, and therefore it should generally  project 3 to 5 years into the future to accommodate rapid changes in  technologies, changes in mission focus and priorities, and uncertainty in  future resource availability. Program officials agreed and stated that they  would use \u201cnear-term\u201d consistently in future versions of the architecture  and transition plan.", "Version 3.0 does not represent a fully integrated set of architecture  products, although we did find greater product integration than in prior  versions of the architecture. Examples of instances in which product  integration was not apparent follow.", "First, the Operational Event-Trace Description product (OV-6c)\u2014 which depicts when activities are to occur within operational  processes\u2014includes a process entitled \u201cSend Statements of  Accountability or Transactions or Trial Balance to Treasury.\u201d  However, the Operational Activity Model (OV-5)\u2014which shows the  operational activities (or tasks) that are to occur and the input and  output process flows among these activities\u2014 identifies no  corresponding activity. Instead, the OV-5 has an activity entitled  \u201cPerform Treasury Operations,\u201d which has four subactivities, none of  which is linked to the above process. Program officials agreed that  these were not linked; however, they stated that the \u201cPerform  Treasury Operations\u201d activity and its subactivities are not intended to  link with the above mentioned process. However, intended linkages  are not clear because the architecture does not include a traceability  matrix that shows the connection between the two architecture  products (OV-6c and OV-5). Program officials have acknowledged the  need for greater product integration.", "Second, one identified event in the architecture\u2014\u201ctriggers the  supplier process that provides supplier inventory information to the  DOD\u201d\u2014is depicted as two separate events at different levels in the  process decomposition. In particular, there are different names for  this event on the parent diagrams and the child diagrams, and  different templates were used to prepare the diagrams. Program  officials agreed that these names differed and stated that this would  be addressed.", "Third, certain business rules are not explicitly linked to the events  included in the architecture description, such as \u201cENT Post  Concurrent Months\u201d and \u201cENT_Estimate_Receivable.\u201d Program  officials stated that the guidelines being used by the department  require the business rules to be linked to process steps or decision  gateway objects, not events. However, because an event is something  that \u201chappens\u201d during the course of a business process, it affects the  flow of the process and usually has a cause (trigger) or an effect  (result). Therefore, best practices recognize the need to integrate or  link the \u201ctriggers\u201d that are reflected in the Operational Information  Exchange Matrix (OV-3) to both the business rules shown in the  Operational Rules Model (OV-6a) and the business events shown in  the Operational Event-Trace Description (OV-6c). Program officials  stated that they will consider revising their guidelines to link  business rules to events.", "Fourth, the interface diagram for the Financial Management System  Entity (FMSE) does not include 4 of the 21 relevant interfaces  identified in the AV-2 product, which is the integrated dictionary.  Instead, these four interfaces are shown in other system interface  diagrams, which are not linked to the FMSE diagram. Program  officials stated that they will address this.", "Fifth, the timelines reflected in the transition plan are difficult to map  to the \u201cTo Be\u201d description, according to DOD\u2019s contractor  responsible for verification and validation of the architecture and  transition plan.", "Sixth, the architecture is not adequately linked to the component  architectures and transition plans, although such linkage is  particularly important given the department\u2019s newly adopted  federated approach to developing and implementing the architecture.  According to DOD, a federated architecture is composed of a set of  coherent but distinct entity architectures. The members of the  federation collaborate to develop an integrated enterprise  architecture that conforms to the enterprise view and to the  overarching rules of the federation. Program officials agreed and  stated that greater levels of integration will be a key goal of future  versions of the architecture.", "Moreover, while Version 3.0 of the architecture is easier to navigate through  than prior versions because of improved product integration, it is still  difficult to navigate and use this version, making verification and validation  of completeness and correctness unnecessarily time consuming. For  example, to trace business rules to their associated events (e.g., the  business rule entitled \u201cENT Post Concurrent Months\u201d to the event \u201ctrial  balance closing is complete\u201d), we had to first locate and review the  description of the business rule, then locate the descriptions of the events  by manually searching through numerous process diagrams. This was  necessary because the architecture does not include a systematic function  that enables the user to list all business rules that are associated with  events and all events that are associated with business rules. Such a  function is an accepted verification and validation method recommended  by industry experts.", "DOD and its verification and validation contractor have also identified  limitations in Version 3.0 of the architecture, which program officials told  us would be addressed in future versions. For example, the architecture  does not do the following:  It does not explicitly link to the department\u2019s primary non-business  enterprise architecture (the Global Information Grid Architecture,  which covers the warfighting mission area).", "It does not adequately address \u201cnet-centricity,\u201d a DOD term that refers to  having a robust, globally interconnected network environment  (including infrastructure, systems, processes, and people) in which data  and services (e.g., security services) are shared \u201ctimely and seamlessly\u201d  among users, applications, and platforms. According to DOD, the  architecture must be improved to better designate enterprise data  sources, business services, and IT infrastructure services.", "It does not accurately and completely address stakeholder comments  and their change requests.", "Program officials, including the Director of the Transformation Support  Office, the Chief Architect, and the Enterprise Transition Plan Team Lead,  stated that the department has taken an incremental approach to  developing the business enterprise architecture and meeting the act\u2019s  requirements. Accordingly, the Special Assistant to the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Business Transformation and contractor officials  said that Version 3.0 was appropriately scoped to provide for that content  that could be produced in the time available to both lay the foundation for  fully meeting the act\u2019s requirements and provide a blueprint for delivering  near-term capabilities and systems to meet near-term business enterprise  priorities. Because of this, they stated that Version 3.0 fully satisfies the  intent of the act.", "We support DOD taking an incremental approach to developing the  business enterprise architecture, recognizing that adopting such an  approach is a best practice that we have advocated. In addition, we believe  that Version 3.0 provides a foundation upon which to build a more  complete architecture. However, we do not agree that Version 3.0 fully  satisfies the requirements in the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act.  Further, the missing scope and content and related shortcomings described  above mean that while this version is a reasonable baseline upon which to  build, it is not yet a sufficient frame of reference for defining a common  vision and the kind of comprehensive transition plan needed to effectively  and efficiently guide and constrain system investment decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition Plan Partially Satisfies the Act, but Improvements Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["The defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 requires that DOD  develop, by September 30, 2005, a transition plan for implementing its  business enterprise architecture, and that this plan meet three  requirements. The requirements are that it include  an acquisition strategy for new systems that are expected to be needed  to complete the defense business enterprise architecture;  listings of the legacy systems that will and will not be part of the target  business systems environment, and a strategy for making modifications  to those systems that will be included; and  specific time-phased milestones, performance metrics, and a statement  of financial and nonfinancial resource needs.", "On September 28, 2005, the Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense approved  the transition plan. This plan, as described below, partially satisfies the  three requirements.", "With respect to the first requirement, concerning an acquisition strategy,  the plan does describe a high-level approach for transforming the  department\u2019s business operations and systems, and the approach is driven  by a set of priorities and a targeted set of business capabilities that are to  be provided through the implementation of key programs. In general, the  plan includes information (e.g., the lead core business mission, budget  information, and milestones) for the 39 transformational initiatives and  the 60 business systems that are to be part of the \u201cTo Be\u201d architectural  environment, including an acquisition strategy for each system.", "However, the plan is largely based on a bottom-up planning process in  which ongoing programs were examined and categorized in the plan  around business enterprise priorities and capabilities, including a  determination as to which programs would be designated and managed as  DOD-wide programs versus component programs. This bottom-up  approach to developing the plan does not explicitly reflect transition  planning key practices cited in federal guidance, such as consideration of  technology opportunities, marketplace trends, fiscal and budgetary  constraints, institutional system development and acquisition capabilities,  and new and legacy system dependencies and life expectancies, and the  projected value of competing investments. Moreover, it means that the  plan is not based on a top-down capability gap analysis between the \u201cAs Is\u201d  and \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures in which capability and performance shortfalls  are described, and investments (such as transformation initiatives and  systems) that are to address these shortfalls are clearly identified. For  example, those programs and systems that need to be acquired, developed,  or modified and by when to meet the department\u2019s time frame to have a  general ledger capability in fiscal year 2006 or 2007 are not clearly  identified. According to DOD, this general ledger capability is to be  addressed by systems and initiatives that are spread across various  appendixes in the transition plan. However, the transition plan should  clearly describe the collective investments, including the components and  their respective systems, the specific strategies to be used, and the  estimated timelines for completion, to address this capability shortfall. This  is not yet the case because for example, the transition plan states that  \u201ceach component is still identifying the optimal path to achieve the  capability to post to a United States Standard General Ledger compliant  DOD corporate ledger.\u201d", "With respect to the second requirement, about identifying legacy systems  that will and will not be part of the \u201cTo Be\u201d architectural environment,  including modifications to these systems, the plan does show some of the  legacy systems that are to be replaced by ongoing programs. For example,  it identifies the Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) as a target  system and listed several legacy systems that would be replaced by DCAS  (e.g., the Cash Reconciliation System, the Financial Operations Support  system, and the International Balance of Payments system). It also  provides a list of legacy systems that will be modified to provide  capabilities associated with the target architecture environment, such as  the Standard Procurement System and the Navy Marine Corps Intranet.", "However, the transition plan does not include a number of elements:  It does not include a complete listing of the legacy systems that will not  be part of the target architecture. For example, the plan identified 145  legacy systems that would be migrating to the target system  Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS). However, DOD  documentation shows that this system includes over 659 legacy logistics  systems and other legacy management information systems. This  means that the plan does not account for 514 systems related to the  integration and migration of ECSS. Program officials agreed and stated  that the 145 systems included account for 90 percent of the Air Force\u2019s  Installation and Logistics portfolio. They also said that the Air Force is  currently assessing the remaining 514 systems to identify interfaces and  to determine duplication, and will update the transition plan to reflect  this assessment.", "The plan does not include system and budget information for 13 of its 15  defense agencies and for 8 of its 9 combatant commands. Exclusion  of the Defense Information Systems Agency is particularly limiting,  given that this agency provides IT infrastructure services that business  systems will need to use. This omission makes it unclear whether the  new business systems will be able to reuse existing components,  thereby leveraging established capabilities, or will be allowed to  introduce duplicative capabilities. According to program officials, the  transition plan excluded information for 13 of the defense agencies and  for 8 of its combatant commands because it was focused on the largest  business-focused organizations in DOD\u2014those meeting Tier 1 and Tier 2  investment review board certification criteria. They noted that the  majority of these organizations do not meet these threshold criteria and  therefore were not included in the transition plan.", "The plan does not include a complete listing of the legacy systems that  will be part of the target architecture, nor explicit strategies for  modifying those legacy systems identified in the plan\u2019s system migration  diagrams. For example, other DOD documentation shows that ECSS,  the Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System, and the  Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) must  interface to provide needed business capabilities. However, the  transition plan does not reflect this needed integration or the specific  capabilities that will be provided by ECSS. According to the transition  plan, these strategies are incorporated in the components\u2019 architectures.  However, as we stated in the previous section of this report, the  components\u2019 architectures have yet to be linked to the business  enterprise architecture. Program officials stated that this issue will be  addressed through the department\u2019s tiered accountability approach.", "With respect to the third requirement, concerning milestones, performance  metrics, and resource needs, the plan includes key milestone dates for the  60 systems identified. For example, September 2006 was given as the  milestone date for the Defense Travel System to achieve full operational  capability, and performance metrics were cited for some systems; for  example, for DIMHRS, the plan cites a metric of reducing manual  workarounds for military pay by 90 percent. However, the plan does not  show specific dates for terminating or migrating many legacy systems, such  as the Cash Reconciliation System and the Financial Operations Support  system, and it does not include milestone dates for some ongoing  programs, such as the Navy Tactical Command Support System. Further,  the plan does not include benefits or measures and metrics focused on  mission outcomes for each system that can be linked to the plan\u2019s strategic  goals. In addition, although the plan does identify resource needs in terms  of funding, these needs are a reflection of the funding needs contained in  the fiscal year 2006 budget submission; this submission was approved  before the programs included in the transition plan were reevaluated by the  DBMSC as to their fit within the \u201cTo Be\u201d architectural environment and the  reasonableness of their respective plans. According to program officials,  this means that the resource needs in the transition plan for some programs  are not current.", "Beyond the transition plan\u2019s partial compliance with the three requirements  in the act, as described above, the plan is also missing relevant context and  is not consistent with the architecture in various ways. For example:   The plan identifies 60 systems as target systems (e.g., DCAS), but the  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture includes only 23 of these systems. Program officials  agreed and stated that the other 37 systems are contained within  component architectures and transition plans. However, as we  previously stated, the component architectures have not been linked to  Version 3.0.", "The plan identifies 21 enterprise initiatives (e.g., SFIS, Defense  Acquisition Management Information Retrieval, and Customer  Relationship Management), but only 1 of these\u2014Defense Acquisition  Management Information Retrieval\u2014is included in the architecture, and  it is shown in the architecture as a system, not an initiative. It is  important for the architecture to include these initiatives and their  relationships to systems. Program officials agreed and stated that  Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval will be  appropriately reflected as a system in the next version of the plan.", "The plan includes a list of 66 systems that are characterized as  nonpriority DOD enterprise or component programs that will be part of  the target architecture, but the target architecture does not identify all  these systems. Further, some systems on the list, such as the  Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), are  systems that in the past were considered eligible for elimination.  Program officials agreed and stated that some of these systems are  component-level systems and therefore are reflected within the yet to be  linked component architectures and transition plans. With regard to  systems that, like MOCAS, are slated for termination, these officials  stated that replacement systems for such legacy systems have not yet  been identified. Until they are, the legacy systems will continue to be  shown as target solutions.", "The specific business capabilities to be provided by the system solutions  for the six business enterprise priorities have not been completely  defined in the plan. For example, the Materiel Visibility business  enterprise priority requires additional capabilities related to the supply  chain planning process, according to DOD, but these capabilities have  yet to be defined in the plan. Program officials stated that these will be  addressed in future versions of the architecture and transition plan.", "According to program officials, including the Director of the  Transformation Support Office, the Chief Architect, and the Enterprise  Transition Plan Team Lead, the transition plan is evolving, and any  limitations will be addressed in future iterations of the plan. The Special  Assistant to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Business  Transformation and contractor officials stated that the department has  taken an incremental approach to developing a transition plan and that the  plan, as constrained by the scope of Version 3.0 of the architecture,  satisfies the intent of the act\u2019s requirements.", "We support an incremental approach to developing the transition plan,  which is a best practice that we have advocated. However, the plan does  not fully comply with the act\u2019s requirements. Moreover, it was not derived  on the basis of a gap analysis between \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures,  and it is not of sufficient scope, content, and alignment to effectively and  efficiently manage the disposition of the department\u2019s existing inventory of  systems or for sequencing the introduction of modernized business  operations and supporting systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Year 2006 IT Budget Submission Includes Some but Not All Information That the Act Specifies", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act specifies information that  the department is to incorporate in its budget request for fiscal year 2006  and each fiscal year thereafter. Specifically, the act states that each budget  request must include information on   each defense business system for which funding is being requested;   all funds, by appropriation, for each such business system, including  funds by appropriation specifically for current services (Operation and  Maintenance) and systems modernization; and   the designated approval authority for each business system.", "DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006 IT budget submission partially satisfies these three  requirements. With regard to the first requirement, to identify each  business system for which funding is requested, the fiscal year 2006 budget  does not reflect all business systems. Specifically, when DOD submitted its  fiscal year 2006 budget submission in February 2005, it did not yet have a  comprehensive single inventory of its business systems. As we reported in  May 2004, DOD was relying at that time on several separate, inconsistent,  and unreconciled databases to establish an inventory of its business and  national security systems. Accordingly, we recommended that the  department establish a single database for its inventory of business  systems. On July 13, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks  and Information Integration)/Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII)/CIO)  directed establishment of the DOD Information Technology Portfolio Data  Repository (DITPR), and on September 28, 2005, the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Deputy CIO), issued guidance to begin merging the  DOD IT registry into DITPR. According to DOD, all business systems will  be entered into DITPR by December 31, 2005. According to DOD, all  systems will be entered into DITPR by September 30, 2006. However, the  establishment and merger of these repositories had not been completed  before the development and submission of the fiscal year 2006 IT budget.", "With respect to the fiscal year 2007 and future IT budget submissions, DOD  plans to use a separate database, entitled the Select and Native  Programming Data Collection System\u2013Information Technology to develop  the department\u2019s IT budget submissions. For these future submissions, it  will be important for DOD to ensure that this system contains all business  systems investments.", "The extent to which any of these repositories include all business systems,  and thus the extent to which the fiscal year 2006 and future budget  submissions will as well, is also a function of whether DOD classifies a  given system as a business system or a national security system. We  previously reported that DOD reclassified 56 systems in its fiscal year 2005  budget request from business systems to national security systems. The  net effect of the reclassification was a decrease of approximately $6 billion  in the fiscal year 2005 budget request for business systems and related  infrastructure. While some of the reclassifications appeared reasonable, we  reported that others were questionable. According to DOD, it is currently  reviewing the 56 systems, and it plans to complete these reviews by  February 2006 to ensure they are properly classified in the fiscal year 2007  IT budget submission.", "Further reclassifications are in the fiscal year 2006 budget submission.  Specifically, 13 systems have been reclassified from business systems to  national security systems in the fiscal year 2006 submission. In addition, 10  national security systems have been reclassified as business systems in the  fiscal year 2006 submission. For example:   The Air Force\u2019s Aviation Resource Management System, with a fiscal  year 2006 budget of $3.3 million, was reclassified from a business to a  national security system. DOD included this system in the department\u2019s  original inventory of business systems in April 2003 and also reported it  as a business system under the Logistics domain in the fiscal year 2005  IT budget request.", "The TRICARE Management Agency\u2019s Medical Readiness Decision  Support System, with a fiscal year 2006 budget of $1.3 million, was  reclassified from a national security system to a business system.", "Identification of each business system is also complicated by the fact that  DOD\u2019s definition of a business system, as given in its budget submission,  differs from the definition of a business system in the fiscal year 2005  defense authorization act. According to the act, a defense business system  is \u201can information system, other than a national security system, operated  by, for, or on behalf of the Department of Defense, including financial  systems, mixed systems, financial data feeder systems, and information  technology and information assurance infrastructure, used to support  business activities.\u201d In contrast, the definition that DOD used as the basis  for its fiscal year 2006 IT budget request notes that IT infrastructure and  information assurance funding supports both business systems and  national security systems. As a result, DOD\u2019s position is that shared IT  infrastructure and information assurance funding cannot be classified as  related to business systems or to national security systems.", "With regard to the second requirement, to identify the type of funding (i.e.,  appropriation) being requested and whether the funding was for current  services or modernization, the fiscal year 2006 budget submission identifies  the type of funding (i.e., appropriation) being requested and whether the  funding was for current services or modernization. However, a number of  systems are assigned to a category designated \u201cAll Other.\u201d It is not clear  what is included in the budget submission under this category. In the fiscal  year 2006 IT budget submission, this category totaled about $1.2 billion,  and includes, for example, about $22.6 million for financial management.  As we previously reported, the ASD(NII)/CIO and military services\u2019 budget  officials told us that the \u201cAll Other\u201d category in the IT budget includes  system projects that do not have to be identified by name because they fall  below the $2 million reporting threshold for budgetary purposes. This  budgetary threshold is not consistent with the $1 million threshold that the  act requires for modernization review and approval, as discussed later in  this report, and thus could affect DOD\u2019s ability to identify all system  investments that are subject to the requirements of the act.

According to DOD,  such \u201cAs Is\u201d related work \u201cis more properly aligned with business process  review than architecture management.\u201d Notwithstanding these comments,  DOD also stated that it was committed to documenting the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo  Be\u201d relationship in an appropriate manner.", "We agree that both the \u201cAs Is\u201d and the \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures need to be  documented in an appropriate manner.

In this regard, we also agree that  developing what the department termed in its comments as a  \u201ccomprehensive \u2018As Is\u2019 architecture\u201d may not be an effective use of time  and resources. Accordingly, our prior recommendations for an \u201cAs Is\u201d  architecture have neither presumed nor prescribed a specific level of  comprehensiveness for this \u201cAs Is\u201d description, beyond recognizing that it  should be defined in accordance with widely accepted best practices and  federal guidance. According to these practices and guidance, it should  capture the current inventory of enterprise capabilities (in terms of  business processes and performance measures) in sufficient scope and  detail to permit meaningful analysis of capability gaps in the \u201cTo Be\u201d  architecture in those areas of the enterprise that are likely to change during  the defined transition period. In addition, it should capture descriptions of  the information/data, services/applications, and technology environments  currently in use, so that transition planning activities can appropriately  take into account and address such things as data redundancies,  application duplication, shared services, and infrastructure capacity. Our  prior recommendations were, however, clear that these \u201cAs Is\u201d descriptions  should be part of the enterprise architecture (as opposed to what DOD  referred to as a business process review), because including such  descriptions is a widely accepted best practice and a condition in federal  guidance.", "With respect to the second point, DOD stated that great effort was made to  integrate the business enterprise architecture and the transition plan and  that \u201cvirtually all\u201d of our examples demonstrating a lack of integration  within and between the business enterprise architecture and the transition  plan \u201cwould be more accurately described as misunderstandings regarding  the scope, purpose or intent of the information presented.\u201d It also stated  that it was committed to correcting any integration issues.", "We agree that considerable effort was made to integrate architecture  products and the architecture with the transition plan, and we  acknowledge this in the report by stating that the integration of products in  this version of the architecture was an improvement over prior versions.  However, because our \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d arise directly from ambiguity  and inconsistencies in the architecture products and the transition plan  that blur their intended meaning, this is clear evidence that a well-defined  architecture is needed and that current levels of ambiguity and  inconsistency limit the utility and effectiveness of the products as  reference tools for guiding and constraining system investment decisions.
