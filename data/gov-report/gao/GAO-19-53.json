DOD dedicated most of the plan to describing the governance structure of the proposed administrative framework and to describing the timeline for a phased transfer of the approximately 457 MTFs to the DHA by October 1, 2021. Initially, DOD was to transfer responsibility for the administration of the MTFs to the DHA by October 1, 2018.

DOD did not define or analyze the potential effect of excluding these functions, which include dental care, substance abuse, and occupational health.

In its June 2018 plan, DOD states that the DHA will experience personnel growth during each phase of the transition, but that it expects to reduce headquarters-level personnel by 10 percent by 2021. However, the plan does not provide specific details about how DOD will achieve the established goal of reducing headquarters-level personnel by 10 percent while the DHA experiences personnel growth. Further, the plan does not address whether and how contractor personnel factor into the reduction. This lack of clarity exists because DOD has not validated headquarters-level personnel requirements or conducted a comprehensive review to identify the least costly mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel to meet the validated requirements.", "Until DOD takes action to resolve these two weaknesses, DOD will likely not be well positioned to reduce or better manage duplication and improve efficiencies, including reducing headquarters-level personnel across the Military Health System.

Overall, contractors are referenced only five times  in the entire plan:", "Three of the references are simply repeating the language from the  statutory requirement.", "Another reference reiterates that the DHA will assume management  responsibilities for civilian and contractor personnel performing health  care delivery functions and operations.", "The last reference from the section of the plan related to personnel  reductions states that DOD is planning for headquarters personnel  reductions, to include military, civilian, and contractor personnel.", "In reviewing the concepts of operations for the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, the DHA, the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force for details on contractor personnel, we found that most of these  documents did not provide details regarding contractors. Four out of five  of the aforementioned concepts of operations did not include information  concerning contractors in the context of personnel reductions. Although  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs\u2019 concept of  operations does include information about contractors in the context of  personnel reductions, the information does not provide further details  about DOD\u2019s plans for this effort.", "According to DOD Directive 1100.4, Guidance for Manpower  Management, it is DOD policy that personnel requirements are driven by  workload and shall be established at the minimum levels necessary to  accomplish mission and performance objectives. This directive states  that personnel is a resource and that changes in personnel shall be  preceded by changes to the programs, missions, and functions that  require personnel resources. Additionally, the directive states that  assigned missions shall be accomplished using the least costly mix of  personnel (military, civilian, and contract) consistent with military  requirements, among other considerations. The directive also states that  military (active and reserve) and civilian manpower resources shall be  programmed in accordance with validated personnel requirements,  among others. Moreover, key change management practices concerning  workforce reductions state that before implementing workforce reduction  strategies, it is critical that agencies carefully consider how to strategically  downsize the workforce and maintain the staff resources to carry out its  mission. These same key change management practices also define  \u201cefficiency\u201d as maintaining federal government services or outcomes  using fewer resources (such as time and money) or improving or  increasing the quality or quantity of services or outcomes while  maintaining (or reducing) resources.", "However, DOD\u2019s ability to develop an analytically-based goal for  personnel reductions associated with the transfer of administration to  DHA, a plan to achieve that goal given that it is projecting growth in  personnel, and how contractors factor into its plan has been limited for  two reasons. First, DOD has not validated headquarters-level personnel  requirements. Second, DOD has not conducted a comprehensive  review\u2014a review that, per DOD\u2019s own guidance, would involve  establishing at minimum levels the requirements necessary to accomplish  mission and performance objectives and reflect the consideration of the  least costly mix of personnel (i.e., military, civilian and contract) consistent  with military requirements, among other considerations, to meet the  validated requirements.", "Senior-level officials from the offices of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs and the DHA stated that information regarding  contractor personnel reductions was not included in the plan because  DOD probably did not have these data. These same officials said that it is  difficult to obtain contractor personnel data. As we previously noted,  DOD has faced challenges with understanding DHA headquarters  personnel requirements and composition. In 2015, we reported on DOD\u2019s  establishment of the DHA and on how, among other things, DOD could  not determine DHA\u2019s effect on Military Health System administrative and  headquarters personnel levels. We found that the DHA had not  completed the personnel requirements assessment process or developed  a baseline estimate of personnel in the Military Health System before the  DHA was created. As discussed previously, we made five  recommendations, with which DOD concurred or partially concurred. As  of January 2018, DOD had not taken action to fully address three of these  recommendations. Of the three recommendations that had not been fully  addressed, two relate directly to DHA personnel requirements.  Specifically, we recommended the following:", "To provide decision makers with appropriate and more complete  information on the continuing implementation, management, and  oversight of the DHA, the Secretary of Defense should direct the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to develop a  comprehensive requirements assessment process that accounts for  needed future skills through the consideration of potential  organizational changes and helps ensure appropriate consideration of  workforce composition through the determination of the final status of  military personnel within the DHA.", "To provide decision makers with appropriate and more complete  information on the continuing implementation, management, and  oversight of the DHA, the Secretary of Defense should direct the  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to develop a plan for  reassessing and revalidating personnel requirements as the missions  and needs of the DHA evolve over time.", "Since the recommendations concerning DHA personnel requirements  have not been fully addressed and DHA is in the middle of a significant  organizational change, it would be timely for DOD to validate  headquarters-level personnel requirements and conduct a comprehensive  review to determine the appropriate mix of personnel. This validation and  comprehensive review should occur prior to transferring authority,  direction, and control of the MTFs to the DHA for the third phase, which,  as previously noted, is scheduled to begin no later than October 1, 2020.", "In June 2018, DOD directed a review and validation of headquarters-level  personnel requirements. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness issued two memorandums concerning the review of  headquarters-level personnel requirements. The June 7, 2018,  memorandum directs the establishment of cross-service manpower  teams to conduct a baseline review of DHA headquarters\u2019 current and  future personnel requirements. Similarly, the June 15, 2018,  memorandum directs the establishment of a working group to determine  the appropriate manning of all above MTF-level medical activities in the  military departments. This memorandum also requires the working group  to review and validate the results of the cross-services manpower teams\u2019  assessment of DHA headquarters activities, among other requirements.", "Officials with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness involved in these efforts said that the goal of the current review is to identify the DHA\u2019s current and future baseline personnel  requirements. However, according to these same officials, the review will  not (1) validate personnel requirements because of time constraints, (2)  identify potential personnel reductions, or (3) consider workforce  composition. These officials also clarified that a comprehensive personnel  requirements study would take a considerable amount of time and would  generate more technical estimates of the work being performed. They  said such a study would review major functions and subfunctions, as well  as get down to the task level and analyze work processes, which would  allow for making process improvement suggestions.", "In September 2018, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness issued the report on DHA\u2019s personnel  requirements. The report stated that DHA personnel requirements  would increase to support an expanded mission and included several  recommendations one of which was to conduct a military essentiality  review of DHA positions and functions. According to officials with the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  each military department provided headquarters personnel data, which  will be reviewed as part of the upcoming Program Budget Review cycle.", "Until DOD validates headquarters-level personnel requirements and  conducts a comprehensive review that considers the least costly mix of  personnel, DOD may not be able to achieve its goal of reducing  headquarters-level personnel by 10 percent while maintaining the efficient  and effective provision of healthcare services. Furthermore, Congress will  lack important information to determine the extent to which the transfer of  the administration of the MTFs to the DHA is being planned and  implemented effectively and efficiently."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress required DOD to provide a plan to transfer the administration of  the MTFs from the military departments to the DHA. DOD provided a final  implementation plan, which made significant changes to the  administrative approach described in two of DOD\u2019s initial interim plans.

However,  the plan did not provide details to demonstrate how DOD will reduce  duplicative activities or headquarters-level personnel. Without defining  and analyzing the 16 functions currently excluded from transfer to the  DHA, validating headquarters-level personnel requirements, and  conducting a comprehensive review to determine, per DOD guidance, the  least costly mix of personnel, DOD and congressional decisionmakers are  not positioned to know how, whether, and to what extent undertaking this  significant reform effort will improve effectiveness and efficiency in the  administration of the MTFs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to the DOD:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with Director of the DHA and  the Surgeons General of the military departments, define and analyze   the 16 operational readiness and installation-specific medical functions  currently excluded from transfer to the DHA to determine whether  opportunities exist to reduce or better manage duplicative functions   and improve efficiencies in the administration of the MTFs.
