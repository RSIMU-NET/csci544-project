Federal laws require the states and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program, including payments under Medicaid managed care, which are growing at a faster rate than payments under fee-for-service (FFS). However, five state program integrity (PI) units and four Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCU) from the seven states included in GAO's review said they primarily focus their efforts on Medicaid FFS claims and have not begun to closely examine program integrity in Medicaid managed care. In addition, federal entities have taken few steps to address Medicaid managed care program integrity.", "CMS, the federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees Medicaid has largely delegated managed care program integrity oversight activities to the states, but has not updated its program integrity guidance since 2000.", "Additionally, CMS does not require states to audit managed care payments, and state officials GAO interviewed said they require additional CMS support, such as additional guidance and the option to obtain audit assistance from existing Medicaid integrity contractors in overseeing Medicaid managed care program integrity.", "The involvement of multiple entities in conducting post-payment reviews, audits, and investigations has resulted in fragmented program integrity efforts; yet the effects of fragmentation are unclear. As GAO has found in past work, coordinating activities can alleviate many problems created by fragmentation, thus allowing entities to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap. Most of the program integrity officials from the seven states GAO included in this review said that coordination efforts helped them manage overlap and avoid unnecessary duplication; however some officials said that coordination presented additional challenges for time and staff resources. Given that combined federal and state efforts have recovered only a small portion of the estimated improper payments, continued monitoring of federal and state program integrity efforts in Medicaid will be an important means of assessing whether the current structure is effective.", "Because of the gap GAO identified between state and federal program integrity efforts in managed care, neither state nor federal entities are well positioned to identify improper payments made to managed care organizations (MCOs), nor are they able to ensure that MCOs are taking appropriate actions to identify, prevent, or discourage improper payments. Improving federal and state efforts to strengthen Medicaid managed care program integrity takes on greater urgency as states that choose to expand their Medicaid programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are likely to do so with managed care arrangements, and will receive a 100 percent federal match for newly eligible individuals from 2014 through 2016. Unless CMS takes a larger role in holding states accountable, and provides guidance and support to states to ensure adequate program integrity efforts in Medicaid managed care, the gap between state and federal efforts to monitor managed care program integrity will leave a growing portion of federal Medicaid dollars vulnerable to improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS increase its oversight of program integrity efforts by requiring states to audit payments to and by MCOs; updating its guidance on Medicaid managed care program integrity; and providing states additional support for managed care oversight, such as audit assistance from existing contractors.

Most Medicaid beneficiaries are in  managed care, and although expenditures for managed care are less  than FFS expenditures, managed care expenditures are growing at a  faster rate. Medicaid consists of 51 state-based programs and, within  broad federal parameters, states are largely responsible for the day-to- day operations, including the program integrity activities, of their Medicaid  programs. The size and diversity of the Medicaid program make it  particularly vulnerable to improper payments\u2014including payments made  for treatments or services that were not covered by program rules, that  were not medically necessary, or that were billed for but never provided.

Further, officials  from three PI units described a potential conflict of interest because when  MCOs report improper payment recoveries, future capitation rates could  be reduced because of any improper payments identified. For example,  officials from four PI units said their states account for improper payment  recoveries and explained that it negatively impacts the MCO plans\u2019 rates  for the following year.", "State officials we spoke with told us that one reason they have not  focused on managed care program integrity is that MCO plan and  provider audits and investigations are more complex than those in the  FFS model.

During the 2013 National Association of Medicaid  Program Integrity conference, the agency presented on the challenges  associated with identifying different types of plan-based fraud schemes,  some of which result in inflated payments to MCOs. While CMS does  audit states\u2019 payments to MCOs to verify that the state is paying the  capitated rates specified in the MCO\u2019s contract, CMS does not require  states to audit the appropriateness of these payments, to ensure, for  example, that these payments do not include improper payments by  plans. In addition to plan-level fraud, the agency has noted the need for  more emphasis on analyzing potential provider fraud in Medicaid  managed care. On June 1, 2012, HHS-OIG issued updated performance  standards directing MFCUs to take steps to ensure that state Medicaid  agencies, MCOs, and other agencies refer suspected provider fraud  cases to the MFCU. Additionally, the updated performance standards  direct MFCUs to ensure their caseload mix reflects the proportion of  Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care. As of March 10, 2014,  HHS-OIG had published three MFCU evaluations that used the new  performance standards. In one MFCU evaluation, HHS-OIG found that 55 percent of the state\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in MCOs,  but the state\u2019s MFCU only opened one case involving an MCO during the  two year review period.

Federal laws require the states  and CMS to ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program, including  payments under Medicaid managed care. However, most of the state PI  units and MFCUs included in our review were not closely examining the  activities of MCOs citing a lack of sufficient guidance and support. For  example, CMS does not require states to audit the appropriateness of  payments to MCOs to ensure payments have not been improperly  inflated, nor does CMS require states to include review of payments to  MCO providers as part of their Medicaid RAC programs. However, CMS  has largely delegated managed care program integrity activities to the  states. Without adequate federal support and guidance on ways to  prevent or identify improper payments in a managed care setting, states  are neither well-positioned to identify improper payments made to MCOs,  nor are they able to ensure that MCOs are taking appropriate actions to  identify, prevent, or discourage improper payments. Such efforts take on  greater urgency as states that choose to expand their Medicaid programs  under PPACA are likely to do so with managed care arrangements,  receiving a 100 percent federal match for newly eligible individuals from  2014 through 2016. Unless CMS takes a larger role in holding states  accountable, and provides guidance and support to states to ensure  adequate program integrity efforts in Medicaid managed care, the gap  between state and federal efforts to monitor managed care program  integrity leaves a growing portion of federal Medicaid dollars vulnerable to  improper payments.", "Program integrity activities are fragmented across multiple state and  federal entities. If not carefully coordinated, these fragmented activities  could result in additional overlap and unnecessary duplication. State PI  units and MFCUs we reviewed coordinate with one another and federal  entities to avoid duplication, but their coordination efforts present both  benefits and challenges. As implemented across the states, newer  program integrity efforts\u2014such as RACs and MICs\u2014may improve states\u2019  efforts to identify and recover improper payments; however, they will also  increase the need for coordination to ensure maximum program coverage  and minimum duplication and overlap of program integrity activities.  Given that combined federal and state efforts have recovered only a small  portion of the estimated improper payments, it will be important to  continue to monitor federal and state program integrity efforts in Medicaid  as a means of assessing whether the current structure is effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Medicaid program  integrity efforts, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS take the  following three actions:  1.  hold states accountable for Medicaid managed care program integrity  by requiring states to conduct audits of payments to and by managed  care organizations;  2.  update CMS\u2019s Medicaid managed care guidance on program integrity  practices and effective handling of MCO recoveries; and  3.  provide the states with additional support in overseeing Medicaid  managed care program integrity, such as the option to obtain audit  assistance from existing Medicaid integrity contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment. In its written  comments, HHS stated that the Department concurred with two of our  recommendations, and stated that our first recommendation\u2014 to hold  states accountable for Medicaid managed care program integrity by  requiring states to conduct audits of payments to and by managed care  organizations\u2014was unclear. In response to this recommendation, HHS  listed current CMS activities that the Department believes address the  first recommendation. These activities include the audits under the PERM  program, the adoption of regulations requiring MCOs to have fraud and  abuse compliance plans and to provide in their contracts for HHS and  state audit and access authority. While the activities described by HHS  support states in ensuring other aspects of Medicaid program integrity,  they do not require states to conduct audits to ensure the appropriateness  of payments to MCOs or payments by MCOs and therefore do not  achieve the goal of our recommendation. Taking this additional step,  particularly in combination with additional guidance and audit assistance,  would help ensure that payments to MCO plans are appropriate and that  providers within MCOs are also consistently reviewed, thus helping  ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program.", "HHS agreed with our recommendation to update CMS\u2019s Medicaid  managed care guidance on program integrity practices and effective  handling of MCO recoveries. HHS stated that CMS is consulting with  federal and state partners regarding strategies to improve Medicaid  program integrity, and plans to address changes in future rulemaking or  other guidance. Additionally, HHS agreed that states could benefit from  additional Medicaid managed care guidance, particularly regarding  improper payment recoveries, and that CMS would consider issuing  guidance to states regarding the handling of overpayment recoveries.", "HHS also agreed with our recommendation that CMS provide states with  additional support in overseeing Medicaid managed care program  integrity, such as the option to obtain audit assistance from existing  Medicaid integrity contractors. HHS stated that CMS currently offers  assistance to states, including guidance in the use of tools for managed  care program integrity. HHS also said that in 2014 CMS will conduct  special in-depth reviews focused on managed care program integrity  activities in selected states that are expanding the use of managed care.  Additionally, HHS stated that CMS is working with two states with  considerable managed care experience to develop a model for managed  care audits for all states.", "HHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix I.
