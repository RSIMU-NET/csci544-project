These laws seek to improve federal management by responding to a need for accurate, reliable information for congressional and executive branch decisionmaking. This information has been badly lacking in the past, as much of our work has demonstrated. Implemented together, these laws provided a powerful framework for developing fully integrated information about agencies\u2019 missions and strategic priorities, data to show whether or not the goals are achieved, the relationship of information technology investment to the achievement of those goals, and accurate and audited financial information about the costs of achieving mission results.", "The Results Act focuses on clarifying missions, setting goals, and measuring performance toward achieving those goals.

The plan does not address either issue.", "Some of Justice\u2019s performance indicators are more output than outcome related. For example, one cited strategy for achieving the goal of ensuring border integrity is to prevent illegal entry by increasing the strength of the Border Patrol. One of the performance indicators Justice is proposing as a measure of how well the strategy is working is the percentage of time that Border Patrol agents devote to actual border control operations. While this measure may indicate whether agents are spending more time controlling the border, it is not clear how it will help Justice assess its progress in deterring unlawful migration.", "The Act requires that agencies\u2019 plans discuss the types of resources (e.g., human skills, capital, and information technology) that will be needed to achieve the strategic and performance goals and OMB guidance suggests that agencies\u2019 plans discuss any significant changes to be made in resource levels.

Murrah building), changing statutory responsibilities, changing technology, and developments overseas.
