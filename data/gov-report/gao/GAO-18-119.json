The ATP called for deployment of a mix of radars, sensors, and cameras in Arizona; the 2014 plan expanded these deployments to the rest of the southwest border. As of October 2017, Border Patrol had completed the planned deployment of select technologies to Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico. For example, in Arizona, Border Patrol deployed all planned Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS) and Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC) systems, and 15 of 53 planned Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) systems. Border Patrol also deployed all planned MSC systems to Texas, California, and New Mexico and completed contract negotiations to deploy RVSS to Texas. These technology programs have experienced delays, but are currently on track against revised program schedules and cost baselines. To plan for future technology deployments, Border Patrol reports it will use its Requirements Management Process (RMP)\u2013\u2013a process designed to facilitate planning by, among other things, identifying capability gaps and collecting agents' feedback\u2013\u2013and other initiatives. Border Patrol is currently developing written guidance for the RMP to ensure station officials understand their roles and responsibilities in the process.", "Border Patrol agents collect and report data on asset assists, which are instances in which technologies or other assets (such as canine teams) contributed to an apprehension or seizure; however, Border Patrol has not provided sufficient guidance to ensure the accuracy and reliability of that data. For example, agents incorrectly attributed some apprehensions or seizures to certain technologies rather than others. Stations in the Rio Grande Valley sector recorded assists from IFTs in about 500 instances from June through December 2016; however, this sector does not have IFTs. Data integrity and quality checks are the responsibility of individual sectors, but Border Patrol has provided limited guidance on how to ensure data quality. Without sufficient guidance to ensure the quality of asset assist data, Border Patrol is limited in its ability to determine the mission benefits of its surveillance technologies and use information on benefits to inform resource allocation decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Border Patrol issue guidance to improve the quality and usability of its asset assist information.

Within the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) U.S. Border Patrol  (Border Patrol) is the federal agency responsible for securing the national  borders between U.S. ports of entry. According to Border Patrol data,  total apprehensions of illegal entrants across the southwest border  increased from about 331,000 in fiscal year 2015 to about 409,000 in  fiscal year 2016.", "Border Patrol has employed a variety of land-based surveillance  technologies to assist in securing the border and apprehending  individuals attempting to cross the border illegally. In November 2005,  DHS launched the Secure Border Initiative, which was responsible for  developing a comprehensive border protection system based on tower- mounted radar and camera technologies, known as the Secure Border  Initiative Network (SBInet). By 2010, at a cost of about $1 billion, CBP  had deployed 15 SBInet tower systems along 53 miles of Arizona\u2019s 387- mile border with Mexico. However, in January 2011, in response to  internal and external assessments that identified concerns regarding the  performance, cost, and schedule for implementing the systems, the  Secretary of Homeland Security announced the cancellation of future  SBInet systems. That same month, CBP introduced the Arizona Border  Surveillance Technology Plan (ATP) for deploying technology along the  remainder of the Arizona border. The ATP was based on a mix of fixed  and mobile technology systems, including radars, sensors, and cameras  that could be tailored to the varying terrain and operating conditions along  the border to help provide security for the remainder of the Arizona  border. In June 2014, CBP developed a separate plan that incorporated  the ATP and extended land-based surveillance technology deployments  to the remainder of the southwest border\u2014the Southwest Border  Technology Plan.", "Over the years, we have reported on the progress DHS has made and  challenges it has faced in implementing its border security efforts. More  specifically, in November 2011 we reported on DHS\u2019s planning efforts  related to the ATP and found that CBP did not have the information  needed to fully support and implement the plan. Among other things, we  recommended that CBP ensure the underlying analyses of the plan were  documented in accordance with DHS guidance and internal control  standards, develop and apply key attributes for metrics to assess  program implementation, and conduct a post-implementation review and  operational assessment of SBInet. DHS concurred with these  recommendations and has taken action toward addressing some of them,  as we discuss later this in report. In March 2014, we reported on DHS\u2019s  progress in deploying land-based surveillance technologies under the  ATP and efforts to assess the contributions of those technologies to  border security. We found, among other things, that CBP\u2019s schedules and  life-cycle cost estimates reflected some, but not all, best practices, and  CBP had not developed an Integrated Master Schedule for the ATP. We  recommended that CBP apply scheduling best practices, and verify life- cycle cost estimates, among other things. DHS concurred with some, but  not all, of these recommendations, and has taken action toward  addressing some of them, as we discuss later in this report.", "You asked us to review the status of DHS\u2019s efforts to implement the  Southwest Border Technology Plan. This report addresses the following  two questions:  1.  What is the deployment status of the technology programs under the  Southwest Border Technology Plan, and to what extent has CBP  developed plans for future technology deployments?  2.  What data are available on the contributions of the deployed  technologies to CBP\u2019s border security efforts, and to what extent has  CBP assessed the technologies\u2019 performance?", "To determine the deployment status of the technology projects under the  Southwest Border Technology Plan and the extent to which CBP has  developed plans for future technology deployments, we analyzed DHS  and CBP documents and interviewed CBP officials regarding the  technology programs\u2019 costs and schedules. We focused on the plan\u2019s  three highest-cost technology programs\u2014the Integrated Fixed Tower  (IFT), Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS), and Mobile  Surveillance Capability (MSC). As part of our work, we reviewed key  planning and funding documents, including acquisition decision memos  for these programs and relevant DHS acquisition management policies  and processes. We analyzed CBP\u2019s revised schedules and cost  estimates for these programs and compared them against the originally  planned baselines for the selected technologies. As discussed in this  report, we also identified technology deployment challenges that CBP  was experiencing in testing, procuring, deploying, and operating  technologies in the Southwest Border Technology Plan. We analyzed  relevant documents and interviewed program officials from the Border  Patrol\u2019s Program Management Office Directorate (PMOD) about the  causes of those challenges, the associated risk of program delays, and  their plans to manage those risks. Further, we interviewed CBP officials  and analyzed documents to determine the progress CBP and DHS have  made in implementing prior GAO recommendations to improve  management of surveillance technology programs.", "In addition, we conducted site visits to Arizona in November 2016 and  April 2017 and to south Texas in March 2017. During these site visits, we  observed border surveillance operations, interviewed Border Patrol  agents operating technologies, and discussed agents\u2019 experiences  utilizing the technologies. In Arizona, we visited five Border Patrol stations  within the Tucson sector\u2014Ajo, Brian A. Terry, Douglas, Nogales, and  Tucson stations. We also conducted telephone interviews with officials  from two additional stations within the Tucson sector\u2014Casa Grande and  Sonoita\u2014and from the Yuma sector. We selected the Tucson and Yuma  sectors because CBP has deployed a mix of technologies there and we  selected specific stations in order to observe a variety of those  technologies. To learn about CBP\u2019s planning for border surveillance  technologies along the south Texas border, we visited four Border Patrol  stations within the Rio Grande Valley sector\u2014McAllen, Rio Grande City,  Weslaco, and Harlingen stations. We selected the Rio Grande Valley  sector and stations within that sector because Border Patrol determined  that the capability gaps in these stations constituted a critical vulnerability  to border security, among other factors. While the information we  obtained from interviews with officials in these sectors cannot be  generalized to all Border Patrol sectors or stations within these sectors,  the interviews provided important insights on Border Patrol\u2019s process for  identifying border surveillance technology needs and Border Patrol\u2019s  current plans for technology deployments in each area of responsibility.  To assess Border Patrol\u2019s process for identifying what land-based  surveillance technologies it plans to deploy in the future, we reviewed  relevant documentation from the Border Patrol Operational Requirements  Management Division, which is responsible for executing Border Patrol\u2019s  Requirements Management Process (RMP) and deploying technologies  along the southwest border.", "To determine what data are available on the contributions of the deployed  land-based surveillance technologies to CBP\u2019s border security efforts and  the extent to which CBP assessed the technologies\u2019 performance, we  analyzed available data from DHS\u2019s Enforcement Integrated Database  (EID) on apprehensions, seizures, and other events and their  corresponding asset assists. Specifically, we analyzed data from fiscal  years 2015 through May 3, 2017 (the most current years for which data  were available) on asset assists in order to determine which assets have  contributed the most to Border Patrol\u2019s activities. We reviewed Border  Patrol\u2019s processes for ensuring the reliability and completeness of these  data and compared those processes to standards set forth in Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We report on the  reliability of those data later in this report. We also reviewed available  reports on technology testing and performance, including operational  assessments and post-implementation reviews. Additionally, we visited  Border Patrol stations within the Tucson sector, as discussed earlier, to  gather agent perspectives on the impacts technologies have had on  mission effectiveness, the extent to which agents\u2019 feedback during user  testing has been incorporated into the final deployed systems, and the extent to which technologies have met requirements once deployed. We  interviewed program officials from the Border Patrol\u2019s PMOD to determine  what actions have been taken, or were planned, in order to address  deficiencies identified in testing or raised by users for each technology.  We also interviewed Border Patrol headquarters officials with  responsibilities for collecting and using asset assist and other related  data, including officials from the Strategic Planning and Analysis  Directorate.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to November 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Border Patrol developed the Southwest Border  Technology Plan using a two-step process. First, the Homeland Security  Studies and Analysis Institute conducted an analysis of alternatives,  which analyzed five technology options in 13 representative areas along  the southwest border, identified the types of environmental conditions  under which a given technology option might be more effective or less  effective, and provided a general overview of the cost and effectiveness  tradeoffs between the technologies. For example, the analysis of  alternatives noted that IFTs are potentially effective if vegetation is  sufficiently sparse and terrain is flat or rolling, such as in the Ajo station  area of responsibility (see figure 2). However, according to Border Patrol  officials, the IFT\u2019s radar capabilities may not be suited for urban  environments, where illegal crossers and narcotics traffickers can blend in  with the legitimate traffic. In some of these locations, such as the Nogales  port of entry, Border Patrol has determined that the RVSS is more  effective.", "Second, Border Patrol developed a technology deployment plan that  identified the types and quantities of each technology needed for each  sector. To develop this plan, Border Patrol officials reviewed the results of  the analysis of alternatives and considered each sector\u2019s operational  conditions, including patterns of traffic, terrain, infrastructure, weather,  available resources, and challenges. For example, Border Patrol selected  MSC units for Arizona\u2019s Tucson and El Centro sectors, but not for Texas\u2019s  Rio Grande Valley sector because the radar was less effective in the  dense vegetation of south Texas, an example of which is shown in   figure 3.", "Figure 4 shows the border surveillance technology systems included in  the Southwest Border Technology Plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Acquisition Life Cycle", "paragraphs": ["Border Patrol follows DHS\u2019s acquisition policy to acquire planned  technologies under the Southwest Border Technology Plan.

Specifically, we found that the three highest-cost programs (IFT, RVSS,  and MSC) had experienced delays relative to their baseline schedules as  of March 2013, which were current at the time of our review. We  recommended that CBP ensure that scheduling best practices are applied  to the IFT, RVSS, and MSC program schedules. DHS concurred with the  recommendation and stated that CBP planned to apply scheduling best  practices when revising the three programs\u2019 schedules. Based on our  assessment of the IFT, RVSS, and MSC programs\u2019 revised schedules  that CBP had completed as of January 2017, CBP did not apply all  scheduling best practices. However, the revised programs\u2019 schedules for  the IFT, RVSS, and MSC reflect substantial improvements in quality and  are consistent with the intent of our recommendation. In particular, CBP  has improved the quality of its products for analyzing and quantifying risk  to the programs\u2019 schedules.

The RVSS and the MSC programs\u2019 completion dates  were also extended because the scopes of the programs had increased,  among other reasons. While Border Patrol\u2019s revisions to its schedules are  positive steps in helping the agency oversee its management of these  programs, the programs continue to be behind schedule relative to their  original planned baseline documents dated March and September 2012  for the IFT and RVSS programs, respectively, as shown in figure 7.", "In addition to revising program schedules, Border Patrol has revised the  life-cycle cost estimates for the three highest-cost programs to reflect  actual costs and include cost estimates for additional and ongoing work.  For example, the MSC cost estimate increased by $294.7 million\u2014from  $107.2 million to $401.9 million\u2014due to, among other reasons, the  program\u2019s expanded scope to Texas, California, and New Mexico. In  December 2015, estimated life-cycle costs for the IFT program decreased  from its original March 2012 baseline estimate by $211.5 million, in part  because of lower-than-expected contract costs. However, from March  2012 to December 2015, IFT\u2019s acquisition cost threshold increased by  more than $50 million\u2014from $288 million to $341 million\u2014when CBP  included the costs of contractor personnel supporting the program office,  the cost of replacing SBInet systems, and actual costs through fiscal year  2014, rather than estimates. According to Border Patrol officials, a CBP  policy change required them to include the contractor personnel support  costs in the rebaseline, which was previously not required in the original  cost baseline. Figure 8 shows original and revised cost estimates for the  IFT, RVSS, and MSC programs.", "In March 2014, we reported that the three highest-cost programs (IFT,  RVSS, and MSC) accounted for 97 percent of the Arizona Technology  Plan\u2019s estimated cost and that the life-cycle cost estimates for the two  highest-cost programs\u2014IFT and RVSS\u2014reflected some, but not all, best  practices for cost estimating. Reliable life-cycle cost estimates reflect  four characteristics\u2014they are (1) well-documented, (2) comprehensive,  (3) accurate, and (4) credible. Our analysis of CBP\u2019s estimates for the two  highest-cost programs at the time of our March 2014 review showed that  these estimates at least partially met three of these characteristics: well- documented, comprehensive, and accurate. In terms of being credible,  these estimates had not been verified with independent cost estimates in  accordance with best practices. We concluded that verifying life-cycle  cost estimates with independent estimates in accordance with cost- estimating best practices could help better ensure the reliability of the  cost estimates. We recommended that CBP verify the life-cycle cost  estimates for the IFT and RVSS programs with independent cost  estimates and reconcile any differences. DHS concurred with this  recommendation, but stated then that it did not believe there would be a  benefit from expending funds to obtain independent cost estimates and  that if the costs realized to date continued to hold, there may be no  requirement or value added in conducting full program updates with  independent cost estimates.", "As part of our updates on CBP\u2019s efforts to implement our 2014  recommendations, CBP officials told us that in fiscal year 2016, DHS\u2019s  Cost Analysis Division (CAD) would begin piloting its own independent  cost estimate capability with the RVSS program. According to CBP  officials, this pilot was an opportunity to assist DHS in developing its  independent cost estimate capability. CBP selected the RVSS program  for the pilot because the program was at a point in its planning and  execution process where it could benefit most from having an  independent cost estimate performed, as these technologies were being  deployed along the southwest border beyond Arizona. According to CBP  officials, CAD completed its independent cost estimate for the RVSS  program in August 2016. CBP officials also told us that the RVSS life- cycle cost estimate was finalized and reconciled in March 2017. CBP  reported that the component acquisition executive approved the  reconciliation estimate in September 2017. According to CBP officials,  CBP does not have plans to conduct an independent cost estimate and  verification for the IFT.

For instance, the IFT program continues to  experience delays deploying IFTs to tribal lands in the Tucson sector in  Arizona. Border Patrol officials stated that the IFT program has not  received authorization from tribal land leaders to build an access road  and deploy IFT tower systems on the tribe\u2019s land. They also stated that  the historic preservation officer for the tribal lands would need to issue a  finding that the IFT would not have any negative impact on cultural  resources before Border Patrol could proceed with deployment. In  addition, RVSS program officials we met with noted that access to  privately owned land is an issue of concern in Texas that could potentially  delay RVSS deployment for the Rio Grande Valley sector. Border Patrol  has also encountered delays in the IFT program as a result of technical  issues identified during delivery of the IFT. For example, we previously  reported that testing completed in November 2015 on IFT systems in  Nogales had been delayed by 2 months in order for the contractor to  address issues related to IFT cameras and operator interfaces.  Additionally, Border Patrol has encountered schedule delays due to  contracting challenges, such as renegotiations with the contractor after  the contract was awarded.

Border Patrol agreed to the  change, which led to delays.", "We have previously reported that program delays can result in increased  costs and force agents to rely on legacy surveillance technologies.  According to Border Patrol officials, program managers and Border Patrol  are working to mitigate the risk of delays through quarterly executive  steering committee meetings of program managers and representatives  from other component and headquarters offices, such as DHS\u2019s PARM.  During these meetings, program managers discuss cost and schedule  risks and evaluate options for mitigating those risks. For example,  according to PARM officials, at one such meeting, officials reviewed the  RVSS program and determined that it met cost criteria to receive  additional DHS oversight. According to Border Patrol officials, Border  Patrol has also used quarterly executive steering committee meetings to  involve stakeholders and address potential risks as it moves forward with  full production in the IFT program.

By developing this written  guidance, Border Patrol intends to reduce the risk of relevant agency  officials not having the information needed to perform their appropriate  role in the process. We will continue to monitor the progress of Border  Patrol efforts related to the RMP to determine whether these actions meet  the intent of our recommendation to fully develop and implement written  guidance for the steps within the RMP. Until then, Border Patrol is less  likely to have reasonable assurance that it has the best available  information to inform future investments in surveillance technologies and  resource allocation decisions among surveillance technologies.", "In addition to the RMP, future surveillance technology deployments will be  affected by other ongoing DHS and CBP initiatives. Specifically, Border  Patrol officials in the Strategic Planning and Analysis Division reported  that the Domain Awareness: Land Surveillance initiative requirements  documents and Southwest Border Capability Roadmap will also be taken  into consideration throughout the RMP and will influence future  surveillance technology deployments. CBP\u2019s Domain Awareness: Land  Surveillance initiative is intended to depict current CBP land domain  awareness capabilities and inform future capabilities, which could help  Border Patrol identify solutions during various phases of the RMP. Border  Patrol officials stated that Border Patrol, with CBP\u2019s Air and Marine  Operations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is  developing mission needs statements, concepts of operations, and  capability operational requirements documents for (1) mobile, (2) fixed  and relocatable, and (3) agent-portable capabilities which will help inform  future technology deployments. Border Patrol also proposed a Southwest  Border Capabilities Roadmap in April 2017 to assist with identifying  solutions, such as surveillance technology, mobility and access, and  personnel. This roadmap is intended to inform a balanced, risk-based  investment strategy driven by capability gaps, geographic priorities,  terrain, and other environmental factors, and to consider the evolving  cross-border threat. The roadmap identifies specific requirements for  persistent surveillance assets, such as RVSS, and was used to support  CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget justification for RVSS deployments in the  Rio Grande Valley sector. To create this roadmap, Border Patrol officials  reported reaching out to stations within 40 miles of the border to discuss  their current gaps and how they would close them (either through physical  barriers, manpower, or technology). Because Border Patrol is still in the  planning phases for future technology deployments, it is too soon to tell  how these efforts will assist Border Patrol in structuring and planning  those deployments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Is Taking Action to Better Link Performance Data to Planning Efforts, but Needs to Improve Data Quality", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Border Patrol Has Made Progress Identifying Performance Metrics for Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Border Patrol has made progress identifying performance metrics for the  technologies under the Southwest Border Technology Plan, but additional  actions are needed to fully implement our prior recommendations in this  area. In November 2011, we found that CBP did not have the  information needed to fully support and implement the ATP and  recommended that CBP (1) determine the mission benefits to be derived  from implementation of the ATP and (2) develop and apply key attributes  for metrics to assess program implementation. We reported in 2014 that,  in response to our recommendations, CBP had identified mission benefits  expected from the implementation of the surveillance technologies under  the ATP, but had not fully developed key attributes for performance  metrics for the technologies. We recommended, among other things, that  CBP analyze available data on apprehensions and seizures and  technological assists, in combination with other relevant performance  metrics or indicators, to determine the contribution of surveillance  technologies to CBP\u2019s border security efforts. CBP officials stated that  they planned to develop objectives for each performance measure, at  which time the agency would begin using the data to evaluate the  contributions of specific technology assets. CBP also intended to  establish a tool by the end of fiscal year 2016 that explained the  qualitative and quantitative impacts of technology and tactical  infrastructure on situational awareness in specific areas of the border  environment.", "In September 2016, Border Patrol provided us a case study that  assessed technology assist data, along with other measures, to  determine the contributions of surveillance technologies to its mission. In  April 2017, we reported that this was a helpful step in developing and  applying performance metrics; however, the case study was limited to  one border location and the analysis was limited to select technologies.  In May 2017, Border Patrol officials demonstrated the agency\u2019s new  Tracking, Sign Cutting, and Modeling (TSM) system, which they said is  intended to connect between agents\u2019 actions (such as identification of a  subject with a camera) and results (such as an apprehension) and allow  for more comprehensive analysis of the contributions of surveillance  technologies to Border Patrol\u2019s mission. One official said that data from  the TSM will have the potential to provide decision makers with  performance indicators, such as changes in apprehensions or traffic  before and after technology deployments. However, the TSM is still early  in its use and officials confirmed that it is not yet used to support such  analytic efforts. The official stated that over time it would be used to  analyze performance on a systematic basis and provide information to  decision makers. We continue to believe that it is important for Border  Patrol to assess technologies\u2019 contributions to border security and will  continue to monitor the progress of the TSM and other Border Patrol  efforts to determine whether these actions sufficiently meet the intent of  our November 2011 recommendation to fully develop and apply  performance metrics for its border technologies. Until then, Border Patrol  is not well positioned to fully assess its progress in implementing the  Southwest Border Technology Plan and determine when mission benefits  have been fully realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Patrol Measures Technologies\u2019 Assistance in Apprehensions and Seizures, but Data Are of Limited Quality and Usability", "paragraphs": ["Border Patrol agents collect and report data on asset assists, which are  instances in which technologies or other assets (such as canine teams,  bicycle patrols, or air support from CBP\u2019s Air and Marine Operations)  contributed to an apprehension or seizure; however, the agency does not  have sufficient controls to ensure the accuracy and reliability of that data.  In March 2014, we reported that CBP was not capturing complete asset  assist data on the contributions of its surveillance technologies to  apprehensions and seizures and that Border Patrol agents were not  consistently recording these data across locations. We recommended  that CBP require data on asset assists to be recorded and tracked within  the DHS Enforcement Integrated Database (EID), which contains data on  apprehensions and seizures. Since then, Border Patrol has taken actions  to better record asset assists and to expand the types of technologies that  can be tracked, consistent with our prior recommendation. Specifically, in  June 2014, Border Patrol issued guidance informing agents that the asset  assist data field within the e3 Portal to the EID had become a mandatory  data field. Additionally, when recording asset assists, agents initially  could only choose from \u201ccamera,\u201d \u201cmobile surveillance system,\u201d \u201cscope  truck,\u201d \u201cunattended ground sensor,\u201d or \u201cother\u201d when selecting  technologies. In May 2016, Border Patrol expanded the types of assets  available for agents to choose from to include MSC, IFT, and APSS,  among others.", "Border Patrol requirements for entering asset assist data into the e3  Portal and expansion of the types of assets listed have been positive  steps to help better position Border Patrol to assess the contributions of  surveillance technologies to border security efforts, as we recommended  in 2014. However, we have identified issues with the completeness and  reliability of the asset assist data. In particular, we analyzed data on asset  assists from October 1, 2014 through May 3, 2017 and our analysis  showed that agents incorrectly attributed some apprehensions and  seizures to certain technologies rather than others. For example, stations  in the Rio Grande Valley sector recorded assists from IFTs in nearly 500  instances from June through September 2016, which cannot be accurate,  since the sector does not have IFTs. When we brought this issue to the  attention of Border Patrol headquarters officials, they told us in December  2016 that they would discuss the matter with Rio Grande Valley sector  officials. However, data from December 2016 through May 3, 2017  indicated that agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector continued to record  asset assists from IFTs. Additionally, we found that one station in the  Tucson sector with SBInet towers was recording asset assists from the  SBInet towers as \u201cother,\u201d when Border Patrol headquarters officials told  us that SBInet towers should be recorded as \u201cIFT.\u201d Moreover, our  analysis showed that \u201cother\u201d (including \u201cother\u201d listed alongside additional  assets) made up nearly 16 and 23 percent, respectively, of asset assists  recorded in the Tucson and Rio Grande Valley sectors from October 1,  2016 through May 3, 2017. Border Patrol officials told us that \u201cother\u201d  should be any technology not otherwise listed, and could include  technologies or support that officials were interested in tracking locally.  Officials said the large number of \u201cother\u201d assets could also be a result of  agents not understanding their responsibilities or agents working to  complete the asset assist data entry as quickly as possible so they could  move on to other duties.", "According to Border Patrol officials, data integrity and quality checks are  the responsibility of the individual sectors, and each station has a  designated point of contact for data integrity and a system administrator  to oversee data quality. However, Border Patrol has not provided written  guidance to the sectors on how to oversee data integrity or conduct  quality checks of asset assist data, and Border Patrol\u2019s guidance on how  to enter asset assist data is limited. According to Border Patrol officials,  Border Patrol\u2019s asset assist guidance for sectors consists of two training  presentations. We reviewed the training slides for these presentations  and found they included photographs and general descriptions of some  technologies, along with two case examples for recording an asset assist.  However, the slides did not discuss how sectors should conduct data  integrity or quality checks. Furthermore, the slides did not address how  agents should record assists for SBInet towers. The slides also did not  explain why asset assist data are collected (other than that the Chief of  the Border Patrol requires it), what it could be used for, or why it was  important to ensure data were accurately recorded. Officials told us in  June 2017 that the asset assist data were only used to respond to data  requests from external agencies\u2014the data were not being used for  planning, budgeting, performance measurement, or other purposes.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should obtain relevant data from reliable internal and  external sources in a timely manner based on the identified information  requirements. Reliable internal and external sources provide data that  are reasonably free from error and bias and faithfully represent what they  purport to represent. Management should evaluate both internal and  external sources of data for reliability. Additionally, management should  periodically review policies, procedures, and related control activities for  continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving the entity\u2019s objectives  or addressing related risks. If there is a significant change in the entity\u2019s  process (such as the addition of new asset assist fields), management  should review this process in a timely manner to determine that the  control activities are designed and implemented accordingly. Without  sufficient guidance for sectors on how to enter and review asset assist  information, Border Patrol does not have reliable data on asset assists  that could help monitor the contribution of surveillance technologies to  Border Patrol apprehensions and seizures and inform resource allocation  decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Patrol Reviews Agent Feedback Data on Technology Performance to Improve Current and Future Deployments", "paragraphs": ["Border Patrol has a variety of mechanisms for collecting agent feedback  on technology performance and for using that information to improve  current and future deployments. For example, officials from the Border  Patrol Program Management Office Directorate (PMOD) reported that  they conduct required technology performance evaluations at specified  intervals (e.g., a 6-month post-deployment review and an annual  operational analysis) to regularly collect and evaluate agent feedback,  and conduct monthly reviews of maintenance and repair requests.  Officials said that this feedback is consolidated, prioritized based on cost  effectiveness, and used to identify system upgrades (both for systems  that have been deployed and for future deployments).", "The PMOD also collects feedback as part of the annual process for  developing an operational analysis report. In the 2016 operational  analysis for the MSC program, the PMOD assessed Border Patrol agents\u2019  overall satisfaction with the MSC system, whether it enabled agents to  perform their functions more easily and efficiently, and whether it met  agents\u2019 needs. Agents identified several MSC benefits, including  performance improvements from the prior system (known as the Mobile  Surveillance System), radars that exceeded the performance of other  mobile systems\u2019 radars, and targets being detected at farther ranges than  the system specification. However, the analysis identified more  opportunities for improvement, including the need for improvements to the  MSC\u2019s camera, video analytics, tracking, graphical user interface,  engineering, and other changes.", "Border Patrol also reported using post-implementation reviews to collect  agent feedback and identify improvements. For technologies under the  ATP and Southwest Border Technology Plan, Border Patrol completed  post-implementation reviews for the MSC in July and October of 2014, for  the IFT in June 2016, and for the RVSS in October 2016. In August 2017,  Border Patrol reported expecting to conduct reviews for the remaining  technologies within 6 to 18 months of each technology reaching initial  operating capability. A post-implementation review\u2019s primary purpose is to  determine the impact of the system on stakeholders, quantitative and  qualitative performance of the system, and the ability of the system to  meet identified goals. For example, the MSC review from October 2014  reported that the system was generally an improvement over the older  Mobile Surveillance System; however, program risks included damage to trucks and sensors from Border Patrol agent operator error and the need  to improve or widen access roads given the larger footprint of the MSC  trucks (compared to the prior Mobile Surveillance System trucks). The  review concluded with six recommendations to improve future  assessments of the system and to plan for new sensor deployments. The  recommendations to the PMOD and Border Patrol acquisition office  included updating the life-cycle cost estimate to track manpower costs;  using a skills-based qualification standard for MSC operators; and  ensuring future Border Patrol surveillance systems include the ability to  extract actual performance, operational, and environmental data. In  August 2017, Border Patrol reported a range of actions underway to  address these recommendations, including (1) developing updates to the  MSC\u2019s support system to better capture all service requests and  maintenance work orders, (2) providing standardized training to each  MSC operator with refresher training available upon request, and (3)  updating key acquisition documents to reflect the increase in the number  of MSCs to a full operating capability of 90 units.", "In addition to required reports, PMOD officials reported gathering agent  feedback directly. For example, a PMOD official with responsibility for the  IFT program reported conducting feedback meetings with agents. The  meetings included both contractors and government personnel in order to  ensure a shared understanding of agent-identified issues. The PMOD  also reported conducting weekly, monthly, and real-time monitoring of  trouble-tickets\u2014that is, agent-generated reports of maintenance or other  technical issues. PMOD officials reviewed the issues identified and  prioritized them based on cost and the potential increases in capability.
