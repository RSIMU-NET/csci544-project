GAO\u0092s analysis also showed that the amounts of carryover exceeding the allowable amounts have declined in each of the past 4 years. These reductions could be attributed to DMAG actions, including implementing production efficiencies that reduced the time required to repair weapon systems.", "In contrast, DMAG\u0092s budgeted carryover amounts were less than the allowable amounts for all 8 years GAO reviewed. In the most recent 6 years, DMAG\u0092s reported actual carryover amounts exceeded budgeted carryover by at least $50 million.

This increase could be primarily attributed to new orders from customers more than tripling over this period. GAO\u0092s analysis found that the increase in new orders was the result of higher depot maintenance requirements supporting OIF/OEF.

Both DOD and congressional  defense committees have agreed that some carryover is appropriate at  the end of the fiscal year in order for working capital funds to operate  efficiently and effectively. For example, if customers do not receive new  appropriations at the beginning of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary  to ensure that working capital fund activities (1) have enough work to  continue operations in the new fiscal year and (2) retain the appropriate  number of personnel with sufficient skill sets to perform depot  maintenance work. Too little carryover could result in some personnel not  having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the other  hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds  from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the work until well  into the next fiscal year.

Considering the impact that new orders have on carryover, in  2008 MCLC established criteria for the acceptance of new orders  including (1) determining if the customer order supports OIF/OEF  workload and if there are viable alternatives to the scope of the order  and/or source of repair for which the customer is able to mitigate, and  (2) determining whether there are alternatives that DMAG can use to  avoid carrying over workload into the new fiscal year (i.e., increase  overtime, augment personnel, and/or subcontract portions of the  workload).", "Beginning in 2008, DMAG formed a working group to engage its  customers and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to  reduce times for closing completed orders. In addition, DMAG closed  out orders with small remaining balances that reduced the unobligated  balances on the orders. For example, DMAG has earned an additional  $2.3 million in revenue in fiscal year 2011 due to an August 2011  change to the Defense Industrial Financial Management System to  automatically bill to revenue the residual dollar amounts left on  customer orders.

For example, the DMAG  fiscal year 2010 budget cited the acceptance of unplanned workload by  the maintenance centers to repair war-ravaged equipment and weapon  systems returning from overseas contingency operations as the reason  for the maintenance centers exceeding the allowable carryover in fiscal  year 2008.

The center  carried over $7.9 million of the $11.7 million order principally because  many of the vehicles had excessive corrosion in the hull floor plate  and side board areas that were much greater than anticipated and  which required additional welding and plate replacement. Barstow  officials said that the additional welding, plate replacement, and  extensive corrosion repair caused the repair cycle time to be extended  beyond the timelines originally anticipated to complete the work and  caused work delays on other variants of LAVs concurrently being  worked on at the center. The center completed work on the order in  September 2011.", "In December 2010, MCLC accepted an order totaling $1.4 million that  was financed with fiscal year 2011 operation and maintenance,  Marine Corps appropriated funds to perform depot maintenance work  (inspect and repair only as necessary) on 18 rough terrain forklifts at  the Albany maintenance center.

The order was amended four times from  March 2010 to September 2010 to increase quantities to 45  HMMWVs, increase funding to $4.7 million, and extend the work  completion date into fiscal year 2011. The center carried over almost  the entire amount of the $4.7 million order because the center was  working on other fiscal year 2010 HMMWVs. Due to customer  requirements, as well as capability, utilization, and production  constraints, the center could not begin work on this order until the  center completed work on the other orders. The center did not begin  work on this order until September 17, 2010\u201410 months after the  initial order was accepted, and did not complete work on the order  until August 2011\u2014near the end of fiscal year 2011.", "In November 2010, MCLC accepted an order totaling $1.5 million that  was financed with fiscal year 2011 funds appropriated for Marine  Corps operation and maintenance to perform depot maintenance work  on three LAVs at the Barstow maintenance center. Because the  Barstow maintenance center was still performing depot maintenance  work on a fiscal year 2010 LAV order for the same vehicle  configuration, the Marine Corps Supply Management Center (SMC)  (customer) issued an amendment in February 2011 to reduce  quantities to zero and deobligate the entire amount on the fiscal year  2011 order. Our analysis of order documentation showed that the  customer deobligated the funds because the Barstow maintenance  center did not require the funds at that time, as the center was still  performing work on the fiscal year 2010 LAV order. Beginning in  March 2011, the MCLC accepted amendments to increase quantities  on the fiscal year 2011 order to 20, increase funding to $10.5 million,  and changed the scope of the work to include the replacement of  missing communications equipment. Barstow maintenance center  began performing depot maintenance work on this fiscal year 2011  order in April 2011\u20147 months into the fiscal year and 5 months after  the order was originally placed. Because the Barstow center was  working the fiscal year 2010 order, work was delayed on the fiscal  year 2011 LAV order causing the center to carry over $3.8 million into  fiscal year 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amendments Accepted in the Last Quarter of the Fiscal Year", "paragraphs": ["The timing of the receipt and acceptance of orders from customers affect  the amount of carryover at year-end. Our examination of 60 orders for  fiscal years 2010 and 2011 determined that, in 25 cases we reviewed,  amendments to orders accepted in the last quarter of the fiscal year  contributed to carryover. These amendments either increased order  quantities or expanded the scope of work on existing orders with the  maintenance centers. DOD Financial Management Regulation provides  that depots cannot perform work until they receive and accept orders from  customers. According to MCLC (Programs and Resources Department)  officials, since some of these orders or amendments to these orders were  planned and funded in the fourth quarter, DMAG could not start work until  it received and accepted amended orders as specified in the DOD  regulation.", "In June 2006, we reported that carryover is greatly affected by orders  received late in the fiscal year. late in the fiscal year increase the amount of carryover. Further, we  reported that the most frequent reason DOD activity groups accepted  orders at the end of the fiscal year was because funds were provided to  the customers late in the fiscal year to finance existing requirements.  DOD customers stated that it is common for military services to provide  funds to them late in the fiscal year after the military services review their  programs to identify funds that will not be obligated by year-end. When  these funds are identified, the military services realign the funds to  programs that can use them. These funds are then used to finance orders  placed with working capital fund activities at year-end. Our discussion  with SMC officials\u2014the largest DMAG customer\u2014confirmed that the  information reported in June 2006 was also applicable for fiscal years  2010 and 2011. The officials stated that there is a significant advantage to  using unobligated funds at fiscal year-end that are set to expire on  September 30 because the maintenance centers can perform more work  to satisfy its customers\u2019 unfunded requirements. Two examples we  identified of amended orders received late in the fiscal year that increased  carryover are presented below.", "GAO, Defense Working Capital Fund: Military Services Did Not Calculate and Report  Carryover Amounts Correctly, GAO-06-530 (Washington D.C.: June 27, 2006).", "In fiscal year 2010, MCLC accepted an order and amendments to the  order totaling $31.2 million that was financed with fiscal year 2010  operation and maintenance, Marine Corps appropriated funds to  inspect and repair only as necessary 389 HMMWVs at the Albany  maintenance center. The order was amended eight times in fiscal  year 2010 to increase quantities from 25 vehicles to 389 vehicles,  increase funding from $2.0 million to $31.2 million, and extend the  work completion date into fiscal year 2011. During the fiscal year, the  Albany center completed about 90 percent of the work on the order  through the seventh amendment. However, on September 30, 2010\u2014 the last day of the fiscal year\u2014MCLC received and accepted an  amendment to the order increasing funding by $4.9 million and the  quantity by 61 vehicles. The funding cited on this order was set to  expire that same day. The entire amount of this amendment carried  over into fiscal year 2011. According to a SMC official, the  amendment was issued to the Albany maintenance center on  September 30, 2010, because funding on a HMMWV order with the  Barstow maintenance center was identified by the center as excess to  requirements 2 days before the end of the fiscal year. The funding  was set to expire at the end of the fiscal year and, if not obligated on  another order by September 30, 2010, could not be used for new  requirements. As a result, the funding from the Barstow maintenance  center that was to expire on September 30, 2010, was applied to the  Albany order. The center carried over $7.6 million into fiscal year 2011  on this order and completed work on the order in March 2011.", "In planning the fiscal year 2011 workload, SMC expected to issue  orders to MCLC for the Albany and Barstow maintenance centers to  perform depot maintenance on 179 Logistics Vehicle Systems\u2019 front  power units. In order to repair the vehicles, MCLC issued a  commercial subcontract to the original equipment manufacturer to  purchase cabs and other operating material and supplies needed to  support work at the Albany and Barstow maintenance centers for the  179 vehicles. Subsequent to the subcontract being awarded, the  Marine Corps maintenance strategy changed on the Logistics Vehicle  Systems to reduce the need for the cabs purchased on the contract.  In return, SMC (the customer) decided to decrease the scope of work  from a planned 179 vehicles to 47 vehicles. Through May 2011, the  MCLC accepted orders with amendments totaling $8.9 million to  support work on the 47 vehicles. Because costs associated with  terminating the contract with the original equipment manufacturer for  the excess cabs and other operating material and supplies would be  nearly as much as having the contractor complete the order, the  Marine Corps decided to have the contractor complete the order and  transfer ownership of the excess cabs and other operating material  and supplies to MCLC headquarters. In June 2011, MCLC informed  SMC that $9.8 million, in addition to the $8.9 million provided earlier,  would need to be returned in order to pay for the cost of the  contracted cabs and other operating material and supplies ordered  from the contractor and to complete work on the remaining 47  vehicles. On September 15 and 29, 2011, SMC issued amendments  to fund the additional $9.8 million using fiscal year 2011 Marine Corps  operation and maintenance funds that became available when other  programs indentified excess funds that would expire on September  30, 2011. Because funding was provided late in the fiscal year, the  centers carried over $9.4 million of the $18.7 million in orders on this  program into fiscal year 2012. The orders are to be closed in fiscal  year 2012 when deliveries from the contractor are complete and  ownership of the excess cabs and other operating material and  supplies are transferred to MCLC headquarters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Reliable carryover information is essential for Congress and DOD to  effectively perform their oversight responsibilities, including reviewing and  making well-informed decisions on the Marine Corps\u2019 DMAG budget.

As a result, while the  Marine Corps budgets showed that DMAG\u2019s carryover would be under  the allowable amount, subsequent Marine Corps financial records  showed the actual reported carryover exceeded the allowable amount for  the most recent 6 years. The carryover information can be a management  tool for (1) controlling the amount of work that can carry over from one  fiscal year to the next, and (2) identifying problems in other areas such as  developing budgets on the amount of new orders for depot maintenance  work.

We analyzed  carryover since fiscal year 2004 because prior to fiscal year 2004, DOD  had a different policy for determining the allowable amount of carryover.  We met with responsible officials from Navy and Marine Corps  headquarters and the Marine Corps Logistics Command (MCLC)  (Programs and Resources Department) to determine the reasons for  significant variances between (1) reported actual carryover and the  allowable amount or (2) budgeted and reported actual carryover.

We also performed  walkthroughs of the Albany and Barstow maintenance centers\u2019 operations  and discussed with officials reasons for workload carrying over from one  fiscal year to the next for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Further, in order to  more fully understand the reasons for carryover at the maintenance  centers, we obtained and analyzed 60 orders (30 orders for fiscal year  2010 and 30 orders for fiscal year 2011) that had the largest dollar  amount of carryover. Carryover amounts associated with these orders  represented 49 percent and 68 percent of DMAG\u2019s total carryover for  fiscal years 2010 and 2011, respectively. We selected 60 orders because  they were the largest and most recent orders at the time of our audit. We  reviewed the orders with amendments for each of the orders and  discussed the information in these documents with MCLC (Programs and  Resources Department) and maintenance center Albany and Barstow  officials to determine the reasons for the carryover.
