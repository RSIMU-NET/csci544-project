To address this problem, a growing number of locations are turning to non-U.S. citizens who have just completed their graduate medical education in the United States. These physicians generally enter the United States under an exchange visitor program administered by the United States Information Agency (USIA). Their visas, called J-1 visas, require them to leave the country when their medical training is done, but this requirement can be waived at the request of a federal agency or a state. This waiver is usually accompanied by a requirement that the physician practice for a specified period in an underserved area.", "The growing use of these waivers is not without controversy. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the main federal agency responsible for addressing physician shortages and medical underservice. HHS has taken the position that the J-1 visa is a way to pass advanced medical knowledge to other countries and that waivers of the J-1 visa requirement should not be used as a means to address medical underservice in the United States. Instead of using waivers to address underservice, HHS administers its own federal programs specifically for this purpose, particularly the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). Some other groups, including the Pew Health Professions Commission and the Institute of Medicine\u2019s Committee on the U.S. Physician Supply, believe that allowing foreign physicians to remain in the United States after completing their graduate medical education could contribute to a general oversupply of physicians, which could drive up medical costs. Many communities that need physicians, however, are using these waivers to address physician shortages, stating that they could not recruit qualified physicians without doing so.", "To provide information that would be useful to the Congress in addressing this issue, we conducted a self-initiated study focused primarily on the following questions:", "How many foreign physicians with J-1 visas receive waivers, where do they practice, and what are their medical specialties?", "Do federal agencies and states effectively coordinate policies and procedures for granting these waivers?", "To what extent are foreign physicians who receive waivers complying with waiver requirements to practice in underserved areas?", "To conduct this work, we developed two surveys addressing the extent to which states and federal agencies used waivers to meet physician shortages. One polled all states to determine the size of their programs for requesting waivers. The other surveyed health care facilities for a random sample of physicians who received waivers. These surveys provided more complete information than was available from participating agencies, including USIA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the federal agencies requesting waivers for physicians. We supplemented this work with reviews of existing data, interviews with agency officials and others involved with the waivers, and field work in three states. Appendix I explains our methodology in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["J-1 visas allow foreign nationals to participate as exchange visitors in cultural and educational programs in the United States. USIA is responsible for managing the J-1 visa program and designates organizations as program sponsors. In 1995, over 9,000 foreign physicians with J-1 visas were in the United States for graduate medical education or training. These exchange visitors constituted about one-tenth of all individuals receiving graduate medical education (see app. II). Because many exchange visitors are in the United States for several years for graduate medical education and training, each year a few thousand new physicians receive J-1 visas and enter the United States to begin graduate medical education and training while a few thousand complete their training.", "To ensure that the J-1 visa program works as intended in passing learning and experience to other countries, the Congress has imposed restrictions on J-1 visa holders, including physicians in graduate medical education. These physicians are required to return to their home country (or to their country of last legal residence) for at least 2 years after completion of training. However, they may obtain a waiver of this requirement and remain in the United States. For most physicians, the waivers are requested on their behalf by a federal agency or by a state agency or department that is responsible for public health issues. These federal agencies and states generally request waivers of the 2-year foreign residence requirement so that the physicians can practice for several years in underserved areas (see table 1). The federal agencies and states submit these requests to USIA.", "USIA reviews the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forwards its recommendations to the INS Commissioner. For waiver requests made by interested U.S. government agencies or states, INS may only grant the waiver if USIA submits a favorable recommendation. Figure 1 illustrates the waiver process.", "While HHS is the federal agency responsible for addressing physician shortages it does not use waivers to do so. HHS endorses the philosophy that exchange visitors return home after completing their training to make their new knowledge and skills available to their home countries. As a result, HHS does not support waivers for physicians to remain in the United States to practice in underserved areas.", "Instead, HHS administers other federal programs, such as NHSC, to address physician shortages in the United States. NHSC supplies physicians and other health professionals to underserved areas primarily by (1) awarding scholarships to students who agree to serve in a shortage area after their health professions training is complete and (2) repaying a set amount of educational loan debt for each year of service in a shortage area. On December 31, 1995, 848 NHSC physicians and 685 other NHSC professionals who received scholarships or federal loan repayment were practicing in underserved areas of the country.", "In addition to NHSC, HHS has other programs to address medical underservice. For example, HHS provides federal grant funding to community health centers that are required to accept all patients regardless of their ability to pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Waivers Has Grown in Size and Scope", "paragraphs": ["Begun as an exceptions policy, the number of physicians receiving waivers of the 2-year foreign residence requirement for J-1 exchange visitors has grown more than tenfold in the past 5 years. Several factors have contributed to the increase: more hospitals and other facilities have found the waiver to be a means to fill their empty positions; more agencies and states are making requests; and physicians are actively seeking waivers, in some cases allegedly paying recruiters and immigration attorneys to find them a position. Waiver physicians are practicing in virtually every state; most are primary care physicians."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of Waivers Has Increased Significantly", "paragraphs": ["The number of waivers being processed for physicians to practice in underserved areas each year has grown from 70 in 1990, to 1,374 in 1995 (see fig. 2). In 1995, the number of waivers being processed for physicians was greater than the number of NHSC physicians (1,267) practicing in underserved areas, and it was enough to offset about 27 percent of the total physician shortage identified by HHS. Indications are that in 1995, about half of the foreign physicians that were supposed to return home were granted waivers of this requirement to practice in an underserved area in the United States.", "Why do facilities want to employ foreign physicians through the use of the waivers? In responding to our survey and during our visits to health centers, physician offices, clinics, and other health care facilities where these physicians were practicing, many officials said that their facilities had turned to these physicians because they were unable to recruit U.S. physicians. For example, the administrator of a county public health unit in Florida commented that most U.S. physicians are not willing to work in rural areas, but she has found many physicians with J-1 visas who had excellent references and credentials and who were willing to practice there. She said it would be a \u201ctravesty\u201d to health care in rural areas if these waiver physicians were not available. Other reasons cited for hiring these physicians are their superior foreign language skills and cultural familiarity with a facility\u2019s patient population. For example, several physicians received waivers to practice at a migrant health center in Eastern Washington. These physicians were recruited, in part, because they are native Spanish speakers, which enables them to effectively treat the center\u2019s Spanish-speaking patients.", "The sudden increase in the number of waivers being processed in 1994 and 1995 probably reflects the fact that facilities had additional places to turn to for requesting the waivers. By 1995, four U.S. government agencies and 23 states were requesting waivers of J-1 visa requirements for physicians. Before 1993, the only agency requesting waivers for a number of physicians to practice in underserved areas was ARC. ARC began requesting waivers in the 1980s for physicians to practice in Appalachia. However, ARC requested around 200 or fewer waivers per year, peaking at 266 waivers in 1993. In addition to ARC, since 1993 the Department of Transportation (DOT) has requested waivers for a handful of physicians to practice in one rural area where the U.S. Coast Guard operates.", "The rapid growth in waivers began in late 1993 and 1994, when the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began requesting them for physicians to serve their rural and urban constituents. Senior officials at both agencies said that they initially responded to a constituent request to support a specific physician; however, their offices were subsequently flooded with requests for waivers for other physicians. Agency officials said that they would like to limit the number of waivers processed by their agencies, but have not found a way of effectively restricting them.", "The number of waivers also increased because the authority for states to request waivers was passed in 1994, and 23 states requested waivers in calendar year 1995. As a result of the entry of these federal agencies and states, physicians seeking waivers were no longer limited to practice locations in Appalachia and areas serving DOT personnel; instead, they could practice in rural and urban areas across the country. However, HUD officials have recently decided to reassess the department\u2019s waiver policy and stopped accepting requests after August 30, 1996, to conduct a review. Table 2 shows the number of waiver requests submitted to USIA by each agency in 1995 and the reason for the requests. For information on the number of waivers requested by each agency since 1990, see appendix V.", "Another factor in the increase in waivers may be the interest among physicians with J-1 visas themselves. Health care facility officials, as well as state and federal health officials, said that they have been inundated with inquiries from physicians who would like to obtain a waiver by working in a shortage area. In addition, officials at several facilities said that they were contacted by professional recruiters or immigration attorneys regarding the availability of a physician to meet their facility\u2019s needs if the physician could obtain a waiver. Some facility officials and physicians reported paying up to $25,000 in immigration attorney or recruiter fees for assistance in matching a physician with a facility and processing the waiver. During our site visits to facilities where physicians who had received waivers were practicing, physicians cited several reasons why they wanted waivers, including that (1) they would not be able to apply the medical skills they had learned in the United States in their home countries, (2) they were concerned about violence in their home countries, (3) they wanted to serve in an underserved area, (4) their families and relatives were in the United States, and (5) they had a general desire to stay in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waiver Physicians Practice Throughout the Country in a Variety of Settings", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, waiver physicians were practicing in 49 states and the District of Columbia\u2014every state except Alaska. However, the degree to which they are relied on to relieve physician shortages varies greatly from state to state. To measure the extent of this reliance, we compared the number of waivers granted or in process in 1994 and 1995 with the number of physicians identified by HHS as needed to remove the shortage area designations in a state. In five states (Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, and West Virginia), the number of physicians for whom waivers were processed equaled more than 75 percent of the number of physicians needed to remove these designations in the state. In other states, such as California, such physicians equal less than 10 percent of the identified need.", "Physicians with waivers are practicing in a variety of settings. Our survey results show that more than one-third of physicians who received their waivers through federal agencies are practicing in nonprofit community or migrant health centers and about one-fourth are in a private or group practice. The rest are practicing in hospitals, for-profit health centers, or other settings (see fig. 3).

Overall, more than half of them were practicing in internal medicine (see fig. 4). The other major primary care specialties were pediatrics and family practice.", "We estimate that one-third of the waiver physicians who had primary care specialties also had subspecialties. The most prevalent subspecialty was nephrology (medicine concerned with kidney disease), which was reported for about 7 percent of the primary care physicians. Other subspecialties included infectious diseases, cardiology, and gastroenterology. Requesting facilities and state officials had mixed views on the usefulness of subspecialties for meeting their needs. Officials from some states said that physicians with subspecialties are not as desirable because they may not remain in the area to practice primary care. In fact, several states have policies to not request waivers for physicians who have subspecialties. On the other hand, officials at some facilities said that they recruited specific physicians, such as a nephrologist, because their subspecialties enabled them to meet the needs of their patient populations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Waivers Are Not Coordinated Effectively Across Participating Agencies and States", "paragraphs": ["Requests for waivers for physicians with J-1 visas are not coordinated effectively among the agencies and states or with other medical underservice programs, such as NHSC. No single entity is responsible for coordinating practice locations of waiver physicians and HHS, perhaps the most logical candidate for doing so, opposes the way in which the waivers are being used. Because no single entity is responsible for coordinating physicians\u2019 practice locations, the requesting agencies set up varying policies for requesting the waivers. Because of the lack of coordination, the number of waivers processed for physicians to practice in some states has been more than the amount needed to alleviate the identified physician shortage in that state."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No Agency Is Responsible for Managing Waivers to Address Physician Shortages", "paragraphs": ["No single agency has management responsibility for use of the waivers to address physician shortages.

USIA officials said that while they check for required documentation, they almost always rely on the interested government agencies\u2019 assertions that the waivers are in the public interest. INS officials said that refusal of the waiver is extremely rare if USIA has given a favorable recommendation. INS officials said that they are not in a position to second-guess USIA or the interested government agency as to whether the public interest would be served if the waiver was granted. \u201cwhen the application demonstrates that the exchange visitor is needed merely to provide services for a limited geographical area and/or to alleviate a local community or institutional manpower shortage, however serious.\u201d \u201cIn summary, this Department has viewed the J-1 visa to be a means of sharing advanced medical knowledge and allowing the benefits of training to accrue to the home country.

Policies vary with regard to such matters as eligible practice locations and state involvement and the consequences of the physician\u2019s failure to complete the agreed-upon length of service. For example, ARC restricts physicians to practice locations in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, while the physicians who received waivers through USDA and HUD have been allowed to practice in other areas, including designated Medically Underserved Areas. ARC officials said that they excluded the Medically Underserved Area designations because (1) this designation is not an accurate measure of physician shortage; (2) the designations have not been updated; and (3) including them would allow physicians to practice in virtually any location in Appalachia.Federal agency and state officials also said that and our review found cases where physicians or their immigration attorneys were shopping between agencies; that is, requesting waivers through multiple agencies at the same time.", "State health officials commented that they would like consistency in waiver policies across federal agencies.

By 1995, there were nearly 30 federal agencies and states processing requests for waivers for physicians with J-1 visas. Most of them were operating independent of one another.", "The four federal agencies have no formal process for coordinating their waiver requests and they have overlapping jurisdictions. For example, while USDA\u2019s policy has been to request waivers for rural areas and HUD\u2019s policy has been to request waivers for urban areas, the two agencies have not agreed on which areas are rural and which are urban. As a result, we found some locations, such as Buffalo, New York, and Decatur, Illinois, where USDA requested waivers for one or more physicians and HUD requested waivers for additional physicians to practice in the same city and in some cases the same facility. There is no mechanism for each federal agency to know how many waivers the other has requested to address the physician shortage in an area.", "Coordination is also lacking between state and federal efforts. State health officials do not always know where physicians receiving waivers through federal agencies are practicing and, therefore, they cannot coordinate these placements with state programs to address medical underservice. While ARC requires that facilities\u2019 requests for waivers come through the states, other agencies do not. This leads to situations where the states are unaware of the level of placements that are occurring. For example, health department officials in Texas, which does not request waivers for physicians under the state authority, did not know how many physicians received waivers through federal agencies to practice in the state. As a result, when we scheduled our visits to practice sites in Texas, state officials were surprised to find out that federal agency records showed over 20 waiver physicians practicing in El Paso.", "Waivers for physicians also are not well-coordinated with other programs addressing underservice, such as those operated by HHS. One such program is NHSC. When combined with NHSC physicians, federal agencies and states have requested waivers for more physicians than are needed to remove the shortage designations in some states. We found that for eight states, the number of physicians who received waivers in 1994 and 1995 (or had waivers in process), combined with the number of NHSC physicians in service at the end of 1995, exceeded the number of physicians needed to remove the shortage area designations in the state. (See app. VII for more information on the identified need, number of waivers being processed, and the number of NHSC physicians practicing in each state.) Without information on the number of physicians needed in the area and the number of NHSC and waiver physicians already addressing that need, federal agencies and states will not know if the needs of an area are already being met when considering whether or not to request a waiver for a physician.", "Another HHS program with which physician waivers are not well-coordinated is the Community Health Center program. This means that federal agencies and states may not know of problems identified by HHS when considering requests from community health centers. For example, waivers were requested through HUD for several physicians to practice at a health center that had its HHS funding discontinued due to financial management problems. When requesting the waivers for these physicians, HUD officials did not know that HHS had identified problems with the health center. As a result, they could not take those problems into consideration when deciding whether the waivers were in HUD\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest.", "Coordination between the agencies involved in the requests and other programs to address medical underservice is important, because not all the agencies processing the waiver requests have expertise in addressing health care issues. For example, USDA and HUD officials involved in the waiver requests said that their offices lacked expertise in health issues. In USDA, waivers for physicians are processed in the department\u2019s Agricultural Research Service by an office that has experience processing waiver requests for a small number of research scientists who were in the United States as exchange visitors.

We estimate that 90 percent completed the minimum employment period required by ARC, which was 2-years, for the facility that requested the waiver. On January 1, 1996, over one-fourth (28 percent) were still practicing at the same facility that requested the waiver and nearly half of these (13 percent) had been there for more than 4 years.", "We also examined the shorter-term compliance record of all physicians practicing on January 1, 1996, after receiving waivers through federal agencies between 1994 and 1995. We estimate that 96 percent of them were working at the facility for which the waiver was requested. The remaining 4 percent had left or did not plan to work at that facility. Although this percentage is similar to the percentage of ARC physicians who did not complete their 2-year agreements, the percentage may grow because many of the physicians had completed only a fraction of their employment contract by the start of 1996.

We found cases in which a facility made the request and then determined that the physician was no longer needed. In at least one case, it appears that the employer made this determination before the waiver was even granted, but the physician still received the waiver. Here are examples in which the facility changed its mind: In letters asking USDA to request waivers for three physicians, a clinic in Illinois said that the physicians were needed to help meet an urgent primary care delivery crises in the rural community where the practice site was located. Six months after one of the physicians began working there, she was terminated because the clinic had determined that it was overstaffed. She is now practicing in another city in Illinois that has an identified shortage of physicians who serve Medicaid patients. The second physician was transferred from the location on the waiver request to another location that is not in a federally designated shortage area. The third physician was practicing only part-time at the practice site for which the waiver was requested. He said that because there were not enough patients in that location, he spends about half his time working at the main clinic in Champaign, Illinois.", "A medical group asked HUD to request waivers for three physicians to work at a practice purchased from a retiring physician outside of Atlanta. When we called the practice site, we were told that only one of the three was practicing there. An official from the medical group said that the practice no longer had enough patients to support these physicians. As a result, one physician never worked at the site, one physician worked a brief period and then went to practice at a prison in Michigan, and one physician remained to work for the new employer after the practice was sold. INS officials said that waivers had been approved for all three physicians, including the one who was never employed there. Before we notified them, HUD officials were unaware that the facility had been sold and that two of the physicians were not practicing there.", "We also found instances in which the reason for not meeting the requirements of an agreement resulted from the physician\u2019s actions. For example, in two separate cases, physicians were fired when they refused to complete the requirement for working 40 hours a week at the requesting facility. In one instance, the fired physician notified USDA that he was going to practice at another hospital and when USDA officials told him he could not because the hospital was not in a shortage area, the physician broke off contact with them. The facility official said that he had heard that the physician was pursuing additional graduate medical education in the United States. In the second instance, the facility reported the physician\u2019s firing directly to INS, which revoked his nonimmigrant work status.", "Reviews conducted by ARC\u2019s Inspector General have disclosed similar instances in which conditions of agreements were not met. Six of eight reviews conducted by the Inspector General from 1994 to 1995 found that contrary to ARC policy, some physicians were not practicing primary care at least 40 hours per week in a Health Professional Shortage Area.

In an effort to ensure that the employers have a true need for a physician, ARC, USDA, and HUD policies, as well as the proposed USIA regulations, require the facilities to provide some documentation of past recruitment efforts. This procedure, however, does not ensure that the use of waivers for physicians is the option of last resort for areas with physician shortages. In some cases it appears that other qualified physicians are available, but the facility prefers to hire the physicians with J-1 visas. For example, officials from one multispecialty clinic told us that they interviewed several applicants for a specialist physician position, including candidates who were not under J-1 visas, but they chose the physician with a J-1 visa and obtained a waiver because he was the most qualified. The use of waivers is now a ready means for acquiring physicians, some of whom are being actively marketed by the physicians themselves or placement specialists such as recruiters.

USDA, for example, relies on employers to enforce the employment contracts, citing a lack of staff resources to conduct its own monitoring. However, as we and ARC\u2019s Inspector General found, many of the examples of physicians who failed to comply with agency policies resulted from actions taken by the employers. As a result, a reliance on employers to do the policing does not appear adequate to prevent the kinds of situations we found.

Under existing procedures, locating a waiver physician in a medical shortage area is no guarantee that the needs of the underserved will be addressed.

For example, if the underserved part of the population is low-income, the requesting agencies\u2019 and states\u2019 policies do not all require that a waiver physician in such an area accept Medicaid, have a sliding fee scale, or accept anyone for services regardless of his or her ability to pay. In one area where the identified need was care for migrant farm workers, a waiver physician was in a group practice a block away from a federally funded migrant health center. A senior official at the migrant health center said that the waiver physician did not impact the center\u2019s patient load because they both served different patient populations.", "Establishing penalties against a facility for failing to comply with agency policies. The new regulations and the 1996 amendments do not establish any penalties for employers who fail to comply.

The number of waiver requests for physicians to practice in underserved areas that the agencies sent to USIA in 1995 (1,374) is about 64 percent of this figure.

We used the number of full-time-equivalent physicians identified by HHS as needed to remove primary care Health Professional Shortage Area designations in the state on December 31, 1995, because it is the primary measurement used by HHS and the requesting agencies to establish the need for physicians. Although physicians with waivers may also practice in designated Medically Underserved Areas, HHS does not remove this designation and, as a result, there is no dedesignation level to measure the need for physicians in the Medically Underserved Area. To measure the number of waiver physicians who would be practicing on December 31, 1995, or shortly thereafter, we used data from the requesting agencies and states on the number of waiver applications sent to USIA from 1994 to 1995. For the number of NHSC physicians in a state, we used the number of NHSC scholarship and loan repayment recipients who were practicing on December 31, 1995. This is a conservative number of NHSC physicians; however, because it does not include the number of physicians who were NHSC state loan repayment recipients practicing in shortage areas, which was not available by state from NHSC at the time of our review.", "As shown in table VII.1, the degree to which the identified physician shortage can be offset by the waiver physicians practicing in a state varied between the states.
