Nine CFO Act agencies have been reported as noncompliant in one or more programs every year since the implementation of IPERA in fiscal year 2011, totaling 7 consecutive years of noncompliance.", "The IGs of the 14 noncompliant agencies reported that a total of 58 programs were responsible for the identified instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2017. Further, 18 of the 58 programs at 9 agencies were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. Fourteen of these 18 programs accounted for an estimated $74.4 billion of the $141 billion total estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2017; the other 4 programs did not report improper payment estimates. This sum may include estimates that are of unknown reliability. The $74.4 billion is primarily composed of estimates reported for two noncompliant programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicaid program and the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Earned Income Tax Credit program; estimated improper payments for these two programs are also a central part of certain high-risk areas in GAO's 2017 High-Risk List.", "Agencies with any program reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years are required to notify Congress of their program's consecutive noncompliance and submit a proposal for reauthorization or statutory change to bring that program into compliance. GAO found that three agencies with one or more programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, did not notify Congress or submit the required proposals. The Departments of Labor and the Treasury submitted proposed legislative changes in response to their programs being previously reported as noncompliant, but did not notify Congress of the programs' continued noncompliance as of fiscal year 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not notified Congress despite prior GAO and USDA IG recommendations to do so. To address these issues, in June 2018 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its guidance to clarify the notification requirements for each consecutive year a program is reported as noncompliant.", "GAO found that five agencies did notify Congress as required, and included additional quality information that is not specifically required, but could be useful in updating Congress on their compliance efforts. For example, all five agencies provided information on the root causes, risks, changes, or issues affecting their efforts and corrective actions or strategies to address them; three agencies provided other quality information on accountability mechanisms, designated senior officials, and measurable milestones.", "In June 2018, OMB updated its guidance to clarify agency reporting requirements for programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. However, the updated guidance does not direct agencies to include the types of quality information included in these five agencies' notifications for fiscal year 2016. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the importance of communicating quality information, such as significant matters affecting agencies' efforts to achieve compliance objectives. Such information could be useful in understanding the current challenges of these programs and is essential for assessing agency efforts to address high-risk and other issues. As a result, Congress could have more complete information to effectively oversee agency efforts to address program noncompliance for 3 or more consecutive years.", "When programs are reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, IPERA gives OMB authority to determine whether additional funding is needed to help resolve the noncompliance. In April 2018, OMB staff stated that they determined that no additional funding was needed for the 15 programs that were reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and that they primarily rely on the IGs' recommendations in their annual IPERA compliance reports when making funding determinations. OMB staff subsequently stated that they no longer need to conduct a detailed review of the IGs' IPERA compliance reports to identify recommendations related to additional funding needs. Instead, OMB updated its guidance in June 2018 to direct agencies to submit proposals to OMB regarding additional funding needs to help address IPERA noncompliance and clarified that the funding determination process will unfold as part of the annual development of the President's Budget. As of September 2018, OMB was in the process of making funding determinations for 12 programs that were reported as noncompliant as of fiscal year 2017 and stated that any determinations made would be developed in the President's Budget for fiscal year 2020."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB update its guidance to specify other types of quality information that agencies with programs noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years should include in their notifications to Congress, such as significant matters related to risks, issues, root causes, measurable milestones, designated senior officials, accountability mechanisms, and corrective actions or strategies planned or taken by agencies to achieve compliance.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to OMB and requested comments, and OMB said that it had no comments. GAO also provided a draft of this report to the 24 CFO Act agencies and their IGs and requested comments. In its written comments, the Social Security Administration (SSA) stated that it provided information on measurable milestones, designated senior officials, and accountability mechanisms in its agency financial report. However, SSA did not provide this information in its notifications to Congress for programs reported as noncompliant under IPERA as of fiscal year 2016. GAO believes that OMB should take steps to update OMB's guidance to help ensure that agencies report such significant information and include it in their notifications to Congress.

It is important to note that  these estimates themselves may not be accurate, reliable, or complete,  because, as we have reported, the federal government is unable to  determine the full extent to which improper payments occur and  reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken to reduce them.

In addition, we reviewed the content of  agencies\u2019 notifications to evaluate their efforts to communicate quality  information to Congress, consistent with Principle 15 of Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, which emphasizes the need  for an entity\u2019s management to externally communicate the necessary,  quality information\u2014such as significant matters related to risks, changes,  or issues concerning their strategies for achieving compliance.

The amended legislation  requires executive branch agencies to (1) review all programs and  activities and identify those that may be susceptible to significant  improper payments (commonly referred to as a risk assessment),   (2) publish improper payment estimates for those programs and activities  that the agency identified as being susceptible to significant improper  payments, (3) implement corrective actions to reduce improper payments  and set reduction targets, and (4) report on the results of addressing the  foregoing requirements.", "In addition to the agencies\u2019 identifying programs and activities that are  susceptible to significant improper payments, OMB designates as high  priority the programs with the most egregious cases of improper  payments. Specifically, under a provision added to IPIA by IPERIA, OMB  is required to annually identify a list of high-priority federal programs in  need of greater oversight and review. In general, for fiscal years 2014  through 2017, OMB implemented this requirement by designating high- priority programs based on a threshold of $750 million in estimated  improper payments for a given fiscal year. OMB also plays a key role in  implementing laws related to improper payment reporting. Specifically,  OMB is directed by statute to provide guidance to federal agencies on  estimating, reporting, reducing, and recovering improper payments.", "IPERA also requires executive agencies\u2019 IGs to annually determine and  report on whether their respective agencies complied with certain IPERA- related criteria. If an agency does not meet one or more of the six IPERA  criteria for any of its programs or activities, the agency is considered  noncompliant overall. The six criteria are as follows:  1.  publish a report in the form and content required by OMB\u2014typically  an agency financial report (AFR) or a performance and accountability  report (PAR)\u2014for the most recent fiscal year, and post that report on  the agency website;  2.  conduct a program-specific risk assessment, if required, for each  program or activity that conforms with IPIA as amended;  3.  publish improper payment estimates for all programs and activities  deemed susceptible to significant improper payments under the  agency\u2019s risk assessments;  4.  publish corrective action plans for those programs and activities  assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments;  5.  publish and meet annual reduction targets for all programs and  activities assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments; and  6.  report a gross improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for  each program and activity for which an improper payment estimate  was published.", "Under IPERA, agencies reported by their IG as not in compliance with  any of these criteria in a fiscal year are required to submit a plan to  Congress describing the actions they will take to come into compliance,  and such plans shall include measureable milestones, the designation of  senior accountable officials, and the establishment of accountability  mechanisms to achieve compliance. OMB guidance states that agencies  are required to submit these plans to Congress and OMB in the first year  of reported noncompliance.", "When agency programs are reported as noncompliant for consecutive  years, IPERA and OMB guidance requires agencies and OMB to take  additional actions. Specifically, an agency with a program reported as  noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years is required to submit to  Congress within 30 days of the IG\u2019s report either (1) a reauthorization  proposal for the program or (2) the proposed statutory changes  necessary to bring the program or activity into compliance. We  previously recommended that when agencies determine that  reauthorization or statutory changes are not necessary to bring the  programs into compliance, the agencies should state so in their  notifications to Congress. Effective starting with fiscal year 2018  reporting, OMB updated its guidance to instruct agencies with programs  reported as noncompliant for 3 consecutive years to explain what the  agency is doing to achieve compliance if a reauthorization proposal or  proposed statutory change will not bring a program into compliance with  IPERA. The updated guidance also instructs agencies with programs  reported as noncompliant for 4 or more consecutive years to submit a  report to Congress and OMB (within 30 days of the IG\u2019s determination of  noncompliance) detailing the activities taken and still being pursued to  prevent and reduce improper payments.", "If agency programs are reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 2  consecutive years, and the Director of OMB determines that additional  funding would help the agency come into compliance, the head of the  agency must obligate additional funding in the amount determined by the  Director to intensify compliance efforts. IPERA directs the agency to  exercise any reprogramming or transfer authority that the agency may  have to provide additional funding to meet the level determined by OMB  and, if necessary, submit a request to Congress for additional  reprogramming or transfer authority to meet the full level of funding  determined by OMB.

Further, Treasury stated that IRS has repeatedly requested authority  to correct such errors in subsequent fiscal year budgets, including its  fiscal year 2019 budget submission. In June 2018, Treasury staff  stated that the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided IRS  with additional tools for reducing EITC improper payments; however,  the act did not expand IRS\u2019s authority to systematically correct the  erroneous claims that are identified when tax returns are processed.", "Treasury staff also stated that the department has continued to  coordinate with OMB on required reporting for the EITC program  because of the program\u2019s complexity, and that OMB has not  requested additional actions or documentation regarding the  program\u2019s noncompliance.

All five agencies informed Congress of (1) root causes  that directly lead to improper payments or hindered the program\u2019s ability  to achieve compliance; (2) certain risks, significant changes, or issues  affecting their efforts; and (3) their corrective actions or strategies to  achieve compliance. Three of the five agencies\u2014DOD, Education, and  DHS\u2014also included the other types of additional information described  above in their notifications, including measurable milestones, designated  senior officials to oversee progress, and accountability mechanisms  established to help achieve compliance. For example, all three agencies  designated their chief financial officers (CFO) to oversee progress toward  achieving measurable milestones and expanded their official roles and  responsibilities to hold them accountable. Education and DHS stated that  these responsibilities were added to their respective CFOs\u2019 individual  performance plans.", "Although OMB updated its guidance in June 2018 to clarify agency  reporting requirements related to programs reported as noncompliant for  3 or more consecutive years, the updated guidance did not direct  agencies to include other types of quality information in their notifications,  such as those described above. In addition, information related to  measurable milestones, corrective actions, risks, issues, or other items  affecting agencies\u2019 efforts may change significantly over time. With this  additional information, Congress could have more complete information to  effectively oversee agency efforts to address long-standing challenges  and other issues that have contributed to programs being reported as  noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OMB Updated Guidance for Determining Additional Funding Needs for Programs Reported as Noncompliant for 2 Consecutive Years", "paragraphs": ["Fifteen programs in seven agencies and 12 programs in six agencies  were reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal years  2016 and 2017, respectively. For agencies reported as noncompliant  under IPERA for 2 consecutive years for the same program, IPERA gives  the Director of OMB the authority to determine whether additional funding  would help the agencies come into compliance. If the OMB Director  determines that such funding would help, the agency is required to use  any available reprogramming or transfer authority to meet the funding  level that the OMB Director specified and, if such authorities are not  sufficient, submit a request to Congress for additional reprogramming or  transfer authority. According to OMB staff, OMB determined that no  additional funding was needed for programs reported as noncompliant for  2 consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016. As of September 2018, OMB  was in the process of making funding determinations for 12 programs that  were reported as noncompliant as of fiscal year 2017 and stated that any  determinations made would be developed in the President\u2019s Budget for  fiscal year 2020.", "The 12 programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of  fiscal year 2017, accounted for approximately $3 billion (2 percent) of the  $141 billion total improper payment estimate for that year. Of these 12  programs, more than half (or 7 of the 12) were attributable to DOD;  however, Education\u2019s Pell Grant program accounted for $2.2 billion (or 74  percent) of the $3 billion in improper payment estimates for programs  reported as noncompliant programs for 2 consecutive years, for fiscal  year 2017. In addition, as shown in table 4, the 12 programs reported as  noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2017, were  primarily noncompliant with the IPERA criteria that required agencies to  publish information in their PAR or AFR or publish and meet reduction  targets.", "As noted previously, IPERA gives OMB authority to determine whether  additional funding for intensified compliance efforts would help the agency  come into compliance under IPERA. Therefore, an established process  for making timely, well-informed funding determinations is an essential  part of ensuring that agencies have sufficient resources and take steps to  intensify their compliance efforts in a timely manner. In April 2018, OMB  staff stated that when making funding determinations, they primarily rely  on the IGs\u2019 recommendations in their annual IPERA compliance reports.  OMB staff also stated that for its fiscal year 2016 determinations, OMB  determined that additional funding was not needed because the IGs\u2019  recommendations did not specify that additional funding was needed to  help resolve the programs\u2019 noncompliance.", "The IGs\u2019 annual reports provide information on agencies\u2019 IPERA  compliance and may be useful to OMB as a tool to help them make  determinations for additional funding. However, IPERA does not require  IGs to address funding levels in their annual compliance reports, and  OMB\u2019s guidance does not inform the IGs that their work might be relied  upon in this manner. We reviewed the IGs\u2019 fiscal years 2016 and 2017  IPERA compliance reports for the agencies with programs reported as  noncompliant for 2 consecutive years and found that the IGs did not make  any recommendations regarding additional funding needed to bring these  programs into compliance. In addition, as specifically stated by the IGs for  Education and USDA in their IPERA reports, OMB has the statutory  responsibility to make these funding determinations. Education IG\u2019s fiscal  year 2017 IPERA compliance report stated that \u201cIf OMB recommends that  the Department needs additional funding or should take any other actions  to become compliant with IPERA, we recommend that the Department  implement OMB\u2019s recommendations.\u201d Also, the USDA IG\u2019s fiscal year  2016 IPERA compliance report stated, \u201cFor agencies that are not  compliant for 2 consecutive years for the same program, the Director of  OMB will determine if additional funding would help these programs come  into compliance.\u201d As a result, OMB\u2019s reliance on IG recommendations as  the source of information to support additional funding determinations  may not provide sufficient information to effectively assess agencies\u2019  funding needs to address noncompliance.", "OMB staff subsequently stated that they no longer need to conduct a  detailed review of the IGs\u2019 IPERA compliance reports to identify  recommendations related to additional funding needs. Instead, OMB  Memorandum M-18-20, issued in June 2018, updated OMB Circular No.  A-123, Appendix C, and clarified that the funding determination process  will unfold as part of the annual development of the President\u2019s Budget,  as described in OMB Circular No. A-11. This updated guidance also  directs agencies to submit proposals to OMB regarding additional funding  needs that may help them address IPERA noncompliance.", "To illustrate, under this new guidance, the IGs\u2019 fiscal year 2018 IPERA  compliance reports will be due in May 2019, and any funding needs to  address noncompliance would be incorporated in the next annual budget  preparation process, the results of which are due to be submitted to  Congress in February 2020 for the President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year  2021. Once OMB\u2019s determinations have been made and communicated  to agencies, agencies would respond by performing the required  reprogramming and making transfers under existing authority, where  available. Any requests for additional transfer authority may be  incorporated into subsequent appropriations legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Estimated improper payments reported government-wide total almost  $1.4 trillion from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2017.

The extent to which the 24 agencies listed in the Chief Financial  Officers Act of 1990, as amended (CFO Act), complied with the six  criteria listed in the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act  of 2010 (IPERA), for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and the trends  evident since 2011, as reported by their inspectors general (IG).  2.  The extent to which CFO Act agencies addressed requirements for  programs and activities reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria  for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and  communicated their strategies to Congress for reducing improper  payments and achieving compliance.  3.  The extent to which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  made determinations regarding whether additional funding would help  CFO Act programs and activities reported as noncompliant with  IPERA criteria for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal years 2016 and  2017, come into compliance.", "Although the responsibility for complying with provisions of improper  payment-related statutes rests with the head of each executive agency,  we focused on the 24 agencies listed in the CFO Act because estimates  of their improper payments represent over 99 percent of the total reported  estimated improper payments for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Our work  did not include validating or retesting the data or methodologies that the  IGs used to determine and report compliance. We corroborated all of our  findings with OMB and all 24 CFO Act agencies and IGs.", "To address our first objective, we identified the requirements that  agencies must meet by reviewing the Improper Payments Information Act  of 2002 (IPIA), IPERA, and OMB guidance. We reviewed the CFO Act  agency IGs\u2019 IPERA compliance reports for fiscal years 2016 and 2017,  which were the most current reports available at the time of our review.", "We summarized the overall agency and program-specific compliance  determinations with the six IPERA criteria, as reported by the IGs. For  fiscal years 2011 through 2015, we relied on and reviewed prior year  supporting documentation and analyses of CFO Act agencies\u2019 IPERA  compliance, as reported in our prior reports, in order to identify  compliance trends since 2011, as reported by the IGs. Based on these  reports, we summarized the programs and the number of consecutive  years that they were reported as noncompliant. For each IG report that  did not specifically state that the agency had programs noncompliant for  consecutive years, we compared the list of programs reported as  noncompliant for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to the list of programs  reported as noncompliant for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 in our prior  reports. Lastly, we corroborated our findings with OMB and all 24 CFO  Act agencies and IGs.", "To address our second objective, we determined if the agencies  responsible for programs and activities reported as noncompliant for 3 or  more consecutive years as of fiscal year 2016 had submitted the required  proposals (reauthorizations or statutory changes) to Congress by  requesting and reviewing documentation of the required submissions and  relevant notifications to Congress obtained from each applicable agency.  Further, we reviewed the content of each agency notification to evaluate  agencies\u2019 efforts to communicate quality information to Congress  concerning their strategies for achieving compliance consistent with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Principle 15 of  these standards emphasizes the need for an entity\u2019s management to  communicate necessary quality information, such as significant matters  related to risks, changes, or issues affecting agencies\u2019 efforts, to achieve  compliance objectives, to external parties\u2014such as legislators, oversight  bodies, and the general public. To identify other types of information  useful for this purpose, we reviewed IPIA, as amended; IPERA; and OMB  guidance for information agencies are required to provide to Congress or  OMB in other notifications and reports, such as their corrective action  plans or strategies, measurable milestones, designated senior officials,  and accountability mechanisms for achieving compliance. We also  reviewed information used to assess agency efforts to address issues  associated with programs on our High-Risk List.", "To determine the extent to which agencies\u2019 notifications to Congress  included these additional types of useful information for their applicable  program(s), we used a data collection instrument to document our  determinations regarding the additional types of quality information  included in each notification.

Differences between the analysts\u2019 determinations were identified and  resolved to ensure that the types of additional information were  consistently identified and categorized.

Lastly,  we corroborated our findings with the respective agencies and IGs.", "To address our third objective, we identified provisions in IPIA, IPERA,  and OMB guidance that are applicable to OMB for programs reported as  noncompliant for 2 consecutive years. To determine if OMB made  additional funding determinations for agency programs and activities  reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years as of fiscal years 2016  and 2017, we requested relevant information and communications from  OMB and the applicable agencies and IGs. We also interviewed key OMB  staff on their process for determining additional funding needs for  noncompliant programs and activities as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017  and related results. In addition, we reviewed the applicable fiscal years  2016 and 2017 CFO Act agency IG IPERA compliance reports, which  OMB staff stated they relied on for determining whether noncompliant  programs and activities required additional funding.
