Second quarter of calendar year 2019 data was the most recent data at  the time of our analysis.

NASA continues to assess a SpaceX risk  related to the design of its launch vehicle engines, which has  previously resulted in the turbine wheel cracking. To mitigate the  turbine cracking risk, SpaceX conducted additional qualification  testing and developed an operational strategy that resulted in no  cracks. Consequently, the program accepted this risk for SpaceX\u2019s  uncrewed test flight but levied a constraint on the crewed test flight.  Specifically, SpaceX has agreed to conduct a follow-on test campaign  of the engines to demonstrate that it meets NASA\u2019s standards in order  to launch its crewed test flight.

As shown in Table 2, the  program is near completion of phase two reviews and phase three  reviews are in progress.", "Program officials told us that they have started work on many of the  phase three safety reviews, but the data only reflect their efforts once  they complete a phased safety report in its entirety. Any additional delays  to complete this process, however, would delay the crewed test flights  and create uncertainty about when NASA will certify the contractors to  begin operational flights.", "Verification Closure Notices. NASA has made progress verifying that  the contractors have met ISS and Commercial Crew Program  requirements, but much work remains. When a contractor is ready for  NASA to verify that it has met a requirement, such as that the contractor\u2019s  system can detect and alert the crew to critical faults that could result in a  catastrophic event, the contractor submits data for NASA to review  through a verification closure notice. Table 3 shows the agency\u2019s  progress approving verification closure notices for each contractor.", "Program officials told us that, because the contract solicitation did not  require an uncrewed test flight, they had not previously determined the  minimum number of Commercial Crew Program requirements that the  contractors should meet prior to an uncrewed test flight. Subsequently,  both contractors included an uncrewed test flight as part of their  schedules. As these test flights approached, NASA determined that it  must verify that the contractors met approximately 20 percent of the  program\u2019s requirements before the contractors\u2019 uncrewed test flight and  the remaining 80 percent before the contractors\u2019 crewed test flights. The  program made this determination based on ensuring the contractors met  requirements related to the spacecraft safely approaching and docking to  the ISS; ensuring the safety of the ISS and its crew; and meeting any  mission-specific requirements for cargo.", "Both contractors originally planned for the program to verify they had met  more than 20 percent of the Commercial Crew Program requirements  before the uncrewed test flight but have subsequently changed their  plans. For both contractors, the program is allowing the contractors to  submit more verification closure notices between the uncrewed and  crewed test flight than initially envisioned. Program officials told us that  contractors proposed deferring the submission of verification closure  notices because they were having difficulties meeting the original targets.  Figure 4 includes SpaceX and Boeing\u2019s original and current plans for  verification of requirements compared to the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s  minimum level of requirements it determined was necessary for the  uncrewed test flight. As reflected in the figure, these new plans, which  defer submission of work to the crewed test flight, may compound the  program\u2019s bow wave of work and create uncertainty about the timing of  certification.", "Further, the Commercial Crew Program will need to reassess a subset of  requirements closed for the uncrewed test flight prior to the crewed test  flight. For example, of the 78 requirements Boeing plans to close prior to  the uncrewed test flight, the program will re-assess 16; for SpaceX\u2019s 49  requirements, the program will re-assess 32. Program officials told us that  some of this work is expected based on known changes to the  contractors\u2019 systems between the uncrewed and crewed test flight. For  example, officials told us that they approved a verification closure notice  for SpaceX\u2019s air conditioning system in order to support the uncrewed test  flight, but they know that they will need to re-assess it because SpaceX is  making changes before its crewed test flight. While these types of  changes and those that are identified through testing are not uncommon,  they further add to the program\u2019s workload and create uncertainty about  the timing of certification.", "Among the requirements that must be closed before the crewed test flight  is loss of crew, which is a metric that captures the probability of death or  permanent disability to one or more crew members. According to program  risk charts, the program\u2019s top safety risk continues to be that neither  contractor will meet the contractual requirement of a 1 in 270 probability  of incurring loss of crew. We previously found that NASA lacked a  consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew and recommended  that key parties, including the program manager, collectively determine  and document how the agency will determine its risk tolerance level prior  to certifying either contractor. NASA partially concurred with that  recommendation, stating that, if neither contractor can meet the loss of  crew requirement, the program will request a waiver through the human  rating certification process to ensure transparency. As of March 2019,  NASA officials told us they have not taken steps to address this  recommendation. Officials told us that the Commercial Crew Program is  currently reviewing Boeing\u2019s loss of crew verification closure notice and  SpaceX\u2019s draft verification closure notice in order to verify if the  contractors have met the loss of crew requirement.", "According to program officials, one of the biggest challenges for the  program is balancing its workload to support the two contractors, but  officials are making an effort to review each contractor\u2019s data products as  they are submitted. For example, program officials told us that they were  able to review SpaceX submissions during the summer of 2018, while  Boeing\u2019s submissions slowed as it focused on addressing the test  anomaly with its launch abort engines. However, based on current  schedules, the program must complete its reviews of certification  paperwork while supporting uncrewed, crewed, and abort system test  flights for both contractors before the end of 2019. Both contractors said  they have concerns about NASA\u2019s ability to maintain its pace of  processing paperwork in order to support the contractors\u2019 planned test  flights and certification dates.
