Broadband project sponsors in those areas included municipalities, non-traditional private providers, consortiums of sponsors in a region, and cooperatives. In making broadband deployment decisions, project sponsors said they considered diverse factors related to their ability to fund successful projects, such as the (1) likelihood of near-term service upgrades by incumbent providers, (2) potential demand for new services, (3) potential broadband technologies, and (4) existing infrastructure and potential local assistance available to providers. For financing approaches, some project sponsors used local private and public funds while others leveraged federal funds. In addition, project sponsors used a variety of ownership structures that ranged from public ownership to local private investors.", "Stakeholders and project sponsors GAO contacted cited economic, legal, and policy concerns in deploying broadband in unserved and underserved areas. For example, regarding funding, stakeholders said that remote areas generally face high broadband deployment costs due to the expense of deploying technologies over long distances or difficult terrain and that often the return on investment is low since there are relatively few potential subscribers in those areas. Project sponsors and industry experts noted legal concerns, including concerns with laws in some states that limit or ban companies that are not telecommunications companies from deploying broadband due to concerns about unfair competition. For example, in Louisiana, a city official GAO contacted said state laws bar any municipality from deploying broadband directly to consumers, so the city is planning to build and own a fiber-optic network, but to comply with the state law, will not offer retail service. Stakeholders also noted several policy concerns, including concerns over the accuracy of federal broadband-mapping efforts and whether the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) broadband-speed benchmark is set high enough. While there may be valuable lessons in the examples profiled in our case studies, their limited number does not allow us to generalize findings to the broader universe of all entities seeking to deploy broadband networks.", "FCC has several efforts under way to increase broadband deployment in unserved areas, efforts that help address the economic and policy concerns raised by stakeholders. FCC established the Connect America Fund in November 2011 to support voice and broadband access in areas where no private business case exists to provide broadband\u2014one of the key challenges these areas face in deploying broadband. Additionally, in January 2014, FCC adopted an order in which it stated that it will solicit proposals from non-traditional providers, including utilities and municipalities, to deploy broadband technologies in rural, high-cost areas. Through this effort, FCC plans to explore broadband policy issues and gather information on viable business models for deploying fiber-optic or next-generation wired technology in rural areas.

In  2011, FCC adopted this 4 Mbps/1Mbps benchmark for broadband  projects to be eligible to receive universal service support. The federal  benchmark allows for such Internet applications as accessing websites,  emailing with attachments like pictures, and simple video conferencing,  but does not support some of the newer Internet applications that require  faster speeds to use, as shown in figure 1. For example, applications  such as distance learning, telecommuting, and telemedicine, which can  involve transmitting large amounts of data and images in real-time,  cannot perform acceptably at the federal benchmark speed of 4  Mbps/1Mbps.", "Unserved and underserved areas tend to have conditions that increase  the cost of constructing and maintaining broadband networks. These  conditions include low populations who might also be widely dispersed  and in remote areas that might have challenging terrain, such as  mountains, that increase construction costs. The choice of broadband  technology and the ability to use or extend existing infrastructure also  affects the costs of constructing and maintaining broadband networks.

As noted above, remote areas generally have high costs to deploy  broadband due to the expense of deploying technologies over long  distances and potentially difficult terrain to often relatively few potential  subscribers. For these reasons, stakeholders told us that being able to  cover costs with potential revenues and thus make a return on investment  is a key issue to deploying broadband in unserved and underserved  areas. Stakeholders told us that deployment costs can be reduced if there  is easier access to rights-of-way, public facilities, and conduits already  underground. For example, the opportunity to install cellular antennas on  public water towers or thread fiber into existing conduit can reduce  construction costs while leveraging public infrastructure. Stakeholders  also told us that the costs of financing projects affect the projects\u2019 overall  costs. Project sponsors that could use public-financing, such as municipal  bonds, had lower capital costs than private companies and thus could  more cheaply finance their projects. Project sponsors that could use  revenues from existing services, such as electricity subscribers, had  funds available to deploy broadband which allowed them to leverage  financing.", "Project sponsors noted that the projects receiving federal funds were able  to reduce their own costs of the project and obtain better financing terms  due to the federal subsidy. However, project sponsors we contacted told  us they are challenged by a lack of clear information about which federal  funds are available for broadband deployment, which entities can make  use of the funds, and how to apply for them. One sponsor from a small  town said his staff lacked the expertise necessary to meet reporting  requirements tied to using federal funds and his department did not have  the financial resources available to hire consultants to assist. Another  sponsor in a rural area said paying for telecommunications-engineering  consultants to estimate construction and operating costs was the main  challenge the project faced, because without such estimates, the project  could not apply for federal funds. We found some trade associations  provided educational materials about federal broadband programs, but  such associations typically only provided information or resources to their  members. We also found the mission of some trade and industry groups  steered them to advocate for a particular technology, rather than offering  neutral advice on technological alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal", "paragraphs": ["Project sponsors and industry experts we contacted told us that some  states have laws that limit or ban companies that are not  telecommunications companies from deploying broadband, on the basis  that it creates unfair competition. As a result, project sponsors told us  they considered their state\u2019s legal environment when considering  alternate broadband service options. For example, in Vidalia, Louisiana,  an official told us that state laws bar any municipality from deploying  broadband directly to consumers, so the city is planning to build and own  a new fiber-optic network, but will not offer retail service in order to  comply with the law and avoid competing with incumbent cable and  telephone companies. Instead, a Vidalia official said they will seek to  improve broadband service options by offering independent service  providers the opportunity to provide Internet, telephone, and video  services over the network to the town\u2019s approximately 4,000 residents.  According to one legal expert who works with states that we contacted, as  of May 2013, 20 states had in place restrictions on community broadband  services or other public communications initiatives. Some of the project  sponsors we interviewed said that they had been affected by such laws.  For instance, some, but not all, existing public providers in North Carolina  are partially exempt from such requirements and can offer broadband  service. We spoke to officials from one such provider, the city of Wilson,  who said that they built their fiber-optic network before the state law that  limits municipalities providing broadband service and were granted an  exemption to operate the network which serves 6,000 accounts.  However, the officials said they are not permitted to expand the network  or otherwise provide telecommunications services outside the county due  to the state\u2019s requirements, which limit their ability to bring broadband  service to unserved and underserved areas in the region. While California  public entities are generally allowed to provide communications services,  Community Service Districts have the authority to provide  communications services only as long as no private person or entity is  willing to do so. However, if such a private-sector operator emerges, the  Community Service District must sell or lease its communications system  to that person at \u201cfair market value,\u201d which could be below cost. An official  from Lit San Leandro, a private California alternative provider, said two  companies were formed as protection against incumbent provider  lawsuits, which he said have been directed at some California  municipalities for allegedly gaining unfair advantage by using city-owned  conduit to compete against a private entity. A cable broadband provider  told us that cable companies generally will not invest in broadband  deployment in municipal areas that are already receiving public  deployment funds because the public funds amount to subsidized  broadband service, against which it is difficult for private companies to  compete. According to the National Broadband Plan, Congress should  make clear that state, regional, and local governments have the right to  build broadband networks in the absence of private investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we contacted, including project sponsors and industry  participants, noted that there are several policy issues that affect  broadband deployments in unserved and underserved areas. First,  stakeholders expressed concern that an area\u2019s inaccurate designation on  the National Broadband Map can have financial consequences when the  map deems an area as served even if not all premises in the area have  access to broadband service. For example, an official from an industry  group told us accurate mapping is important because without it, areas  that are served only by dial-up service can be ruled ineligible for federal  broadband deployment funds. In one case, the official said the National  Broadband Map shows the top half of an Indiana county as covered by  broadband service and the bottom half as not covered, but in reality the  entire county only has access to dial-up service (which is not considered  broadband). Stakeholders stated that it could be difficult to obtain funding  for broadband projects if the entire area is deemed served, so the  accuracy of the National Broadband Map is very important. The data on  the National Broadband Map is displayed at the census block level and if  one house or building has broadband access, the entire census block is  deemed served. Stakeholders told us that this is an issue particularly for  remote areas that are part of large census blocks and have premises  located long distances from one another and from existing broadband  networks.", "Second, project sponsors told us that while they are required to meet the  federal benchmark of 4 Mbps download/1 Mbps upload when applying for  some types of federal funding, this benchmark generally does not allow  for the use of advanced Internet applications such as video conferencing  for online education and telemedicine, which project sponsors said their  communities would like to have. Stakeholders told us that often  universities and hospitals are located far from rural communities and  therefore the ability to use online education and telemedicine could  reduce the need to drive long distances to get a higher education or see a  medical specialist. However, stakeholders stated it was difficult to garner  political support and funding for broadband technology projects that  provide the higher speeds needed for these advanced applications when  the areas have been designated as served by the National Broadband  Map. Moreover, stakeholders told us that federal universal service funds  were provided to projects that met the federal benchmark although  communities wanted projects that provided higher speeds. Stakeholders  told us that federal funds could be more effectively used by granting funds  to projects that provided the highest broadband speeds rather than to  projects providing the federal benchmark. On the other hand, officials  from a cable association told us municipal projects in particular result in a  mismatch between demand for service and the costs of providing that  service, because they tend to deploy the most advanced technology\u2014 fiber-optic\u2014to the most remote areas with the least demand.", "Third, stakeholders representing cable and telecommunications  companies stated that they have policy concerns related to public funds\u2014 both federal and local\u2014being used in areas in which there was an  existing broadband provider. A trade association representing cable  companies noted that federal funds such as Recovery Act grants have  been used in areas already served by private broadband providers, such  as cable companies, which built their networks with no public funds. The  stakeholders representing cable and telecommunications companies  stated that municipalities have used local public funds such as tax  revenues to back municipal bonds in areas already served by private  broadband providers. A trade association representing cable companies  and an industry group representing small-community telephone  companies told us that they believe that using public financing to  \u201coverbuild\u201d in already served areas is unfair competition in that the private  broadband provider has built its network with private capital and does not  have the same financial advantages as the municipality. For example, an  official from an industry group representing small community telephone  companies told us that rather than overbuilding, municipalities should  work with telephone companies to upgrade existing broadband  infrastructure. The official said municipalities should not be in the  business of providing broadband services themselves and, as evidence,  cited bankruptcies and judicial opinions involving municipal networks in  cities such as Provo, Utah, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In addition,  we heard from incumbent service providers that project sponsors that are  public entities, such as municipalities, can use their existing infrastructure,  property, and facilities to install broadband technologies which can reduce  their deployment costs\u2014an advantage that private companies do not  have.

As of  March 2014, FCC had authorized the Universal Service Administrative  Company (USAC) to distribute almost $438 million from the Connect  America Fund for projects that, according to FCC, would reach an  estimated 637,000 households and businesses by 2016. As a condition  of receiving funds, FCC requires an eligible telecommunications carrier  (ETC) to offer voice and broadband services in its supported service area,  meet certain broadband performance requirements, and report regularly  on associated broadband performance measures. Many project  sponsors we contacted said they would like the opportunity to receive  support from the Connect America Fund to deploy broadband in unserved  and underserved areas, but since they do not have the ETC designation,  they are not eligible to receive funding. FCC told us that any entity,  including cooperatives and municipalities that meet the requirements for  becoming an ETC under Section 214 of the Communications Act, can   However, project sponsors told us they  petition for ETC designation.believe they are ineligible to become an ETC because they do not provide  the type of phone service that would make them eligible.

FCC plans to also gather information on the  conditions under which consumers would prefer next-generation wireless  services instead of wireline services.

To select the 21 case studies, we analyzed the results of our literature  search and stakeholder interviews to assemble a list of potential  broadband network projects in unserved and underserved areas and  assigned each to one of four categories of networks established by:  municipalities, private companies, regional consortiums, and  cooperatives. The potential projects included some networks that were  planned but did not come to fruition for various reasons. From these, we  selected 21 case studies that represented all four project types and that  included public, private, or a mixture of both types of funding. We sought  geographic variety by assigning the cases to six U.S. regions: Midwest,  Northeast, Northwest, South, West, and Mid-Atlantic, and as we selected  cases, we included ones from each region. While there may be valuable  lessons in the examples profiled in our case studies, their limited number  does not allow us to generalize findings to the broader universe of all  entities seeking to deploy broadband networks. The information we  present on the deployment alternatives that have been used in our 21  case studies represents information provided by project sponsors. It was  beyond the scope of our work to assess the reliability of this  information. It was also beyond the scope of our work to determine  whether all, or any, of the examples deployed, or not deployed, are the  most effective models for broadband network deployment to unserved  and underserved areas.", "To assess what existing broadband speeds and technologies were  available in the case study areas and to compare them to those offered  by our case study projects, we took a sample of 6 of our 21 case studies  and collected data from those areas from the National Broadband Map,  which measures national access to broadband as of December 2012, and  depicts available broadband technologies and maximum advertised  speeds that are available in the United States. Our sample included  projects from three municipalities and one each from the private  company, regional consortiums, and cooperative categories. Because the  National Broadband Map was designed to provide data for one address  or one town, and 14 of our 21 networks operated regionally, covering  multiple towns, we did not try to determine broadband speeds for all 21 of  our case study locations. Instead, we took a sample of the case study  networks. To choose the sample, we considered the 7 networks (4  municipals out of 6, and 3 private companies out of 4) that operated in  discrete locations, and chose 4 of those: 3 municipals and one private  company. We chose a higher number of municipal networks because  there were 6 in our case study sample, versus 4 private companies.  Because we wanted to include examples of all 4 network types, we also  chose one regional consortium network and one cooperative network.  Even though all the networks from these two categories were regional in  nature, and served large areas with multiple towns, we searched for and  found one from each category that served a smaller population for a  discrete area that was appropriate to enter into the National Broadband  Map. For that reason, we included New Hampshire FastRoads, a regional  network that directly serves customers with broadband in two New  Hampshire towns, and Co-Mo Comm, a cooperative that serves  customers in two Missouri towns as part of a broadband pilot project.", "To gather information on stakeholders\u2019 views on economic, legal, and  other issues they believe affected their ability to deploy a network, we  interviewed project sponsors where projects were deployed or attempted  and associations representing consumers and industry.
