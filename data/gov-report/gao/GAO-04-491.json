Twenty-five states charged cost sharing for some portion of children in SCHIP, compared to 6 states for Medicaid. States used copayments as the primary form of cost sharing for children. Most states that reported charging cost sharing applied copayment requirements to the six health care services. Most states reported requiring beneficiary contributions from adults enrolled in Medicaid. Twenty-five states charged premiums, generally charging portions of certain populations, such as adults with disabilities. Over 40 states charged cost sharing to most, if not all, adults, including those with disabilities, noninstitutionalized elderly persons, and parents. Copayments were the predominate form of cost sharing. States most frequently reported copayments for prescription drugs and physician services. From the beginning of their 2001 state fiscal years through August 1, 2003, 34 states reported increasing and 10 states reported decreasing the amount of beneficiary contributions required in Medicaid, SCHIP, or both. For the 33 states that provided information on the amount of increases, premium increases to existing requirements ranged from $2 a month to $39 a month. Other states added new premium requirements, some of which were as much as several hundred dollars a month. In most instances, reported copayment increases were generally limited to $5 or less.

Medicaid generally  covers low-income families and individuals who are aged or disabled,  while SCHIP provides health care coverage to children in families whose  incomes, while low, are above Medicaid\u2019s eligibility requirements. Health  insurance often includes beneficiary contribution requirements of some  type, which require the insured individual to pay some portion of medical  expenses. The most common types of beneficiary contribution  requirements are premiums\u2014a payment required for insurance coverage  for a given period of time\u2014and cost sharing\u2014an out-of-pocket payment  for part of the cost of services used by a beneficiary. Medicaid and SCHIP  limit the use of beneficiary contribution requirements. The Medicaid  statute limits the amount of the premiums that can be charged and  prohibits states from instituting cost sharing provisions for certain  categories of individuals, such as children under age 18 and pregnant  women. Under SCHIP, federal law caps the amount of beneficiary  contributions that can be charged for certain children and exempts  preventive services for certain children from any cost sharing. States must  seek authority from the federal government to waive these requirements to  implement beneficiary contributions beyond Medicaid and SCHIP limits.", "Opinions differ over the extent to which beneficiary contributions are  appropriate and useful tools for managing health care utilization among  low-income populations.  Premiums are sometimes viewed as promoting  personal responsibility by having the beneficiary participate in the cost of  coverage.  Proponents of cost sharing believe that copayments can make  individuals more price-conscious consumers of health care services, which  may reduce the use of unnecessary services.  Others believe that cost  sharing requirements may limit service use, such as physician visits,  causing individuals to defer necessary treatment, resulting in more severe  conditions and potentially higher expenses. Concerns have been  expressed that, as states seek to increase the use of beneficiary  contributions for Medicaid, SCHIP, or both programs, eligible individuals  may reduce their program participation or use of services.", "You asked us to (1) identify and compare states\u2019 Medicaid and SCHIP  beneficiary contribution requirements for children, (2) identify states\u2019  Medicaid beneficiary contribution requirements for adults, and (3)  determine the extent to which states\u2019 Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiary  contribution requirements have changed since 2001.", "To identify the beneficiary contribution requirements in states\u2019 Medicaid  and SCHIP programs, we surveyed offices of each program in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia.

We divided these categories into two  groups\u2014children and adults. For SCHIP, states were asked to report on  requirements for children, children with special needs, and any other  populations defined by the state. For each population group covered, such  as children or individuals in nursing homes, the state was asked to indicate  the portion of the group charged each of the four types of beneficiary  contributions (premiums, copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles) by  selecting \u201call,\u201d \u201cmost,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d or \u201cnone.\u201d States were also asked to  indicate if their Medicaid or SCHIP program did not cover a specific  population.

In addition to their survey responses, states submitted  documentation of the amounts of their beneficiary contribution  requirements. We corroborated survey responses with documentation  provided by states and other available data on states\u2019 Medicaid and SCHIP  programs.

Under  section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human  Services has broad authority to approve demonstration projects that he  determines are likely to promote Medicaid objectives. The Secretary may  waive certain provisions of the statute if the Secretary finds it necessary  for the performance of the experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects.  Section 1115 waivers have been used to provide coverage to individuals  not normally eligible for Medicaid\u2014or to expand coverage to those who  are eligible under Medicaid but are not included in the scope of the state\u2019s  plan. Beneficiary contribution requirements for individuals who become  eligible for Medicaid through an 1115 waiver may be approved at the  Secretary\u2019s discretion, subject to some limitations. CMS reviews states\u2019  proposed beneficiary contribution requirements for 1115 waivers as part  of the waiver approval process and specifies any terms and conditions that  a state must adhere to as a condition of the waiver approval.", "According to CMS, because the provisions of Medicaid law related to  limitations on beneficiary contributions are applicable only to persons  eligible under the state plan, specific waivers of the beneficiary  contribution provisions are not always necessary. Waivers are necessary  when states want to charge premiums or cost sharing amounts that are  generally prohibited under federal law for individuals who are already  covered under the state\u2019s plan.

For these  populations, states are permitted to end coverage for beneficiaries who  fail to pay premiums or deny services to those who fail to pay cost sharing.  As of February 2004, of the 22 states with statewide 1115 waivers, 21 states  covered populations in their Medicaid program for which the Medicaid  statutory provisions regarding limits on beneficiary contributions are not  applicable.", "In 1997, Congress established SCHIP, which provides health care coverage  to low-income, uninsured children living in families whose incomes  exceed the states\u2019 eligibility limits for Medicaid. SCHIP covered over 5.8  million children during fiscal year 2003, and federal and state  expenditures were approximately $6.1 billion. States have three options in  designing SCHIP\u2014expand their Medicaid program, develop a separate  child health program that functions independently of Medicaid, or  combine these two approaches.", "The approach that a state chooses affects its beneficiary contribution  policies. A state that uses its SCHIP allocation to expand Medicaid must  follow Medicaid rules\u2014thus SCHIP beneficiaries are subject to the state\u2019s  Medicaid policies with regard to premiums and cost sharing. For a state  with a separate SCHIP program, federal law limits the premium and cost  sharing amounts it may charge. States with a separate SCHIP program are  prohibited from requiring premium or cost sharing contributions together  totaling more than 5 percent of family income. States with separate  SCHIP programs are also prohibited from charging any cost sharing on  preventive services. In addition, for children in families with income at or  below 150 percent of the FPL, there are specific limits on the amounts of  premiums and cost sharing that states may charge in a separate SCHIP  program (see table 4). For these individuals, federal regulation also  prohibits states from requiring more than one type of cost sharing charge  on each service. Additionally, regardless of family income or a state\u2019s  SCHIP design, states are prohibited from charging premiums or cost  sharing to American Indians or Alaska Natives.", "Similar to Medicaid, to require premiums or cost sharing in SCHIP beyond  what is permissible under federal law, states must seek waivers from the  Secretary of Health and Human Services. In establishing SCHIP, Congress  extended the applicability of section 1115 of the Social Security Act to  SCHIP \u201cin the same manner\u201d as it applies to states under Medicaid.  According to CMS, six states with SCHIP programs that are Medicaid  expansions have received section 1115 waivers to require beneficiary  contributions that would be allowable in a separate SCHIP program.
