GAO found that USAID missions completed detailed fiduciary risk assessments for G2G assistance activities when required but did not always include mitigation steps in planning documents, in part, because risk assessments were often done after planning had been completed. Also, project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plans often did not incorporate steps USAID and partner governments agreed to take to mitigate risks and build capacity.", "Implementation: In this phase, USAID implements G2G activities according to the terms and conditions established in assistance agreements with partner governments. USAID missions usually selected funding mechanisms in which USAID reimburses partner governments for costs related to completion of agreed-upon activities.

To assess USAID  missions\u2019 adherence to these policies, we reviewed planning documents  for 29 G2G assistance activities from 14 USAID missions with more than  $500,000 in G2G obligations in fiscal year 2012. These included risk  assessments, project or activity planning documents, assistance  agreements, and audits, among others.

We chose these missions on the basis of fiscal year 2012 G2G funding  levels, progress in implementing projects and activities, and geographic  and sector diversity. Although the results of our case studies cannot be  projected across all USAID missions, we believe these missions provide  an illustrative mix of USAID\u2019s G2G assistance activities.

According to USAID\u2019s policy on G2G assistance, before providing  funds directly to a partner-government entity, the missions must complete  a fiduciary risk assessment of that entity. The goal of this assessment is  to establish risk mitigation measures that will be integrated into the design  of the project to help ensure that funds are managed appropriately.  Possible risk mitigation measures include technical assistance for  capacity building, disbursement of funds in tranches contingent on the  achievement of certain milestones, establishment of benchmarks for the  partner country to demonstrate progress in correcting financial  management weaknesses, and limits on cash advances under cost- reimbursable funding mechanisms. Missions are required to include the  findings of the risk assessments, as appropriate, in the planning  documents approved by the mission director. In addition, missions should  include provisions for ensuring partner-government compliance with risk  mitigation measures in the M&E plans for projects with G2G assistance  activities. Since fiscal year 2012, legislation governing the use of funds  for direct G2G assistance has placed conditions on such assistance,  including requiring the assessment of the partner-government entity that  will receive the assistance funds and determination regarding whether it  has the systems required to manage those funds. According to USAID,  the agency meets these assessment requirements by means of its  policies and procedures relating to G2G assistance.", "On the basis of our review of 29 planning documents for G2G assistance  activities with fiscal year 2012 obligations, we found that missions  conducted risk assessments and formulated risk mitigation plans, as  required.

Of the 29 planning documents we reviewed, 20 included  no discussion of identified risks, and 17 of the planning documents did not  address measures for mitigating risks. Furthermore, 25 of the 29 M&E  plans did not integrate follow-up for ensuring partner government  compliance with agreed-upon risk mitigation measures.", "In most cases, missions had not completed the fiduciary risk  assessments prior to finalizing project or activity planning: for 14 of the 20  planning documents that did not include risk mitigation information, we  found that the fiduciary risk assessment was either under way or not yet  initiated at the time of project planning. In some cases, our document  review enabled us to identify possible reasons missions completed  planning before the corresponding risk assessments were completed. In  one instance, the planning document included non-G2G activities for  which a fiduciary risk assessment was not required, according to the  document; to avoid delays in the approval of these non-G2G activities,  the mission approved the larger project and proceeded while the G2G- related risk assessment was under way. In another instance, the USAID  mission had a previous funding relationship with the partner-government  agency and thus may have decided to proceed because it was already  aware of potential risks.", "USAID policy on G2G assistance clearly underscores the importance of  integrating risk mitigation measures into project and M&E planning. When  missions finalize project planning without having the information from  completed fiduciary risk assessments, they may not incorporate into the  design of the project appropriate safeguards or measures that would  strengthen partner-country systems. Furthermore, not integrating partner- government follow-up on risk mitigation measures into project M&E plans  weakens oversight and accountability and creates potential reporting  inefficiencies.", "In some cases, missions documented risk mitigation measures and  compliance-monitoring plans in other project-related documents.

In addition, USAID headquarters  officials noted that mission officials in Rwanda, Egypt, and Indonesia  worked with other donors, including the World Bank, on public financial  management capacity assessments. Nevertheless, mission officials in  the three countries we visited told us that donor coordination on risk  assessment can be difficult and cited several reasons, among them that  USAID has more rigorous risk assessment requirements, donor budget  and project planning cycles may not coincide with USAID\u2019s time frames,  and donor working groups may be organized around pooled funding  arrangements in which USAID does not participate. In addition, two of the  USAID missions had yet to determine who should take the lead on donor  coordination focused on improving partner-government public financial  management.", "Despite such difficulties, some USAID mission officials and donor  representatives we spoke with described potential benefits of coordination  on risk assessments. For example, they told us that since donors\u2019 risk  assessments tend to produce similar results, a lack of coordination  among donors leads to duplication and increased costs associated with  conducting the assessments, costs borne by donors (including USAID)  and partner governments alike.

In 11 of the 26 cases, missions also  allowed funds to be advanced to the partner country. USAID policy allows  for cash advances for projects that have been approved outside of the  partner government\u2019s budget cycle or when funding from the partner  government is not available. In such cases, the partner government is  required to provide documentation of the proper use of the funds. Finally,  in 3 cases, USAID missions provided resource transfers. In our three  case study countries, we noted the following examples of missions using  these three types of funding mechanisms:   In Nepal, the USAID mission used a resource transfer for a  democracy and governance project, contributing to a multidonor trust  fund managed by the government of Nepal; the mission also planned  to use a fixed-amount reimbursement agreement to fund an  accompanying capacity-building project with the Ministry of Peace and  Reconstruction.", "In Peru, the mission specified cost reimbursement as the funding  mechanism in its planning document for a health, education, and  alternative development project implemented through the regional  government of San Mart\u00edn.

For example, one OIG audit review included a recommendation  for USAID Nepal to correct deficiencies related to procurement and  internal controls; in response, the mission agreed to ensure that goods  and services are procured from authorized vendors only. In another  example, OIG instructed USAID Ethiopia to determine whether  questioned costs of about $28,000 were allowable or unallowable and, if  appropriate, to recover unallowable costs; the mission found the costs to  be unallowable and recovered the funds.", "Nevertheless, on the basis of our review of these audits, we found that  two-thirds (12 of 18) were submitted late (see table 3); in one case, OIG  indicated it had received the audit report about a year late.", "The late submission of audits delays subsequent audit follow-up activities  required by USAID policy, including OIG\u2019s review as well as USAID  mission follow-up on OIG recommendations.

In addition, we noted that a USAID-commissioned study, while it  concluded that increasing funding to partner governments was associated  with improved capacity of partner governments in some countries, also  highlighted the need for more evidence demonstrating the impact of this  approach on funding development assistance relative to other funding  approaches. At the time of our prior review, USAID officials told us that  other approaches existed within the agency for measuring progress  toward strengthening partner-country systems and promoting sustainable  development, particularly project-level indicators and evaluation data.", "Some of the planning documents we reviewed did include indicators or  evaluation plans, suggesting that missions have begun to develop ways  to measure and track progress in achieving the three Local Solutions  goals of strengthening capacity to implement programs, enhancing and  promoting country ownership, and increasing sustainability. For  example, the planning document for a nutrition project in Ghana  envisioned conducting an impact evaluation to assess the relative  effectiveness in achieving results of direct G2G funding versus an indirect  funding model. The same planning document also included several  expected results related to local government capacity, such as  strengthening district assemblies\u2019 capacity to manage direct donor  funding. In addition, the M&E plan for a USAID early-education project in  Nepal identified as an illustrative evaluation question prospects for scale- up and sustainability of the project as a regular activity of the local  Ministry of Education. Finally, the planning document for a democratic  governance and accountability project in Tanzania indicated that an  evaluation would identify the keys to sustainability of enhanced public  resource oversight, as well as constraints to wider adoption of  accountability practices. This planning document also stated that  indicators of citizen perceptions of governance and accountability would  be tracked through a survey in targeted districts.", "The President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in which  USAID is heavily involved, and other USAID-specific initiatives and  programs have published guidance addressing how to measure and track  progress toward enhancing capacity, country ownership, and  sustainability. For example, PEPFAR\u2019s guidance on capacity building  provides illustrative examples of indicators, such as percentage of  PEPFAR-supported government staff transferred to government salaries,  number of workers trained and percentage of trainees retained, and  percentage of partners with on-time reports and unqualified audits. With  regard to sustainability planning, PEPFAR\u2019s guidance calls on PEPFAR  country teams to develop sustainability M&E plans. Similarly, the M&E  guidance for the U.S. government\u2019s global hunger and food security  initiative (Feed the Future) states that it will measure public sector  capacity and program sustainability primarily by tracking partner- government budgets allocated to agriculture and nutrition. With regard  to measuring country ownership, the Global Health Initiative\u2019s interagency  paper on country ownership cites increases in health spending in the  partner country and in direct funding to its government as possible  indicators. Finally, USAID\u2019s strategic framework for democracy, human  rights, and governance cites improved governance and institutional  capacity as key expected results of USAID activities.", "USAID\u2019s July 2014 policy on G2G assistance allows missions to  collaborate with partner governments to identify indicators and select  evaluation questions that address capacity building and sustainability.  According to USAID headquarters officials, an internal discussion paper  on M&E for G2G assistance activities elaborates on these concepts, and  the agency is currently reviewing tools and methods used by missions to  measure performance of partner governments. In addition, according to  USAID, as of March 2015, the agency is in the process of developing  supplemental guidance on indicators that can be used to track results of  strengthening public financial management activities. Nevertheless, at the  time of our review, USAID did not have agency-wide guidance on how to  collect data or evaluate the development hypothesis that channeling  funds through partner-government systems helps to achieve Local  Solutions goals. Without integrating indicators or evaluations for  assessing progress toward Local Solutions goals into the plans for  ongoing and future projects that include G2G assistance activities, USAID  missions risk committing resources to unproven funding strategies as the  agency executes its plans to expand G2G assistance in scale and scope.

We found that  USAID policies require that missions incorporate safeguards throughout  the program cycle of planning, implementing, and monitoring and  evaluating G2G assistance; however, we also found that missions have  not yet fully applied these safeguards in all cases. In the cases we  reviewed, USAID had carried out required fiduciary risk assessments,  documented project planning, utilized assistance agreements and funding  mechanisms, conducted audits, and devised key elements of monitoring  and evaluation. However, missions in some cases had not completed the  risk assessments in a timely manner, hampering their efforts to integrate  assessment findings and mitigation measures into project planning and  M&E plans, when required. Missions also encountered difficulties  coordinating risk assessment and related activities with other donors,  potentially leading to inefficiencies and less effective oversight of partner  countries\u2019 efforts to address financial management weaknesses. Because  required audits we reviewed often were submitted late, the subsequent  chain of OIG review and mission response also was delayed, decreasing  the likelihood of resolving important audit findings such as questioned  costs and other financial management weaknesses.

We also interviewed USAID officials in Washington, D.C., about the  policies we reviewed. Some of the policy documents we reviewed apply  broadly to all USAID assistance, while others were specific to G2G  assistance. Specifically, the chapters we reviewed were the following:", "ADS Chapter 220: Use and Strengthening of Reliable Partner  Government Systems for Implementation of Direct Assistance (first  issued August 2011, revised in March 2012 and July 2014);", "ADS Chapter 201: Planning (most recently revised in December", "ADS Chapter 203: Assessing and Learning (most recent revisions in  January and November 2012 and January 2013).", "In our summary of these policies, we drew from the most recent versions  available at the time of our review, but in conducting our analysis, we  used the versions that were in place at the time that we developed our  tools for analysis.

To assess the degree to which  these policies reflect generally accepted accountability standards, we  compared the most recent versions of these policies with relevant  sections of GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which we refer to as accountability standards. These  standards outline ways agencies can improve accountability, such as by  assessing and mitigating risk and carrying out defined policies and  procedures. We mapped the USAID policies listed above to relevant  sections of the accountability standards, noting ways in which USAID  policy addresses specific factors or elements that contribute to a  supportive environment for accountability.", "To review mission planning for G2G assistance activities, we began by  identifying project appraisal documents (PAD) and activity approval  documents (AAD) as key sources of information for our review. Starting in  2012, USAID policy on planning required missions with approved country  development cooperation strategies (CDCS) to document planning for  projects (which consist of one or more activities) in PADs. Prior to 2012,  missions documented project and activity planning using AADs. We next  identified 22 USAID bilateral missions that had obligated more than  $500,000 in G2G assistance in fiscal year 2012 and had completed a  stage 1 rapid appraisal at the time of our review, according to USAID  Local Solutions data and other information provided by the agency. We  then requested planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation  documents\u2014including risk assessments, activity approval documents,  project appraisal documents, assistance agreements, implementation  letters, and audits\u2014from these 22 USAID missions.", "During the course of this preliminary work and as we reviewed the  submitted documents, we removed 8 missions from the scope of our  review for the following reasons. First, according to USAID headquarters  and mission officials, all of the fiscal year 2012 G2G funds obligated by  missions in Egypt and Mali were deobligated after fiscal year 2012.", "Second, mission officials in Indonesia and Georgia determined that all of  each mission\u2019s respective fiscal year 2012 obligations had not, in fact,  been implemented through partner government entities and, as such,  were incorrectly characterized as G2G assistance. Third, project and  activity planning documents for G2G assistance activities with fiscal year  2012 obligations were not available for USAID missions in Ethiopia and  Rwanda. In response to our request for documents, these missions  provided assistance agreements and implementation letters; in the case  of Ethiopia, the mission stated that the agreements and letters  documented authorization of G2G assistance activities. Finally, because  GAO, the USAID Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Special  Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction had each reviewed  various aspects of USAID\u2019s G2G assistance in Afghanistan and Pakistan,  we did not include those two countries in our document review. (App. III  provides a summary of other reviews of USAID\u2019s G2G assistance in  Afghanistan and Pakistan.) As a result of this process, we reviewed all 29  project appraisal or activity approval documents provided by 14 USAID  missions: Armenia, Barbados, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Liberia,  Mozambique, Nepal, Peru, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia.  Table 4 provides a list of the projects with G2G assistance activities for  which we reviewed planning documents, by USAID mission.", "To conduct our review of these planning documents, we developed a data  collection instrument to gather information on the required elements of  PADs, as described in USAID policies on G2G assistance, planning, and  monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

To determine the  extent to which these documents contained the required elements, we  reviewed each planning document and recorded any relevant information  we found for each of the elements in our data collection instrument. We  then analyzed this information and determined whether the information  provided met requirements outlined in the USAID policies described  above. With regard to project-level M&E plans, while we recognized that  USAID missions may refine project M&E plans after completing project  design, our interest was in the degree to which missions had integrated  M&E into planning for G2G assistance activities. Accordingly, we  reviewed the M&E information provided in the planning documents we  collected and identified cases where these documents (1) included  general M&E information and (2) specifically addressed sustainability,  country ownership, or capacity. Finally, we also reviewed assistance  agreements and implementation letters associated with the G2G activities  in our review for information we did not find in the planning documents,  including the funding mechanism used to implement the G2G activity and  partner-government compliance with risk mitigation measures.", "To identify examples of types of risks identified in USAID risk  assessments, we selected illustrative examples from our case study  countries for inclusion in this report.

In response to this request, 5 USAID missions provided 18  financial audits: Ethiopia (1), India (2), Nepal (7), Peru (7), and Rwanda  (1). We reviewed audits submitted by these missions in response to our  request, but did not seek to validate that all required audits were  conducted or submitted. Accordingly, our findings are limited to the  audits provided. We also reviewed agency or OIG reviews, memos, and  related documentation provided by USAID headquarters and USAID  missions. We recorded the following information from these documents:  the type of auditor (third-party contractor, host country supreme audit  institution, mission, or OIG), audited entity, time frame for audit and  submission, audit findings, OIG recommendations, and status of  implementation of the recommendations for each audit. The analysis we  conducted is a reflection of the documentation provided by USAID,  including the documents\u2019 limitations. For example, OIG recommendations  incorporate the findings and recommendations of the third-party  contractor, supreme audit institution, and USAID auditors.

USAID  policy outlines three funding mechanisms:", "Cost reimbursement: USAID reimburses the partner-government  entity for actual costs and expenditures incurred in carrying out the  project activities, up to an estimated total cost specified in advance.  Cost reimbursements require missions to prepare a budget that  reasonably estimates the cost of implementing the project, with the  understanding that the final amounts may be further refined. Cost  reimbursements may be used when unit costs cannot be estimated  with sufficient accuracy at the beginning of the project because of  price fluctuations over the life of a project that are outside the control  of the partner-government. Because USAID reimburses actual costs  incurred based on these estimates, the mission is responsible for  closely monitoring project implementation to help ensure that it is on  schedule and to resolve problems as they arise. When the partner  government is ready to request a reimbursement for costs incurred  during project implementation, it submits the request according to  procedures specified in the assistance agreement or the  implementation letter, along with certified financial reports detailing  the amount of expenditures incurred and supporting documents, such  as contracts, invoices, and payments. The reports and supporting  documents are subject to USAID review and audit procedures  outlined in the agreement. Under this funding mechanism, USAID  may provide cash advances for projects that have been approved  outside of the government\u2019s budget cycle or when funding from the  partner government is not available.", "Fixed amount reimbursement: USAID reimburses an amount agreed  to in advance, per output or associated milestone, after the mission  has verified that quality standards have been met. This mechanism  requires that the mission and the partner government invest a  significant amount of time and resources to develop cost estimates for  outputs and associated milestones during the design phase of the  project. The partner-government entity implementing the project  submits design specifications and cost estimates for each output or  associated milestone for approval by the mission. The mission  independently verifies that the estimate is reasonable and negotiates  payment amounts with the partner government for each output or  milestone. The amount of the mission\u2019s contribution to the project is  thereby fixed and the partner government bears the responsibility for  any unforeseen cost increases. Similarly, if actual costs are less than  estimated costs, the mission\u2019s payment to the partner government is  not reduced. However, the mission may make periodic adjustments  for subsequent payment amounts in certain cases, such as  unforeseeable inflation or price increases. Once the cost estimate has  been established under this funding mechanism, the mission\u2019s  monitoring and oversight of the project is significantly less than that  required for the cost reimbursement mechanism because the  mission\u2019s primary role is to verify that the outputs or associated  milestones have been completed and meet the agreed-upon quality  standards. In addition, during project planning, the mission must also  determine that the partner-government entity has the qualified  management staff with sufficient technical skills and experience to  implement the project in a timely manner.

The transfer of resources is generally dependent on  the completion of specific actions by the partner government.

According to USAID policy, to the extent  possible, missions must avoid funding the establishment of separate  donor-funded project management or implementation units that operate  outside the existing partner-government structures. USAID aims to  strengthen those government institutions already established by the  partner government rather than create or maintain separately operated  project management or implementation units that may be unsustainable  in the long run. Similarly, USAID policy states that while missions may  use host country contracts to engage with partner governments, this  funding mechanism is different from using partner-government systems  and therefore is not counted toward the agency\u2019s 30 percent Local  Solutions target. OIG found that most of the mission\u2019s G2G activities in  Afghanistan had been implemented through project implementation and  management units. For example, USAID provides funds for an education  program to a nongovernmental organization, which hires a team of  consultants to work in the Ministry of Education to manage and implement  the activities under this program. OIG considered the use of project  implementation and management units as a key risk mitigation measure  that helped safeguard funds and thus did not find issue with this finding or  make any recommendations. Similarly, a SIGAR review of USAID\u2019s  health programs in Afghanistan also noted that the mission funds this  activity through a host country contract, which is managed by a separate  grants and contracts management unit.", "In addition, SIGAR found that USAID Afghanistan\u2019s use of cash advances  in one G2G activity made funds more vulnerable to waste, fraud, and  abuse because the activity is funded with monies paid in advance of costs  incurred.
