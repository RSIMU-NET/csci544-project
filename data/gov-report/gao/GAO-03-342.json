However, these agencies' food safety statutes can be interpreted to provide authority to impose certain security measures. FDA believes that its statutes authorize it to regulate food security to the extent that food security and safety overlap but observes that there is little overlap between security and safety. USDA believes that it could require food processors to adopt certain security measures that are closely related to sanitary conditions inside the facility. USDA also believes that the statutes, however, cannot be interpreted to authorize the regulation of security measures that are not associated with the immediate food-processing environment, such as requiring fences, alarms, and outside lighting. Neither agency believes that it has the authority to regulate all aspects of security at food-processing facilities. Both FDA and USDA issued voluntary security guidelines to help food processors identify measures to prevent or mitigate the risk of deliberate contamination. Because these guidelines are voluntary, neither agency enforces, monitors, or documents their implementation. Both FDA and USDA have asked their inspectors to be vigilant and to discuss security with managers at food-processing facilities, but the agencies have stressed that inspectors should not enforce the implementation of security measures or document any observations because of the possible release of this information under the Freedom of Information Act and the potential for the misuse of this information. Since FDA and USDA do not monitor and document food processors' implementation of security guidelines, the extent of the industry's adoption of security measures is unknown. According to officials of trade associations and the five facilities we visited, however, food processors are implementing a range of security measures. In addition, the FDA and USDA field inspectors we surveyed indicated that most facilities have implemented some security measures, such as installing fences. However, the inspectors were less able to comment on security measures that were not as obvious, such as accounting for missing stock and implementing proper mail-handling practices. The inspectors also noted that while USDA has provided some of its field supervisory personnel with security training on the voluntary security guidelines it issued, it has not provided most of its inspectors with such training. FDA has not provided its staff with any training on the security guidelines. Without training on the security guidelines, inspectors are limited in their ability to conduct informed discussions regarding security with managers at food-processing facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring the safety of the nation\u2019s food supply\u2014protecting the food  supply from unintentional contamination\u2014is a key objective of the  Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA). Since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, however, ensuring food security\u2014that is, protecting  the food supply from deliberate contamination\u2014has also become a  heightened concern of these agencies. Bioterrorism experts, government  officials, and scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) and the National Academies warn that U.S. food-processing  facilities are vulnerable to terrorist attack and that the deliberate  introduction of biological and chemical agents into food supplies could  sicken large numbers of people and possibly cause many deaths. Some  experts note that terrorist groups could introduce infectious disease  agents and chemicals into the food supply to confuse public health  officials into believing that outbreaks were naturally occurring, thus  delaying detection and action. Recognizing this risk, on October 8, 2001,  the President added the agriculture and food industries to the list of  critical infrastructure sectors needing protection from terrorist attack.", "Although the U.S. food supply has been mostly secure from deliberate  contamination, a few such incidents have occurred. In 1984, for example, a  cult group poisoned salad bars in some Oregon restaurants with  Salmonella bacteria, and about 750 people became ill. Some large  naturally occurring outbreaks of foodborne illness that result from  accidental contamination illustrate how widespread and costly the effects  of deliberate contamination could be. In 1994, for example, 224,000 people  nationwide were infected with Salmonella enteritidis after eating a  national brand of ice cream. This outbreak was estimated to have cost  about $18.1 million, including $6.9 million for medical care and $11.2  million in time lost from work.", "The intentional contamination of the food supply could have severe  consequences for the economy and the health of the American public.  Security measures that could minimize the risk of such an event at food- processing facilities range from restricting visitor access, securing  hazardous chemicals, and restricting access to in-plant laboratories to  conducting employee background checks, building fences around  facilities, and designating a food security management coordinator.", "In this context, you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which federal  statutes can be effectively used to regulate food security at food- processing facilities; (2) what actions FDA and USDA have taken to help  food processors prevent or reduce the risk of deliberate food  contamination and how these agencies determine the extent to which  food-processing facilities are implementing security measures; and   (3) the extent to which industry is implementing security measures to  better protect food products against deliberate contamination. While  experts acknowledge that a terrorist attack could be aimed also at  livestock and crops on farms or at foods at retail stores, this review  focused on the food-processing segment of the farm-to-table food  continuum\u2014that is, from the farm gate to the retail level. Also, we  confined our review to domestic food processors, although we recognize  that both FDA and USDA have intensified their efforts to enhance the  oversight of imported foods at U.S. ports of entry.", "In conducting our work, we sought the cooperation of industry  associations to survey a representative number of food-processing  facilities. We also sought permission to visit some food-processing  facilities to discuss the extent to which they are implementing security  measures, although we acknowledge that industry is not obligated to  respond to our inquiries. We were unsuccessful in our attempts to survey a  representative number of food-processing facilities because companies  were concerned about sharing information on security measures;  however, we were able to secure visits to five companies. To obtain a  broader overview of the security measures being adopted, we also  surveyed FDA and USDA food inspectors to obtain their views on the  extent of security they have observed at food-processing facilities they  inspect across the country. We also asked state audit offices in all 50 states  to interview a selected number of state food safety regulatory officials  concerning their food security activities, if any. Eleven agreed to  participate. Appendix I contains the details of our scope and methodology.  We conducted our review from February through December 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection  Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, USDA, through FSIS, is  responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and certain egg  products. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public  Health Service Act, FDA is responsible for all other foods, including fruits  and vegetables; dairy products; seafood; and certain canned, frozen, and  packaged foods. The food-processing sector is generally described as the  middle segment of the farm-to-table continuum\u2014it extends from the time  livestock and crops leave the farm for slaughter and processing into food  until it reaches retail establishments.", "FDA and FSIS work to ensure the safety of food products processed in the  United States through a regulatory system of preventive controls that  identifies hazards early in the production process to minimize the risk of  contamination. Known as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point  (HACCP) system, it makes food-processing facilities responsible for  developing a plan that identifies harmful microbiological, chemical, and  physical hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and establishes critical  control points to prevent or reduce contamination. Through their  inspection programs, FDA and FSIS verify that food processors are  implementing their HACCP plans. FDA inspects over 57,000 food facilities  every 5 years on average, and USDA inspects over 6,000 meat and poultry  slaughter and processing facilities daily. Individual states also conduct  yearly inspections of about 300,000 food-processing facilities, including  small firms with fewer than 10 employees and large corporations with  thousands of employees and multiple processing plants located in many  states. Both FDA and FSIS have the authority to take enforcement actions  as necessary to ensure that facilities meet the agencies\u2019 safety and  sanitation regulatory requirements. As we reported in 2001, in fiscal year  1999, the latest year for which such information was available, FDA, FSIS,  and the states spent a total of about $1.3 billion on food safety activities.", "Following the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government  intensified its efforts to address the potential for deliberate contamination  of agriculture and food products. On October 8, 2001, the President issued  an executive order establishing the Office of Homeland Security, which  added the agriculture and food industries to the list of critical  infrastructure systems needing protection from terrorist attack. In  addition, the Congress provided FDA and USDA with emergency funding  to prevent, prepare for, and respond to potential bioterrorist attacks  through the Department of Defense Appropriation Act of 2002: $97 million  for FDA and $15 million for FSIS. For the most part, FDA has used the  emergency funds to enhance the security of imported food by hiring new  inspectors and increasing inspections at U.S. ports of entry. FSIS has used  its emergency funds to support its food security activities, which include,  among other things, providing educational and specialized training. FDA\u2019s  fiscal year 2003 budget builds upon funding received from the fiscal year  2002 appropriation plus the fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental  funding of $97 million to counter terrorism. FDA plans to seek additional  funding in the future for food safety activities and security activities  related to terrorism. FSIS is asking for an additional $28 million. The  Congress also enacted the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism  Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which contains numerous  provisions designed to enhance the safety and security of the food, drug,  and water industries.", "In addition, both FDA and USDA have taken many actions to better  protect the food supply against deliberate contamination. For example,  FDA has hired 655 new food safety investigators and laboratory personnel  in the field. In addition, it has participated in several exercises at the  federal and state levels to enhance emergency response procedures.  Furthermore, FDA is working with CDC to initiate and implement a  nationwide Laboratory Response Network for foods to identify laboratory  capacity for testing agents that could be used to deliberately contaminate  food. It has also provided additional laboratory training for food safety  personnel and sought stakeholders\u2019 input to develop regulations that are  required by the new bioterrorism legislation. Moreover, FDA worked with  the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, to adapt a version of the  Operational Risk Management approach to examine the relative risks of  intentional contamination during various stages of food production and  distribution. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, both  FDA and CDC have worked closely with federal, state, and local agencies  to enhance their surveillance of diseases caused by foodborne pathogens.  FDA\u2019s efforts to reduce food security risks also include working with other  federal agencies, trade associations, and the Alliance for Food Security.", "USDA has formed a Homeland Security Council to develop a Department- wide plan to coordinate efforts between all USDA agencies and offices.  The Department has also established the FSIS Office of Food Security and  Emergency Preparedness to centralize the Department\u2019s work on security  matters. USDA has also coordinated with other government agencies, such  as the Office of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), and FDA, to develop prevention, detection, and response  procedures to better protect the nation\u2019s food supply. USDA will be  increasing the number of import inspectors by 20. These inspectors will  place special emphasis on food security in addition to their traditional  food safety role. In addition, USDA has participated in several exercises at  the federal and state levels to enhance response procedures and has  conducted risk assessments for domestic and imported food. Since this  review began, USDA has conducted three simulation exercises at the  Department and agency level to test the Department\u2019s response to a  terrorist attack and is planning three additional simulations for the spring  of 2003. USDA has also conducted preparedness-training sessions for  veterinarians and circuit supervisors. (Circuit supervisors supervise the  work of in-plant inspection personnel and discuss the security guidelines  with them.)", "Experts from government and academia generally agree that terrorists  could use food products as a vehicle for introducing harmful agents into  the food supply. Just recently, the National Academies reported that  terrorists could use toxic chemicals or infectious agents to contaminate  food production facilities and that, although much attention has been paid  to ensuring safety and purity throughout the various stages of processing  and distribution, protecting the food supply from intentional  contamination has not been a major focus of federal agencies. Among  other things, the report says that FDA should act promptly to extend its  HACCP methodology so that it could be used to deal effectively with the  deliberate contamination of the food supply. In February 2002, CDC  reported that although the food and water systems in the United States are  among the safest in the world, the nationwide outbreaks due to  unintentional food or water contamination demonstrate the ongoing need  for vigilance in protecting food and water supplies. All of the bioterrorism  experts whom we consulted from academia agreed that the food supply is  at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Food Safety Statutes Do Not Provide Sufficient Authority to Regulate All Aspects of Security at Food- Processing Facilities", "paragraphs": ["The food safety statutes do not specifically authorize FDA or USDA to  require food processors to implement any type of security measures  designed to prevent the intentional contamination of the foods they  produce.

However, Counsel also advised that FDA\u2019s food safety authorities do not  extend to the regulation of physical facility security measures. FDA\u2019s  counsel provided a similar assessment, telling us that, to the extent that  food safety and security overlap, FDA might be able to require the industry  to take precautionary steps to improve security but observed that there is  little overlap between safety and security. One area where safety and  security do overlap is in the handling of hazardous materials. FDA\u2019s  existing safety regulations specify that hazardous chemicals should be  stored so that they cannot contaminate food products. This requirement  overlaps with FDA\u2019s food security guidelines advising that hazardous  chemicals be stored in a secure area and that access to them be limited.", "USDA, on the other hand, has a somewhat more expansive view of the  extent to which its statutory authority allows it to require food processors  to adopt certain security measures. USDA\u2019s general counsel concluded  that to the extent that security precautions pertain to activities closely  related to sanitary conditions in the food preparation process, FSIS has  the authority to require food processors to implement certain security  measures. The general counsel concluded that FSIS could require  facilities to develop and maintain a food security management plan  concerning their response to an actual threat involving product tampering,  since this is directly related to food adulteration. Such a plan could be  added to a current HACCP plan or it could be entirely separate. USDA also  believes that FSIS has authority to mandate its \u201cinside security\u201d guidelines,  such as controlling or restricting access to certain areas, monitoring the  operation of equipment to prevent tampering, and keeping accurate  inventories of restricted ingredients and hazardous chemicals. Similarly,  USDA believes that many of its security measures that address shipping  and receiving food products or protecting water and ice used in processing  products also could be made mandatory. These measures include putting  tamper-proof seals on incoming and outgoing shipments and controlling  access to water lines and ice storage.", "On the other hand, USDA believes that the \u201coutside security\u201d measures  included in its guidelines, such as securing plant boundaries and providing  guards, alarms, and outside lighting, have little to do with sanitation in the  facility or the immediate food-processing environment and, therefore,  could not be made mandatory under existing authorities. With respect to  the guidelines\u2019 personnel security measures, USDA noted that FSIS has  limited authority over personnel matters at food-processing facilities and  could not require facilities to perform personnel background checks  before hiring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and FSIS Issued Voluntary Security Guidelines to Food Processors but Do Not Track or Document the Extent to Which They Are Being Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In response to the nation\u2019s growing concerns regarding the potential for  deliberate contamination of the food supply, FDA and USDA issued  guidelines to the food-processing industry suggesting measures to enhance  security at their facilities.

Food-processing facilities are not required to adopt  any of the security measures but are encouraged to adopt those that they  feel are best suited for their operations. Although both agencies have  alerted their field inspection personnel to be vigilant about security issues,  they have also told the inspectors that they are not authorized to enforce  these measures and have instructed them not to document their  observations regarding security because of the possible release of this  information under the Freedom of Information Act and the potential for  the misuse of this information. As a result, FDA and USDA currently do  not know the extent to which food security measures are being  implemented at food-processing facilities. In contrast, the Congress  directed medium-size and large-size community water systems, which are  privately or publicly owned, to assess their vulnerability to terrorist  attacks and to develop an emergency response plan to prepare for such an  event. The act also authorized funding to be used for basic security  enhancements, such as the installation of fencing, gating, lighting, or  security cameras.

Officials from both FDA and FSIS  told us that there was little or no coordination between the two agencies  in developing these guidelines. The FDA guidance contains over 100  recommended security measures covering seven areas of plant operation,  such as managing food security, physical (outside) security, and computer  security. FSIS\u2019s guidelines contain 68 security measures and cover seven  areas of plant operation. Figure 1 summarizes key aspects of both  agencies\u2019 voluntary security guidelines for industry.

They have also instructed their field personnel not to  document plants\u2019 security measures because they are concerned that such  information would be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.", "More specifically, FDA\u2019s instructions to its field personnel specify that  they should neither perform a comprehensive food security audit of the  establishment nor conduct extensive interviews to determine the extent to  which preventive measures suggested in the guidelines have been adopted.  The goals, according to FDA, are to heighten industry\u2019s awareness of food  security practices, facilitate an exchange of information between FDA and  industry on the subject of food security, and encourage plant management  to voluntarily implement those preventive measures that they believe are  most appropriate for their operation. In short, FDA inspectors are  encouraged to discuss food security concerns with plant management and  to provide them with copies of the guidelines. Although the exact details  of such discussions are not to be recorded, inspectors are required to  document in their inspection reports that such discussions took place and  that they gave a copy of the guidelines to facility management.", "Similarly, FSIS has informed its field inspectors that they have no  regulatory duties regarding the enforcement of the guidelines. Initially, the  agency instructed its inspectors to refer any questions from facility  managers to USDA\u2019s Technical Service Center in Omaha, Nebraska.  Recently the agency modified its position regarding direct discussions of  food security and now allows inspectors to discuss, but not interpret,  security with facility management. Inspectors are still instructed not to  document these conversations or enforce the adoption of any security  measure.", "Officials from both agencies expressed concerns about gathering security  information from facilities because it could be subject to public disclosure  through Freedom of Information Act requests.

The President addressed this concern  in the October 8, 2001, executive order establishing the Office of  Homeland Security and adding the agriculture and food industries to the  list of critical infrastructure systems needing protection from terrorist  attack. The National Academies have also concluded in a recently released  report that infectious agents and toxic chemicals could be used by  terrorists to contaminate food-processing facilities. Among other things,  the report says that FDA should act promptly to extend its Hazard Analysis  and Critical Control Point methodology so it might be used to deal  effectively with deliberate contamination of the food supply. The Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention also reported recently on the need to  better protect our nation\u2019s food and water supplies.", "These assessments underscore the need to enhance security at food- processing facilities. Although FDA and FSIS recognize that need and have  taken action to encourage food processors to voluntarily adopt security  measures, these actions may be insufficient. Because the agencies believe  that they generally lack authority to mandate security measures and are  concerned that such information would be subject to Freedom of  Information Act requests, they do not collect information on industry\u2019s  voluntary implementation of security measures. The agencies are,  therefore, unable to determine the extent to which food processors have  voluntarily implemented such measures. Both FDA and USDA have  completed risk assessments. However, without the ability to require food- processing facilities to provide information on their security measures,  these federal agencies cannot fully assess industry\u2019s efforts to prevent or  reduce the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s food supply to deliberate  contamination. Similarly, they cannot advise processors on needed  security enhancements. Furthermore, lacking baseline information on the  facilities\u2019 security condition, the agencies would be unprepared to advise  food-processing facilities on any additional actions needed if the federal  government were to go to a higher threat alert.", "Finally, the lack of security training for FDA food inspectors on the  voluntary security guidelines issued for food processors and the limited  number of FSIS inspectors that have so far received training on the  voluntary security guidelines hamper the inspectors\u2019 ability to conduct  informed discussions regarding security measures with facility personnel  as they are currently instructed to do."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to reduce the risk of deliberate contamination of food products,  we are recommending that the Secretary of Health and Human Services  and the Secretary of Agriculture study their agencies\u2019 existing statutes and  identify what additional authorities they may need relating to security  measures at food-processing facilities. On the basis of the results of these  studies, the agencies should seek additional authority from the Congress,  as needed.", "To increase field inspectors\u2019 knowledge and understanding of food  security issues and facilitate their discussions about the voluntary security  guidelines with plant personnel, we are also recommending that the  Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture  provide training for their agencies\u2019 field staff on the security measures  discussed in the voluntary guidelines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided FDA and USDA with a draft of this report for their review  and comment. We received written and clarifying oral comments from  each agency. The agencies also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated into the report as appropriate. FDA agreed with our  recommendation that it provide all food inspection personnel with training  on security measures. Subsequently, FDA officials told us that the agency  did not have an opinion on our recommendation that it study what  additional authorities it may need relating to security measures at food- processing facilities. In its written comments, FDA stated that the report is  factual and describes accurately the events and actions that FDA has  taken on food security. FDA also commented that one of the goals of its  voluntary guidance to industry is to heighten awareness of food security  practices and that the role of its investigators is first and foremost food  safety. FDA also said that it does not have sufficient security expertise to  provide industry with consultation in this area. FDA further commented  that although HACCP and other preventive controls are appropriate  measures to enhance food safety, HACCP does not afford similar  advantages for addressing deliberate contamination, tampering, and/or  terrorist actions related to the food supply. Our report underscores that  the role of FDA\u2019s investigators is primarily one of food safety.  Nevertheless, we believe that it is also crucial for cognizant agencies to  have information about industry\u2019s security efforts so that they can assess  the extent to which the risk of deliberate contamination is being mitigated.  We also believe that possessing such information is important if it  becomes necessary to advise food processors on needed security  enhancements. With regard to HACCP, our report does not take a position  on the feasibility of using HACCP as a means to control deliberate  contamination; instead, we report on the opinion of the National  Academies. FDA\u2019s comments are presented in appendix V.", "In its written comments, USDA agreed with the contents of our report.  Subsequently, USDA\u2019s food safety officials confirmed that the agency also  agrees with the report\u2019s recommendations. In its letter, USDA commented  that it has already conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the food  supply without plant security information and that knowing whether a  plant employed one or several security measures was not needed to assess  the risk. Our report acknowledges that USDA has conducted a  comprehensive risk assessment, but we believe that it is crucial for  cognizant agencies to have information about industry\u2019s security efforts so  that they can assess the extent to which the risk of deliberate  contamination is being mitigated.

We  discussed these authorities with FDA and USDA counsel and requested a  legal opinion to determine the extent to which each agency believes its  existing authorities allow it to regulate food security. We then  independently reviewed these authorities to draw our own conclusions.", "To describe the actions that FDA and USDA have taken to help food  processors prevent or reduce the risk of deliberate food contamination,  we met with staff from FDA and FSIS to review the voluntary guidelines  issued by each agency. To better understand the provisions of the  guidelines, we met with agency program staff responsible for issuing the  guidelines and for receiving industry comments on it. To learn how the  guidelines would be implemented, we met with FDA and USDA\u2019s Food  Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) officials responsible for field  operations and with staff from field offices in Atlanta, Georgia, and  Beltsville, Maryland. Finally, to gather additional information about the  vulnerability of the food supply to acts of deliberate contamination, we  contacted nine experts from academia, including experts in food safety  and in bioterrorism.", "To describe how the government is determining the extent to which food- processing companies are implementing security procedures, we asked  FDA and FSIS program officials about the nature of the information they  are collecting about industry security measures. We also conducted  surveys of agency field personnel to obtain their observations about and  knowledge of food security measures taken at facilities they regularly  inspect for food safety. Our FDA survey, which was Web-based, was  administered to all 150 field investigators who recorded 465 or more hours  for domestic food inspection from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002. Our  survey of FSIS staff was a telephone survey of a randomly selected  stratified sample of 50 circuit supervisors. Our response rate for these  surveys was higher than 85 percent for FDA and 90 percent for FSIS, and  respondents included participants from all the agencies\u2019 geographic  regions. Before administering the surveys, we discussed with and obtained  input from FDA and FSIS program officials. We also pretested the surveys  at field locations to ensure that our questions were valid, clear, and  precise and that responding to the survey did not place an undue burden  on the respondents. In addition, we contacted state audit offices in all 50  states to collect information about state government actions designed to  prevent the deliberate contamination of food products. Of the 50 state  audit offices we contacted, only 11 agreed to help us collect this  information: Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New York, North  Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.", "To determine the extent to which the food-processing industry is  implementing security measures to better protect its products against  deliberate contamination, we contacted officials from 13 trade  associations representing, among others, the meat and poultry, dairy, egg,  and fruits and vegetables industries and the food-processing industry. We  discussed the guidelines that their organizations have issued, and they  described what actions their constituents are taking to protect their  products. We also visited five food-processing facilities in various  geographic regions to ask corporate and plant officials about the actions  they have taken to protect their products and facilities against intentional  contamination. These facilities included a slaughter plant as well as  facilities that produce beverages and ready-to-eat products. We recognize  that the efforts of these five facilities are not necessarily representative of  the whole food-processing industry.
