To achieve the best return on the government's investment, federal agencies are generally required to award contracts competitively. As the Army has decreased the amount of in-house system development it is doing for tactical networking equipment, it is using various tools to involve private industry to meet its needs. One such tool is the agile capabilities life cycle process whereby the Army determines the capabilities it needs and gaps in those capabilities, and uses market research and semi-annual evaluations, among other means, to involve industry. According to the Army, this agile process provides opportunities for enhancing competition. The Army acquisition strategy for eight of the nine systems discusses plans for competition and market research. An acquisition strategy is not required for the Soldier Radio Waveform Appliqu\u00e9 system because it is not a formal acquisition program; however, the Army conducted market research and is seeking competition. GAO grouped the nine systems into three categories based on similarities in the competition strategy. Specifically,", "In two of the nine systems GAO examined\u2014Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radio and Soldier Radio Waveform Appliqu\u00e9\u2014the Army is beginning new programs and structuring the acquisition approaches to competitively procure non-developmental capabilities directly from industry. The Army competitively awarded a procurement contract for its Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio, providing units for risk reduction and requirements verification. In April 2014 the Army competitively awarded contracts to four vendors to buy the Soldier Radio Waveform Appliqu\u00e9.", "Five of the nine systems GAO studied have been under development for many years. Three of those\u2014the Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station radio; the Rifleman Radio; and the Manpack Radio\u2014were part of the Joint Tactical Radio System, which was previously competed and which the Army has restructured. The Army had been developing software-defined radios to interoperate with existing radios. The Army is now seeking non-developmental solutions through competition to provide the needed capability. For the other two systems, the Joint Battle Command\u2013Platform and Nett Warrior, the Army reports that it plans to use full and open competition for individual subcomponents. In both cases, the Army conducted market research to identify vendors or seek feedback on requirements.", "The Army deemed competition impractical for the two remaining systems in GAO's review, the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical Increment 2 and Warfighter Information Network-Tactical Increment 3. The Army considered acquisition strategies for more competition in the development and procurement of these systems but determined that only the incumbent contractor could satisfy the requirements without unacceptable delays. Nevertheless, the Army continues using market research to identify interested contractors and has awarded several competitive contracts for subcomponents under these two systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The Army has declared the network its number one  modernization priority. For nearly 20 years, the Army has had limited  success in developing its information network of sensors, software, and  radios to give soldiers and commanders exact information when they  need it, in any environment, and thus improve situational awareness and  decision making in combat.

We have issued two products on these efforts. In our first  report, we addressed issues related to the Army\u2019s agile process.

We looked for evidence that the Army had utilized  some of the principles of competition in its acquisition strategies, but did  not assess compliance with policy and federal acquisition regulations, for  a non-generalizable sample of 9 of the 25 tactical networking systems by  determining if DOD had developed the documentation. These systems  are the Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio, Soldier Radio Waveform\u2014 Appliqu\u00e9, Rifleman Radio, Manpack, Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station,  Joint Battle Command\u2014Platform, the Nett Warrior, Warfighter Information  Network\u2014Tactical Increment 2, and Warfighter Information Network\u2014 Tactical Increment 3.

We reviewed Army market  research reports, requests for information, acquisition strategies, contract  award information, and briefings to senior Army officials. We  independently researched accessibility of acquisition announcements on  federal procurement opportunity web sites. We also interviewed key  program officials to discuss both their consideration of competition in  contracting strategies and their plan for engaging industry.

The  Army did not synchronize the development and fielding efforts for these  network improvements and the funding and timelines for the associated  acquisition activities were rarely, if ever, aligned. The Army\u2019s efforts to  develop networking capabilities fell far short of their objectives, resulting  in what the Army believes was a loosely coordinated set of disparate  sensors, applications, and services. The Army fielded capabilities in a  piecemeal fashion and the user in the field was largely responsible for  integrating them with existing technology. In other words, the Army had  neither an overarching framework outlining its desired tactical networking  capabilities nor a strategy for acquiring them.", "In an effort to establish a requirements framework for acquiring its  networking capabilities, the Army, in December 2011, finalized the  Network-enabled Mission Command Initial Capabilities Document, a  central document that describes the essential network capabilities  required by the Army, as well as scores of capability gaps. These  capabilities support an Army mission-command capability defined by a  network of command posts, aerial and ground platforms, manned and  unmanned sensors, and dismounted soldiers linked by an integrated suite  of mission command systems. A robust transport layer capable of  delivering voice, data, imagery, and video to the tactical edge (i.e., the  forward battle lines) connects these systems.", "The Army also developed a network strategy that changes the way it  develops, evaluates, tests, and delivers networked capability to its  operating forces, using an approach called capability set management. A  capability set is a suite of network components, associated equipment,  and software that provides an integrated network capability.approach, the Army plans to buy only what is currently available, feasible,  and needed for units preparing to deploy, instead of developing an  ultimate capability and buying enough to cover the entire force. Every  year, the Army plans to integrate another capability set that reflects  changes or advances in technology since the previous set. To support  this approach, the Army has implemented the agile capabilities life-cycle  process, which uses the identified capability gaps to solicit solutions from  industry and government and then evaluate those solutions during the  NIEs in consideration for later fielding to combat units. This process is  quite different from the past Army methods in which the Army assumed  beginning-to-end control of the design, development, test, and  procurement of networking systems. Army officials expect the agile  process and associated network integration evaluations to provide  opportunities for greater industry involvement by allowing vendors to both  propose solutions to address capability gaps and showcase their systems  in a realistic environment. This allows the Army to identify and evaluate  systems without the need for large investments in development programs  and without having to enter into procurement contracts.", "Competition in contracting is a critical tool for achieving the best return on  investment for taxpayers and can help save the taxpayer money, improve  contractor performance, and promote accountability for results. Past GAO  work has found that the federal government can realize significant cost  savings when awarding contracts competitively. DOD also acknowledges  specific benefits from competition, such as direct cost savings; improved  product/service quality; enhanced solutions and industrial base; fairness  and openness; prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse; and increased  likelihood of efficiencies and innovation. Federal acquisition regulations  require, with limited exceptions, that contracting officers shall promote  and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding  government contracts.", "Federal acquisition regulations also require that agencies conduct market  research, which DOD recognizes as a key to effective competition.", "According to the Defense Acquisition University, market research involves  collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the market  to satisfy agency needs. It is a continuous process for gathering data on  product characteristics, suppliers\u2019 capabilities, and the business  practices/trends that surround them\u2014plus the analysis of that data to  make smart acquisition decisions. Market research can vary across  acquisitions given that the nature of the research depends on such  factors as urgency, dollar value, complexity, and past experience. One  such market research method allows for government to communicate its  needs to industry and identify commercial items that could be used to  satisfy those needs. The FAR outlines specific techniques for conducting  market research. These could include, but are not limited to, consulting  with government and industry subject-matter experts, publishing requests  for information, or conducting interchange meetings with potential  offerors, and hosting pre-solicitation conferences for potential offerors,  which the Army has called industry days.", "Congress passed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009,  which outlines several congressionally-directed defense acquisition  reforms related to competition. Subsequently, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics issued an update to  DOD acquisition policy, which provides direction and guidance on how  program management will create and sustain a competitive environment  at both the prime and subcontract level throughout the program\u2019s life  cycle. DOD policy requires programs to outline their market research in  their acquisition strategies, which is the business and technical  management framework for planning, directing, contracting for, and  managing a program.
