DOD\u2019s model installation program was initiated by the then Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations (DAS/DI). The program focused on reducing the amount of regulation governing administrative functions at certain military installations. Through this program, DOD identified hundreds of pages of regulations governing military installations that it believed did not make sense or wasted time and money. The DAS/DI waived as many DOD regulations as possible and allowed the base commanders to operate the installations in their own way. According to an NPR official, the program was enthusiastically supported by the installations, which began to improve not only administrative operations but also mission-related functions. The model installations program became so successful that DOD opened the program to all military installations in March 1986.", "In early 1993, the DAS/DI was appointed the Director of the overall NPR effort. According to an NPR official, the Director suggested to the Vice President that \u201creinvention labs\u201d similar to the model installations be established within all federal agencies as part of the administration\u2019s governmentwide effort to improve government operations and save money."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NPR Task Force Supports Lab Effort", "paragraphs": ["The NPR effort is headed by the Vice President, but the day-to-day operation of the effort is the responsibility of an NPR task force that comprises staff from various federal departments and agencies. The staff are assigned to the task force for a temporary period of time, usually 3 to 6 months. The total number of staff assigned to the task force has varied over time but has usually been between 40 and 60. About 10 of these staff have worked on the NPR task force since it was established in 1993, but even they technically remain employees of their home agencies.", "The NPR task force has attempted to advertise and promote the reinvention lab effort in a variety of ways. For example, the task force has sponsored or cosponsored several reinvention lab conferences (with another scheduled for March 25-27, 1996) and has periodically published information about the labs. It has also developed a lab database using information voluntarily submitted by the labs identifying their agencies, location, contact persons, and other general information about the reinvention efforts.", "However, consistent with its overall philosophy, the NPR task force has avoided control mechanisms and has consciously taken a \u201chands-off\u201d approach to the development and oversight of the labs. NPR officials said it is up to each agency to decide whether it will have any labs and, if so, how they should be structured and operated. The NPR task force has not required agencies to notify it when labs are created or to report to NPR on their progress. In fact, the task force recommended that labs not be required to file progress reports with their agencies\u2019 management. Overall, agencies have been allowed to operate reinvention labs as they believe appropriate, without top-down control or interference from the task force. The task force views its role as encouraging federal agencies to establish reinvention labs and highlighting those labs that are \u201csuccess stories\u201d and that focus on customer service.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has played less of a role in the reinvention lab effort than the NPR task force. OMB has not been involved in the labs\u2019 designation or their oversight and does not collect or disseminate information about the labs. However, OMB officials said that OMB program examiners are generally aware of the existence of labs in the agencies for which the examiners have responsibility.", "OMB is responsible for providing management leadership across the executive branch and therefore can be important to the implementation of NPR management improvement ideas. In fact, OMB has already begun to play that role in some areas. For example, during the fiscal year 1996 budget cycle, OMB stressed agency downsizing plans and the use of performance information\u2014key elements of the overall NPR effort\u2014during its reviews of agencies\u2019 budget submissions. OMB itself was \u201creinvented\u201d as part of the NPR effort when its budget analysis, management review, and policy development roles were integrated into a new structure designed to improve the decisionmaking process and the oversight of executive branch operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Specific Definition of a Reinvention Lab", "paragraphs": ["After the Vice President\u2019s April 1993 letter, each federal agency was made responsible for designating organizational units, programs, or new or ongoing initiatives as reinvention labs. Although their comments in the intervening period provide some indication of what kinds of reinvention projects they envisioned, neither the Vice President nor the NPR task force has established specific criteria defining a lab.", "\u201ce hope this process will involve not only the thousands of federal employees now at work on Reinvention Teams and in Reinvention Labs, but millions more who are not yet engaged. We hope it will transform the habits, culture, and performance of all federal organizations.\u201d", "In October 1993, representatives from reinvention labs at a number of agencies attended a conference in Hunt Valley, MD, at which they discussed their ideas and experiences. One of the key topics of discussion at the conference was, \u201cWhat is a reinvention lab?\u201d The conference proceedings stated that a lab \u201cis a place that cuts through \u2019red tape,\u2019 exceeds customer expectations, and unleashes innovations for improvement from its employees.\u201d The proceedings listed five areas of consensus about the characteristics of a reinvention lab: (1) vision (continually improving value to customers); (2) leadership (unleashing the creativity and wisdom in everyone); (3) empowerment (providing employee teams with resources, mission, and accountability); (4) incentives (offering timely \u201ccarrots\u201d for innovation and risk-taking); and (5) accountability (ensuring the customer is always right). The Vice President said that reinvention labs were doing the same things as the rest of the agencies, \u201conly they\u2019re doing them faster.\u201d", "Several of the Vice President\u2019s and NPR officials\u2019 comments about the reinvention labs centered on the labs\u2019 ability to avoid complying with regulations that could encumber their efforts. As noted previously, the Vice President told agencies in his April 1993 letter that regulations should be replaced with \u201cincentives\u201d in the labs. NPR officials also told the reinvention labs that they should be provided freedom from regulations. A number of the comments at the Hunt Valley conference focused on eliminating red tape and unnecessary regulations.", "Another recurring theme in the Vice President\u2019s comments and NPR publications has been the need to communicate about lab results. At the Hunt Valley conference, the Vice President said that reinvention labs \u201cwill need to share what they learn and forge alliances for change.\u201d A 1993 NPR report also voiced support for spreading reinvention ideas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Contemporaneous Reform Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Reinvention labs are but one of a number of efforts initiated in recent years by the administration or Congress to reform the operation of the federal government. Because these other reform efforts were being implemented at the same time that the reinvention labs were being initiated, they may have affected the labs\u2019 development.", "For example, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), enacted in August 1993, was designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs by establishing a system to set goals for program performance and to measure results. GPRA requires federal agencies to (1) establish 5-year strategic plans by September 30, 1997; (2) prepare annual plans setting performance goals beginning with fiscal year 1999; and (3) report annually on actual performance toward achieving those goals, beginning in March 2000. As a result of GPRA\u2019s requirements, greater emphasis is to be placed on the results or outcomes of federal programs. OMB is responsible for leading the GPRA implementation effort and has designated more than 70 programs and agencies as pilots.", "As noted previously, the reinvention lab effort was initiated in 1993 at about the same time that the original NPR recommendations were being developed. As part of that effort, the 1993 NPR report said that the civilian, nonpostal workforce could be reduced by 252,000 positions during a 5-year period. The report said these cuts would be made possible by changes in agencies\u2019 work processes and would bring the federal workforce to its lowest level since the mid-1960s. In 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act, which mandated an even greater 5-year workforce reduction of 272,900. The September 1995 NPR status report estimated that more than 160,000 jobs had already been eliminated from the federal government.", "In December 1994, the administration launched a second phase of the NPR effort, referred to as NPR II. One aspect of NPR II was an agency-restructuring initiative in which the Vice President asked the heads of each agency to reexamine all of their agencies\u2019 functions and determine what functions could be eliminated, privatized, devolved to state or local governments, or implemented in a different way. The agencies developed a total of 186 agency-restructuring recommendations, which were aggregated and published in the September 1995 NPR status report. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed consolidating 60 grant programs into 3, giving greater flexibility to governors and mayors.", "There have also been several recent congressional proposals to reform the federal government. For example, in May 1995, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held hearings on proposals for the elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Energy, and Education. In February 1995, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities proposed merging the Departments of Education and Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into a single department. There has also been a proposal to combine elements of the Departments of Commerce and Energy with the Environmental Protection Agency and other independent agencies to create a Department of Science."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Comprehensive Review of Lab Efforts Has Been Published", "paragraphs": ["Although reinventing government and the NPR effort have been frequently discussed in the professional literature, relatively little has been written about reinvention labs. In the Brookings Institution\u2019s Inside the Reinvention Machine: Appraising Governmental Reform, one author briefly mentioned several agencies\u2019 labs and said they were but one component in the agencies\u2019 reinvention efforts. She also said the labs frequently were \u201cbottom-up\u201d reform processes, sending a message to the staff that we\u2019re all in this together. Another author in this volume said that the labs \u201crepresent exciting innovations in the federal government\u201d and that they were generating \u201can impressive amount of fresh ideas and information about how government workers can do their jobs better.\u201dHowever, he also noted that there had been no systematic survey of what the labs had accomplished.", "An article exclusively about reinvention labs described the lab effort as being a struggle between advocates for change and those individuals with power within the agencies. The author describes labs at several agencies (e.g., the Departments of Agriculture and Education and the General Services Administration), noting that in some cases entire agencies have become labs (e.g., the Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Other articles have briefly discussed the activities of a few reinvention labs, but no research efforts have systematically collected information about all of the labs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We initiated this review of the reinvention labs as part of our ongoing body of work examining NPR issues. The objectives of this review were to determine (1) the focus and developmental status of the labs, (2) the factors that hindered or assisted the development of the labs, (3) whether the labs were collecting performance data, and (4) whether the labs had achieved any results.", "We addressed all of these objectives by conducting a telephone and fax survey of all of the reinvention labs. However, to design and conduct the survey, we had to obtain preliminary information from the NPR task force, agencies, and some of the labs themselves.", "We obtained information from the NPR task force\u2019s database about the labs\u2019 locations, their developmental status, subject areas covered, and a contact person at each of the lab sites. As of February 1995, NPR\u2019s database indicated that there were 172 labs. However, NPR\u2019s database did not include some labs and double-counted others. After contacting officials responsible for the labs in each of the agencies that the task force reported had ongoing efforts, we later concluded there were 185 labs active as of early 1995.", "The NPR task force told us that the regional labs were further along in the implementation process than the labs in the Washington, D.C., area. Therefore, we conducted a structured interview of the regional labs by telephone in the summer of 1994 to obtain information on their status, the type of procedure or process being reinvented, and any results the labs had produced. Using the information obtained from these contacts, we selected 12 labs to visit on the basis of two criteria: (1) labs that represented a variety of procedures or processes being reinvented (e.g., procurement, personnel, financial management, or general operations); and (2) labs that had generally progressed to at least the planning stage. We visited each of these 12 labs and obtained detailed information concerning each of our objectives. We developed case studies on each of the 12 labs and subsequently sent them to both the lab officials from whom we gathered the data and the agencies\u2019 headquarters for their review and comment. Their comments were incorporated into the final version of the case studies. (For a list of these labs, see app. I. See apps. II through XIII for the full case studies.)", "We then conducted two surveys of all 185 of the labs\u2014first a telephone then a fax survey\u2014and received responses from 181 of the labs (98 percent). The telephone survey was primarily designed to obtain a general description and overview of the labs\u2019 operations. We sent the second survey to the respondents by fax after the completion of the telephone survey. If a lab focused on more than one area for reinvention (i.e., the lab was engaged in multiple lines of effort), we asked the respondent to focus his or her answers to the fax survey on the lab\u2019s primary line of effort. (See app. I for a list of the labs by agency and subject category.)", "The fax survey consisted primarily of structured multiple-choice items that focused on each of our objectives. (See app. XIV for copies of the telephone and fax surveys.) Questions focused on such issues as the lab\u2019s developmental status and the nature and extent of performance data being collected. We also asked questions about a number of factors that could affect the labs\u2019 development\u2014e.g., waivers from certain regulations, communication with other labs and the NPR task force, and agency management support. On the basis of comments made by lab officials during our site visits, we selected these factors for specific follow-up in the survey phase of our work. They may not cover all possible factors affecting lab development.", "We did not independently verify the information we received from any of the information sources\u2014the NPR task force, the site visits, the telephone survey, or the fax survey. For example, if a survey respondent said that his or her lab had collected performance data or had communicated with other labs, we did not assess those data or check with the other labs. However, we did collect some relevant documents or data regarding these issues during our site visits to the 12 labs.", "We conducted our work between June 1994 and August 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The telephone and fax surveys were administered between April and July 1995, so the survey data are as of those dates. Although we attempted to survey all of the reinvention labs in the federal government, we cannot be sure that the 185 labs we contacted included all agencies\u2019 labs. Others may have been active at the time of our survey, but we were not aware of them either because of the lack of a specific definition for reinvention labs, the NPR task force did not keep an accurate record on the number of operating labs, or we were denied access to agency officials. In one instance, we were unable to verify the existence of a lab appearing on NPR\u2019s list as being at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) because a CIA official said that it was their standard policy to deny GAO access to CIA reinvention activities. Also, other labs may have been developed since the survey was conducted.", "We submitted a draft of each case study to the relevant lab and agency headquarters officials for their review and have incorporated their comments into the final version of each appendix. On December 27, 1995, we submitted a draft of this report to the Vice President (as head of the NPR effort) and to the Director of OMB for their review and comment.

Aside from the general parameters of customer service and employee empowerment, few restrictions were placed on the labs\u2019 initiation or development.", "Federal agencies responded to the Vice President\u2019s call for the creation of reinvention labs in earnest. Labs were designated in dozens of agencies and in virtually every region of the country. Our survey indicated that the labs varied widely in terms of their origin, their stage of development at the time of the survey, the number of reinvention efforts addressed by each lab, and the subject areas covered by the labs. Also, although many of the labs shared a common customer service focus, they differed in who they defined as their customers.

Some large agencies had relatively few labs (e.g., the Department of Veterans Affairs); while some comparatively small agencies had initiated a number of labs, e.g., the General Services Administration (GSA). Some agencies that serve the public directly and that had been the subject of both the 1993 and 1995 NPR recommendations had not started any labs at the time of the survey (e.g., the Small Business Administration).", "Figure 2.1 and table 2.2 show the number of reinvention labs at the time of our survey within each standard federal region. As the figure illustrates, labs had been established in virtually every federal region, but the mid-Atlantic region (region 3) had over two-thirds of the labs. Most of these labs were located in the Washington, D.C., area, but some affected operations in other areas. Relatively few labs were located in the northeast (regions 1 and 2) or the northwest (region 10). Some of the labs were operated in multiple locations within a single region. For example, one HUD lab effort had several sites that included HUD\u2019s offices at Chicago, Milwaukee, and Cleveland. (See app. VIII for a discussion of this lab.) Other labs had multiple sites located in different standard federal regions.

(Survey respondents were allowed to identify more than one type of data for their labs.) The respondents most commonly said their labs were collecting data on the units\u2019 outputs (77 percent) and/or were collecting informal comments from staff or customers (69 percent). Other frequent responses were customer opinion survey data (57 percent), outcome data (52 percent), and staff opinion survey data (40 percent).

Analysis of the labs\u2019 stage of development and whether or not they collected data supports the lab officials\u2019 opinion that it was too early in the reinvention process to be collecting performance data. As shown in figure 4.2, nearly 90 percent of the labs that were at least fully implemented at the lab site said they had collected or were collecting performance data. In contrast, only about half of the labs in the planning or beginning implementation stages of development had collected or were collecting such data.", "A more detailed breakdown of the responses from fully implemented labs further demonstrates this relationship between stage of development and data collection. As figure 4.3 shows, although more than three-fourths of the labs implemented at only the lab site were collecting performance data, over 90 percent of the labs implemented at the lab site and beyond were collecting such data. Therefore, the more developed the lab, the more likely that it would have collected performance data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Respondents Indicated Data Not Needed or Used", "paragraphs": ["Although most of the survey respondents indicated their labs were collecting performance data, 14 percent of the respondents who said their labs were not collecting such data said they did not do so because gathering performance data was not seen as essential to their labs\u2019 efforts. For example, lab officials from GSA\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Office and the Commerce Department\u2019s Boulder reinvention lab said that efforts to measure \u201cobvious improvements\u201d were unnecessary. One official from the Boulder lab said that data collection efforts should be concentrated on those changes in which outcomes are more dubious. Other officials from this lab said that they had planned to use the agency\u2019s Inspector General to monitor the lab\u2019s progress, but the Inspector General told them that many of the lab\u2019s changes were based on common sense and, therefore, did not require measurement to prove their worthiness.

However, not all of the data the labs collected appear to have been used. For example, officials from USDA\u2019s lab reinventing the baggage inspection operations in Miami said that they had collected data that could have been used to judge the lab\u2019s performance, but the data were never used by anyone in the agency or the lab for that purpose.

Examples of customer service improvements follow: \u2022 VA\u2019s New York Regional Office claims processing lab said that the average amount of time veterans had to wait before being seen for an interview had been reduced from about 20 minutes before the lab to less than 3 minutes after the lab was established. Lab officials also said that VA employees had greater control and more authority and found their jobs much more satisfying. (See app. XIII.) \u2022 VA\u2019s reinvention lab at the Zablocki Medical Center in Milwaukee said two surveys\u2014one of physicians and the other of patients and their family members\u2014indicated that customer satisfaction had improved as a result of the lab\u2019s effort to coordinate veterans\u2019 outpatient and inpatient care by teaming social workers with primary care physicians. (See app. XII.) \u2022 DOE\u2019s reinvention lab at the Hanford site in Washington State said that the lab had reduced the safeguard and security budget by $29 million over a 4-year period by changing the installation\u2019s security operations from a large paramilitary organization that supported a national defense mission to an industrial-style organization that supports environmental cleanup. (See app. V.) \u2022 HUD\u2019s reinvention lab in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Cleveland said that by developing partnerships with public housing authorities the lab had improved the satisfaction of the public housing residents.

(See app. VIII.) \u2022 DLA\u2019s lab said the lab reduced the agency\u2019s overall pharmaceutical inventories by $48.6 million and achieved similar inventory reductions and cost savings at DOD medical facilities.

The survey respondents indicated that the labs generally were established to do what the Vice President suggested in his April 1993 letter to federal departments and agencies\u2014improve customer service; address specific problems; and, ultimately, improve the operation of federal agencies. Because many of the labs had not been implemented at the time of our review, it is too early to tell whether they will accomplish these goals. Even for the labs that the respondents said had been fully implemented, it may take years before it can be determined whether the changes will have a long-lasting effect on federal agencies beyond the lab site. Also, because there is not a specific definition of a reinvention lab or guidance from either the NPR task force or OMB as to how labs should operate, few clear criteria exist against which to judge the labs\u2019 performance. Nevertheless, some preliminary observations about the labs are possible based on comments the Vice President and others have made about the labs and the information developed during this review.", "For example, the Vice President said that the labs should ideally be initiated where the government serves the public in a highly visible way. Although virtually all of the survey respondents indicated that improving customer service was a primary goal of their labs, they did not always define their labs\u2019 customers as the public. In fact, lab officials most commonly viewed their labs\u2019 customers as other governmental organizations, and, for some of the labs, a government organization was their only customer. Although the linkage of these labs to the public may not have been as direct as the Vice President envisioned, the public or the agency\u2019s constituency appeared to be at least indirectly served in virtually all of the labs.", "Although the survey respondents indicated that the labs\u2019 changes represented a substantially different mode of operation, the scope of the reforms being developed in the labs was relatively narrow compared to the sweeping changes contemplated by GPRA, the NPR II agency-restructuring recommendations, and the congressional proposals to consolidate agencies\u2019 functions or eliminate agencies entirely. However, the labs\u2019 comparatively narrow scope is a natural consequence of the Vice President\u2019s charge that they \u201creengineer work processes.\u201d Agencies and employees were not asked to suggest macro-level changes, such as whether entire agencies or programs should be abolished or whether multiple agencies should be merged into a single structure. Ultimately, though, the diffusion and widespread adoption of the labs\u2019 reengineering proposals could lead to the \u201cfundamental culture change\u201d that the Vice President envisioned in 1993.", "At the beginning of the lab effort, a number of observers indicated that a key factor in the success of the effort would be the labs\u2019 ability to obtain waivers from federal regulations. Although the respondents said many labs sought and received regulatory waivers, a large number of the efforts were able to be implemented without such waivers. Some lab officials said they believed waivers would be needed, but they later discovered that they already had the authority needed to change their work processes. Although some impediments to the labs were clearly real, the experiences of those officials suggest that at least some barriers to organizational change may be more a function of perception than reality.", "Most of the survey respondents said they were collecting performance data to measure the effect of their labs\u2019 reinvented work processes. However, some of the respondents\u2019 comments raised questions about their commitment to measuring performance or the quality of the data being collected. Some lab officials said that either they or other agency officials did not believe that the collection of performance data was necessary or worthwhile. Other lab officials said that they had difficulty developing measures of performance or that data had been collected but had not been used by decisionmakers. One of the most common types of data reportedly being collected by the labs was informal comments from customers or staff\u2014anecdotal data that are not measurable and, therefore, may not be convincing to skeptics of the reinvention process.", "Of particular concern to us are the labs that were reportedly collecting data about their reinvention efforts but had not collected similar types of data before the start of their labs. Without such pre-lab data, lab officials have no baseline for documenting a lab\u2019s effects and therefore will find it difficult, if not impossible, to reach persuasive conclusions about the lab\u2019s effects. The absence of both pre- and post-lab data will also make it difficult to support expanding a lab\u2019s changes to the rest of its agency or to other organizations. Development of pre-lab performance measures is particularly important for the substantial number of labs reportedly still in the planning stage.", "Nevertheless, the reinvention lab effort has produced hundreds of ideas to reengineer work processes and improve agencies\u2019 performance\u2014ideas drawn from employees with hands-on experience in operating government programs. Many of the labs are addressing issues that are at the cutting edge of government management, such as how agencies can use technology to improve their operations; how they can be more self-sufficient in an era of tight budgetary resources; and how agencies can work in partnership with other agencies, other levels of government, or the private sector to solve problems. This progress notwithstanding, even more innovations are possible in these and other areas as agencies review and rethink their existing work processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Moving Beyond the Labs", "paragraphs": ["The labs we surveyed were at varying stages of development.

However, relatively few of the labs\u2019 proposals had been implemented beyond the original lab site.", "The types of assistance the labs need depend on their stage of development. Labs that are in the planning or developmental stages need the support, encouragement, and, at times, the protection that a \u201cchange agent\u201d in a position of influence can provide. Governmentwide, the Vice President and the NPR task force have attempted to perform that role. There have also been change agents within particular agencies that have encouraged and supported the labs\u2019 development.", "Labs that have been fully implemented, particularly those that have demonstrated ways to save money and/or improve federal operations, need a different type of assistance if the ideas they represent are to spread beyond the lab sites. Nonlab organizations both within the labs\u2019 agencies and in other agencies need to become aware of the labs, recognize the applicability and value of the ideas the labs represent to their own organizations, and learn from the labs\u2019 experiences. As the Vice President said, for the labs to achieve their full potential they \u201cwill need to share what they learn and forge alliances for change.\u201d The real value of the labs will be realized only when the operational improvements they initiated, tested, and validated achieve wider adoption. Also, by learning from the labs\u2019 experiences, other organizations can avoid the pitfalls that some of the labs experienced. Sharing this information will keep other organizations from having to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d as they reinvent their work processes. If the changes the labs represent end at the lab sites, a valuable resource will have been wasted. Therefore, communication about the labs is crucial to the long-term success of this part of the overall reinvention effort.", "However, the survey respondents indicated that relatively few labs have had substantial communication either with other labs or with the NPR task force. Also, although it has encouraged the labs\u2019 development and made certain information available about them, the NPR task force has not actively solicited information from the labs, has encouraged agencies to focus on reinventing rather than reporting, and has not systematically contacted the labs to provide them with information or direction. As a result, the NPR task force was not able to provide us with an accurate listing of all of the labs. The task force\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d approach to the reinvention lab effort was a conscious decision by NPR officials not to micromanage the labs and impose a top-down \u201ccommand and control\u201d structure. This approach, while appropriate to encourage and empower employees and agencies to find the solutions they believe most appropriate to reengineer their work processes, may not be the best strategy for moving the labs\u2019 results beyond their experimental environments. Furthermore, there is no certainty that the NPR task force will still be in existence when some of the labs reach maturity.", "Therefore, we believe that some type of information \u201cclearinghouse,\u201d placed in a relatively stable environment, is needed to allow other organizations to become aware of the labs and to learn about the labs\u2019 experiences. The clearinghouse could, among other things, provide information and guidance to labs on the development of appropriate performance measures, including baseline data against which the labs\u2019 performance could be judged. A number of federal organizations could conceivably perform this clearinghouse role. For example, OMB\u2019s responsibility for providing management leadership across the executive branch makes it a candidate to serve as the clearinghouse.
