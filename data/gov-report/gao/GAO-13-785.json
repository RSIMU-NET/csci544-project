The act also requires that GAO review DOD's report and submit any findings to the congressional defense committees. In response to this mandate, GAO examined (1) DOD's April 2013 reporting of a risk-based assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Aerospace Control Alert mission as they relate to expected future changes to the budget and force structure of that mission and (2) the extent to which DOD has reported the total cost of the Aerospace Control Alert mission. GAO reviewed DOD's April 2013 report to Congress and Aerospace Control Alert budget justification displays, and interviewed knowledgeable DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its April 2013 report to Congress, the Department of Defense (DOD) did not provide any new analyses, but provided the results of previous analyses related to the Aerospace Control Alert mission because, according to DOD officials, DOD was not expecting any future changes to the budget or force structure of the mission, including consideration of any basing location alternatives. DOD's April 2013 report summarized the results of three risk assessments that were conducted to support DOD's 2012 decision on which two alert basing locations could be removed from 24-hour alert status with the least amount of risk. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the Office of the Secretary of Defense Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, and the Continental U.S. NORAD Region performed these assessments and all concluded that, given the 2012 DOD decision that two alert basing locations would be removed from 24-hour alert status, the removal of the locations at Duluth, Minnesota, and Langley, Virginia, would provide the least increase in risk. DOD's April 2013 report also summarized a cost savings estimate developed after the decision to remove these basing locations from 24-hour alert status.", "Along with the submission of DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2010-14, the Air Force reported cost information for components of the Aerospace Control Alert mission in budget displays required by the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, but DOD did not report the comprehensive cost of the Aerospace Control Alert mission. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that financial information is needed for periodic external reporting and, on a day-to-day basis, to make operating decisions, monitor performance, and allocate resources. The Air Force provided budget displays containing information related to Air Force and Air National Guard military personnel costs, flying hours, and certain other costs along with DOD's budget justification materials for fiscal years 2010-14. However, DOD did not report other military service costs associated with the Aerospace Control Alert mission. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 now requires, in addition to the Air Force cost information required by the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, that DOD provide a consolidated budget justification display that fully identifies the Aerospace Control Alert budget for each of the military services and encompasses all programs and activities of the Aerospace Control Alert mission for each of the following: procurement; operations and maintenance; research, development, testing, and evaluation; and military construction. According to DOD officials, such a display is being developed for inclusion with the fiscal year 2015 budget submission. These consolidated budget displays should help provide a more complete picture of Aerospace Control Alert mission costs. However, other military personnel costs, including those associated with the Army and the Army National Guard personnel providing ground-based air defense capabilities, support the mission as well. Inclusion of this information, in addition to the information required in the budget justification displays, could provide decision makers with more comprehensive cost information to make fully informed resource allocation decisions to support the Aerospace Control Alert mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD, as it expands its cost reporting in response to current reporting requirements, ensure that all personnel costs related to the Aerospace Control Alert mission, including those of the Army and Army National Guard, are included in DOD's budget displays.

One such mission is the Aerospace Control  Alert mission, which includes military forces arrayed in a rapid response  posture to conduct both air sovereignty and air defense operations  against airborne threats over the United States and Canada. These  forces include fighter aircraft and personnel available 24 hours a day,  every day, to deter, respond to, and if necessary defeat airborne threats  at 16 Aerospace Control Alert basing locations across the contiguous  United States as well as in Alaska and Hawaii. These alert basing  locations make up a portion of the Aerospace Control Alert mission and  include pilots, command and control personnel, fighter aircraft, refueling  tankers, airborne early warning aircraft, and aircraft maintenance  personnel. The Army and the U.S. Coast Guard also support the  Aerospace Control Alert mission; the Army provides ground-based air  defense systems and personnel while the U.S. Coast Guard provides  alert helicopters. The Aerospace Control Alert mission represents the last  line of the air defense of the United States. In 2012, in response to the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s efficiency initiatives, DOD decided that its  Aerospace Control Alert basing locations in Duluth, Minnesota, and in  Langley, Virginia, could be taken off 24-hour alert status, with minimal  impact on overall mission capabilities.", "We previously reported on improvements and challenges regarding the  planning and management of the Aerospace Control Alert mission,  including challenges faced by the North American Aerospace Defense  Command (NORAD) and DOD in their ability to balance risks, costs, and  benefits associated with that mission. Specifically, in January 2009, we  reported on shortcomings in DOD\u2019s approach to the mission, including  NORAD\u2019s difficulty in determining the appropriate numbers and types of  units, personnel, and aircraft for the mission. In January 2012, we  reported again on the Aerospace Control Alert mission and noted that  NORAD had not included a prioritized list of metropolitan areas and  critical infrastructure in its risk assessments and that it did not incorporate  into these assessments assumptions associated with all three elements  of risk: threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Finally, in February 2013,  we reported on the analyses DOD used to support its decision to take the  alert basing locations in Duluth, Minnesota, and in Langley, Virginia, off  24-hour alert status. Our report summarized the three risk assessments  conducted by DOD to inform the decision of which of the basing locations,  once removed from 24-hour alert status, would have the least impact on  operational effectiveness. Our report also summarized the estimated cost  savings that DOD expected as a result of these changes.", "Effective January 2013, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2013 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to  Congress, not later than April 1, 2013, that provided a cost-benefit  analysis and risk-based assessment of the Aerospace Control Alert  mission as it relates to expected future changes to the budget and force  structure of such mission. On April 18, 2013, DOD submitted its report to Congress. The act also requires that GAO conduct a review of the DOD  report and submit a report on the findings of that review to the  congressional defense committees. In response to this mandate, we  examined (1) DOD\u2019s reporting of a risk-based assessment and cost- benefit analysis of the Aerospace Control Alert mission as they relate to  expected future changes to the budget and force structure of the mission  and (2) the extent to which DOD has reported the total cost of the  Aerospace Control Alert mission.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed relevant documents and  interviewed knowledgeable officials from DOD\u2019s Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs, Office of  the Secretary of Defense Office of Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, Joint Staff, NORAD/U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Pacific  Command, Departments of the Army and Air Force, National Guard  Bureau and Air National Guard, Continental U.S. NORAD Region (a  component of NORAD that directs aerospace control for the continental  United States, with the exception of Alaska), and U.S. Army North. To  examine DOD\u2019s reporting of a risk-based assessment and cost-benefit  analysis in the April 2013 DOD Report on the Aerospace Control Alert  Mission Cost-Benefit Analysis and Risk-Based Assessment, we examined  the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis information contained in the  2013 DOD report and supporting documentation and testimonial evidence  provided by DOD during the course of our review. To examine the extent  to which DOD reported the total cost of the Aerospace Control Alert  mission, we analyzed the costs included in Air Force budget displays for  the Aerospace Control Alert mission for fiscal year 2010 through fiscal  year 2014 and compared this information with mission-related costs identified during the course of our review by DOD officials associated with  the mission, as well as with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2013 until September  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Following a decision by DOD that two alert basing locations should be taken off 24- hour alert status, three risk assessments were conducted to support the  2012 decision of which two locations, once removed from 24-hour alert  status, would have the least amount of increase in risk to the overall  Aerospace Control Alert mission. DOD\u2019s April 2013 report provided a  summary of the final results of these three risk assessments. These risk  assessments were performed by NORAD, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, and the  Continental U.S. NORAD Region, which included consideration of threat,  vulnerability, and consequence. All three of these assessments came to  similar conclusions regarding which of the two alert locations would cause  the least increase in risk if taken off of 24-hour alert status.", "NORAD\u2019s risk assessment analysis was based on quantitative modeling  of fighter basing and, in our February 2013 report, we noted that NORAD  had improved its risk analysis by changing some of the assumptions used   We also discussed the  to address vulnerability and consequence.separate analysis conducted by the Office of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation, which similarly relied on modeling to aid its  evaluation of risk.

The report states that these  estimated cost savings are primarily from shifting personnel from full-time  to part-time status at the two sites no longer on 24-hour alert status.
