Given the cost difference of between $500 and $740 per day per bed between rural hospitals and the Medical College of Georgia, cost savings resulting from telemedicine may be significant. In Minnesota, a managed health care company and a rural health care company formed a partnership to develop a rural telemedicine network. As part of this network, eight rural hospitals were connected to a larger community hospital for emergency room consultations.

For example, Tingay Dental Clinic at Fort Gordon, Georgia, used telemedicine to provide specialized dental consultations to active duty personnel at Forts McPherson and Benning, Georgia; Fort McClellen, Alabama; Soto Cano Air Force Base, Honduras; Gorgas Army Hospital, Panama; and the Naval Dental Detachment, Key West, Florida. Without these consultations, the soldiers would have to take time away from duty and travel for specialized dental care. A study done by the clinic showed that soldiers at Fort McPherson saved at least one-half day away from duty for each consultation.", "A telemedicine project at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, decreased the amount of time a soldier missed basic training. Typically, a soldier on sick call would lose a whole day of training because of the time to drive to the clinic, wait to see the physician, get a prescription filled, and return to the field. Of 101 soldiers seen via telemedicine, about 20 percent returned to training without going to the clinic. DOD officials believe that as the practitioners get more familiar with the equipment and the medical procedures are streamlined, more than 50 percent of the soldiers will be able to return to training without going to the clinic."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Savings May Be Offset by Infrastructure Costs and Increased Use", "paragraphs": ["Although some data show that telemedicine can save costs, other data indicate that there is a high cost for using telemedicine both in total dollars and per consultation.

For example, the infrastructure start-up, equipment, and operational costs for DOD\u2019s telemedicine deployment to Bosnia are estimated to total about $30 million, and only about 60 consultations, excluding teleradiology cases, have been performed to date. Also, recurring basic telemedicine line charges in rural communities can run about $1,500 a month. Various officials expressed concern whether the volume of rural telemedicine consultations can ever be high enough to pay the recurring line charges as well as initial equipment expenditures.", "Another factor that will affect the cost of telemedicine is increased utilization by persons who previously did not have access to such care. According to the Institute of Medicine\u2019s report on telemedicine, home monitoring via telemedicine may result in earlier identification and treatment of problems that would be more costly to treat if not caught early, but it may also identify more borderline problems that would generate more home or office visits.", "The potential cost impact of inappropriate utilization of health services via telemedicine is a concern for many third-party payers, such a Medicare. These concerns are not as apparent in managed health care settings, including DOD and VA, where many costs are fixed, including physician salaries. On the other hand, fee-for-service providers receive their income from the volume and type of services provided. In such settings, some providers may use complex and costly medical technologies when less costly techniques may suffice.", "Without a payment support mechanism, infrastructure or health care providers may not consider telemedicine alone to be capable of delivering a sufficient return to justify their investment. However, if multiple applications are available to use the infrastructure, such as those related to business, education, or entertainment, the infrastructure cost can be shared among the various users.", "Officials at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) are also concerned that Medicare expenditures could significantly increase if Medicare were to begin reimbursing for telemedicine consultations. Various reports have cited an estimate that telemedicine consultations could increase the total Medicare budget by $30 billion to $40 billion annually by the year 2000. Our review found no evidence to support this increase.

However, the study noted that because of limitations, such as lack of follow-up and outcome data, response time, and user satisfaction, the data may provide limited results. Additionally, the exclusion of incomplete records may have also skewed the results. For example, the use of telemedicine may have precluded air evacuations, but there was little or no information on whether the patient had a worse outcome or needed evacuation after the consultation. Because of the lack of a central records system, it was impossible to follow individual cases to determine case outcomes.", "This study also noted that the types of patients seen in operations other than war differ from those seen in active combat, suggesting that the results may not be indicative of the benefits of battlefield telemedicine. For example, combat support hospitals are staffed to treat previously healthy young soldiers suffering from trauma and are not configured for pediatric patients and chronic infectious disease cases. The study concluded that further analysis may help determine if a combat support hospital in an operation other than war needs modification. It also suggested that the large number of dermatology consultations may indicate that dermatologists should routinely deploy with combat support hospitals.", "During its Advanced Warfighter Experiments in 1994 and 1996, the Army Medical Department demonstrated that medics using lightweight, hands-free, two-way radios were able to communicate with medical officers at battalion aid stations to provide lifesaving medical treatment. This communication impacted the number of soldiers who may have never been evacuated off the battlefield. However, few trends become apparent from analyzing the data from the different experiments. Some data showed that medics utilized the consultations more if the number of casualties was small. As the number of casualties increased, consultations went down. Because the time required to treat each casualty increased, other wounded could die while the medic was in a consultation. The Joint Warfighter Interoperability Demonstrations showed that the different services\u2019 medical communication systems were incompatible with each other and the warfighter.", "Early rural health demonstrations have also provided some lessons learned about network structure, personnel, funding, and equipment considerations when establishing telemedicine networks.

In the United States, physicians must be licensed in each state in which they practice medicine to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. One issue facing many states is whether a physician who provides medical advice to someone in another state via telemedicine is in effect practicing medicine in the patient\u2019s state. Another issue is that obtaining and maintaining licenses in other states can be a time-consuming and expensive effort.", "For physicians who regularly or frequently engage in the practice of medicine across state lines, the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, a private organization, developed a model act in April 1996 that would create a special license for physicians to practice telemedicine in a state where they are not currently licensed. If the model act is adopted by states, this special license could remove the need for physicians to obtain a full license in each state where they practice telemedicine. Physicians who merely consult with other physicians in certain states concerning medical diagnosis and treatment, however, are less likely to encounter licensing barriers than physicians having direct and frequent contact with patients in other states. In opposition to the model act, various national associations, such as the American Medical Association, recommended full and unrestricted licensure by individual states for physicians who wish to practice telemedicine across state lines. In contrast, the National State Board of Nursing has recommended one national license instead of numerous state special licenses.", "Our review of literature and other reports revealed that some states are beginning to restrict medical practice through telemedicine.

It is unclear under what circumstances a remote encounter via telemedicine could subject a practitioner to malpractice litigation in the remote state. For example, one report suggests that the risk of malpractice is heightened when the practitioner is in one location and the patient, in another location, is in the presence of only a nurse or physician\u2019s assistant.

Without some payment support mechanism, infrastructure or health care providers may not consider telemedicine alone to be capable of delivering a sufficient return to justify their investment.

Today, much of the data content exchanged, such as the patient\u2019s relationship to the member, is left to the interpretation of individual managed care organizations; providers must make assumptions when coding claim data elements and frequently use coding standards employed by the provider\u2019s system. According to our 1993 and 1994 reports, these distinctions are very important to the payor and provider, since they can affect which insurance company will be liable for a claim. Also, the Council on Competitiveness\u2019 March 1996 report states that data requirements should be clearly articulated by health care entities, including (1) definitions of the data they need, (2) the format in which they expect to receive such data, (3) the way in which data should be submitted (e.g., electronically), and (4) the frequency with which data should be submitted.", "The standard that allows formatting and exchanging of images and associated information is known as the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine.

Worried that this incompatibility problem could surface again, one of the VA\u2019s Veteran\u2019s Integrated Service Network offices appointed a special committee to handle the procurement needs for all facilities in Alabama.

In 1994 and 1995, the battle lab at Fort Gordon, Georgia, sponsored a Joint Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration in which industry, academia, and others were given an opportunity to demonstrate medical communication products with war-fighter applicability. Several officials associated with the demonstration told us that, during the exercises, some demonstrations were less than successful due to equipment incompatibility. In one demonstration, the Army found that its telemedicine equipment was not compatible with other Army command, control, and communication systems. In another exercise, a joint service demonstration failed because one service\u2019s medical communications equipment could not \u201ctalk\u201d to the others. From the perspective of the Army Signal Corps community, these sorts of impediments could pose serious problems on the battlefield. The Director of Combat Developments at Fort Gordon stated that, during an armed conflict, the Signal Corps assumes command and control over all communication systems, including medical communications. The Signal Corps worries that telemedicine equipment brought to the front will not be able to successfully integrate with the established battlefield communication infrastructures and therefore not be functional during a conflict.", "Also, the emphasis placed on high-technology systems without sufficient consideration of the specific clinical and health care requirements and infrastructure capabilities in each setting has created a poor fit between telemedicine system design and end-user needs. Given the constraints on financial resources in most communities in need of telemedicine services, every effort should be made to design scaleable systems that can serve the immediate and essential clinical and health care needs at minimal cost. Upgrading can follow as further needs are identified and the financial capabilities of communities increase.

In addition to new linkages, more sophisticated telemedicine technologies require the transmission of image data, which places considerable demands on bandwidth communications.", "DOD does not have a dedicated medical communications network. Therefore, telemedicine communications transmissions have to compete with other critical transmissions. In time of war, these requests could be for enemy coordinates or attack and defend commands. An Army official stated that if a medical facility used a secure military satellite to transmit medical information to and from the battlefield during an armed conflict, that facility would lose its neutral zone classification. Under the Geneva Rules of Conduct for Warfare, the enemy can engage any facility transmitting communication data over secured lines. This rule makes medical facilities in theater, normally protected from attack, open to enemy assault.", "Today, the combat medic does not have adequate means for video communication, and military medical treatment facilities have limited bandwidth available for telemedicine communications, both within the theater of operations and with connections to the sustaining base. Further, the Navy has an extremely challenging problem, since all data used must be transmitted and received using data links that are already used to capacity on most ships.

For example, some uninterested doctors reported scheduling difficulties, inability to actually examine patients, and unfamiliarity with the technology as reasons that have deterred them from participating in telemedicine activities.", "During our Georgia case study, various telemedicine officials often spoke about resistance to change. In one instance, medical personnel at a military clinic stated they were reluctant to use the teleradiology system primarily because they preferred having a radiologist on hand that they knew, trusted, and could rely on. In addition, the radiologists at the consulting facility were occasionally slow to respond to requests for consultations. Some physician resistance is due in part to the relative complexity of the systems currently in use. The equipment is not user-friendly; therefore, additional training is required to learn how to operate the equipment. Some VA telemedicine projects have also experienced low utilization because of physician reluctance.", "A 1995 journal article by HHS and the Telemedicine Center, Medical College of Georgia, states that the designs of current systems are driven more by technology than by the needs of physicians. To be successful, the article noted that telemedicine technologies may need to adapt to the needs of physicians and patients, not vice versa. Training was cited as a key component of any successful telemedicine system to help physicians with limited experience and comfort with computers. A June 1994 report of the Council on Medical Service, part of the American Medical Association, cited a need for physician education as it relates to instruction covering the spectrum from basic computer literacy to familiarity with expert diagnostic systems and knowledge databases.

However, it is impossible to determine the full scope of these initiatives. They range from long-term research efforts exploring robotic or telepresence surgery to pilot programs at medical facilities where some clinical application, such as teledentistry, is actually practiced. The most common current clinical application is teleradiology.", "DOD and other federal agencies are actively sponsoring telemedicine projects that individually seem justifiable and fall under the purview of the sponsoring agency\u2019s mission. However, not enough comprehensive, accurate information exists to determine the collective value of these projects. For example, it is difficult to tell whether DOD\u2019s investment is commensurate with the potential benefits it stands to gain. DOD is currently the largest federal investor with $262 million. On a case-by-case basis, many projects seem justifiable, but the collective value of the DOD telemedicine program cannot be easily assessed. In fact, DOD\u2019s telemedicine program is actually the sum of many individual parts and not an interrelated group of projects prioritized to accomplish specific goals. Some agencies, including DOD and VA, have recognized the need for a telemedicine strategy to define their programs but have not moved beyond the conceptual stage. Private sector organizations are reluctant to share their market observations and data for fear of revealing helpful information to their competition. Further, because priorities differ among the public and private sectors, working together is even more difficult without clear and common goals.", "Successful expansion and sustainment of telemedicine will require resolution of many legal and regulatory, financial, technical, and cultural barriers. Some of the more critical barriers, such as licensure, privacy, and infrastructure costs, are too broad and have implications too far-reaching for any single sector to address. On the other hand, some barriers, such as physician acceptance, can be overcome at the local level with proper planning and management. Because federal agencies that directly deliver health care, such as DOD, VA, IHS, and BOP, are less affected by licensure and reimbursement barriers, they are better placed to provide comprehensive information to help determine the course of telemedicine.", "The numerous telemedicine initiatives funded by the public and private sectors could be more productive if they were linked by common goals, such as interdependent utilization of the information superhighway to provide cost-effective and quality health care. Such a goal should complement, not supplant, individual missions, such as improving rural or remote health care delivery, by serving as a vehicle for sharing technical progress and avoiding duplication.

Such efforts should provide a framework to optimize the value of federal telemedicine investments with activities sponsored by the states and private sector.", "Accordingly, we recommend that the Vice President direct JWGT, in consultation with the heads of federal departments and agencies that sponsor telemedicine projects, to propose a federal strategy that would establish near- and long-term national goals and objectives to ensure the cost-effective development and use of telemedicine. In addition, the proposed strategy should include approaches and actions needed to establish a means to formally exchange information or technology among the federal government, state organizations, and private sector; foster collaborative partnerships to take advantage of other telemedicine investments; identify needed technologies that are not being developed by the public or private sector; promote interoperable system designs that would enable telemedicine technologies to be compatible, regardless of where they are developed; encourage adoption of appropriate standardized medical records and data systems so that information may be exchanged among sectors; overcome barriers so that investments can lead to better health care; and encourage federal agencies and departments to develop and implement individual strategic plans to support national goals and objectives.", "Further, because DOD is the major federal telemedicine investor and manages one of the nation\u2019s largest health care systems, it is in a good position to help forge an overall telemedicine strategy. A first step is to develop a departmentwide strategy. Therefore, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense develop and submit to the Congress by February 14, 1998, an overarching telemedicine research and development and operational strategy. The strategy should clearly define the scope of telemedicine in DOD; establish DOD-wide goals and objectives and identify actions and appropriate milestones for achieving them; prioritize and target near- and long-term investments, especially for goals related to combat casualty care and operations other than war; and clarify roles of DOD oversight organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, VA, HHS, and the Office of the Vice President.

Our recommendation was not intended to imply that JWGT direct federal agencies investments in telemedicine initiatives but rather that JWGT develop a roadmap for federal agencies to use as a guide for their investments. HHS also stated that it might be better to require individual departments to develop their own strategies before an overarching federal strategy is proposed. We believe that individual strategies should be developed but that these strategies would not ensure an interagency commitment to common goals and objectives or serve as a guide to prevent duplicative investment efforts.
