Both HHS and Education have also made other guidance and informational resources available to states.", "Officials in child welfare and education agencies in the six selected states reported using a range of approaches to help children affected by trauma, including training staff, screening children, and providing services and support systems. To train child welfare workers, educators, and birth and foster parents to understand trauma and its effects on children, agencies in the six selected states used various approaches, such as learning communities, which include in-person learning and coaching, and online courses. Several state child welfare agencies also used learning communities to train clinicians in trauma-focused therapies. In addition, child welfare and education agencies in five states used screening tools to identify children exposed to and exhibiting symptoms of trauma. Children identified as experiencing trauma are referred for a trauma-informed mental health assessment. Also, to help children affected by trauma, child welfare and education agencies in five of the six states provide support and services. For example, in one state, caseworkers provide specialized services, including weekly visits, to children and families.", "Officials in the six selected states reported facing various challenges in their efforts to support children affected by trauma, and they emphasized the importance of engaged leadership in establishing and sustaining support for these children.

Children can be  exposed to various types of trauma. Any frightening, dangerous, or violent  event that threatens the life or safety of a child or their loved ones can  potentially be traumatic. For example, in fiscal year 2017, HHS reported  that there were approximately 674,000 victims of child maltreatment,  including neglect and physical and sexual abuse. In addition, in 2016,  students ages 12 through 18 experienced an estimated 749,400  victimizations (theft and nonfatal violent victimization) at school and  601,300 victimizations away from school. While not every child who  experiences trauma will suffer lasting effects, studies have shown that for  many there are serious short- and long-term consequences.

The states we selected were  Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Washington, and  Wisconsin. These states were selected based on four criteria: (1)  recommendations from subject-matter experts and federal agency  officials; (2) reviews of state child welfare and education agency websites  to locate statewide initiatives to support children affected by trauma; (3)  variation in state child welfare system administrative frameworks (two  state-administered, three county-administered, and one hybrid partially  administered by the state and partially administered by counties); and (4)  geographic diversity. We spoke with state child welfare officials in all six  states and with state education and Medicaid   officials in four states. Also, in each state we selected two localities and  interviewed local officials from the respective child welfare and education  agencies, where practicable. These localities were selected based on  recommendations from state officials and geographic diversity (one urban  and one rural). In addition, we interviewed officials from other selected  state and local agencies and organizations, such as departments of  health, interagency trauma groups, universities, and hospitals, as  appropriate.

These experiences may overwhelm a child\u2019s natural  ability to cope and can cause stress reactions in children, including  feelings of intense fear, terror, and helplessness. When children are  exposed to chronic stressful events, their neurodevelopment can be  disrupted. As a result, a child\u2019s cognitive functioning or ability to cope with  negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired, causing long-term harm  to their physical, social, and emotional well-being. These adverse  effects may include changes in a child\u2019s emotional responses; ability to  think, learn, and concentrate; impulse control; self-image; attachments to  caregivers; and relationships with others. Traumatic experiences have  been linked to a wide range of health-related conditions, including  addiction, depression and anxiety, and risk-taking behavior, and may also  increase the likelihood of chronic ill health conditions, such as obesity,  diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and even early death. Not all children will  experience all of these effects. Children\u2019s responses to traumatic events  are unique and affected by many factors, including their age at the time of  the event, the frequency and perceived severity of trauma, and the child\u2019s  innate sensitivity, as well as protective factors such as the presence of  positive relationships with healthy caregivers, physical health, and natural  coping skills.", "While all children can be affected by trauma, trauma is common among  children who enter the child welfare system. Many of these children  have been abused or neglected, and involvement in the child welfare  system, primarily through placements into a foster care home, may cause  additional trauma due to the separation from family; changes in school  placement, neighborhood, and community; as well as fear and uncertainty  about the future. Child welfare experts generally believe that child welfare  systems that use trauma-informed approaches are better able to  address children\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being needs. Although  trauma-informed frameworks may vary, they generally include  interventions as well as a change in culture; thus if an agency or  organization is taking a trauma-informed approach, it is incorporating  knowledge of trauma and its effects into its policies, procedures, and  practices. A trauma-informed child welfare system may offer services to  help identify and mitigate the effects of trauma, including screening and  assessing children for trauma, and providing or referring children to  services. These approaches may produce improved outcomes for  children in the child welfare system, including fewer children requiring  crisis services, such as residential treatment, and fewer foster home  placements, placement disruptions, and reentries into foster care. Other  trauma-informed approaches may result in reduced lengths of stay in  foster care and improved child functioning and increased well-being.", "In addition to child welfare agencies, school staff and members of the  school community can play a key part in recognizing and responding to  children who have experienced trauma. In a 2017 report on child well- being, GAO reported that an expert noted that health and human service  agencies are not the only entities needed to address child well-being and  suggested that community stakeholders work together to determine what  resources are needed for the children in their community. A trauma- informed school, characterized by an understanding and a commitment of  teachers and staff to an awareness of how trauma affects students, is an  example of a coordinated approach to trauma. Trauma-informed teachers  and staff are aware of trauma\u2019s impact on students\u2019 behavior, their  relationships, their ability or inability to self-regulate behavior, and how it  contributes to their classroom behavior. Specific elements of a trauma- informed school may include addressing and treating traumatic stress,  developing partnerships with students and families, evaluating and  revising school discipline policies and practices, and creating a trauma- informed learning environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trauma Treatments and Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies, academic institutions, and community-based treatment  centers have generated evidence-based trauma treatments that clinicians  and therapists can use when working with children and their families.

While these studies are limited in  terms of the number of participants, they indicate the positive effects of  including trauma-informed approaches into the work of child welfare staff  and educators. For example, one study that used child welfare  administrative data for about 1,500 children from Kansas found that  implementing a trauma-informed approach was associated with improved  child well-being and placement stability for children in foster care.  Another study of two public child welfare agencies that involved 52  children, as well as child welfare staff, mental health providers, and foster  parents and kinship caregivers, suggests, among other things, that fewer  children exited foster homes for negative reasons, such as running away  or moving to a group home, when families were trained in a trauma- informed approach. In addition, a study of 126 female youths residing in  two treatment centers in Massachusetts suggests that the youth at the  center receiving the trauma-informed approach experienced a reduction  in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms compared with the youth in  the residential center that did not offer this approach. A study of five  schools that adopted a trauma-sensitive approach also reported positive  outcomes. For example, the study found a decrease in disciplinary  actions, and staff at one school reported that the school felt safer and  calmer.

Child  welfare officials in two states, Wisconsin and North Carolina, told us that  they use learning communities to train staff, and in some instances, foster  parents. For example, North Carolina\u2019s child welfare agency used a  learning community approach\u2014which included face-to-face training, as  well as coaching and practice, over an extended period\u2014to work with  child welfare staff in 32 of the state\u2019s 100 counties, according to a state  official. In a 2016 agency report, state officials reported that the 9- to 12- month learning community process was designed to allow staff the time  required to become steeped in trauma knowledge, to learn how to spread  that knowledge into skills and practices, and to develop a sustainable  program. Conversely, state and local education and child welfare officials  in three states told us that they use online learning or university  coursework to train staff. For example, Wisconsin education agency  officials told us that they developed a three-tiered training, including  online modules for educators and school staff. The modules are designed  for self-study and, among other things, include guidance on making  policies and procedures more trauma-sensitive, as well as information  about the characteristics of safe, supportive learning environments. Also,  Massachusetts state child welfare officials told us that they partnered with  three universities to provide trauma-focused courses to child welfare  workers, and local school officials told us that a university offers a  graduate certificate in trauma and learning to area educators. corroborated, when possible, the information we received during our state and county  interviews with relevant state documents. We provided officials the opportunity to review  the content for accuracy and provide revisions or corrections. a 10-hour, self-paced webinar. According to Wisconsin\u2019s child welfare  website, clinicians who complete the training are eligible for certification  as TF-CBT therapists and can be listed on a national website of certified  clinicians. Similarly, North Carolina\u2019s state child welfare agency, in  partnership with a nonprofit organization, trains clinicians in four trauma- focused, evidence-based therapies, including TF-CBT and Parent-Child  Interaction Therapy.

State and local child welfare and education officials in  five of the six selected states told us that they screen certain children to  determine whether they have experienced trauma, are exhibiting  symptoms of trauma, or need to be referred for a trauma-informed mental  health assessment. For example, North Carolina and Washington child  welfare officials told us they screen children for trauma when they enter  the child welfare system. North Carolina counties that participated in the  state\u2019s training efforts, described above, use two screening tools: one for  children under age 6 and the other for those ages 6 through 21. The  social worker, with input from the caregiver, completes the screening tool  for children under age 6. Older children are asked questions about their  exposure to trauma, including physical abuse, domestic violence, sexual  abuse, and other traumatic events. According to the North Carolina child  welfare agency, the trauma screen has a number of benefits for child  welfare practice, including informing placement decisions for the youth,  prioritizing children who might need to receive treatment quickly, and  providing the mental health professional with a better understanding of a  child\u2019s issues. Child welfare officials in Washington also reported  integrating trauma screening into the state\u2019s child screening program,  using a 2012 ACF trauma grant. Children and youth are screened within  30 days of placement in foster care if officials expect them to remain in  care 30 days or more. With these grant funds, officials reported that  Washington\u2019s child welfare agency added a tool to screen for children\u2019s  trauma symptoms and developed a protocol that rescreens these children  every 6 months. In addition, education agency officials from three states  told us that schools have developed processes to identify students who  may have experienced trauma. For example, one Wisconsin school  district official told us that any staff member, family member, or student  can refer a student for screening. This official explained that the school  district formed school-based teams to review information, such as data on  suspensions and class disruptions, to identify at-risk students. In addition  to the screening process, the school district developed school-based and  community mental health service partnerships at 23 schools where  therapists provide mental health services, according to this official."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Support Systems", "paragraphs": ["State and local child welfare and education agency officials in five of six  selected states told us they have developed support systems, which can  include providing services, to try to help children affected by trauma. For  example, Colorado and Ohio child welfare agencies have spearheaded  efforts to provide services and support to children who may have  experienced trauma. The Colorado child welfare agency, as part of its  system of care, uses an evidence- and team-based planning model,  referred to as high-fidelity wraparound services, to manage care for  children with or at risk of serious emotional disturbance and who are  involved in multiple systems, such as the child welfare and juvenile justice  systems. As part of these wraparound services, county child welfare  staff and local service providers and professionals work with the family to  create a plan for them and their children. A coordinator sets up meetings,  oversees the plan, and makes sure all team members participate in  achieving the plan\u2019s goals. In addition to the coordinator, a family  advocate provides peer support, via weekly visits, to parents and  caregivers of youth receiving wraparound services. In addition, depending  on the needs of the child, wraparound services may include participating  in a support group or meeting with a therapist or grief counselor, among  other things. In Ohio, child welfare officials in two counties told us about a  partnership that provides services to children and their families who have  experienced trauma because of parents\u2019 substance use disorder. As  part of the program, children and parents are screened for trauma and  may get referred for treatment and services. Families receive wraparound  services that are provided by a caseworker and family peer mentor; the  family peer mentor has personal experiences with addiction and is in  recovery.", "In addition, state education agency officials in four selected states told us  that they had at least one statewide effort administered by the state  education agency to help support all children, including those affected by  trauma. Colorado, Washington, and Wisconsin encourage schools to  implement tiered systems of behavioral support, according to state  officials. Tiered systems of support generally consist of three tiers of  support: (1) universal supports that apply to all children; (2) specialized  supports for smaller groups of children; and (3) supports for individual  children who need intensive interventions. To implement the first tier,  school staff support students in various ways, such as interacting with  students and setting up a dedicated space in a classroom for students to  regulate their behavior. The second tier may include convening small  groups to help children with similar behavioral issues learn how to  regulate their emotions, and the last tier may include intensive support for  students who need more help, such as developing and implementing  wraparound services plans. School district officials that we spoke with in  Massachusetts told us that although they do not use tiered systems of  behavioral support, they help children affected by trauma by employing  practices to create safe classroom environments for all students, such as  developing and building upon relationships and engaging students in  structured conversations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Child Welfare and Education Agencies in Selected States Identified Leadership and Capacity Limitations as Challenges to Supporting Children Affected by Trauma", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Officials in Selected States Reported That Leadership Is Important for Supporting Children Affected by Trauma", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all six selected states spoke of the importance of having  engaged leadership in establishing and sustaining support for children  affected by trauma.

Additionally, Ohio  county child welfare officials spoke about the value of obtaining  management support for their plan to become a trauma-informed  organization. In other cases, leaders were seen as important to sustaining  trauma initiatives and ensuring their impact. In Massachusetts, university  officials said that, to ensure the continued availability of evidence-based  therapies, they train not only clinicians, but also the individuals who  supervise them. Also, a county public health official in Washington, whose  agency is implementing trauma initiatives in schools, told us that their  efforts tend to be unsuccessful unless they first engage school leadership  and align their health initiatives with the schools\u2019 existing efforts.", "Federal officials and reports have also cited leadership as an important  factor in the implementation of trauma initiatives, with some maintaining  that leadership is necessary to support children affected by trauma because of the need to change an organization\u2019s culture. In 2013,  NCTSN reported on takeaways from a learning collaborative in which  nine teams led by child welfare agencies developed, implemented, and  tested trauma-informed child welfare practices. Based on the  experiences of the teams, the NCTSN report stated that strong and  consistent leadership is necessary to implement trauma-informed practice  because it requires a shift in organizational culture. SAMHSA\u2019s 2014  guidance for a trauma-informed approach similarly suggests that  organizations consider the importance of leadership to initiate a systems- wide change. In addition, HHS officials, who worked with states on a  series of trauma-related grants awarded between 2011 and 2013, also  told us that leadership commitment was important for their grantees in  building organizational and worker resiliency, acting upon data and  evaluation, and sustaining initiatives. These documents and statements  echo previous GAO work on organizational transformation; for example,  in 2003 we reported on key practices found at the center of successful  transformation efforts, noting that leadership must set the direction, pace,  and tone and provide a clear, consistent rationale that brings everyone  together behind a single mission.", "In addition to discussing the important role that leadership plays in  establishing and sustaining support for children affected by trauma,  officials in three states highlighted instances in which a lack of leadership  hindered their efforts to support these children.

Officials in one school district said they  had developed policies around multi-tiered system of supports in 2009  but did not receive support from political leaders or funding for the  initiative until 2016. They told us that this hindered the initiative\u2019s  implementation.", "Incomplete implementation. State education officials in that same  state said that a lack of leadership hindered their ability to track school  districts\u2019 implementation of the state\u2019s trauma initiatives. These  officials said that a lack of requirements for districts to scale up  trauma work was a barrier to collecting data on local activities. In  another state, there was a county child welfare initiative to implement  universal trauma screening which was conducted in partnership with a  local university. The university reported that less than half of children  with open cases were screened during the project period, which  university officials attributed to some supervisors not supporting the  screening initiative.", "Unsuccessful implementation. According to officials in a third state,  turnover among high-level leaders contributed to difficulties integrating  trauma-informed practices at the state\u2019s child welfare agency, and the  agency was not successful at implementing a trauma screening  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Welfare and Education Officials in Selected States Also Reported Capacity Limitations and Other Challenges to Supporting Children Affected by Trauma", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Capacity Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all six selected states talked about limitations on their agency\u2019s  or organization\u2019s capacity to support children affected by trauma.  Limitations included high rates of staff turnover, limited staff time to focus  on trauma, insufficient numbers of clinicians trained in trauma-focused,  evidence-based therapies, and insufficient funding for trauma initiatives.  Some agencies and organizations had taken actions to address these  challenges.", "Secondary Traumatic Stress  According to the National Child Traumatic  Stress Network (NCTSN), Secondary  Traumatic Stress (STS) is the emotional  duress experienced when hearing about  another person\u2019s traumatic experiences.  Professionals working with children affected  by trauma, such as child welfare workers, are  commonly at risk of developing STS. STS can  compromise these professionals\u2019 ability to do  their jobs and may drive them to leave their  job or their professional field.  NCTSN notes that several factors can  increase the risk for developing STS,  including heavy caseloads of children affected  by trauma, social or organizational isolation,  and feeling unprepared for the job due to lack  of training. NCTSN suggests taking a multi- dimensional approach to STS, which includes  both prevention and intervention. This could  include strategies such as establishing self- care groups, helping workers maintain work- life balance, and training organizational  leaders on STS. education agencies. Child welfare officials in all six states talked about  high rates of staff turnover, while education officials did so in two states  (Colorado and Wisconsin). Staff turnover resulted in difficulties  maintaining staff trained in trauma-informed approaches and sustaining  institutional trauma knowledge and trauma-related activities, according to  officials. Colorado university officials partnering with a county child  welfare agency said that staff turnover forced them to invest additional  time in training replacement staff and made it more difficult for child  welfare officials to conduct regular follow-ups. Similarly, one education  official in another part of Colorado said that high turnover at many  agencies, including education and child welfare, hindered the county\u2019s  efforts to maintain institutional knowledge about trauma-informed  practices and sustain the services these agencies were providing to  children affected by trauma. Some state and local officials in three states  attributed high rates of staff turnover to fatigue and secondary traumatic  stress, which is the emotional duress that staff may experience when they  hear about children\u2019s traumatic experiences (see sidebar). Some  agencies said that they sought to address staff turnover by supporting  employees through training on secondary traumatic stress; at least one  agency in each of the six states offered such training. Officials from Ohio  and Wisconsin told us that another way they were addressing the issue  was by participating in an HHS-funded project to improve child welfare  workforce outcomes.", "Many agencies also said they faced limitations on the time that staff could  dedicate to trauma initiatives. This issue was more commonly raised by  education agencies than by child welfare agencies. Education agency  officials reported this limitation in three of four states that had education  initiatives, whereas child welfare officials reported it in two of the six  selected states. Some of these officials explained that lack of staff time to  focus on trauma may have limited the implementation of their trauma  initiatives. State education officials in Washington and local education  officials in Massachusetts told us that they have the expertise to provide  trauma training to schools and community groups, but time limitations  restrict their ability to do so. A Colorado county child welfare official told  us that some caseworkers see trauma screening as an additional burden  due to their already large workload, and a child welfare official in another  Colorado county told us that many caseworkers forget to do trauma  screening because they are busy. At least one agency we interviewed in  each of the six states has or had a staff position dedicated to trauma  work, which could help address this limitation.", "Officials in all six selected states said that there were not enough  clinicians trained in trauma-focused, evidence-based therapies to serve  children affected by trauma. GAO has previously reported on difficulties  finding specialty care for children. For example, in 2017 we found that  limited access to mental health services was a challenge for several  selected states due to a variety of factors, including insufficient numbers  of providers in certain specialties, such as child psychiatrists. Some  officials indicated that a shortage of clinicians trained in trauma-focused,  evidence-based therapies can limit the ability of child welfare agencies to  address trauma. For example, state child welfare officials in  Massachusetts specifically noted that identifying children affected by  trauma is not helpful if there are not enough clinicians trained in these  therapies to treat them. County child welfare officials in Massachusetts  and local healthcare partners in Ohio said that providers sometimes rely  on interns to address the shortage of clinicians, but Massachusetts  officials viewed this as problematic because interns have short tenures  that prevent them from establishing relationships with the children.  Officials in five of the six selected states told us about initiatives to  address the shortage by training clinicians in trauma-focused, evidence- based therapies, and university officials in Massachusetts described an  initiative to make trained clinicians more accessible. (See text box.)", "LINK-KID: A centralized trauma treatment referral service  The Child Trauma Training Center at the University of Massachusetts  Medical School trains clinicians and operates a centralized referral  service called LINK-KID. The goal of LINK-KID is to facilitate  connections between children in need of trauma-focused, evidence- based therapies and clinicians who have been trained to provide such  therapies. LINK-KID maintains an active database of trained clinicians  throughout the state of Massachusetts.", "University officials told us that anyone in Massachusetts with concerns  about a child, including family, teachers, clinicians, and child welfare  workers, may call the service. LINK-KID collects information about the  child and family, works with them to decide which treatment is most  appropriate, and ensures the child is referred for that treatment.", "University officials said that using LINK-KID is easier for families and  child welfare workers, who otherwise might have to call multiple service  providers to determine who offers the needed treatment and accepts  their insurance. These officials also said they have seen a reduction in  the time children must wait for treatment when using LINK-KID. They  said that prior to LINK-KID, they saw many children waiting 6 months to  a year to receive treatment after having been identified as having  experienced trauma, whereas wait times are generally between 25 and  40 business days with LINK-KID.", "Finally, some agencies said they had difficulties getting or maintaining  sufficient funding to support trauma initiatives. Officials in Washington,  including, among others, state and local education officials and a local  public health partner, reported this issue. In addition, local officials in four  other states noted limited funding to support trauma initiatives. School  district officials in Washington indicated that a lack of funding limited their  implementation support for one major trauma initiative to approximately  one-quarter of their schools. These schools were chosen based on need,  as demonstrated by measures such as discipline and absenteeism rates.  County child welfare officials in Ohio said they had to stop one of their  trauma initiatives 3 years ago because the state funding supporting the  initiative ran out. Those Ohio officials said they have relied on  relationships and collaboration to address the issue of scarce funding. For  example, they said that county organizations, including local government  agencies, private healthcare providers, and nonprofits, share data  extensively and pool funding to support various initiatives. One initiative  they pointed to is a local interagency council which provides services to  children affected by trauma."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Child welfare and other officials in the six selected states, including  officials with nonprofit partners, a state department of health, and a state  interagency collaborative, also raised at least one other challenge.  Challenges included sharing data while remaining in compliance with  state and federal privacy laws; sharing data across incompatible systems;  limitations on services billable to Medicaid; and Medicaid reimbursement  rates. Some agencies had taken actions to address or avoid data sharing  challenges. In the states where child welfare officials identified Medicaid- related challenges, state Medicaid officials offered a different perspective  on perceived Medicaid challenges and cited alternative ways to support  children affected by trauma.", "Officials in all six states talked about sharing data with other agencies for  various purposes; however, privacy laws and regulations were sometimes  cited by these officials as a barrier to sharing data about children affected  by trauma. For example, officials in two Massachusetts school districts  told us they are notified by police or child welfare workers when a child  has been involved in an incident with those agencies. One official  described the goal of this effort as making staff aware of incidents and  events that may affect children\u2019s learning and behavior and ensuring that  children feel supported. However, child welfare officials in four of the six  selected states and other officials in two states said that it was difficult to  share data while remaining in compliance with state and federal privacy  and confidentiality laws and regulations, though the reasons they cited for  these difficulties varied. State child welfare officials in Massachusetts  told us that the state has strict privacy laws in addition to federal laws  such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  These officials said that data sharing is possible but generally requires a  specific memorandum of understanding because of privacy laws. In  contrast, a state child welfare official in North Carolina said they had  difficulties with counties not understanding what data they are allowed to  share. That official told us that the state tries to mitigate this challenge by  helping counties understand what they can share and encouraging them  to share screening information with mental health and medical providers.  Additionally, a North Carolina university has published state-specific  guidance on sharing education, mental health, and other records.", "Systems incompatibility and technology issues were also sometimes seen  as barriers to sharing data about children affected by trauma. Child  welfare officials in three of the six selected states, and state health  officials in a fourth state, said that incompatibility among various systems  made data sharing very difficult or impossible. For example, county  officials in Wisconsin said that the state\u2019s child welfare and juvenile justice  offices use one data reporting system while the state\u2019s mental and  behavioral health offices use another, and these two statewide data  systems are unable to communicate. While state child welfare officials in  Colorado also reported systems incompatibility issues, county child  welfare officials in that state talked about efforts to make data systems  more accessible to relevant partners. Officials in one county said that they  have a database which is accessible by all members of the county\u2019s multi- agency partnership, including child welfare, school districts, public health,  and others. Those officials also said they use a universal release-of- information which includes all partner agencies, enabling them to share  data at multi-agency meetings.", "Additionally, child welfare officials in Colorado, Ohio, and Massachusetts  said that certain services for children affected by trauma or certain service  providers were not billable to Medicaid, although Medicaid officials in  these states offered a different perspective and cited alternative ways to  support these children. Depending on the state, child welfare officials  said they could not bill wraparound services, trauma assessments,  transportation, or non-traditional therapies, such as animal therapy or  community and relationship building. County child welfare officials in  Ohio also mentioned restrictions on providers; they said that potential  peer support specialists with a criminal background and interns could not  bill Medicaid. However, Medicaid officials in these states generally said  that such services were billable to Medicaid, and Ohio Medicaid officials  said that interns and those with a criminal background could bill Medicaid,  under certain circumstances. For example, they said that while certain  severe criminal offenses, such as homicide, could exclude someone from  providing services, those with lesser offenses could become eligible after  a waiting period. Colorado and Ohio Medicaid officials we spoke with  offered some alternative ways to use Medicaid to support children  affected by trauma in cases where services could not be billed to  Medicaid. For example, a Colorado Medicaid official and a child welfare  official both said that Medicaid does not pay providers for travel time or  mileage and that this can be a problem in rural areas; however, the state  Medicaid official said that telehealth is available to address this issue and  that reimbursement rates for services in rural areas can be higher to  reflect the additional cost of travel.", "Finally, child welfare and Medicaid officials in Colorado and North  Carolina also had different perspectives regarding Medicaid  reimbursement rates. Child welfare and other officials in these states said  that certain services for children affected by trauma, such as trauma  assessments and trauma-focused, evidence-based therapies, are  expensive, and that Medicaid reimbursement rates are too low to  incentivize providers to offer these services. However, Colorado and  North Carolina Medicaid officials explained that most children in Medicaid  in their states receive mental health care through managed care, where  the state pays a set rate per child to managed care organizations (MCOs)  to provide or arrange for any mental health services a child may need,  including trauma-related care. MCOs, in turn, reimburse providers for the  services they deliver, and MCOs set the rates they pay providers for  those services rather than the state. Medicaid officials in Colorado and  North Carolina noted that MCOs have flexibility to negotiate rates with  providers and may choose to reimburse at a higher rate. North Carolina  Medicaid officials said that some MCOs in their state were reimbursing  providers at a higher rate for comprehensive, trauma-informed mental  health assessments, and a Colorado Medicaid official also noted that  MCOs in their state may vary reimbursement rates based on provider  availability, offering higher rates in areas where there are shortages."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and Education for review and  comment.
