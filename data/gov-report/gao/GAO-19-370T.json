Overdoses have become the leading cause of death due to injuries in the United States, and most of these deaths involve opioids. GAO has a body of work on drug policy and ongoing work on ONDCP's efforts, including issuance of the National Drug Control Strategy. GAO also noted in its March 2019 High Risk report that federal efforts to prevent drug misuse is an emerging issue requiring close attention.", "This statement includes preliminary GAO observations on the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy and related findings from select GAO reports on federal opioid-related efforts. It is based on ongoing GAO work, two reports that GAO issued in March 2018 and October 2017, and selected updates on recommendations from these reports as of February 2019. For ongoing work and recommendation updates, GAO assessed the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy against statutory requirements, reviewed ONDCP and HHS documents, and interviewed ONDCP officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)\u2014responsible for coordinating and overseeing efforts by more than a dozen federal agencies to address illicit drug use\u2014issued the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy on January 31, 2019. ONDCP describes the strategy as a high-level vision of federal drug control efforts, focused on prevention, treatment and recovery. The strategy designates one overarching objective to reduce the number of lives lost to drug addiction, and provides some description of federal agencies' activities, including steps to reduce the availability of illicit drugs. However, it does not include certain information required by law, such as annual objectives that are quantifiable and measurable, or a 5-year projection for program and budget priorities. This required information could help prioritize activities across federal agencies and measure progress over time, which previous GAO work has shown to be important for achieving results. GAO will continue to assess the strategy as part of ongoing work, and make recommendations as appropriate.", "The lack of information in the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy on measuring progress toward its objective to reduce lives lost is particularly concerning in light of previous GAO reports. These reports found that individual agencies could do more to assess their particular efforts related to opioids. For example, GAO reported in March 2018 on five agency-specific strategies to combat illicit opioids, and also reported in October 2017 on the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) efforts to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. In these reports, GAO recommended, among other things, that federal agencies establish performance measures to better determine progress toward their goals. While federal agencies have taken some action to implement these recommendations, such as establishing performance measures for access to medication-assisted treatment, additional actions to measure the effectiveness of related drug control efforts would further help to gauge agencies' success, determine if new approaches are needed, and efficiently target resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made prior recommendations to ONDCP, HHS, and other federal agencies to address drug misuse, including establishing performance measures with targets to better gauge progress toward achieving agency goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our ongoing work related to  the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), as well as two of our  issued reports on federal opioid-related efforts that highlight the  importance of assessing outcomes for the steps ONDCP and other  agencies are taking to control illicit drug use and reduce deaths from drug  overdoses.", "While drug misuse in the nation is not a new phenomenon, the scale and  impact of illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse has reached new  levels, affecting individuals, their families, and the communities in which  they live. Drug overdoses are at their highest ever-recorded level and,  since 2011, have outnumbered deaths, respectively, by firearms, motor  vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide, according to the Drug  Enforcement Administration. Over 70,000 people died from drug  overdoses in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. Opioids\u2014particularly highly potent synthetic opioids like  fentanyl\u2014are currently the main driver of these deaths. The Council of  Economic Advisers estimated that, in 2015, the economic cost of the  opioid crisis alone was more than $500 billion when considering the value  of lives lost due to opioid-related overdoses. Primarily due to increasing  rates of opioid-related deaths and opioid use disorder, the Acting  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on October 26,  2017. We highlight these issues in our latest High-Risk report, which we  issued on March 6, 2019. In that document, we identify federal efforts to  prevent drug misuse as an emerging issue requiring close attention.", "Federal drug control efforts span a range of activities including  prevention, treatment, interdiction, international operations, and law  enforcement. These efforts also represent a considerable federal  investment. According to the President\u2019s fiscal year (FY) 2019 budget,  federal drug control funding for FY 2017 was $28.8 billion. Multiple federal  agencies have ongoing efforts to respond to the opioid crisis, including  efforts to reduce the supply and demand for illicit drugs, to prevent  misuse of prescription drugs, and to treat substance use disorders. As  federal agencies engage in drug control efforts, ONDCP is responsible  for, among other things, overseeing and coordinating the implementation  of national drug control policy across the federal government.  These  responsibilities include the Director of ONDCP promulgating a National  Drug Control Strategy, and assessing and certifying the adequacy of the  National Drug Control Program agencies\u2019 budget submissions.", "In our testimony today, we will discuss our preliminary observations on  the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy and how these observations  relate to findings and recommendations from related, prior work. This  testimony is based on our ongoing examination of ONDCP\u2019s strategies  and programs. It is also based on two prior reports, which we issued in March 2018 and October 2017, that highlight the importance of assessing  outcomes related to agency-specific efforts to address the opioid crisis.", "To develop our preliminary observations, we reviewed the 2019 National  Drug Control Strategy, assessed it against relevant provisions of the  Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006  (ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006), and interviewed ONDCP officials.  To perform our prior work, we reviewed and analyzed documents from  ONDCP and other relevant agencies, reviewed relevant statutory  provisions, and interviewed relevant agency officials. More detailed  information on the scope and methodologies used to conduct our prior  work can be found in each product cited in this statement. This statement  also includes selected updates related to recommendations we have  made in those reports. To conduct these updates, we reviewed  documentation provided by agency officials in February 2019 about steps  they have taken to address recommendations since the publication of  each respective report.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["More than a dozen federal agencies\u2014known as National Drug Control  Program agencies\u2014have responsibilities for drug prevention, treatment,  and law enforcement activities. For example, the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) has led efforts to expand access to drug  treatment, and the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security  (DHS) have taken lead roles in limiting the availability of illicit drugs  through criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1988 established ONDCP to enhance national drug control  planning and coordination.  In this role, the office is responsible for (1)  leading the national drug control effort, (2) coordinating and overseeing  the implementation of national drug control policy, (3) assessing and  certifying the adequacy of National Drug Control Programs and the  budget for those programs, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of  national drug control policy efforts.", "Until its 2018 reauthorization, ONDCP had been operating under the  provisions of the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 pursuant to annual  appropriations acts. In October 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder  Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients  and Communities Act (the SUPPORT Act) was enacted and reauthorized  ONDCP and a number of its programs.  The SUPPORT Act aims to  address overprescribing and opioid misuse in the United States and  includes provisions involving law enforcement, public health, and  healthcare financing and coverage. Under both the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006 and the SUPPORT Act, the Director of  ONDCP is required to promulgate the National Drug Control Strategy and  work with National Drug Control Program agencies to develop an annual  National Drug Control Program Budget.  Prior to the SUPPORT Act, the  Director was required to promulgate a National Drug Control Strategy on  an annual basis, while under the SUPPORT Act, generally, the National  Drug Control Strategy is required to be developed every two years.   ONDCP did not issue a National Drug Control Strategy for 2017 or 2018  despite the statutory requirement. Under both the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006 and the SUPPORT Act, the National Drug  Control Strategy is to set forth a comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug  use and the consequences of such illicit drug use in the United States by  limiting the availability of and reducing the demand for illegal drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Observations on the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy", "paragraphs": ["As part of our ongoing work, we are reviewing the 2019 National Drug  Control Strategy that ONDCP issued on January 31, 2019. Agency  officials told us that they began preparing the National Drug Control  Strategy in early 2018\u2014prior to the enactment of the SUPPORT Act in  October 2018. Officials stated that the National Drug Control Strategy  was intended to respond to the requirements of the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006, which was the applicable law at that time. In  light of ONDCP\u2019s stated approach, we based our preliminary analysis of  the National Drug Control Strategy on the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006. However, the SUPPORT Act retained certain similar requirements  for the National Drug Control Strategy contained in the prior law.", "According to ONDCP, the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy provides a  high-level vision of federal drug control efforts by focusing on prevention,  treatment and recovery, and reducing the availability of illicit drugs. The  2019 National Drug Control Strategy designates one overarching  strategic objective\u2014to reduce the number of lives lost to drug addiction\u2014 and provides some general descriptions of federal agencies\u2019 activities.  However, our preliminary observations related to the 2019 National Drug  Control Strategy indicate that it does not include several pieces of  required information, including the following:", "Quantifiable and measurable objectives. The National Drug Control  Strategy was required to include \u201cannual quantifiable and measurable  objectives and specific targets to accomplish long-term quantifiable  goals that the  Director determines may be achieved during  each year beginning on the date on which the National Drug Control  Strategy is submitted.\u201d  However, our work showed that the 2019  National Drug Control Strategy does not include this information.  While it lists seven items that it designates as measures of  performance or effectiveness, it does not indicate how they would be  quantified or measured, or targets to be achieved each year. For  example, one of the measures of performance relates to educating  the public, especially adolescents, about drug use. However, it lacks  information on how ONDCP would measure its efforts to educate  adolescents, as well as targets ONDCP hopes to achieve, such as the  number of adolescents educated or specific knowledge gains. Further,  none of the seven measures has a baseline of current performance or  annual targets, and four of the seven measures do not have  associated timelines\u2014which are important ways that results could be  quantified. For example, one of the Strategy\u2019s measures of  effectiveness is that evidence-based addiction treatment, particularly  medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, is more accessible  nationwide for those who need it. However, there is no information on  the current level of treatment access, any targets for expanding  access, or any associated timeline by which ONDCP hopes to  achieve desired results.", "Program and budget priorities. The National Drug Control Strategy  was required to include \u201ca 5-year projection for program and budget  priorities.\u201d  While the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy outlines  several high-level priorities, including a top priority to address the  current opioid crisis and its associated deaths, it does not include  such a 5-year projection.", "Specific assessments. The National Drug Control Strategy was  required to include specific assessments related to illicit drug use.  For example, the National Drug Control Strategy was required to  include \u201can assessment of the reduction of illicit drug availability.\u201d  This assessment was to be measured by, among other things, the  quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy,  and other drugs available for consumption in the United States; the  amount of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy,  and precursor chemicals and other drugs entering the United States;  and the number of illicit manufacturing laboratories seized and  destroyed as well as the number of hectares of marijuana, poppy, and  coca cultivated and destroyed domestically and in other countries.  The 2019 National Drug Control Strategy does not include this  information. In addition, the National Drug Control Strategy was  required to include \u201can assessment of the reduction of the  consequences of illicit drug use and availability.\u201d This assessment  was to include the burden illicit drug users placed on hospital  emergency departments; the annual national health care cost of illicit  drug use; and the extent of illicit drug-related crime and criminal  activity. Similarly, the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy does not  include this information.", "Performance measurement system. The ONDCP Director was  required to submit \u201cas part of the National Drug Control Strategy a  description of a national drug control performance measurement  system.\u201d  Among other things, this system was to describe the  sources of information and data that would be used for each  performance measure incorporated into the performance  measurement system. This system was also to coordinate the  development and implementation of national drug control data  collection and reporting systems to support policy formulation and  performance measurement. Further, the system was to monitor  consistency across the drug-related goals and objectives of the  National Drug Control Program agencies and ensure that each  agency\u2019s goals and budgets support are fully consistent with the  National Drug Control Strategy. The 2019 National Drug Control  Strategy does not contain a description of such a national drug control  performance measurement system.", "As part of our ongoing work, we also asked ONDCP for information  regarding how ONDCP officials determined the adequacy of National  Drug Control Program agencies\u2019 budget submissions without a National  Drug Control Strategy in effect for 2017 and 2018. The National Drug  Control Program Budget is to provide information on federal drug control  funding requested by the executive branch to implement the National  Drug Control Strategy. National Drug Control Program agencies are  required to submit to ONDCP the portion of their annual budget requests  dedicated to drug control activity undertaken by the department, agency,  or program. Agencies are to prepare these as part of their overall budget  submission to the Office of Management and Budget for inclusion in the  President\u2019s annual budget request. ONDCP is required to review and  certify whether these budgets are sufficient to support the relevant goals  and objectives outlined in the National Drug Control Strategy and then  include these budgets in the consolidated National Drug Control Program  Budget, which the President issues alongside his budget each year. As of  March 4, 2019, ONDCP had not provided information on how it  accomplished the required determination. In addition, as of March 4,  2019, the President\u2019s FY 2020 budget, and the accompanying National  Drug Control Program Budget, had not been released. We will continue to  consider ONDCP\u2019s activities in this area as part of our ongoing work.", "As part of our ongoing work, we will also discuss the 2019 National Drug  Control Strategy with ONDCP and plan to examine how ONDCP intends  to address additional requirements in the SUPPORT Act. The lack of  information in the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy on assessing  progress toward its objective to reduce lives lost reflects findings in our  previous reports. Our prior work in general, and our work on federal drug  control efforts in particular, has consistently emphasized the importance  of setting clear priorities through measurable and quantifiable goals, and  assessing progress toward those goals over time, in order to achieve  results. For example:  In March 2018, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 efforts\u2014including  those of ONDCP\u2014to limit the availability of and enhance their  response to illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl. We reviewed  five strategies related to combating illicit opioids and determined that  only one included outcome-oriented performance measures that aim  to assess the effectiveness of its efforts\u2014ONDCP\u2019s Heroin Availability  Reduction Plan (HARP). In contrast, we found that ONDCP\u2019s High  Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) programs\u2019 Heroin Response  Strategy did not include any outcome-oriented performance  measures. Outcome measures address the results of programs and  services, such as reductions in overdose deaths, and they can help in  assessing the status of program operations, identifying areas that  need improvement, and ensuring accountability for results. Among  other things, we recommended in March 2018 that ONDCP  coordinate with the HIDTAs to establish outcome-oriented  performance measures to assess progress towards the goals set out  in the Heroin Response Strategy. While ONDCP neither agreed nor  disagreed with our recommendation, ONDCP told us in June 2018  that they had engaged with leaders from the HIDTAs participating in  the Heroin Response Strategy to develop performance measures,  including some outcome performance measures. As of March 4,  2019, this recommendation has not yet been addressed and ONDCP  has not provided additional information on these efforts. We continue  to believe that establishing these measures would enhance the  HIDTAs\u2019 ability to assess whether these efforts are producing  intended results.", "In October 2017, we reported on HHS\u2019s efforts to reduce the  prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it by  expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid  use disorder. These efforts included four grant programs that focus  on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural  primary care practices and health centers) and implementing  regulatory and statutory changes that expanded treatment capacity by  increasing patient limits for a MAT medication\u2014buprenorphine\u2014and  by expanding the types of practitioners who can prescribe it in an  office-based setting. We found that HHS had not established  performance measures with targets that would specify the results that  HHS  hoped to achieve through its efforts, and by when. We  concluded that without this information, HHS would not have an  effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand  access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Among  other things, we recommended that HHS establish performance  measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT for opioid  use disorders. HHS concurred with the recommendation and in  February 2019, provided information that the agency had established  performance measures with targets to increase the number of  prescriptions for certain MAT medications, one of the potential ways  to measure access to MAT. However, the recommendation has not  yet been fully addressed, in part because HHS did not provide  information on measures related to the treatment capacity of providers  who prescribe or administer MAT medications, which HHS had  identified as another way to measure access. We continue to believe  that fully implementing this recommendation will help ensure that  invested resources in the program are yielding intended results.", "As our prior work shows, using data\u2014such as information collected by  performance measures and findings from program evaluations and  research studies\u2014to drive decision-making can help federal agencies  improve program implementation, identify and correct problems, and  make other management decisions. Although agencies may struggle to  effectively use this approach, regular performance reviews and evidence- based policy tools can help them incorporate performance information  into federal decision-making. Without effective long-term plans, such as a  national strategy, that clearly articulate goals and objectives and without  specific measures to track performance, federal agencies cannot fully  assess whether taxpayer dollars are invested in ways that will achieve  desired outcomes. ONDCP\u2019s responsibility to develop the National Drug  Control Strategy and coordinate among federal agencies offers the  agency an important opportunity to guide federal activities to address the  unprecedented number of drug overdose deaths. We are continuing with  ongoing and planned work to monitor and assess federal drug control  efforts.", "Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes our prepared statement.
