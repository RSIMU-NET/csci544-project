The 2012 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 12-01 outlined requirements for collecting and publishing data from 22 agencies and designated State as the lead agency for implementing ForeignAssistance.gov.", "GAO's survey showed that most of the 10 agencies reporting data for ForeignAssistance.gov identified limitations in their information technology systems and data availability as key impediments in collecting and reporting data, while most of the 12 agencies not yet reporting data identified lack of staff time as a potential key impediment.", "GAO found that the data on ForeignAssistance.gov were incomplete and that State was not fully transparent about such limitations on the website. In addition, State has not updated ForeignAssistance.gov with verified annual data to ensure quality. GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2014 data showed that ForeignAssistance.gov did not report over $10 billion in disbursements and about $6 billion in obligations provided by the 10 reporting agencies, compared to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-verified data (see fig.). A 2009 OMB memorandum requires agencies to improve transparency in published information, which includes identifying high-value information not yet available online. However, State, as the publisher of this information, does not provide agencies with guidance to identify data limitations that it can clearly disclose on the website and noted that it relies on agencies to report these. The absence of clear information on data limitations may undermine the goal of ForeignAssistance.gov to improve public knowledge and accountability of U.S. foreign assistance. Moreover, State, as the lead agency, has not updated ForeignAssistance.gov with verified data even though OMB Bulletin No. 12-01 indicates that these data should be updated annually using USAID-verified data. State and USAID officials told GAO that they are unable to update ForeignAssistance.gov with verified data because of differences in their datasets. OMB also noted that a review to assess whether agencies had sufficient internal data quality controls did not take place, although it was required by the bulletin. In the absence of a review or additional guidance to address the quality of the data on ForeignAssistance.gov, data will likely remain incomplete."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve the transparency and quality of the data on ForeignAssistance.gov, State (1) should provide guidance to agencies on identifying data limitations and clearly disclose those limitations on the website; and (2) in consultation with the OMB Director and the USAID Administrator, undertake a review of efforts to ensure data quality and develop guidance on improving the quality of ForeignAssistance.gov data.

Since 2009, the U.S. government has taken steps to  provide greater transparency on its foreign assistance activities around  the world. A series of international and domestic initiatives have outlined  key areas in which transparency could be enhanced, including timely  reporting and ensuring data accessibility to a variety of users. In 2011, the  United States became a signatory to the International Aid Transparency  Initiative (IATI), a global campaign that seeks to provide timely, forward- looking, and comprehensive data on foreign assistance funding and  activities in a standard electronic format. In 2012, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued Bulletin No. 12-01 (bulletin) to  provide guidance on its requirement for agencies to publicly report data  on their foreign assistance activities for ForeignAssistance.gov.  Congress also established standards and requirements, including a  common definition, for comprehensive reporting of all federal spending.  The overarching goal of ForeignAssistance.gov is to enable a variety of  stakeholders\u2014including U.S. citizens, civil society organizations, the U.S.  Congress, federal agencies, partner countries, and other donors\u2014to  research and track U.S. government foreign assistance investments in an  accessible and easily understood format. The bulletin identifies the  Department of State (State) as the lead agency responsible for collecting  and publishing data from 22 U.S. agencies for ForeignAssistance.gov.", "You asked us to review the collection and reporting of data for  ForeignAssistance.gov. In this report, we examine (1) State\u2019s data  collection and publishing process for ForeignAssistance.gov; (2) key  impediments, if any, that agencies face in collecting and reporting data for  ForeignAssistance.gov; and (3) the data published on  ForeignAssistance.gov.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed key guidance documents  relating to the data collection process, including the 2012 OMB Bulletin  No. 12-01 (bulletin) and State\u2019s November 2015 Agency Reporting Toolkit  (toolkit). To examine the data collection process, we conducted  semistructured interviews with officials of the 22 U.S. agencies on the  following topics: (1) data collection and validation processes; (2) guidance  provided by State on the data collection process; (3) resources needed to  collect data, such as infrastructure, staff, and training; and (4)  impediments that agencies may face in collecting and reporting  ForeignAssistance.gov data. We also interviewed OMB on its role in  providing guidance for ForeignAssistance.gov. Based on the agency  responses in the fourth area, we surveyed the same 22 U.S. agencies to  identify key impediments that agencies may face in collecting and  reporting data for ForeignAssistance.gov, including agency reporting  systems; required data fields in ForeignAssistance.gov; resources; and  sufficiency of the guidance provided. Finally, we assessed the data by  comparing fiscal year 2014 funding data published on  ForeignAssistance.gov to comparable funding assistance data collected  by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and published  on a website known as Foreign Aid Explorer. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable to serve as a reasonable comparison for the  purposes of our reporting objectives. Additionally, we analyzed a random  probability sample of 106 fiscal year 2014 transactions to assess the  completeness and consistency of the information provided by agencies  for selected data fields with State\u2019s definition for each data field. We also  interviewed key users of ForeignAssistance.gov, including  representatives from a consortium of nongovernmental organizations and  IATI.

In addition, the bulletin indicates that  agencies are required to provide transaction-level data for each activity.  Transactions are individual financial records of obligations and  disbursements in an agency\u2019s accounting system. Data on the website  are categorized under the nine U.S. foreign assistance framework  categories (economic development; education and social services; health;  peace and security; democracy, human rights, and governance;  environment; humanitarian assistance; program management; and  multisector). In general, as of July 2016, data were available from fiscal  years 2006 to 2017.

The website incorporates key elements  necessary for the United States to meet its IATI commitment, such as  frequency of reporting (quarterly), activity-level data, and publishing  format. In addition, a 2015 State guidance document (toolkit) indicates  that ForeignAssistance.gov is expected to meet key domestic data  reporting requirements on U.S. government activities, including those in  the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The  DATA Act aims to improve the transparency and quality of the federal  spending data by requiring that agencies begin reporting data on all  federal spending\u2014including grants, contracts, and other types of financial  assistance\u2014using governmentwide data standards by May 2017 and  publish these data in a computer-readable format by May 2018.", "The specific reporting guidelines for ForeignAssistance.gov are outlined  in the bulletin, which also notes two existing reports on U.S. foreign  assistance\u2014the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants: Obligations and Loans  Authorizations (Greenbook) report to Congress and the U.S. Annual  Assistance Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC). The  bulletin states that USAID will be the lead agency for verifying the data  and assembling these reports. USAID publishes Greenbook and  OECD/DAC data on Foreign Aid Explorer.

State focused on these 10 agencies  because they are responsible for providing 98 percent of U.S. foreign  assistance, according to State. In addition, State officials told us that they  prioritized improving data quality before collecting data from the 12  agencies that are not yet reporting data for ForeignAssistance.gov.", "Figure 2 illustrates State\u2019s data collection and publishing process for the  10 agencies currently reporting data to ForeignAssistance.gov. The 10  agencies are the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), the Inter-American Foundation (IAF),  the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the Peace Corps, State,  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the U.S. African Development  Foundation (USADF), USAID, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA).", "The process consists of five key steps, which occur on a quarterly basis:  1.  State\u2019s ForeignAssistance.gov team reaches out to each of the  agency points of contact to collect that quarter\u2019s data and provides  technical guidance documents, including the bulletin.  2.  Each agency point of contact e-mails data to State in a spreadsheet  or the extensible markup language (XML) format, which can contain  as many as 189 data fields per activity. In 2014, State expanded the  number of data fields to a total of 189 to align with the IATI Standard.  State officials indicated that some of the fields (e.g., currency and  U.S. government) are auto-populated by the ForeignAssistance.gov  team and that not all data fields are relevant to every agency. State  officials told us that 55 of the 189 data fields are the most relevant to  users and can be downloaded from ForeignAssistance.gov in  spreadsheet format (see fig. 3). In November 2015, State prioritized  37 data fields that are critical to the U.S. government\u2019s foreign  assistance reporting, according to State. According to State officials,  on average, the 10 agencies reporting data for ForeignAssistance.gov  submit quarterly data for 40 to 50 data fields.  3.  After converting the agency-submitted spreadsheet data to XML  format for agencies that do not have conversion capability, State  checks the agency data to determine whether all required fields are  populated.  4.  State relays any missing values or possible data reporting errors to  agencies and allows them to review and make corrections before it  publishes the data on the public website.  5.  Using the agency-corrected data, State creates and publishes  downloadable data files on ForeignAssistance.gov. During this final  step, State also simultaneously links the quarterly data files to the IATI  Registry.", "In November 2015, State created a community of practice website to  allow agency points of contact to engage online, clarify any issues, and  share lessons learned.

In September 2015, officials from all 12 agencies told  us that State had not reached out to them with specific reporting  instructions. Between November 2015 and May 2016, State provided the  toolkit to all 12 agencies and conducted information sessions with most of  them on reporting data for ForeignAssistance.gov.", "The toolkit contains descriptions of the data fields and resources to  support the five-phase data publishing process. It also includes a list of  37 priority data fields, which, according to State, will make it easier for  agencies to identify where they should focus their data collection efforts.  The five phases of the publishing process are the following:  1.  Planning phase: Agencies collaborate with the  ForeignAssistance.gov team to understand the general reporting  requirements.  2.  Discovery phase: Agencies review their systems to identify foreign  assistance data and better understand the data sources and needs.  3.  Preparation phase: Agencies create and submit data samples to the  ForeignAssistance.gov team, which provides feedback.  4.  Processing phase: Agencies submit a final dataset to the  ForeignAssistance.gov team and conducts quality assurance checks.  5.  Execution phase: State uploads the final approved dataset to  ForeignAssistance.gov, and agencies can issue press releases to  external stakeholders.", "Between December 2015 and January 2016, State conducted two  information sessions on the toolkit.
