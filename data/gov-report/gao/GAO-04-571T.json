Subtitle D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 allows Energy to help its contractor employees file state workers' compensation claims for illnesses determined by a panel of physicians to be caused by exposure to toxic substances in the course of employment at an Energy facility. Congress mandated that GAO study the effectiveness of the benefit program under Subtitle D of this Act. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on this issue and focuses on four key areas: (1) the number, status, and characteristics of claims filed with Energy; (2) the extent to which Energy policies and procedures help employees file timely claims for these state benefits; (3) the extent to which there will be a \"willing payer\" of workers' compensation benefits, that is, an insurer who--by order from or agreement with Energy--will not contest these claims; and (4) a framework that could be used for evaluating possible options for changing the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During the first 2 1/2 years of the program, ending December 31, 2003, Energy had completely processed about 6 percent of the more than 23,000 cases that had been filed. Energy had begun processing of nearly 35 percent of cases, but processing had not yet begun on nearly 60 percent of the cases. While Energy got off to a slow start in processing cases, it is now processing enough cases that there is a backlog of cases waiting for review by a physician panel. Energy has taken some steps intended to reduce this backlog, such as reducing the number of physicians needed for some panels. Nonetheless, a shortage of qualified physicians continues to constrain the agency's capacity to decide cases more quickly. Consequently, claimants will likely continue to experience lengthy delays in receiving the determinations they need to file workers' compensation claims. GAO estimates that more than half of the cases associated with Energy facilities in 9 states that account for more than three-quarters of all Subtitle D cases filed are likely to have a willing payer of benefits. Another quarter of the cases in these 9 states, while not technically having a willing payer, have workers' compensation coverage provided by an insurer that has stated that it will not contest these claims. However, the remaining 20 percent of cases lack willing payers and are likely to be contested, which means that many of these cases may be less likely to receive compensation. Because of data limitations, these percentages provide an order of magnitude estimate of the extent to which claimants will have willing payers. The estimates are not a prediction of actual benefit outcomes for claimants. In this testimony, GAO also provides a framework for evaluating potential options for changing the program to address the willing payer issue. This framework includes a range of issues that would help the Congress assess options if it chooses to change the current program. One of these issues in particular--the federal cost implications--should be carefully considered in the context of the current federal fiscal environment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to update the information we provided in  our November 21, 2003 testimony before you on our work regarding the  effectiveness of the benefit program under Subtitle D of the Energy  Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000  (EEOICPA). This legislation was designed to provide assistance to  contractor employees in obtaining compensation for occupational  illnesses. Congress mandated that we study this issue and report to the  Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and Appropriations  and the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Appropriations.", "For the last several decades, the Department of Energy (Energy) and its  predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of  individuals in secret and dangerous work in the nuclear weapons  production complex. Over the years, employees were unknowingly  exposed to toxic substances, including radioactive and hazardous  materials, and studies such as one commissioned by the National  Economic Council have shown that many of these employees  subsequently developed serious illnesses. EEOICPA established two  programs to help secure compensation for employees who developed  occupational illnesses or for their survivors. Congressional Committees,   as well as individual Members of Congress, claimants, and advocates have  raised concerns regarding Energy\u2019s processing of claims and the  availability of benefits once claims have been decided.", "Enacted as title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which was signed into law on  October 30, 2000, this legislation has two major components. Subtitle B  provides eligible workers who were exposed to radiation or other toxic  substances and who subsequently developed illnesses such as cancer and  lung disease a one-time payment of up to $150,000 and covers future  medical expenses related to the illness. The Department of Labor  administers these benefits, payable from a compensation fund established  by the same legislation. Subtitle D allows Energy to help its contractor  employees file state workers\u2019 compensation claims for illnesses  determined by a panel of physicians to be caused by exposure to toxic  substances in the course of employment at an Energy facility.", "My testimony today reflects our ongoing review of the effectiveness of  Energy\u2019s implementation of Subtitle D. Our work is focused on four key  areas: (1) the number, status, and characteristics of claims filed with  Energy; (2) the extent to which Energy policies and procedures help  employees file timely claims for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits;   (3) the extent to which there will be a \u201cwilling payer\u201d of workers\u2019  compensation benefits; that is, an insurer who\u2014by order from, or  agreement with, Energy\u2014will not contest these claims; and (4) a  framework that could be used for evaluating possible options for changing  the program in the event that there may not be willing payers of benefits.", "In summary, as of December 31, 2003, Energy had fully processed about   6 percent of the more than 23,000 cases received. Most of the fully  processed cases had been found ineligible because of either a lack of  employment at an eligible facility or an illness related to toxic exposure.  While Energy got off to a slow start in processing cases, it is now  processing enough cases that there is a backlog of cases waiting for review  by a physician panel. The agency has taken some steps to reduce this  backlog; nonetheless, a shortage of qualified physicians continues to  constrain Energy\u2019s capacity to decide cases more quickly. In the  meantime, Energy has not kept claimants sufficiently informed about the  delays in the processing of their claims as well as what claimants can  expect as they proceed with state workers\u2019 compensation claims.", "While the workers\u2019 compensation claims from about 80 percent of the  cases associated with major Energy facilities in 9 states are not likely to be  contested by employers or their insurers, actual compensation is not  certain. This figure is based primarily on the method of workers\u2019  compensation coverage used by the Energy contractors and is not an  estimate of the number of cases that will ultimately be paid. Specifically,  slightly more than half the cases associated with facilities in the 9 states  are likely to have a willing payer of benefits and another quarter of the  cases, while not having willing payers, have workers\u2019 compensation  coverage provided by an insurer that has stated that it will not contest the  claim for benefits. However, the remaining 20 percent of cases lack willing  payers and are likely to be contested, which means that many of these  cases may be less likely to receive compensation. Because of data  limitations, these percentages provide an order of magnitude estimate of  the extent to which claimants will have willing payers. The estimates are  not a prediction of actual benefit outcomes for claimants.", "Various options are available to improve payment outcomes for the cases  that receive a positive physician panel determination, but lack willing  payers under the current program. If it were decided that the program  should be modified, the options for changing it range from adding a federal  benefit to the existing program for cases that lack a willing payer to  designing a completely new program. Congress would need to examine  these options in terms of several issues, including the source, method, and  amount of the federal funding required to pay benefits; the length of time  needed to implement changes; the criteria for determining who is eligible;  and the equitable treatment of claimants. In particular, the federal cost  implications of these options should be carefully considered in the context  of the current federal fiscal environment.", "To perform our review, we analyzed data extracted from Energy\u2019s Subtitle  D case management system for applications filed through June 30, 2003,  and again through December 31, 2003. We also reviewed the provisions of,  and interviewed officials with, the workers\u2019 compensation programs in  nine states with Energy facilities accounting for more than three-quarters  of Subtitle D cases filed, and we interviewed the contractors operating the  major facilities in these states. In addition, we conducted site visits to  three Energy facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the state with facilities  accounting for the largest number of Subtitle D claims. We also  interviewed key program officials and other experts.

Under the new law, workers or their survivors could apply for  assistance from Energy in pursuing state workers\u2019 compensation benefits,  and if they received a positive determination from Energy, the agency  would direct its contractors to not contest the workers\u2019 compensation  claims or awards. Energy\u2019s rules to implement the new program became  effective in September 2002, and the agency began to process the  applications it had been accepting since July 2001, when the law took  effect.", "Energy\u2019s claims process has several steps. First, claimants file applications  and provide all available medical evidence. Energy then develops the  claims by requesting records of employment, medical treatment, and  exposure to toxic substances from the Energy facilities at which the  workers were employed. If Energy determines that the worker was not  employed by one of its facilities or did not have an illness that could be  caused by exposure to toxic substances, the agency finds the claimant  ineligible. For all others, once development is complete, a panel of three  physicians reviews the case and decides whether exposure to a toxic  substance during employment at an Energy facility was at least as likely as  not to have caused, contributed to, or aggravated the claimed medical  condition. The panel physicians are appointed by the National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) but paid by Energy for this work.  Claimants receiving positive determinations are advised that they may  wish to file claims for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Claimants  found ineligible or receiving negative determinations may appeal to  Energy\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals.", "Each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia has its own workers\u2019  compensation program to provide benefits to workers who are injured on  the job or contract a work-related illness. Benefits include medical  treatment and cash payments that partially replace lost wages.  Collectively, these state programs paid more than $46 billion in cash and  medical benefits in 2001. In general, employers finance workers\u2019  compensation programs. Depending on state law, employers finance these  programs through one of three methods: (1) they pay insurance premiums  to a private insurance carrier, (2) they contribute to a state workers\u2019  compensation fund, or (3) they set funds aside for this purpose as self- insurance. Although state workers\u2019 compensation laws were enacted in  part as an attempt to avoid litigation over workplace accidents, the  workers\u2019 compensation process is still generally adversarial, with  employers and their insurers tending to contest aspects of claims that they  consider not valid.", "State workers\u2019 compensation programs vary as to the level of benefits,  length of payments, and time limits for filing. For example, in 1999, the  maximum weekly benefit for a total disability in New Mexico was less than  $400, while in Iowa it was approximately $950. In addition, in Idaho, the  weekly benefit for total disability would be reduced after 52 weeks, while  in Iowa benefits would continue at the original rate for the duration of the  disability. Further, in Tennessee, a claim must be filed within 1 year of the  beginning of incapacity or death. In contrast, in Kentucky a claim must be  filed within 3 years of either the last exposure to most substances or onset  of disease symptoms, but within 20 years of exposure to radiation or  asbestos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Has Processed Few Cases And Insufficient Strategic Planning And Data Collection Complicate Program Management", "paragraphs": ["As of December 31, 2003, Energy had completely processed about 6  percent of the more than 23,000 cases that had been filed.

Moreover, since our prior testimony, Energy has also completed a  comprehensive review of its Subtitle D program that resulted in a plan that  identifies strategies for further accelerating its case processing.

The data system  used by Energy to aid in case management was developed by contractors  without detailed specifications from Energy. Furthermore, the system was  developed before Energy established its processing goals, and the changes  Energy implemented to improve its ability to track certain information  have resulted in more recent status data being not completely comparable  with older status data.", "Because it did not adequately plan for the various uses of its data, Energy  lacks some of the information needed to analyze how cases will fare when  they enter the state workers\u2019 compensation systems or to track their  outcomes. Specifically, it is difficult for Energy to predict whether willing  payers of workers\u2019 compensation benefits will exist using case  management system data because the information about the specific  employer for whom the claimant worked is not collected in a format that  can be systematically analyzed. Since employers are liable for workers\u2019  compensation coverage, specific employer information is important in  determining whether a willing payer exists.

However, in an effort to make the panel  process more efficient, Energy published new rules on March 24, 2004,  that re-defined a physician panel as one or more physicians appointed to  evaluate these cases and changed the timeframes for completing their  review. In addition, the agency began holding a full-time physician panel in  Washington, D.C. in January 2004, staffed by physicians who are willing to  serve full-time for a 2- or 3-week period.", "Energy and NIOSH officials have taken steps to expand the number of  physicians who would qualify to serve on the panels and to recruit more  physicians, including some willing to work full-time. While Energy has  made several requests that NIOSH appoint additional physicians to staff  the panels, such as requesting 500 physicians in June 2003, NIOSH officials  have indicated that the pool of physicians with the appropriate credentials  and experience is limited. The criteria NIOSH originally used to evaluate  qualifications for appointing physicians to these panels included: (1) board  certification in a primary discipline; (2) knowledge of occupational  medicine; (3) minimum of 5 years of relevant clinical practice following  residency; and (4) reputation for good medical judgment, impartiality, and  efficiency. NIOSH recently modified these qualifications, primarily to  reduce the amount of required clinical experience so that physicians with  experience in relevant clinical or public health practice or research,  academic, consulting, or private sector work can now qualify to serve on  the panels. NIOSH has revised its recruiting materials to reflect this  change and to point out that Energy is also interested in physicians willing  to serve on panels full-time. However, a NIOSH official indicated that only  a handful of physicians would likely be interested in serving full-time on  the panels.", "Energy officials have also explored additional sources from which NIOSH  might recruit qualified physicians, but they have expressed concerns that  the current statutory cap on the rate of pay for panel physicians may limit  the willingness of physicians from these sources to serve on the panels.  For example, Energy officials have suggested that physicians in the  military services might be used on a part-time basis, but the rate of pay for  their military work exceeds the current cap. Similarly, physicians from the  Public Health Service could serve on temporary full-time details as panel  physicians. To elevate the rate of pay for panel physicians to a level that is  consistent with the rate physicians from these sources normally receive,  Energy officials plan to develop a legislative proposal that will modify the  current cap on the rate of pay and would also expand Energy\u2019s hiring  authority.", "Panel physicians have also suggested methods to Energy for improving the  efficiency of the panels. For example, some physicians have said that more  complete profiles of the types and locations of specific toxic substances at  each facility would speed their ability to decide cases. While Energy  officials reported that they have completed facility overviews for about  half the major sites, specific site reference data are available for only a few  sites.

Energy officials concede that claimants who filed in the early days of the  program may not have been provided enough information to understand  the benefits they were filing for. As a consequence, some claimants who  filed under both Subtitle B and Subtitle D early in the program later  withdrew their claims under Subtitle D because they had intended to file  only for Subtitle B benefits or because they had not understood that they  would still have to file for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits after  receiving a positive determination from a physician panel. After the final  regulations were published in August 2002, Energy officials said that  claimants had a better understanding of the benefits for which they were  applying.", "Energy has not kept claimants sufficiently informed about the status of  their claims under Subtitle D. Until recently, Energy\u2019s policy was to  provide no written communication about claims status between the  acknowledgement letters it sent shortly after receiving applications and  the point it began to process claims. Since nearly half of the claims filed in  the first year of the program remained unprocessed as of December 31,  2003, these claimants would have received no information about the status  of their claims for more than 1 year. Energy recently decided to change  this policy and provide letters at 6-month intervals to all claimants with  pending claims. Although the first of these standardized letters sent to  claimants in the fall of 2003 did not provide information about individual  claims status, it did inform claimants about a new service on the program\u2019s  redesigned Web site through which claimants can check on the status of  their claim.

Energy\u2019s letter to claimants transmitting a positive determination  from a physician panel does not always provide enough information about  how they would go about filing for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits.  For example, a contractor in Tennessee reported that a worker was  directed by Energy\u2019s letter received in September 2003 to file a claim with  the state office in Nashville when Tennessee\u2019s rules require that the claim  be filed with the employer. The contractor reported the problem to Energy  in the same month, but Energy letters sent to Tennessee claimants in  October and December 2003 continued to direct claimants to the state  office. Finally, claimants are not informed as to whether there is likely to  be a willing payer of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and what this means  for the processing of that claim.

Another 25 percent of the  cases, while not technically having a willing payer, have workers\u2019  compensation coverage provided by an insurer that has stated that it will  not contest these claims and is currently processing several workers\u2019  compensation claims without contesting them.

Similarly, the agreement by the commercial insurer for the workers at the  two facilities that constitute 25 percent of the cases to pay the workers  compensation claims will mostly likely also supercede such state  provisions. However, since the insurer is not bound by Energy\u2019s orders  and it does not have a formal agreement with either Energy or the  contractors to not contest these claims, there is nothing to guarantee that  the insurer will continue to process claims in this manner.", "About 20 percent of cases in the 9 states we analyzed are likely to be  contested. Therefore, in some instances, these cases may be less likely to  receive compensation than a comparable case for which there is a willing  payer, unless the claimant is able to overcome challenges to the claim. In  addition, contested cases can take longer to be resolved. For example, one  claimant whose claim is being contested by an insurer was told by her  attorney that because of discovery and deposition motions by the  opposing attorney, it would be two years before her case was heard on its  merits. Specifically, the cases that lack willing payers involve contractors  that (1) have a commercial insurance policy, (2) use a state fund to pay  workers\u2019 compensation claims, or (3) do not have a current contract with  Energy. In each of these situations, Energy maintains that it lacks the  authority to make or enforce an order to not contest claims. For instance,  an Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation official said that the state  would not automatically approve a case, but would evaluate each workers\u2019  compensation case carefully to ensure that it was valid and thereby  protect its state fund.

This option would  move the administration of the Subtitle D benefit from the state programs  entirely to the federal arena, but would retain the workers\u2019 compensation  concept for providing partial replacement of lost wages as well as medical  benefits. For example, claims with positive physician panel determinations  could be evaluated under the eligibility criteria of the Federal Employees  Compensation Act and, if found eligible, could be paid benefits consistent  with the criteria of that program.", "Option 3\u2014Expanded Subtitle B program that does not use a  workers\u2019 compensation model. Under this option, the current Subtitle B  program would be expanded to include the other illnesses resulting from  radiation and toxic exposures that are currently considered under the  Subtitle D program. The Subtitle D program would be eliminated as a  separate program and, if found eligible, claimants would receive a lump- sum payment and coverage of future medical expenses related to the  workers\u2019 illnesses, assuming they had not already received benefits under  Subtitle B. The Department of Labor would need to expand its regulations  to specify which illnesses would be covered and the criteria for  establishing eligibility for each of these illnesses. In addition, since the  current programs have differing standards for determining whether the  worker\u2019s illness was related to his employment, it would have to be  decided which standard would be used for the new category of illnesses.", "Option 4\u2014New federal program that uses a different type of  benefit structure. This option would address the willing payer issue as  part of developing a new program that involves moving away from the  workers\u2019 compensation and Subtitle B structures and establishing a new  federal benefit administered by a structure that conforms to the type of the  benefit and its eligibility criteria. This option would provide an opportunity  to consider anew the purpose of the Subtitle D provisions. As a starting  point, policymakers could consider different existing models such as the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, designed to provide partial  restitution to individuals whose health was put at risk because of their  exposure even when their illnesses do not result in ongoing disability. But  they could also choose to build an entirely new program that is not based  on any existing model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Issues Should Be Considered in Deciding Whether Changes Are Needed and Assessing the Options", "paragraphs": ["In deciding whether and how to change the Subtitle D program to ensure a  source of benefit payments for claims that would be found eligible if they  had a willing payer, policymakers will need to consider the trade-offs  involved. Table 2 arrays the relevant issues to provide a framework for  evaluating the range of options in a logical sequence. We have constructed  the sequence of issues in this framework in terms of the purpose and type  of benefit as being the focal point for the evaluation, with consideration of  the other issues flowing from that first decision. For example, decisions  about eligibility criteria would need to consider issues relating to within- state and across-state equity for Subtitle D claimants. The framework  would also provide for decisions on issues such as the source of federal  funding\u2014trust fund or increased appropriations\u2014and the appropriate  federal agency to administer the benefit. For each of the options, the type  of benefit would suggest which agency should be chosen to administer the  benefit and would depend, in part, on an agency\u2019s capacity to administer a  benefit program. In examining these issues, the effects on federal costs  would have to be carefully considered.  Ultimately, policymakers will need  to weigh the relative importance of these issues in deciding whether and  how to proceed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Type of Benefit", "paragraphs": ["In evaluating how the purpose and type of benefit now available under  Subtitle D could be changed, policymakers would first need to focus on  the goals they wish to achieve in providing compensation to this group of  individuals. If the goal is to compensate only those individuals who can  demonstrate lost wages because of their illnesses, a recurring cash benefit  in an amount that relates to former earnings might be in order and a  workers\u2019 compensation option, either a state benefits with a federal back  up or a federal workers\u2019 compensation benefit, would promote this  purpose. If, on the other hand, the goal is to compensate claimants for all  cases in which workers were disabled because of their employment\u2014even  when workers continue to work and have not lost wages\u2013the option to  expand Subtitle B would allow a benefit such as a flat payment amount not  tied to former earnings.", "For consideration of a new federal program option, it might be useful to  also consider other federal programs dealing with the consequences of  exposure to radiation as a starting point. For example, the Radiation  Exposure Compensation Act was designed to provide partial restitution to  individuals whose health was put at risk because of their exposure. Similar  to Subtitle B, the act created a federal trust fund, which provides for  payments to individuals who can establish that they have certain diseases  and that they were exposed to radiation at certain locations and at  specified times. However, this payment is not dependent on demonstrating  ongoing disability or actual losses resulting from the disease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility Criteria and Equity of Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The options could also have different effects with respect to eligibility  criteria and the equity of benefit outcomes for current Subtitle D claimants  based on these criteria. By equity of outcomes, we mean that claimants  with similar illnesses and circumstances receive similar benefit outcomes.   The current program may not provide equity for all Subtitle D claimants  within a state because a claim that has a willing payer could receive a  different outcome than a similar claim that does not have a willing payer,  but at least three of the options could provide within-state equity.  With  respect to across-state equity, the current program and the option to  provide a federal back up to the state workers\u2019 compensation programs  would not achieve equity for Subtitle D claimants in different states. In  contrast, the option based on a federal workers\u2019 compensation model as  well as the expanded Subtitle B option would be more successful in  achieving across-state equity.", "Regardless of the option, changes made to Subtitle D could also  potentially result in differing treatment of claims decided before and after  the implementation of the change. In addition, changing the program to  remove the assistance in filing workers\u2019 compensation claims may be seen  as depriving a claimant of an existing right. Further, any changes could  also have implications beyond EEOICPA, to the extent that the changes to  Subtitle D could establish precedents for federal compensation to private  sector employees in other industries who were made ill by their  employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Costs", "paragraphs": ["Effects on federal costs would depend on the generosity of the benefit in  the option chosen and the procedures established for processing claims  for benefits. Under the current program, workers\u2019 compensation benefits  that are paid without contest will come from contract dollars that  ultimately come from federal sources \u2013 there is no specific federal  appropriation for this purpose. Because all of the options are designed to  improve the likelihood of payment for claimants who meet all other  criteria, it is likely that federal costs would be higher for all options than  under the current program. Specifically, federal costs would increase for  the option to provide a federal back up to the state workers\u2019 compensation  program because it would ensure payment at rates similar to the state  programs for the significant minority of claimants whose claims are likely  to be contested and possibly denied under the state programs. Further, the  federal costs of adopting a federal workers\u2019 compensation option would  be higher than under the first option because all claimants \u2013 those who  would have been paid under the state programs as well as those whose  claims would have been contested under the state programs \u2013 would be  eligible for a federal benefit similar to the benefit for federal employees. In  general, federal workers\u2019 compensation benefits are more generous than  state benefits because they replaces a higher proportion of the worker\u2019s  salary than many states and the federal maximum rate of wage  replacement is higher than all the state maximum rates.", "For either of the two options above, a decision to offset the Subtitle D  benefits against the Subtitle B benefit could lessen the effect of the  increased costs, given reports by Energy officials that more than 90  percent of Subtitle D claimants have also filed for Subtitle B benefits.  However, the degree of this effect is difficult to determine because many  of the claimants who have filed under both programs may be denied  Subtitle B benefits. The key distinction would be whether workers who  sustained certain types of illnesses based on their Energy employment  should be compensated under both programs as opposed to recourse  under only one or the other. If they were able to seek compensation from  only one program, the claimant\u2019s ability to elect one or the other based on  individual needs should be considered.", "The effects on federal cost of an expanded Subtitle B option or a new  federal program option are more difficult to assess. In many cases, the  Subtitle B benefit of up to $150,000 could exceed the cost of the lifetime  benefit for some claimants under either of the workers\u2019 compensation  options, resulting in higher federal costs. However, the extent of these  higher costs could be mitigated by the fact that many of the claimants who  would have filed for both benefits in the current system would be eligible  for only one cash benefit regardless of the number or type of illnesses. The  degree of cost or savings would be difficult to assess without additional  information on the specific claims outcomes in the current Subtitle B  program.
