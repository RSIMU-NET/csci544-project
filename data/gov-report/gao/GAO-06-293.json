Some state officials and consumer groups expressed concerns about a perceived loss of consumer protection. GAO identified (1) how OCC's complaint process compares with that of other federal bank regulators, (2) how complaint information informs OCC's supervision of national banks, and (3) issues that consumer advocates and state officials have raised about OCC's consumer protection efforts and OCC's responses to the issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, OCC's process for handling consumer complaints--carried out primarily by its Customer Assistance Group (CAG)--is similar to that of the other three federal bank regulators. However, unlike two of them, OCC lacks a mechanism to gather feedback from consumers it assists that could help it and the banks improve service to consumers. All of the regulators resolve the majority of complaints by providing or clarifying information for bank customers; less frequently, the regulators investigate and determine that a bank or customer erred. OCC annually handles more complaints than the other regulators, likely reflecting its position as the supervisor of banks with the majority of the nation's bank assets. OCC's complaint volume has not increased appreciably since it issued the preemption rules. OCC, in accordance with federal requirements for agencies to measure how they are fulfilling goals related to serving the public, measures the percentage of complaints it resolves within 60 days, a target other federal bank regulators also use. In reporting its performance, however, OCC includes data on its response to consumers' inquiries, which typically take less time, thereby overstating its performance on timeliness of responses to complaints. OCC's bank examiners use consumer complaint information collected by CAG to plan or adjust examinations. CAG staff and examiners communicate regularly regarding specific complaints or complaint volume and coordinate these efforts to provide consistent messages when discussing consumer-related issues with bank officials. In addition, complaint data inform OCC policy guidance to banks, often addressing potential compliance and safety and soundness risks banks face. CAG also provides feedback to banks, focusing on complaint trends and potential risks that may impact the banks' compliance with consumer protection laws or other issues. Many of the state officials and consumer advocates GAO contacted during visits to four states, as well as some representatives of national organizations, nevertheless remain concerned about OCC's commitment and capacity to address consumer complaints--especially given their perception that the rules effectively ended protections provided by state laws and processes. Specific concerns these officials cited include an inability to obtain information on complaint outcomes, the fact that OCC handles complaints from a single location, and the adequacy of CAG's resources. OCC has taken actions addressing some of these concerns. The agency views itself as a neutral arbiter and continues to provide an avenue for consumers to file complaints related to national banks. OCC recently hired additional CAG staff and has begun working with a third-party vendor to expand telephone service from 7 to 12 hours a day. GAO noted that some officials and advocates contacted were unaware of OCC's process for handling consumer complaints and the assistance it can provide."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2004, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), which supervises federally chartered \u201cnational\u201d banks,  issued two final rules, the bank activities rule and the visitorial powers rule  (commonly known as the \u201cpreemption rules\u201d). The bank activities rule  addressed the applicability of certain types of state laws to lending,  deposit-taking, and other federally authorized activities of national banks.  The visitorial powers rule addressed OCC\u2019s view of its authority under  federal law to inspect, examine, supervise, and regulate the affairs of  national banks. Some state officials, Members of Congress, and consumer  groups opposed the rules because of what they viewed as potentially  adverse affects on the dual banking system\u2014which encompasses both  national and state-chartered banks\u2014and on consumer protection. In  particular, state attorneys general, state banking departments and  consumer advocates expressed doubts about OCC\u2019s ability or inclination\u2014 as the sole regulator of national banks and their operating subsidiaries\u2014to  adequately protect consumers.", "In addition to OCC, the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve)\u2014 including the Board of Governors and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\u2014the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS) are the primary federal regulators of banks. For  commercial and savings banks with state bank charters, states charter the  entity and have supervisory responsibilities, while the Federal Reserve or  FDIC serve as the primary federal supervisor for these banks. In the National Bank Act, the Congress created OCC to supervise national banks.   In its capacity as the supervisor of national banks, OCC issues regulations,  policies, and interpretations to establish standards, define acceptable  practices, provide guidance on risks, and prohibit or restrict practices.  Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, OCC is charged with protecting  consumers from unlawful and deceptive practices by national banks. One  indicator of potential consumer protection issues is consumer complaints  that OCC receives and their resolution. The main division within OCC  tasked with handling consumer complaints is the Customer Assistance  Group (CAG), located in Houston, Texas.", "In your letter, you requested that we review OCC\u2019s rulemaking process for  promulgating the preemption rules, OCC\u2019s process and capacity to handle  consumer complaints, and the impact and the potential impact of the rules  on the dual banking system and consumer protection. On October 17, 2005,  we provided you with a report on the rulemaking process. This report  focuses on OCC\u2019s process and capacity to handle consumer complaints.  Specifically, the report identifies (1) how OCC\u2019s consumer complaint  process and its disposition of complaints compare with those of other  federal bank regulators, (2) how OCC\u2019s complaint process relates to the  supervision of national banks, and (3) issues that consumer advocates and  state officials have raised about OCC in relation to consumer protection  and OCC\u2019s responses to these issues. We will soon provide you with a  separate report that discusses the impact of the rulemaking on the dual  banking system and consumer protection.", "To examine how OCC handles complaints and how its consumer complaint  process and disposition of complaints compare with those of other bank  regulators, we interviewed OCC officials, as well as their counterparts at  the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OTS. In addition, we analyzed OCC\u2019s  consumer complaint policies and procedures. We visited the CAG office in  Houston and observed its work, and we reviewed a nonprobability sample  of complaint case files to understand the different types of complaints and  outcomes. We also obtained and analyzed data on consumer complaints  from the four federal bank regulators covering calendar years 2000 to 2004  to determine the number and types of complaints, as well as the nature of  the outcomes for consumers, and how many complaints were resolved  within the regulators\u2019 required time frames. To determine how OCC\u2019s  complaint process relates to the supervision of national banks, we  interviewed OCC and bank officials. We also analyzed documents to  identify how, and the extent to which, bank officials and OCC examiners  use consumer complaint information in planning and implementing  supervisory activities, including policies and guidance. To identify issues  raised by consumer advocates and state officials about OCC and its role in  consumer protection, we conducted site visits between March and August  2005, in four states: California, Georgia, New York, and North Carolina. We  selected these locations based on their experience with state consumer  protection laws. The site visits included interviews of state attorneys  general, banking regulators, banking officials, and local consumer advocate  groups, as well as analysis of relevant documents. We also interviewed  state attorneys general and banking regulators in Iowa and Idaho by  telephone. We interviewed representatives of national consumer groups  and trade groups for state officials\u2014banking regulators and states\u2019  attorneys general\u2014in Washington, D.C. We conducted our audit work in  the previously mentioned four states, in addition to Texas and Washington,  D.C., from October 2004 through December 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

As of March 2005, the assets of the  banks that OCC supervises accounted for approximately 67 percent\u2014 about $5.8 trillion\u2014of assets in all U.S. commercial banks. Among the more  than 1,800 banks OCC supervises are 14 of the top-20 commercial banks in  asset size.", "OCC groups its regulatory responsibilities into three program areas:  chartering, regulation, and supervision. Chartering includes not only  reviewing and approving applications for charters but also reviewing and  approving proposed mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations. Regulation  includes establishing written regulations, policies, operating guidance,  interpretations, and examination policies and handbooks. Additionally, in  its most recent strategic plan, OCC identified its regulatory approach as  one that would ensure that national banks operated in a \u201cflexible legal and  regulatory framework\u201d that enables them to provide a \u201cfull competitive  array\u201d of financial services.", "According to OCC\u2019s latest strategic plan, OCC\u2019s supervision program  consists of ongoing supervisory and enforcement activities undertaken to  ensure that each national bank is operating in a safe and sound manner and  is complying with applicable laws, rules, and regulations concerning the  bank, customers, and communities it serves. OCC\u2019s supervisory activities  include examinations and enforcement actions, dispute resolution, ongoing  monitoring of banks, and analysis of systemic risk and market trends. OCC  policies establish a minimum level of activity that must occur during the  supervisory cycle, during which time examiners assess the overall  condition of the bank in the areas of capital adequacy, asset quality,  management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risks. Such  examinations are generally referred to as \u201csafety and soundness\u201d  examinations. In large banks, much of this work is conducted throughout  the year by examiners assessing specific aspects of a bank\u2019s management  and operations, while in the smaller banks, the on-site examination  generally occurs at one time during a 12- or 18-month period. OCC has a  team of full-time, on-site examiners who are located at large banks  throughout the year and who conduct ongoing monitoring and  examinations. In addition to the safety and soundness examinations, OCC  conducts compliance examinations that assess the bank\u2019s compliance with  laws intended to protect or assist consumers, such as laws related to  disclosure of loan terms, fair lending, equal credit opportunity, and others.  Consumer compliance examinations are conducted on a continuous 3-year  cycle in large banks and at least every 36 months at small banks.", "OCC traditionally has issued opinions on a case-by-case basis, rather than  rules or regulations, on whether the National Bank Act preempts state laws  that impose standards or restrictions on the business of national banks. In  contrast, on January 13, 2004, OCC issued the two preemption rules on the  extent to which the National Bank Act preempts the application of state  and local laws to national banks and their operating subsidiaries. The rules  and the manner in which OCC promulgated them generated considerable  controversy and debate, including questions about OCC\u2019s authority to issue  the rules. According to OCC, the two rules \u201ccodified\u201d judicial decisions and  OCC opinions on preemption under the National Bank Act by making them  generally applicable and clarified certain issues. The visitorial powers rule,  as stated by OCC, clarifies that (1) federal law commits the supervision of  national banks\u2019 banking activities exclusively to OCC (except where  federal law provides otherwise) and that (2) states may not use judicial  actions as an indirect means of regulating those activities. The banking  activities rule preempts categories of state laws that relate to bank  activities and operations, describes the test for preemption that OCC will  apply to state laws that do not fall within the identified categories, and lists certain types of state laws that are not preempted. In proposing the  banking activities rule, OCC stated that it needed to provide timely and  more comprehensive standards about the applicability of state laws to  lending, deposit taking, and other authorized activities of national banks  because of the number and significance of questions banks were posing  about preemption in those areas.", "However, opponents such as consumer groups and state legislators feared  that the preemption of state law, particularly concerning predatory lending  practices, would weaken consumer protections. They noted, in  commenting on the preemption rules, that the rules would prevent states  from regulating operating subsidiaries of national banks and would  diminish the states\u2019 ability to protect their citizens. Prior to OCC\u2019s issuance  of the rules, consumers who had complaints with national banks or their  operating subsidiaries sometimes filed complaints with state officials who  tried to resolve them, although consumers could have filed such  complaints with OCC, and many did. Since OCC issued the rules, some  state officials refer all complaints involving national banks to OCC while  others, through informal arrangements, still try to assist consumers. It is  too soon to assess the practical effect of the rules on a consumer who has a  complaint with a national bank, given the short time frame and legal  questions raised by opponents to the rules. We address some facets of the  rules\u2019 practical effect on consumers in this report and will address others in  our subsequent report on the impact of the rules on the dual banking  system and consumer protection.", "One of OCC\u2019s strategic goals is to ensure all customers have fair access to  financial services and are treated fairly. The agency\u2019s strategic plan lists  objectives and strategies to achieve this goal, including fostering fair  treatment through OCC guidance and supervisory enforcement actions  where appropriate, and providing an avenue for customers of national  banks to resolve complaints. The main division within OCC tasked with  handling consumer complaints is CAG. This group is a part of OCC\u2019s Office  of the Ombudsman, a distinct division of OCC that operates independently  of the agency\u2019s bank supervision function. In addition to CAG, the Office of  the Ombudsman oversees (1) the national bank appeals process\u2014a forum  by which banks may appeal the results of OCC\u2019s supervisory examinations  and ratings and (2) a postexamination questionnaire to obtain feedback  from banks. The Ombudsman reports directly to the Comptroller and is a  member of OCC senior management team (the Executive Committee) that  includes the Chief Counsel, the Chief National Bank Examiner, and the  Senior Deputy Comptrollers for Large Bank and Mid-size/Community Bank  Supervision.", "CAG\u2019s mission is to ensure that bank customers receive fair treatment in  resolving their complaints with national banks. According to the 2004  Report of the Ombudsman, CAG carries out its mission by providing  services to three constituent groups: (1) customers of national banks\u2014by  providing a venue to resolve complaints, (2) OCC bank supervisors\u2014by  alerting supervisory staff of emerging problems that may result in the  development of policy guidance or enforcement action, and (3) national  bank managers\u2014by providing a comprehensive analysis of complaint  volumes and trends. The Deputy Ombudsman manages and directs CAG  operations. Since 1999, CAG has employed about 40 full and part-time staff,  and it had 49 staff in 2005. The annual operating and personnel budget  attributable to CAG operations more than doubled from $2.6 million to $5.4  million between 1999 and 2005.

The volume of complaints OCC handles  is generally in proportion to the assets of the national banks it supervises.  From 2000 through 2004, OCC handled on average more than twice as  many complaints as the other regulators combined.

As illustrated in figure 1, each regulator generally  follows six distinct steps in processing a complaint:  The consumer submits the complaint;  The regulator determines if the bank is under its supervision;  The regulator forwards the complaint to the bank;  The bank sends a response to the regulator;  The regulator examines the response to see if it completely addresses  the consumer\u2019s complaint; and  The regulator notifies consumer of complaint\u2019s outcome.", "Although consumers may initially contact OCC or other regulators about  their complaints via various methods, such as telephone, mail, fax, or, in  some cases, E-mail, regulators normally do not formally accept a complaint  until they have received a signed complaint form or letter. After a  regulator receives a formal complaint, it must then determine if the bank  involved is under its jurisdiction. If not, then the regulator determines who  is the appropriate regulator and provides the consumer with contact  information or forwards the complaint. Once the appropriate regulator  receives the complaint, it forwards the complaint to the bank.

Among the four federal regulators, the time  allowed for initial response ranges from 10 to 20 days, with OCC requesting  a response within 10 days. All of the regulators permit the banks to  request additional time to review the complaint or compile necessary  information. After completing its review of the complaint, the bank sends a  response to the regulator. Often, the bank responds concurrently to the  consumer, since the consumer is the bank\u2019s customer. After receiving the  bank\u2019s response, each regulator examines it to determine if the consumer\u2019s  complaint has been completely and appropriately addressed. At this step,  the regulator examines the complaint and response to determine if any  additional follow-up is necessary by its supervisory or legal staff. If it is not  satisfied with the bank\u2019s response, then the regulator requests additional  information or clarification from the bank.

The Federal  Reserve mails a satisfaction survey, while FDIC directs consumers to a  Web-based survey. Federal Reserve officials explained that the Federal  Reserve has surveyed consumers since the mid 1980s and can link  individual surveys back to original complaints, but the agency has not  analyzed the aggregate data or used any findings from the surveys to  modify its complaint-handling process. However,  Federal Reserve officials  explained that sometimes specific survey results are shared with staff who  worked on the complaint or with management to better target staff  training.", "Neither OCC nor OTS has any formal mechanism to measure satisfaction  with the consumer complaint process (though officials from both agencies  explained that they receive many letters expressing both satisfaction and  disappointment with their services). OTS officials explained that the small  number of complaints they receive does not warrant the resources  necessary to implement a customer satisfaction survey.", "Like other federal agencies, OCC measures and reports on certain aspects  of its performance in accordance with the Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). According to the 2004 Report of the  Ombudsman, OCC measures the effectiveness of its supervisory process  through an examination questionnaire, which is provided to all national  banks at the conclusion of their supervisory cycles. The questionnaire is  designed to gather direct and timely feedback from banks on OCC\u2019s  supervisory efforts. While the questionnaire is a useful step to help OCC  assess its performance regarding its national bank clients, OCC does not  have a comparable tool to gather information regarding its performance in  assisting the consumers of national banks. Collecting information about  how individual consumers assess the assistance CAG provides in  answering their questions or helping resolve a complaint with their bank  could be equally helpful for OCC to measure its performance in ensuring  fair treatment of bank customers.

In analyzing the  complaint data across the four federal regulators, we found that the  regulators, after investigating complaints, generally resolved them in one of  four ways, as shown in order of decreasing frequency: (1) providing the  consumer with additional information without any determination of error,  (2) withdrawing the complaint or tabling complaints already in litigation, (3) finding that the bank had not made an error, and (4) finding that the  bank had made an error."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulators Provided Consumers Additional Information", "paragraphs": ["Between 2000 and 2004, the most common resolution of complaints  handled by all federal regulators was that consumers were provided more  in-depth or specific information about their complaints (see fig. 2).", "In these cases, the regulator\u2019s investigation revealed that the consumer  required additional information to understand his or her situation, and the  regulator made no determination of whether the bank or the consumer had  made any error. For example:   The regulator might explain to the consumer that the complaint involves  a contractual dispute that is better handled by a court. For instance, in  one case, OCC informed a consumer to consider seeking legal counsel  since the matter between the bank and the consumer involved a factual  dispute concerning the interest rate on a credit card. The bank, based on  its review of credit information, raised the interest rate on the  consumer\u2019s credit card after providing the consumer adequate notice  about the impending change to the terms of credit, which included  information on how to opt out of the credit card if the consumer did not  agree to the new terms. The consumer complained that the bank failed  to provide adequate notice and, thus, improperly raised the interest rate.  After reviewing the relevant documentation from both the consumer  and bank, OCC informed the consumer that since the bank claimed to  have sent the proper notice to the consumer and the consumer denied  receiving the notice, the agency could not judge which party was  correct. Therefore, OCC counseled the consumer to consider taking  legal action should the consumer want to pursue the matter further.", "The regulator may determine that rather than wrongdoing, there was a  miscommunication between the bank and its customer. For example,  in one case involving a checking account, a bank charged a maintenance  fee to an account with a zero balance. The checking account had a  minimum monthly maintenance fee, which the bank deducted  automatically from the checking account. When the bank charged the  monthly maintenance fee and the balance became negative, the bank  charged an overdraft fee. The consumer understood that overdraft  protection should cover the maintenance fee but did not recognize that  overdraft protection would result in an additional fee. After OCC  forwarded the complaint to the bank, the bank decided to no longer  hold the consumer liable for the delinquent monthly maintenance and  overdraft fees that accumulated. OCC viewed the matter as  miscommunication between the bank and consumer.", "The regulator may determine that the complaint should be forwarded to  a different regulator. When appropriate, all four federal regulators  directly refer consumers, or forward their complaints, to other federal  and state agencies. We found that three federal regulators\u2014the Federal  Reserve, FDIC, and OCC\u2014referred a considerable number of  consumers who contacted them to another federal agency to have their  complaints or inquiries addressed. For example, from 2000 through  2004, FDIC referred about 40 percent of the consumers who contacted  them with a complaint to another federal agency; the Federal Reserve  and OTS referred about 53 percent and 3 percent, respectively. OCC,  during this same period, referred approximately 38 percent of its callers  to another federal agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaint Is Considered Withdrawn or Tabled Due to Litigation", "paragraphs": ["For OCC, the second most frequent type of complaint resolution was  \u201cwithdrawn\u201d or \u201ccomplaint in litigation,\u201d while it was the least common  for the Federal Reserve and OTS and the third most common for FDIC.  These are complaints that, by and large, the regulator is not able to address.  None of the federal regulators address complaints that they find are already  involved in any legal proceeding at the time the consumer contacts them. In  the case of OCC, one of the major reasons for complaints being withdrawn,  according to OCC officials, is that the consumer does not send in the  requested information, such as the signed complaint form or letter OCC  requires before it begins any complaint investigation. As shown in figure 2,  in 2000, OCC closed about 17 percent of complaint cases because it did not  receive requested information or the complaint was in litigation, while in  2004, OCC closed nearly 37 percent of these cases for the same reasons.  One reason for this increase, OCC officials explained, is that in mid-2000  they made changes to the database that tracks complaints. In particular,  after the changes, the database coded complaints as \u201cwithdrawn\u201d when the  regulator did not receive information it requested from a consumer within  30 days. Previously, this type of complaint remained opened indefinitely or  until the consumer provided the information. OCC\u2019s policy is to reopen any  complaint cases if the consumer sends in the requested information after  60 days from the day OCC made the request for additional information.  Since OCC does not open a new case in such instances, this policy  negatively impacts OCC\u2019s average in meeting its timeliness goals for  resolving complaints.", "According to OCC officials, another reason for this increase is OCC\u2019s policy  of encouraging consumers to contact the bank prior to filing a complaint  with OCC. It is typical for the staff to provide a case number and  complaint form to the consumer to use if he or she is unsuccessful in  resolving the problem with the bank. OCC officials explained that in many  instances they assume that the bank and the consumer has worked the  problem out since the consumer never sends in a completed complaint  form. In these instances, OCC codes the complaint as withdrawn because  the consumer did not submit a completed complaint form. OCC officials  explained that this coding procedure has an advantage.

However,  these totals include inquiries that the agency handled, not just complaints.", "Inquiries\u2014which may be questions or comments subject to an immediate,  simple answer\u2014can typically be handled at the initial contact between the  consumer and OCC, while some complaints can take well over the 60-day  time frame to investigate and resolve. Therefore, by including both  inquiries and complaints in determining whether it met its timeliness goals,  OCC overstated its performance, as measured by the percentage of  complaints resolved within the target time frame. OCC officials explained  that the data in the annual reports were presented using the generic term  \u201ccomplaints\u201d to simplify the amount of information given to the reader.", "As OCC officials explained, some complaints involve more complex  products, such as mortgages. Also, depending on the nature of the  complaint, such as allegations of fair lending abuse, some investigations  take more time. All four regulators have a percentage of complaints that  they cannot resolve within their established time frames. OCC officials also  explained that the time used in resolving complaints is a result of how it  handles consumer appeals. Since OCC considers an appeal a reopened  complaint, the start date for calculating the number of days it takes to  resolve a complaint reverts back to the date it was originally filed with the  agency. This practice had the affect of adversely impacting the measure of  OCC\u2019s timeliness in meeting its timeliness goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CAG\u2019s Consumer Complaint Data Inform OCC\u2019s Bank Supervisory Activities", "paragraphs": ["According to the 2004 Report of the Ombudsman, CAG\u2019s role includes  providing information to OCC examiners and the banks to \u201celevate\u201d the  issues raised by consumers and make them visible to OCC staff involved in  supervision. The complaint data CAG collects, summarizes, and  disseminates to OCC\u2019s examiners helps the examiners to identify banks,  activities, and products that require further review or investigation. OCC  supervision guidance requires examiners to consider consumer complaint  information when assessing a bank\u2019s overall compliance risk and ratings  and when scoping and conducting their examinations.OCC guidance also  requires that the banks have processes in place to monitor and address  consumer complaints.", "According to compliance examiners we interviewed, the examiners learn  about complaints primarily through a Web-based application called CAG  Wizard. The application allows examiners to access near real-time  consumer complaint data. Examiners can review specific complaints,  generate standard reports or conduct customized searches of the data. The  information available to examiners includes data on all of the banks OCC  supervises, not just those where an examiner is currently assigned. With  this capability, examiners can also generate similar reports on similar  institutions. Examiners with whom we spoke said CAG Wizard is a useful  tool. They reported using the application to prepare for an examination or  when developing the annual risk assessment of the bank. Often, the  examiners compare the complaint data that banks maintain with the data  CAG provides through CAG Wizard.", "OCC examiners and CAG staff also collaborate on other activities. For  example, CAG staff may alert examiners if there are certain types of  complaints that warrant further attention or if patterns emerge in the  overall complaint volume about the bank. CAG officials and OCC  examiners told us that there is an open line of communication between  their respective staffs. For example, examination staff at one national bank  undertook a specific investigation based on a complaint forwarded from  CAG. Examination staff specifically requested and reviewed information  from the bank concerning the advertising of a product and the bank\u2019s  associated fees. Examiners can also forewarn CAG staff about any  impending bank actions related to products, services, or policy that may  cause consumers to complain. For instance, the bank might be changing  the terms on a credit card product, and as such, sending a notification to  customers. Such mailings typically lead to an increase in calls to CAG, but  with forewarning from the examiners, CAG can have more accurate  information on hand to use in assisting bank customers who call with  questions.", "OCC also uses consumer complaint data collected by CAG to formulate  guidance for national banks. Topics of these guidelines cover various  aspects of banking, including risks involved with using third-party vendor  partners (e.g., when a bank partners with another business to provide a  service to bank customers), predatory lending, and credit card practices.  For example, CAG received a significant number of consumer complaints  about aggressive marketing tactics and inadequate disclosures related to  credit repair products offered through third parties. In response to the  complaints received, OCC issued guidance in 2000 warning banks about risks posed to them by engaging third-party vendors for products and  services linked to the credit cards that banks issue.", "CAG provides the largest national banks with aggregate information on the  complaints about them. Also, CAG staff meets annually with bank officials  of at least the 10 banks that received the most complaints during the  previous calendar year. In 2004, the 10 banks with the most complaints  accounted for 81 percent of all the complaints that OCC received. At these  meetings, CAG officials discuss significant issues, such as data on  complaint volume and trends, comparable data for the bank\u2019s peers and the  industry, and current issues the bank should address. Prior to these  meetings CAG officials consult with examiners on what specific issues  warrant additional analysis or attention by bank officials.

Yet state  officials and consumer advocates perceive OCC as being pro-bank, not  neutral, and as such, they may hesitate to forward complaints on behalf of  their citizens or clients. Some officials were unaware of CAG\u2019s process for  handling consumer complaints; however, OCC recently took steps to  publicize its customer assistance function. State officials were concerned  about a perceived unwillingness by OCC to share information about the  outcomes of complaints. Other groups with whom we spoke view the  CAG\u2019s centralized location as a shortcoming because CAG staff, they said,  could not be familiar with current lending practices that pose high risk to  consumers or to problematic institutions in local areas.

Comments from state officials argued that a lack of state regulation would  create \u201can enormous vacuum of consumer protection without adequate  federal regulation to fill the gap.\u201d Many of these commenters suggested that  OCC needed to do more, not less, to protect consumers. These views were  echoed by those with whom we spoke in preparing this report, as were  concerns that the visitorial powers rule severely limits the advocates\u2019 and  state officials\u2019 abilities to assist their constituents and clients, thereby  exposing them to potential consumer protection violations. The rule,  according to OCC, clarifies that federal law commits the supervision of  national banks exclusively to OCC. Because advocates work to advance the  interests of their clients, they do not see their role being adequately filled  by OCC, or CAG, which defines itself as a neutral arbiter. Although part of  OCC\u2019s mission is to ensure fair access to financial services and fair  treatment of bank customers, the perception remains, among the groups  with whom we spoke, that OCC is \u201con the side\u201d of the banks. Some  advocates with whom we spoke were unclear about how OCC processes  complaints through CAG and what assistance it can provide consumers.  Some of the state officials and advocates with whom we spoke were  unaware of the CAG, its process for responding to consumer inquiries and  complaints, or the help it can provide. Some of the state officials and  advocates with whom we spoke said that they are reluctant to refer clients  to the agency, given their level of mistrust of OCC and lack of knowledge  about its customer assistance function.

For example, OCC recently  revised its consumer complaint brochure. The brochure has \u201cfrequently  asked questions\u201d about OCC and the role it, and CAG specifically, play in  resolving consumer complaints. This new version will be printed in Spanish  and English. As of November 2005, OCC said they had distributed a small  number of brochures to each national bank. In addition a \u201ccamera-ready\u201d  version will be made available to banks so that they can print more copies  if they choose. However, OCC officials said they will not require the banks  to display or distribute the brochures. In addition, officials said they do not  have a distribution plan to give the brochure directly to the general public,  although they did give a small supply to the Better Business Bureaus.

This report is available on OCC\u2019s Web site  and contains information on total case volume handled in the previous  year, as well as a general discussion about complaint volumes and trends.  Also, in 2004, OCC redesigned its Web site to enhance the consumers\u2019  capability to access information and learn more about its services. The  redesigned Web site provides a searchable list of national bank operating  subsidiaries that do business directly with consumers, which allows  individual consumers to determine if an entity is associated with a bank  supervised by OCC. However, some of the consumer groups with whom we  spoke said that one limitation of this list is that it does not have dates  attached to the list of operating subsidiaries indicating when they became  associated with the bank, which can be important in trying to identify the  parties involved in a transaction at a particular time. OCC officials said that  they will address any complaint brought against a national bank and its  operating subsidiaries, regardless of when the transaction took place.", "OCC officials also said CAG staff are engaging in a series of outreach  meetings with state government organizations and Better Business  Bureaus. For example, in November 2004, senior CAG officials met with  one state attorney general\u2019s office to demonstrate how OCC handles  consumer complaints. That state attorney general told us that it was clear  from the meeting that the CAG officials seemed earnest in wanting to  cooperate, even though the two sides might still disagree on the  appropriate roles for OCC and the states in protecting consumers. OCC  officials said they intend to hold similar meetings with other state attorneys  general and state banking departments, although none were planned as of  November 2005. OCC staff is also engaged in outreach efforts with the  Better Business Bureaus, which includes conference presentations, as well  as meeting with several bureaus in order to educate them on OCC\u2019s  customer assistance services and to enable OCC to better understand the  nature and volume of complaints received by the Better Business Bureaus  involving national banks. In addition, OCC officials are requesting that  Better Business Bureaus update their Web sites to include a link to OCC.

Most state attorneys  general staff with whom we spoke said they are willing to forward  complaints to OCC, but they have not been receiving what they perceive to  be adequate information on the outcome of referrals. According to OCC  officials, it is agency policy to send the consumer a letter acknowledging  receipt of a complaint submitted to OCC. If a complaint is forwarded to  OCC from another agency, it is OCC\u2019s policy to send a copy of the  acknowledgment letter to the forwarding agency. Nonetheless, some state  attorneys general and other state officials said that, in their experience,  OCC does not provide any information about the resolution of the  complaints, which is what state officials want. However, in commenting on  a draft of this report, OCC officials told us that if state officials request  information on the resolution of an individual complaint, OCC will notify  them of the outcome. Specifically, they said that an attorney from OCC\u2019s  Community and Consumer Law Division will contact the state official once  a case is closed and will discuss the case.

The consumer  advocates we interviewed said an in-depth understanding of local real  estate conditions was necessary to prevent predatory lending abuses.  Furthermore, they said that OCC\u2019s 60-day time frame is too long to  effectively address many of their clients\u2019 acute needs, such as when  immediate action is needed to stop a foreclosure proceeding.

FDIC officials said they  are consolidating their complaint handling operations for the same  reasons. OCC examiners we interviewed also pointed out that a central  facility makes sense, given that national banks operate across state lines  and have so many customers in multiple markets. According to CAG and  bank supervision staff, funneling data to, and analyzing it in, one location  provides more potential for seeing national trends and potential problems.", "However, there are also potential drawbacks to having only one  operational facility available for any such customer function, as it increases  the likelihood that there might be disruptions in service. For example, during Hurricane Rita in September 2005, telephones were not staffed for 4  days at CAG, due to the evacuation of Houston. However, consumers  were able to submit complaints by either E-mail or fax. During that period,  OCC received 14 faxes opening new cases, as well as 184 E-mails\u201434 from  bankers and 150 from consumers. Of those complaints from consumers, 16  were from Members of Congress. OCC staff said these numbers are in-line  with normal activity levels. When we asked about the closure, the  Ombudsman replied that he decided to obey the evacuation notice issued  by Houston-area officials, and while this may have resulted in some  backlog of cases, his first priority was ensuring the safety of the Houston  OCC employees.", "In December 2005, OCC began seeking private-sector support for the CAG  facility, in order to expand its telephone service hours.

Furthermore, they contend OCC could  not match the  resources (i.e., personnel and hours of operations) of state  banking departments, consumer credit divisions, and offices of state  attorneys general that currently work to resolve complaints and, more  broadly, to identify fraudulent and abusive practices. However, we note  that state banking departments and state attorneys general handle other  types of consumer complaints, such as complaints about automobile  dealers, mortgage brokers, and check cashers.", "Since OCC issued the preemption rules in January 2004, the volume of  complaints, according to CAG data, has remained fairly steady. In fact,  between 2000 and 2004 complaints received by OCC have decreased 37  percent. According to OCC staff, complaint volume was high around 2000  due to a settlement with a large national bank on credit card disclosure  issues. CAG data for 2005, while available only through June at the time of  our review, indicate a potential increase in the volume of complaints when  compared with 2004. CAG officials believe that the conversion from state  charters to federal charters of two large banks in 2004 accounts for the  increase. That is, customers of those banks who had complaints  previously contacted the appropriate state regulator and either the Federal  Reserve or FDIC, which jointly regulate state chartered banks. After the  banks converted to federal charters, customers contacted OCC concerning  any complaints.", "These data suggest that an increase to levels of complaints experienced  before the 2004 preemption rules could be absorbed by current OCC  resources. Further, CAG data show that the total number of complaints, in  any given year, received from state offices, including banking departments  and states\u2019 attorneys generals, is a relatively small percentage of the total  number of complaints; therefore, any increase in referrals to OCC from  those offices might not have a dramatic effect on total overall volume.  Nevertheless, concerns that OCC resources were not equivalent to those of  a state attorney general or state banking department were still prevalent  among some of those with whom we spoke at the state level. However,  OCC officials said that they have staff\u2014beyond CAG\u2014that work on  consumer protection issues, including bank examiners in compliance  supervision and attorneys in the Community and Consumer Law and  Enforcement and Compliance divisions.", "Until 2004, OCC staffed the CAG\u2019s toll-free telephone line 4 days a week, 8  hours a day, but now has service 5 days. One measure OCC uses to gauge  how effectively it is servicing customers is the wait time for callers to speak  with a CAG representative. OCC officials told us their goal is to answer 80  percent of CAG calls within 3 minutes or less. According to OCC data, between June 2004 and November 2005, CAG met this goal, although wait  times generally were longer for Spanish speaking services. In addition, to  accommodate the expected increase in call volume due to recent charter  conversions, OCC has recently hired more CAG specialists. Lastly, in  December 2005, OCC began seeking private-sector support for the CAG  facility, in order to expand its telephone service hours. A third-party vendor  will handle routine matters, such as providing materials to satisfy  noncomplex questions, obtaining information from callers that is necessary  to open a case file, routing the caller to the appropriate OCC specialist and  providing the status of an open case. In addition, the vendor\u2019s employees  will be able to direct the many callers who have concerns that pertain to  institutions not regulated by OCC to the appropriate regulator.

A significant portion of OCC\u2019s and other regulators\u2019 work involves  providing or clarifying information for bank customers who have questions  and/or have misunderstood a bank product or service. Officials from all  four regulators said that assisting consumers through the complaint  process is an important part of their efforts to educate consumers about  financial products and services. Two of the federal bank regulators collect  some feedback from consumers who make complaints or inquiries; OCC  does not. In contrast, OCC does seek feedback from banks after every  examination, through a survey. Given that part of OCC\u2019s mission is to  ensure that consumers of national banks\u2019 products and services are treated  fairly and have fair access to financial services, obtaining feedback from  bank customers who contact CAG should be useful in improving both its  service to customers and helping banks to do likewise. Moreover, federal  standards reflected in GPRA require that government agencies measure  their progress toward goals, including those related to serving the public.  OCC measures its timeliness in serving consumers with complaints and  inquiries as one indicator of its performance and discloses the results in  reports that are publicly available. However, because those reports  combine data on complaints and data on inquiries\u2014which are questions or  comments that are subject to an immediate, simple answer and typically  require less time to handle\u2014they overstate OCC\u2019s performance in meeting  its timeliness goal for resolving actual complaints.", "OCC appears to make appropriate use of the data CAG collects and  analyzes by informing banks about their performance in relation to  consumer complaints and by using the data to inform its examination and  supervisory activities. CAG\u2019s analysis of complaint data is presented to  bank officials annually and used to identify any concerns. OCC examiners  reported CAG data as useful tools in scoping examinations and in assessing  areas of risk. We documented instances when examiners\u2019 audit plans were  influenced by information from CAG. We also identified instances when  information gathered from CAG complaints and additional research by  supervisory staff contributed to the development of supervision policies  and guidance.", "The concerns expressed by a broad range of consumer advocates and state  officials indicate some uneven understanding of OCC\u2019s process for  handling consumer complaints, possibly contributing to the lack of trust  that the agency will be aggressive in protecting consumers\u2019 interests.  Because these concerns may inhibit state officials or consumer advocates  from sharing information with or referring consumer complaints to OCC,  they could adversely affect the agency\u2019s effectiveness in regulating banks  or assisting bank customers who have complaints. Consumer advocates  and others are concerned about CAG\u2019s centralized location and its capacity  to handle complaints particularly if the volume of complaints should  increase. Recent efforts such as outreach to the Better Business Bureaus  and development of a revised brochure for consumers regarding CAG are  appropriate steps designed to better inform the public of its process and  services. However, the distribution plans for the brochure focus on the  banks and rely on them to share the brochure with bank customers, if the  banks wish. Given that the former Comptroller has acknowledged that  OCC and state officials \u201chave a mutual interest in ensuring that consumers  are protected from illegal, predatory, unfair, or deceptive practices,\u201d it is  essential that OCC undertakes outreach to key state partners\u2014regulators  and consumer advocates\u2014in a manner that effectively and efficiently  informs the public, and especially customers of national banks, about what  CAG does and how state officials and OCC can work together to protect  consumers.
