As a result, the market share of foreign banks grew, especially in certain wholesale banking markets where foreign banks concentrate their products and services. This report examines (1) the reasons why foreign banks have expanded so rapidly, (2) the role foreign banks play in financing the U.S. economy, and (3) whether foreign banks enjoy any significant competitive advantages in the United States over U.S. banking organizations because of regulatory differences."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Capital markets have become increasingly integrated and international in character. Expansion of international trade and the growth of multinational corporations have led U.S. and foreign banks to open offices overseas to service customers of their home country and to seek new growth opportunities.", "In 1994, 378 foreign banks operated 921 offices in the United States, as shown in table 1.1. Branches and agencies were the most common organizational form\u2014accounting for 61 percent of foreign bank offices and 82 percent of foreign bank assets at the end of 1994. Separately chartered U.S. bank subsidiaries were next in importance\u2014accounting for 18 percent of foreign bank assets. The remaining forms\u2014commercial lending companies, Edge Act Corporations, and representative offices\u2014accounted for less than one percent of foreign bank assets in the United States. Foreign banks also provided services to many U.S. customers through shell branches located outside the United States but managed by their U.S. branches or agencies. Because foreign branches and agencies are the dominant form of organization in the United States, this report focuses on the activities of these entities and the shell branches they manage.", "Like their U.S. counterparts, foreign branches and agencies are legal and operational extensions of their parent banks. Their assets and liabilities are consolidated into the accounts of their parent banks, and they operate on the consolidated equity of those banks. For example, their lending limits are based on the capital of their parent banks. Regulators in both the United States and their home country oversee their operations.", "Before passage of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA), only states could license, supervise, and regulate the operations of foreign branches and agencies. Some states specifically prohibited foreign branches but allowed other types of foreign bank activity. Passage of the IBA made foreign banks eligible for federal licenses and subject to federal regulation.", "Foreign branches and agencies may conduct a wide range of banking activities, including lending, money market services, trade financing, and other activities related to the service of home-country and U.S. clients. They can also access the U.S. payments system through the Federal Reserve and obtain other Federal Reserve services. However, they are banned from certain activities. Foreign branches have been prohibited from accepting insured deposits since the end of 1991. In addition, federally licensed agencies and most state-licensed agencies cannot accept deposits.", "Foreign banks can charter or acquire a full-service U.S. bank subsidiary.Foreign banks have exercised this option when state law prohibited them from establishing branches or when a foreign bank wanted to offer retail banking services. Foreign-owned subsidiary banks have all the powers of U.S.-owned banks, are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and are subject to all the rules and regulations governing U.S.-owned banks. However, subsidiary banks have some disadvantages compared with branches and agencies. They are more costly to operate, requiring not only separate boards of directors and managers but also their own capital base. They are also subject to the collateralization requirements and lending limits of the Federal Reserve\u2019s section 23A and 23B restrictions, which limit banks\u2019 extension of credit to their affiliates.", "Foreign banks also offer services to U.S. customers through offices located outside the U.S. (offshore offices). Some offshore offices have practically no office or staff and are referred to as shell branches. Much of their management\u2014including funding decisions and setting lending policies\u2014is handled elsewhere, in many instances by branches or agencies located in the United States. In these cases, banking products\u2014such as commercial and industrial (C&I) loans or deposits\u2014are marketed to U.S. customers from U.S. offices but are held by the shell branch. Although the shell branches of U.S. banks, including foreign-owned U.S.-chartered banks, are subject to all U.S. laws and regulations, the shell branches of foreign banks are subject to U.S. regulation only for those activities that are managed within the United States.", "Foreign banks can also serve U.S. customers through International Banking Facilities (IBF). Like shell branches, IBFs represent a separate set of accounts rather than an operating entity of the bank. For this reason IBFs are sometimes referred to as onshore shell branches. The Federal Reserve authorized U.S. banks and the offices of foreign banks to establish IBFs to engage in Eurocurrency lending in 1981 in response to the growth of shell branches. The activities of IBFs are restricted. They can be used to take deposits from the non-U.S. offices of U.S. and foreign banks, other IBFs, IBF parent banks, and foreign governments. They can also make loans to those cited above, plus non-U.S. residents, and the foreign offices of a domestic corporation. They are free from reserve requirements, federal deposit insurance premiums, and some state income taxes. An IBF may not engage in domestic banking activities. Shell branches, by contrast, may be used to make loans to or hold deposits from any U.S. or non-U.S. customer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth of Foreign Banks", "paragraphs": ["Between 1972 and 1990, the number and assets of foreign banks operating in the United States grew rapidly. The number of foreign branches and agencies increased more than sevenfold\u2014from 77 to 600\u2014and foreign-owned bank subsidiaries more than tripled\u2014from 25 to 88. During this period, the average annual growth rate of branch, agency, and foreign-owned bank subsidiary assets was more than 20 percent (see figure 1.1). By December 1990, 295 foreign banks from 59 countries operated in the U.S. and held $785 billion in assets. Since 1990, the growth of assets in these banks has slowed, and the number of foreign bank offices has declined.", "Forty-seven of the 50 largest banks in the world (excluding U.S.-owned banks) had commercial banking operations in the United States as of December 1993. These banks held 69 percent of foreign branch and agency assets. Of the top 20 banks, 10 had 5 percent or more of their total assets in the United States in 1993."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons Underlying the Growth of Foreign Banks", "paragraphs": ["Several factors have contributed to the growth of foreign branches and agencies since the 1970s.", "First, expansion of foreign-owned businesses gave foreign banks a growing client base in the United States. Imports of goods and services in the United States doubled between 1970 and 1975 and again between 1975 and 1980. Since 1980, imports have continued to grow, although at a slower pace. Between 1980 and 1994, imports doubled. As foreign business has expanded, foreign banks have entered the United States to service clients from their home countries.", "Second, rising federal budget deficits increased the United States\u2019 demand for capital\u2014including foreign capital\u2014while large trade deficits created a surplus of dollar assets abroad. Part of the dollar surplus was deposited into foreign banks. This allowed foreign banks to expand their U.S. operations because growth in their dollar-denominated deposits provided a large funding base for entering the U.S. market. The recycling of dollar surpluses back into the U.S. economy helped the United States to finance its budget deficit as well as maintain economic expansion. Lending in the United States also provided foreign banks with another means of diversifying risks. For example, lending in the United States lessened foreign exchange risk by matching dollar-denominated assets to dollar deposits.", "Third, as discussed later in this chapter, before passage of the IBA in 1978, foreign branches and agencies enjoyed a number of advantages in their operations compared with U.S. banks. Passage of the act, however, removed many of these advantages and brought foreign branches and agencies under federal banking laws and regulations. Some observers have said that foreign banks established branches and agencies in the United States in anticipation of receiving grandfathered privileges under this act.", "Finally, the United States is a large and open economy and has a currency that plays a key role in world markets. The United States is the largest market for dollar exchange and is home to one of the world\u2019s largest financial centers. Technological advances in computers and telecommunications have also made it easier to manage overseas expansion.", "Since 1990, foreign bank growth has slowed. Some of the slowdown may simply be due to the size and maturing of the industry. In addition, foreign banks have experienced many of the same difficulties that slowed the growth of U.S. banks in the late 1980s. Problem real estate and other loans have led foreign banks to search for less risky assets. The need to improve capital ratios has led some to seek sources of income that require little or no additional capital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulation of Foreign Bank Activities in the United States and the Concept of National Treatment", "paragraphs": ["The IBA of 1978 stands as the landmark federal legislation affecting foreign bank operations in the United States. In passing the IBA, the United States adopted a policy of national treatment governing the activities of foreign banks. The goal of national treatment is to allow foreign banks to operate in the United States without incurring either significant advantage or disadvantage compared with U.S. banks. To implement this policy, the IBA brought U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks under federal banking laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve was given regulatory authority for all U.S. international banking laws, which it administers through regulation K.", "Before passage of the IBA, foreign branches and agencies operating in the United States enjoyed many regulatory advantages compared with U.S. banks. They were not subject to reserve requirements or deposit interest-rate ceilings, they could operate full-service branches in any state that allowed them to enter, and they could offer both commercial and investment banking services. The 1978 act was designed to eliminate these advantages and to place foreign banks on an equal footing with U.S. banks. The act required foreign banks to choose a home state and prohibited them from establishing full-service branches in states outside the home state. The IBA also limited foreign bank involvement in U.S. securities and other nonbanking markets by restricting them to those activities that could be done by U.S. bank holding companies (BHC).", "The act also expanded the options of foreign banks. Prior to the IBA, only states could license foreign branches and agencies. Foreign banks were subject to the laws of the states in which they were licensed, and, in some cases, these laws were more restrictive than federal law for national banks. The act made federal licenses available to foreign banks. It also allowed foreign branches to obtain federal deposit insurance, requiring it for any branch with a significant amount of retail deposits. The act permitted foreign banks to establish Edge Act Corporations and it granted foreign branches and agencies access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window.", "Although the IBA eliminated many of the advantages that foreign branches and agencies had over U.S. banks, those foreign branches and agencies that were already engaged in interstate branching or securities activities were allowed to continue these activities under the grandfathering provisions of the act. Restrictions, however, were applied to their growth. Foreign banks with interstate branches were only allowed to establish new full-service branches in their home state. They could not establish full-service branches in other states, even in those states where they were already located. Similarly, foreign banks with grandfathered securities activities were limited to those activities in which they were engaged (or had applied to engage) on the grandfather date. In addition, securities firms owned by foreign banks could only expand by internal growth\u2014they were restricted from acquiring or merging with other securities firms or from expanding by hiring significant numbers of employees from other securities firms. Foreign banks that acquire U.S. banks lose their grandfathered securities rights.", "With the exception of the grandfathered activities, the IBA and subsequent laws and regulations brought foreign banks under the same restrictions as those governing U.S. banks with some adaptations. The application of U.S. laws and regulations to foreign banks reflects the fact that structural and organizational differences exist between foreign and U.S. banks. For example, foreign banks are not generally organized under the holding company structure, as are most U.S. banks.", "Because of these differences, subjecting foreign banks with branches and agencies in the United States to all U.S. laws and regulations without adaptation would likely violate the policy of national treatment. While this policy tries to ensure equal treatment of U.S. and foreign banks in the United States, it recognizes that equal treatment does not necessarily mean the same treatment. Similarly, the United States seeks to have the policy of national treatment applied to U.S. banks operating abroad.", "In 1991, Congress passed the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA). This act, which amended the IBA, authorized federal oversight of all foreign bank operations in the United States and vested this responsibility with the Federal Reserve. It also established uniform standards for all U.S. offices of foreign banks, generally requiring them to meet financial, management, and operational standards equivalent to those required of U.S. banking organizations. Finally, the act prohibited foreign branches from accepting retail deposits, although it grandfathered the branches that already offered insured deposits.", "FBSEA increased the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory and regulatory power over foreign banks by (1) requiring Federal Reserve approval for all foreign banks seeking to establish U.S. offices, whether licensed by state or federal authorities, (2) permitting the Federal Reserve to terminate the activities of a state-licensed branch or agency, or to recommend that OCC terminate the license of a federally licensed branch or agency, and (3) clarifying and strengthening the Federal Reserve\u2019s authority to ensure that foreign bank operations in the United States are examined in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.", "The act required the Federal Reserve to approve all applications for entry or expansion of foreign bank activities in the United States. The Federal Reserve may not approve such applications unless it determines that the applicant bank engages directly in banking outside the United States and is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by home country authorities. In coordination with OCC, FDIC, or the state bank regulator, the Federal Reserve was given authority to examine all records pertaining to the foreign bank\u2019s activities in the United States. The act required that branches and agencies be examined at least once a year. It gave the Federal Reserve the power to order a foreign bank that operates a state-licensed branch or agency in the United States to terminate its activities (1) if the Federal Reserve finds that the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision by its home country supervisor or (2) if it has reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank or an affiliate has committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States. If the Federal Reserve finds these problems in a federally licensed branch or agency, it may transmit a recommendation to OCC for such action.", "The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 also amended the IBA and gave foreign banks the same interstate branching rights as U.S. banks were granted under the act. Under Riegle-Neal, foreign banks will be allowed to establish de novo full-service branches across state lines whenever U.S. banks are allowed to establish de novo branches across state lines. Riegle-Neal will also allow foreign banks to expand across state lines by acquiring an existing bank or branch provided that the state also allows U.S. banks to expand in such a manner.", "Riegle-Neal added additional regulations for foreign banks and tightened some existing restrictions. The act provided that if a foreign bank expanded across state lines by acquiring an existing bank or branch that was subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the new foreign branch would also be subject to CRA. This requirement contrasts with previous practice where foreign branches without insured deposits were not subject to CRA. Riegle-Neal also directed FDIC and OCC to review the definition of the types of retail deposits foreign branches can accept. The act lowered the exception to the prohibition on offering uninsured deposits of under $100,000 from any party from 5 percent to 1 percent of average branch deposits. Finally, it amended the IBA to provide that a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank may not manage activities for a shell branch that a U.S. bank is not permitted to manage overseas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To understand the role of foreign branches and agencies in the United States and the magnitude of their operations, we obtained data on their activities and funding sources from the Federal Reserve. We also obtained data from the Federal Reserve on shell branches managed by foreign branches and agencies in the United States. Data collected on foreign branches and agencies are similar to the call report data on domestic banks and have been collected quarterly since 1980. Data on shell branches have only been collected since March 1993. In addition, shell branch data cannot be verified because the Federal Reserve has no authority to audit the operations of a shell branch, except for those operations that are managed by a branch in the United States. We did not independently verify any of these data.", "In using call report data to compare U.S.-owned banks and foreign-owned U.S. bank subsidiaries and foreign branches and agencies, it must be noted that the domestic assets and liabilities reported by these entities represent the location of the bank, branch, or agency\u2014not the nationality of the borrower or depositor. For example, domestic loans could represent loans made to foreign-owned companies operating in the United States while foreign loans could represent loans made to the overseas offices of U.S. corporations.", "To understand the relationship between foreign branches and agencies in the United States and their shell branches, we reviewed the most recent examination report of the 50 largest foreign banks with branches or agencies operating in New York. In 42 of these reports, we found that the branch or agency managed some assets for a shell operation. We also reviewed 19 other examination reports, selected at random, of branches or agencies with offices in New York, which indicated that they also managed some operations for shell branches.", "To explore the reasons for foreign bank expansion in the United States, the role that foreign banks play in the U.S. economy, and whether U.S. banks face disadvantages in competing against foreign banks in U.S. markets, we interviewed officials at both U.S. banks and branches, agencies, and subsidiaries of foreign banks operating in the United States. Because we were able to speak with only a limited number of bankers and other market participants, the results are not generalizable to the entire banking industry. We also reviewed the literature on foreign bank operations in the United States. We did not attempt to assess the benefits to the U.S. economy from foreign bank participation in U.S. markets or to undertake a study of the comparative role and treatment of U.S. banks abroad.", "We interviewed officials at eight foreign banks operating in the United States. The banks were chosen on a judgmental basis with consideration given to their size, location (New York City is the most common location of foreign branches and agencies), and ability to compete with U.S. banks across a number of product lines. The U.S. operations of these banks reported assets between $2 billion and $47 billion. All of the banks had branches or agencies in the United States and four owned subsidiary banks. The interviews were conducted in either the banks\u2019 New York or San Francisco offices. All of the banks had operations in more than one state, and six banks had shell branches managed by a U.S. office.", "To understand how U.S. banks view their competitive position compared with foreign banks, we interviewed officials at six large U.S. banks. These banks were chosen because their size and the extent of their U.S. operations made it likely that they faced competition from foreign banks in some of their markets. Each of these banks had over $10 billion in assets and competed with foreign banks in providing loans and services to multinationals and other corporations. The banks also offered products in overseas markets, and some operated branches in foreign countries.", "To gauge the impact of foreign bank activity in domestic retail markets, especially to determine whether foreign branches and agencies are competing to provide products and services to small- and medium-sized business customers, we interviewed officials at six smaller banks. These banks had assets of between $250 million to $2 billion, and none operated foreign branches. The banks were chosen because of their domestic retail orientation. The banks served smaller businesses, and they were located in areas also served by foreign branches and agencies.", "We interviewed officials at various trade associations, including the (1) American Bankers Association, (2) Independent Bankers Association, (3) Institute of International Bankers, (4) Bankers Association for Foreign Trade, and (5) Bankers Roundtable to get an overall view on the extent of foreign bank competition and to determine whether their memberships expressed concern about advantages that foreign banks in the United States might have. We were also contacted by several attorneys who represented foreign banks and by officials of foreign governments.", "To get a perspective on how U.S. and foreign corporations use foreign and domestic bank services and meet their funding and banking-services needs worldwide, we interviewed corporate treasurers and other finance officials at nine large multinational corporations. These corporations were chosen because they have extensive operations, in the United States and abroad, and use a variety of banking services. All of the corporations raise funds in U.S. and foreign markets for their worldwide operations and have extensive cash management needs. We also spoke with officials at five smaller U.S. companies with limited, if any, overseas operations. These companies were chosen because they used a variety of banking services and did business in areas serviced by domestic and foreign banks.", "We interviewed federal bank regulators at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to determine what regulations apply to foreign banks, how foreign banks are supervised in the United States, and what role shell branches play. We spoke with officials at the New York State Banking Commission which, until 1992, regulated and supervised more foreign banks than any other U.S. regulator. We also spoke with officials at the California State Banking Department. Officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Commission explained the laws and regulations governing the operations of foreign banks in the United States. They also explained their examination and supervision authority to give us a better understanding of what their roles are regarding supervision of foreign banks. We spoke with officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and reviewed the Department of the Treasury\u2019s national treatment studies done in 1990 and 1994 for information on how foreign banks are treated in the United States and how U.S. banks are treated abroad.", "Our work was conducted in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, between May 1994 and May 1995, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In turn, foreign branches and agencies have gained relatively large shares of some U.S. banking markets, particularly in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, interbank funding, foreign exchange, and loan guarantees.

They tend to specialize in a few activities, such as C&I lending and interbank transactions, and most of their funding comes from other financial institutions. In some of these activities, foreign branches and agencies account for a relatively large share of the domestic market.", "Foreign branches and agencies conduct little retail activity. They hold few retail deposits and make few consumer loans. Their market share in retail deposits is generally less than 1 percent and cannot be readily calculated for consumer loans.

We looked at the amounts in each of these categories as of December 1994 and also at the growth in these categories over the period 1985 through 1994. In addition, we compared the portfolios of foreign branches and agencies to those of U.S. banks with foreign offices. Among these U.S. banks, only a few would be considered wholesale institutions. This is not surprising since, in looking at the U.S. operations of foreign branches and agencies, we are considering only a portion of their parent banks\u2019 worldwide assets.", "Figure 2.1 shows the percentage of assets accounted for by each of these categories, as of December 1994. Interbank assets accounted for 37 percent of foreign branch and agency assets in 1994 and represented the largest share of foreign branch and agency assets. Over two-thirds of the interbank assets represented transactions with other foreign banks, although claims on other financial institutions, such as credit unions and savings and loans, have grown. From December 1985 through December 1994, the percentage of interbank claims on other financial institutions rose from 5 percent to 20 percent of interbank assets. In 1994, interbank assets accounted for only 12 percent of the banking assets in U.S. banks with foreign offices. Over 40 percent of these assets were held in their foreign offices.", "Business lending accounted for 30 percent of foreign branch and agency assets in 1994, a decline from the 35 percent share at year-end 1991. The fall in the volume of business loans held by foreign branches and agencies since 1991 has been due to declines in real estate lending and trade financing. C&I lending has continued to grow, although modestly, since 1991. Business lending by U.S. banks with foreign offices accounted for 27 percent of total assets in December 1994. From December 1990 through December 1993, the volume of business loans held by these U.S. banks also declined. However, at U.S. banks, the decline was due to a decrease in the volume of C&I loans as well as real estate loans. In 1994, the volume of business loans held by U.S. banks with foreign offices rebounded\u2014growing over 3 times faster than at foreign branches and agencies.", "Most foreign branches and agencies appeared to be lending to home countries and large businesses rather than to small or medium-sized U.S. firms. Our review of the examination reports of selected branches and agencies indicated that most foreign branch and agency business loans were either made to subsidiaries of home-country corporations or represented loans to multinationals or Fortune 500 companies. Interviews with foreign and domestic bankers and their representatives also supported this observation.", "We were told by several of the people with whom we spoke that foreign branches and agencies would need to provide retail deposit services to attract the business of most retail customers (including small- and mid-sized businesses). To gauge whether foreign branches and agencies in the United States provide such services, we compared the volume of cash items in process of collection reported by foreign branches and agencies with the volume reported by U.S. banks with foreign offices. In December 1994, foreign branches and agencies reported $3 billion (less than one-half of 1 percent of assets) as cash items in process of collection, compared with $63 billion (about 3 percent of assets) reported by the U.S. banks.", "We also attempted to compare the extent of consumer lending in foreign branches and agencies with that in U.S. banks with foreign offices. However, foreign branches and agencies do not report consumer loans as a separate item, as do U.S. banks.

With the exception of IPC deposits, each of these funding sources is generally considered wholesale in nature. IPC deposits may be either wholesale or retail, although as we show in figure 2.2, most of these deposits appeared to be wholesale in foreign branches and agencies. We also looked at growth in these categories and compared their funding sources with those of U.S. banks with foreign offices. In contrast to foreign branches and agencies, which accounted for only a portion of their parent banks\u2019 worldwide liabilities, most of these U.S. banks depended on retail deposits as their primary funding source.", "Figure 2.2 shows the relative importance of each of these funding sources. As the figure shows, foreign branches and agencies funded themselves primarily through the interbank market. In 1994, 51 percent of their liabilities represented funds owed to other financial institutions. Moreover, three-fourths of their interbank liabilities were owed to other foreign banks. From 1985 through 1994, interbank liabilities held by foreign branches and agencies doubled. However, as a funding source they actually declined in importance over that period. In 1994, U.S. banks with foreign offices held only 18 percent of their liabilities in the interbank market.", "Only 15 percent of foreign branch and agency funding came from the deposits of individuals or businesses (IPC deposits) in December 1994. By contrast, 59 percent of the funding in U.S. banks with foreign offices came from IPC deposits. In addition, about 28 percent of these U.S. banks\u2019 IPC deposits were in transaction accounts. By contrast, one-half of 1 percent of foreign branch and agency IPC deposits represented transaction deposits.", "Between December 1990 and December 1991, IPC deposits in foreign branches and agencies rose by 58 percent.

This bill would repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and would allow companies to choose between two structures for the affiliation of banking and securities firms. Companies with an insured depository institution would have to become Financial Services Holding Companies (FSHC) while companies without an insured depository institution could become Investment Bank Holding Companies (IBHC). FSHCs would have higher firewalls because of federal deposit insurance. Under this bill, foreign banks that do not have operations that raise insured deposits in the United States could be treated as wholesale depository institutions and would be regulated as IBHCs.

This legislation delegated to the Federal Reserve enhanced powers not only to examine all foreign bank operations in the United States on an annual basis, but also to approve and monitor their initial entry and subsequent expansion plans. In particular, it required the Federal Reserve to certify that foreign banks entering or expanding in the United States are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision in their home countries.", "FBSEA also required that foreign branches and agencies have annual examinations. The Federal Reserve, in coordination with OCC, FDIC, or relevant state banking authority, is responsible for these examinations. The consolidated operations of a foreign bank are regulated and examined by its home-country regulator.

We asked these officials for their views on the competitive position of foreign and U.S. banks and whether foreign banks enjoy advantages vis-a-vis U.S. banks due to the adaptations of U.S. laws and regulations under which they operate.

These included existing relationships with the bank, level and quality of service, price, and reputation for specialized services. Relationship, often built around the provision of cash management services, appeared to be the most important factor.

Additionally, officials stressed the importance of a bank\u2019s international presence in providing services to growing companies.

Officials at multinational corporations said that competition varies according to the product line or specialty that each bank decides to pursue, but extensive retail networks have provided U.S. banks with an advantage in providing deposit-based services in the United States. Corporate officials also told us that when U.S. banks have a strong presence in local overseas markets and can support a corporation\u2019s needs, especially cash management, these banks will typically get their business\u2014often because of an existing relationship. In countries where U.S. banks do not have the branch network or local presence to be able to provide cash management services, corporate officials told us they rely on foreign banks to provide such services.

Another banker stated that asset size alone is an incomplete measure of foreign bank penetration and, more importantly, is not an accurate indicator of their competitiveness. He stated that profitability and capital strength are essential components of competitiveness, which must be taken into account, and he believed that U.S. banks do well by these measures.", "Several U.S. bankers stated that foreign banks have become an integral component of the domestic financial markets.

Several bankers credited foreign banks with helping to maintain the C&I loan market in the face of increasing competition from investment banks. One banker stated that if foreign banks were not willing to participate in C&I lending, some businesses would likely issue securities such as commercial paper as substitutes for bank loans because other U.S. banks would not provide funding at prices that would be competitive with these alternatives. This banker said that the C&I loan market would be much smaller without foreign bank participation.
