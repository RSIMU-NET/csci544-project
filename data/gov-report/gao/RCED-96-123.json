In 1994, about 3.5 million families and individuals bought homes. Another 2.5 million families and individuals refinanced the mortgages on their existing homes. A variety of public- and private-sector institutions are involved in helping borrowers to obtain the mortgage credit they need to purchase homes. These institutions include mortgage insurers, who insure lenders against all or some losses on home mortgages. The primary mortgage insurers are private mortgage insurers (PMI), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the U.S. Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (VA).  Mortgage insurance is required primarily for borrowers with limited down payment funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Mortgages Are Not Insured", "paragraphs": ["Of the approximately 6 million mortgages reported through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for purchasing homes and refinancing existing mortgages in 1994, most (4 million) were not insured.

This percentage is substantially higher than the percentage of all mortgages taken out for refinancing in 1994 that were insured (19 percent). Mortgage insurance is generally used when a borrower makes a down payment of less than 20 percent of the value of the home (when the mortgage has a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent). If a borrower does not repay an insured mortgage loan as agreed, the lender may acquire the property through foreclosure and file a claim with the mortgage insurer for all or a portion of its total losses (the unpaid mortgage balance and interest, along with the costs of foreclosure and other expenses). If a borrower does not have mortgage insurance and fails to repay a mortgage, the lender may acquire the property through foreclosure and is responsible for the full amount of losses it incurs.", "While FHA and VA are federal entities, PMIs are privately-owned companies regulated at the state level. FHA is a government corporation operated within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). However, its primary single-family mortgage insurance program, the Section 203(b) program, is supported by the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which requires no federal funds to operate. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund is required by law to meet or endeavor to meet statutory capital ratio requirements; that is, it must contain sufficient reserves and funding to cover estimated future losses resulting from the payment of claims on defaulted mortgages and administrative costs. Cash flows into the fund from insurance premiums and from the sale of foreclosed property. The cash reserves in the fund have always been more than enough to cover the expenses incurred. In 1995, the fund had a negative credit subsidy of $309 million. Negative credit subsidies occur when the present value of estimated cash inflows to the government exceeds the present value of estimated cash outflows. However, if the fund were to deplete its reserves, the U.S. Treasury would have to directly cover lenders\u2019 claims and administrative costs. VA\u2019s single-family mortgage guaranty program does require federal funds each year. In 1995, this program received a credit subsidy of $684 million.", "Many insured single-family mortgages are ultimately sold to investors through the secondary mortgage market. In 1995, virtually all FHA- and VA-insured mortgages were sold to investors with the help of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), which, like FHA, is also a part of HUD. Ginnie Mae guarantees securities backed by pools of FHA- and VA-insured mortgages. Specifically, Ginnie Mae guarantees that investors in Ginnie Mae securities will receive timely principal and interest payments. Most privately insured mortgages are sold by lenders to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)\u2014two government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) that sell securities backed by pools of mortgages to investors and hold other mortgages as investments. Like Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee investors in their securities that they will receive their expected principal and interest payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s charters require that loans they purchase with LTV ratios greater than 80 percent have some form of credit enhancement. Private mortgage insurance is the most common enhancement used for these high LTV loans. For an insured loan they have purchased, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac assume the responsibility for foreclosure losses, if any, that a lender incurs above the amount of the claim paid by the PMI.", "Lenders use guidelines provided by the PMIs, FHA, and VA to determine whether a borrower is eligible for mortgage insurance through any of the insurers. These guidelines include maximum allowable LTV and qualifying ratios. Although some of the guidelines pertaining to FHA and VA mortgage insurance are set by the agencies, many are set by the Congress through legislation. Similarly, although some of the requirements for private mortgage insurance originate with the PMIs, others are set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When determining if a mortgage is eligible for private mortgage insurance, the requirements set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are considered because many lenders want to sell insured mortgages through the secondary market. The requirements set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac include underwriting standards, insurance coverage requirements, and a maximum loan amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PMIs Followed FHA and VA\u2019s Lead in Providing Mortgages With Very Low Down Payments", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, PMIs joined FHA and VA in offering insurance for mortgages with LTV ratios greater than 95 percent by creating special \u201caffordable\u201d programs. The affordable programs are for loans with LTV ratios of up to 97 percent. Generally, these affordable programs have more flexible underwriting than the standard program.

PMIs\u2019 share during the same period fluctuated between a low of 29 percent in 1987 to a high of 69 percent in 1984. VA\u2019s share during this period stayed between 13 and 20 percent. The relative market shares of the mortgage insurers are shown in figure 1.2.", "Between 1986 and 1990, FHA was the largest insurer. The factors contributing to FHA\u2019s large market share during these years may include an increase in FHA\u2019s maximum loan limit in 1988 and economic downturns in some areas of the country. Except for FHA\u2019s loan limit, the terms, such as maximum LTV ratio, under which FHA and VA mortgage insurance is available do not generally vary across different geographic locations, according to program guidelines. However, PMI companies may change the conditions under which they will provide new insurance in a particular geographic area to reflect the increased risk of losses in an area experiencing economic hardship. By tightening up the terms of the insurance they would provide, PMIs may have decreased their share of the market in economically stressed regions of the country.", "From 1990 through 1992, the share of the market insured by FHA fell. This decrease may be a result, in part, of increased premiums for FHA insurance implemented as a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508). In 1992, the insurance premium for FHA mortgages decreased, which may have contributed to the rise in FHA\u2019s market share that took place in 1992 through 1994. Throughout the period from 1991 through 1994, the PMIs had a greater share of all insured single-family mortgage originations than FHA or VA. In 1994, the PMIs\u2019 share of all insured single-family mortgage originations was 48 percent, FHA\u2019s was 35 percent, and VA\u2019s was 17 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Homeownership Tools", "paragraphs": ["The federal government uses a variety of tools to promote homeownership, in addition to providing mortgage insurance through FHA and VA.

The federal government insures deposits and provides advances to the thrifts and savings institutions that are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.", "Federal tax incentives, such as the home mortgage interest deduction that is available to homeowners of all income levels, also are designed to encourage homeownership.

Although the private mortgage insurance industry is composed of eight companies, we limited our review to the guidelines of the six companies that accounted for 97 percent of all new mortgages that were privately insured in 1994. We also collected information on the insurance offered by PMIs through interviews with officials from four PMIs and from the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America (MICA). Because we wanted to compare the terms of private mortgage insurance that are most similar to the terms of FHA mortgage insurance, we focused on the affordable programs administered by the PMIs that may be used for loans with LTV ratios as high as 97 percent. We restricted our review of the terms of FHA single-family mortgage insurance to the Section 203(b) program because it is FHA\u2019s primary single-family mortgage insurance program.", "We computed FHA\u2019s share of the home purchase mortgage market and compared the home buyers using FHA insurance to other home buyers by using the following data sources: (1) data reported through the HMDA on the volume of mortgages made by lenders in 1994 and the income, race, and location of borrowers; (2) data reported by MICA on the volume of mortgages insured by PMIs in 1994 and the income, race, and location of borrowers; (3) data from the 1993 American Housing Survey (AHS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the age of home buyers; (4) data from HUD on the LTV ratio of the loans insured by FHA in 1994; (5) data from the Monthly Interest Rate Survey conducted by the Federal Housing Finance Board on the LTV ratios of conventional loans made in 1994; (6) data from VA on the LTV ratios of loans insured by VA in 1994; and (7) data from the Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Association (MBA) on first-time home buyers who took out mortgages in 1994. We used the data from the American Housing Survey, FHA, the Federal Housing Finance Board, VA, and the MBA because the HMDA and MICA data do not include data on the age of borrowers, LTV ratio, and first-time home buyers. We used 1993 and 1994 data because these were the most recent years for which data comparing FHA-insured loans with other types of loans were available. We did not attempt to examine trends over time in borrowers\u2019 characteristics because our objective was limited to describing how FHA\u2019s current clientele compares with other home buyers. We also limited our examination of borrowers\u2019 characteristics to home purchase mortgages, excluding mortgages taken out to refinance existing mortgages.", "The data we used that were collected through HMDA do not include every mortgage made in 1994 for several reasons. First, not all lenders are required to report under HMDA. A depository institution is required to report if it has an office in a metropolitan area and its assets are at least $10 million. A mortgage company is required to report if it processes 100 or more mortgage applications. Second, the HMDA data we used do not include any mortgages made by lenders who do not lend in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Third, the data do not include mortgages for non-owner-occupied homes. According to a Federal Reserve official, the HMDA data for 1994 include 77 percent of all home purchase mortgage loans.", "Single-family mortgages insured through FHA\u2019s Section 203(b) program are not distinguished from mortgages insured through FHA\u2019s other smaller single-family mortgage insurance programs in the HMDA data.

Information on how FHA\u2019s 203(b) mortgages compare to mortgages insured through the other FHA programs is presented in chapter 4.", "The data from MICA that we used pertain to nearly all of the mortgages insured by PMIs in 1994 through both standard and affordable programs. Although the MICA data pertain only to privately insured loans, the HMDA data consist of FHA-insured loans and all others. To compare FHA-insured mortgages to those insured by PMIs and to uninsured mortgages, in some cases we subtracted the number of loans reported to MICA from the non-government-insured loans in the HMDA data to obtain information about those loans that were uninsured. To take into account underreporting in the HMDA data, we reduced the MICA data by 23 percent when comparing the relative shares of the market for privately insured, FHA-insured, and uninsured loans.", "We also used AHS data, which were derived from a 1993 survey of approximately 65,000 households. The data we used are from the subset of these households that acquired a mortgage in 1993. We also reviewed existing studies conducted by officials at HUD, the Federal Reserve System, and the MBA.", "We looked at borrowers\u2019 income, race, and first-time home buyer status because these characteristics have been highlighted by studies showing that certain types of borrowers, such as low-income borrowers, have difficulty obtaining mortgage credit. In addition, we looked at LTV ratios to compare the types of loans insured by FHA and by the PMIs, given differences in maximum allowable LTV ratios and the associated risk. We also looked at the state in which the loan was insured to identify geographic differences in the use of mortgage insurance. We could not compare the claim rates or loss rates of FHA-insured loans with other loans because data for privately insured and uninsured loans were unavailable.", "We determined how many of the loans that FHA insured would have met PMIs\u2019 requirements through analysis of FHA home buyers\u2019 characteristics and PMIs\u2019 guidelines. Unlike the analyses described above for which 1994 and 1993 data were the most recent available, we were able to use 1995 data for this analysis because it only required information about FHA-insured mortgages. We asked FHA program staff to use their automated data to determine the percentage of 1995 FHA home buyers who reported on their loan application qualifying ratios and LTV ratios below the maximum levels generally allowed by PMIs (mortgages with LTV ratios no greater than 97 percent, total debt-to-income ratios no greater than 38 percent, and housing-expense-to-income ratios no greater than 33 percent).", "We obtained most of our information on other ways in which the federal government helps to provide affordable homeownership opportunities by reviewing published information and by discussing program features with program officials at the various departments and agencies involved.

On the other hand, PMIs can insure loans with a maximum LTV ratio of 97 percent, while both FHA and VA can insure/guarantee loans with ratios exceeding 100-percent. In addition, both FHA and VA generally require borrowers to pay less cash at loan closing than PMIs require. Finally, FHA provides lenders with essentially 100 percent protection against losses from foreclosed loans, while both PMIs and VA protect against a portion of the losses. While this chapter does not discuss all of the differences that exist in the terms offered by the three organizations, the terms described were cited as the most significant by industry and FHA officials we interviewed.", "FHA offers a number of specialized insurance programs; however, because almost 60 percent of its home purchase loans in 1995 were made under the Section 203(b) program, our analysis of FHA addresses only this program.", "Similarly, PMIs insure loans under a variety of different programs. In general, PMIs insure mortgages using what they refer to as either standard or affordable housing loans. Affordable insurance programs differ from standard ones in that they offer more flexible underwriting guidelines than the PMIs\u2019 standard programs in several areas such as LTV ratios, qualifying ratios, and reserve requirements. PMIs offer two types of affordable loans: (1) a maximum LTV ratio of 95 percent and (2) a maximum LTV ratio of 97 percent. The underwriting guidelines for the 97-percent LTV ratio are more restrictive than the 95-percent affordable program for things such as credit ratios. To compare the PMI programs that were most like FHA\u2019s Section 203(b) program and VA\u2019s loan guaranty program, we used the published underwriting guidelines for the PMI affordable loans and limited our review to the insurance terms for these loans.", "While both FHA\u2019s and PMIs\u2019 programs can provide insurance to any borrowers who meet the programs\u2019 underwriting guidelines, VA\u2019s loan guaranty program is limited to qualified veterans and their survivors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Loan Requirements", "paragraphs": ["When deciding whether to finance a home with a loan insured by FHA or a PMI, or guaranteed by VA, the prospective home buyer must consider both the amount of money needed to purchase the home and the amount of the down payment or other cash needs required by the lender.

FHA and VA allow higher LTV ratios than PMIs. The LTV ratio represents the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the lesser of the appraised value or the sales price of the property. LTV ratios are important because of the direct relationship that exists between the amount of equity a borrower has in his/her home and the likelihood or risk of default. The higher the LTV ratio, the less cash a borrower is required to pay out of his/her own funds. However, the higher the LTV ratio, the less cash the borrower will have invested in the home and the more likely it is that he/she may default on the mortgage obligations, especially during times of economic hardship. Thus, while FHA and VA\u2019s higher LTV ratios allow a home buyer to purchase a higher-priced home with less money, these loans have a greater risk of defaulting than PMI loans.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508), enacted in November 1990, established LTV limits for FHA loans of 98.75 percent if the home value is $50,000 or less, or 97.75 percent if the home value is in excess of $50,000. However, because FHA allows financing of the up-front insurance premium, borrowers can in effect receive loans with LTV ratios that exceed 100 percent. The method of determining the maximum FHA mortgage amount requires two steps, as shown in table 2.1. The example assumes a home with a purchase price of $100,000 and closing costs of $2,300. We also assume that the purchase price is equal to or less than the appraised value of the property.", "In the above example, the lesser of the two amounts, $97,685, becomes the maximum mortgage allowed.

In qualifying a borrower, VA\u2019s underwriting guidelines establish a maximum total-debt-payment-to-income ratio and a minimum monthly residual income requirement.

For these organizations, past credit performance serves as the most useful guide in determining a borrower\u2019s attitude toward credit. A borrower who has made payments on previous or current obligations in a timely manner represents reduced risk. Conversely, if the credit history, despite adequate income to support obligations, reflects continuous slow payments and delinquent accounts, the organizations require that strong offsetting factors should exist for the loan to be approved.", "The guidelines of FHA, PMIs, and VA are very similar in their approach and requirements for determining satisfactory credit. For all three, it is the overall pattern of credit behavior that must be examined rather than isolated occurrences of unsatisfactory or slow payments.

FHA charges both a single, up-front premium as well as an annual premium for all mortgages over 15 years. The up-front premium is equal to 2.25 percent of the maximum mortgage allowed.

Similarly, with the possible exception of LTV ratio, we cannot say categorically that an FHA borrower that does not meet any one ratio would not qualify for private mortgage insurance. Also, this analysis does not consider the credit history of a borrower, which lenders and insurers must consider when underwriting a loan.

Therefore, some FHA borrowers whom we have identified as not being able to qualify for private mortgage insurance on the loan they received may have been able to increase their down payment, thereby lowering their LTV and total-debt-to-income ratios and qualifying for private mortgage insurance on a smaller loan. In its October 1995 report, HUD\u2019s Office of Policy and Development found that most of FHA\u2019s loans would not have been insured by PMIs because of differences in LTV or noncredit factors, even before the companies considered differences in personal credit history.", "About 68 percent of FHA borrowers in 1995 were within the most liberal PMIs\u2019 guidelines for LTV ratio (had an LTV ratio less than 97).

This official also commented that our report underestimates the (1) percentage of FHA borrowers who would qualify for a privately insured loan because compensating factors may enable a borrower to qualify even if he does not meet the ratios we considered and (2) importance of the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because it does not present those organizations\u2019 criteria for purchasing loans. We disagree with these two comments. First, this chapter describes the limitations of the analyses presented on FHA borrowers who might qualify for private insurance. This analysis was not intended to determine with certainty how many of FHA\u2019s borrowers would have qualified for a privately insured loan. To make such a determination would require considering many more factors than loan-to-value and qualifying ratios. Rather, as pointed out in this chapter, our analysis is intended to determine how many of FHA\u2019s borrowers might have qualified for private mortgage insurance on the basis of the ratios alone. We point out further in this chapter that we cannot say definitively that an FHA borrower who does not meet all three private mortgage insurance guidelines would not qualify for private insurance. Similarly, if an FHA borrower meets all three private mortgage insurance guidelines, it cannot be said categorically that a private mortgage insurer would insure the borrower\u2019s mortgage. In connection with the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we point out in this report that many guidelines pertaining to private mortgage insurance are set by the two secondary market institutions.

Although these tools differ in their scope and technique, the federal government uses these and other tools to promote homeownership. In comparison with FHA\u2019s Section 203(b) program, over half of the other 10 programs require direct federal funds, all reach fewer persons, and they generally direct a greater proportion of assistance to low-income home buyers (income less than/equal to 80 percent of an area\u2019s median income). These programs provide home buyers with grants, direct loans, guaranties, interest subsidies, and other assistance in financing a home purchase, and in some instances they rely heavily upon FHA for mortgage insurance. These homeownership programs are run by the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs; the Federal Home Loan Banks; state housing agencies; the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a government-funded corporation; and Neighborhood Housing Services of America, a government-funded nonprofit organization.", "The federal government also promotes affordable homeownership by placing upon certain lenders and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) special requirements for meeting housing finance needs.

The Department of Agriculture, through the Rural Housing Service (RHS), operates a subsidized direct loan program for low- and very-low income rural Americans and a guaranteed loan program for moderate-income rural Americans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development operates three grant programs\u2014the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere that promote affordable homeownership.

However, the federal government has paid for liquidating insolvent member institutions that had benefited from the use of system advances, and the cost of liquidation may have been higher where advances permitted a troubled institution to incur larger losses than it may have otherwise incurred. Furthermore, the government\u2019s past willingness to assist troubled government-sponsored enterprises means that it may bear the costs of most of the losses that such enterprises may suffer in the future.

In 1995, almost 570,000 homeowners received mortgage insurance through FHA insurance programs. During fiscal year 1995, 263,130 homeowners were assisted through the VA\u2019s guaranteed loan program.

In contrast, Neighborhood Housing Services of America purchased 1,133 first and second mortgages in fiscal year 1995 totaling $47.7 million; and the HOPE 3 program had assisted 1,396 homeowners as of December 1995.", "The characteristics of the home buyers who were assisted were not always available for each of the programs. In general, where data were available, these other programs were more heavily concentrated in assistance provided to homeowners who were low-income, minority, and first-time buyers than was the case for FHA, which balances its risk by insuring a broad range of borrowers and thereby operates without federal subsidies.", "For example, 30 percent of the borrowers insured under FHA\u2019s Section 203(b) program had incomes no greater than 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income.
