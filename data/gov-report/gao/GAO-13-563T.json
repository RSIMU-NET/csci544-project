As part of an effort to make additional spectrum available for commercial use, DOD assessed the feasibility of relocating 11 major communication systems from the 1755-1850 MHz band.

Actual relocation costs exceed estimated costs for various reasons, including unforeseen challenges and some agencies not following the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) guidance for preparing the cost estimate. In contrast, the Department of Defense (DOD) expects to complete relocation for about $275 million or approximately $80 million less than its $355 million estimate. According to DOD officials, the relocation of systems from this band has been less expensive than originally estimated because many systems were simply re-tuned to operate in the adjacent 1755-1850 MHz band. The auction of the 1710-1755 MHz band raised almost $6.9 billion in gross winning bids. NTIA expects agencies to complete the relocation effort between 2013 and 2017; therefore, final net auction revenue (auction revenue less relocation costs) may change.", "DOD's preliminary cost estimate for relocating systems from the 1755-1850 MHz band substantially or partially met GAO's best practices, but changes in key assumptions may affect future costs. Adherence with GAO's Cost Guide helps to minimize the risk of cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unmet performance targets. GAO found that DOD's estimate substantially met the comprehensive and well-documented best practices. For instance, it included complete information about systems' life cycles and documentation for the majority of systems was sufficient. However, not all programs had evidence of cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions, and some of the source data were insufficient. GAO also determined that DOD partially met the accurate and credible best practices. For example, DOD applied appropriate inflation rates and its estimated costs generally agreed with its 2001 cost estimate for this band. However, DOD did not develop a confidence level, making it difficult to determine if the costs considered are the most likely costs, and DOD only completed some sensitivity analyses and risk assessments at the program level for some programs. DOD officials said that changes to key assumptions could substantially change its costs. Most importantly, decisions about which spectrum band DOD would relocate to are still unresolved. Nevertheless, DOD's cost estimate was consistent with its purpose--informing the decision to make additional spectrum available for commercial wireless services.", "No government revenue forecast has been prepared for a potential auction of licenses in the 1755-1850 MHz band, and a variety of factors could influence auction revenues. One private sector study in 2011 forecasted $19.4 billion in auction revenue for licenses in this band, assuming that federal users would be cleared and the nationwide spectrum price from a previous auction, adjusted for inflation, would apply to this spectrum. The price of spectrum, and ultimately auction revenue, is determined by supply and demand. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and NTIA jointly influence the amount of spectrum allocated to federal and nonfederal users (the supply). The potential profitability of a spectrum license influences its demand. Several factors would influence profitability and demand, including whether the spectrum is cleared of federal users or must be shared."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today as the Subcommittee  examines the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) requirements for radio  frequency spectrum. As you know, DOD requires spectrum to support  military operations, testing, and training at home and around the world.  For example, DOD has dramatically increased its use of unmanned aerial  systems in support of overseas missions; these systems require spectrum  to transmit volumes of critical intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance data, leading to an increase in DOD\u2019s demand for  spectrum. Similarly, as the demand for and use of smart phones, tablets,  and other wireless devices continues to grow, commercial requirements  for spectrum are expanding as well, with important implications for  economic growth. Thus, balancing competing industry and government  demands for a limited amount of spectrum, today and in the future, is a  challenging and complex task.", "In June 2010, the administration issued a presidential memorandum  directing the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) to collaborate with the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) to make available a total of 500 MHz of federal and nonfederal  spectrum for wireless broadband within 10 years. As part of this effort,  DOD studied the feasibility of relocating military systems from the 1755- 1850 MHz band, which is ideally suited to enabling highly mobile, yet  reliable communication links for commercial and federal users. Relocating  to other parts of the radio frequency spectrum means that many of these  military systems would need to be redesigned. In addition, few other  comparable spectrum bands are available that can effectively support the  federal operations currently in the band. In September 2011, DOD  estimated that the cost to relocate most military systems from the 1755- 1850 MHz band would be about $12.6 billion over 10 years.", "My statement today discusses our ongoing review, requested by the  Senate Committee on Armed Services, of federal agencies\u2019 spectrum  relocation costs and auction revenues. Our review focuses on (1) the  differences between estimated and actual federal relocation costs, and  revenue from the auction of the 1710-1755 MHz band; (2) the extent to  which DOD followed best practices to prepare its preliminary cost  estimate for vacating the 1755-1850 MHz band and the limitations, if any,  of its analysis; and (3) what government or industry revenue forecasts  exist for an auction of the 1755-1850 MHz band, and what factors, if any,  could influence the actual auction revenue. To determine the estimated  and actual federal relocation costs, and revenue from the auction of the  1710-1755 MHz band, we reviewed annual progress reports for the 1710- 1755 MHz transition published by NTIA and spectrum auction data  published by FCC as of December 2012. We limited our analysis to the  Advanced Wireless Services-1 (AWS-1) auction involving the 1710-1755  MHz band; this is the only spectrum auction involving federal agencies,  including DOD, with significant, known relocation costs. To assess  whether the cost of vacating the 1755-1850 MHz band is sufficiently  captured in DOD\u2019s preliminary cost estimate, we assessed DOD\u2019s  preliminary estimate against GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide (Cost Guide), which has been used to evaluate cost estimates  across the government; these best practices help ensure cost estimates  are comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. To identify  any limitations affecting DOD\u2019s estimate, we also interviewed DOD  officials responsible for developing the department\u2019s preliminary cost  estimate. To identify any government or industry forecasts of revenue  from a future auction of the 1755-1850 MHz band and any factors that  would affect the value of spectrum licenses, we reviewed academic,  government, and public policy literature. We also interviewed officials  from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), and stakeholders with knowledge of  spectrum licensing issues, including industry and policy experts. We are  conducting our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  military employs these systems for training, testing, and combat  operations throughout the world. Commercial entities use spectrum to  provide a variety of wireless services, including mobile voice and data,  paging, broadcast television and radio, and satellite services.", "In the United States, FCC manages spectrum for nonfederal users under  the Communications Act, while NTIA manages spectrum for federal  government users and acts for the President with respect to spectrum  management issues as governed by the National Telecommunications  and Information Administration Organization Act. FCC and NTIA, with  direction from Congress and the President, jointly determine the amount  of spectrum allocated for federal, nonfederal, and shared use. FCC and  NTIA manage the spectrum through a system of frequency allocation and  assignment.", "Allocation involves segmenting the radio spectrum into bands of  frequencies that are designated for use by particular types of radio  services or classes of users. (Fig. 1 illustrates examples of allocated  spectrum uses, including DOD systems using the 1755-1850 MHz  band.) In addition, spectrum managers specify service rules, which  include the technical and operating characteristics of equipment.", "Assignment, which occurs after spectrum has been allocated for  particular types of services or classes of users, involves providing  users, such as commercial entities or government agencies, with a  license or authorization to use a specific portion of spectrum. FCC  assigns licenses within frequency bands to commercial enterprises,  state and local governments, and other entities. Since 1994, FCC has  used competitive bidding, or auctions, to assign certain licenses to  commercial entities for their use of spectrum. Auctions are a market- based mechanism in which FCC assigns a license to the entity that  submits the highest bid for specific bands of spectrum. NTIA  authorizes spectrum use through frequency assignments to federal  agencies. More than 60 federal agencies and departments combined  have over 240,000 frequency assignments, although 9 departments,  including DOD, hold 94 percent of all frequency assignments for  federal use.", "Congress has taken a number of steps to facilitate the deployment of  innovative, new commercial wireless services to consumers, including  requiring more federal spectrum to be reallocated for commercial use.  Relocating communications systems entails costs that are affected by  many variables related to the systems themselves as well as the  relocation plans. Some fixed microwave systems, for example, can use  off-the-shelf commercial technology and may just need to be re-tuned to  accommodate a change in frequency. However, some systems may  require significant modification if the characteristics of the new spectrum  frequencies differ sufficiently from the original spectrum. Specialized  systems, such as those used for surveillance and law enforcement  purposes, may not be compatible with commercial technology, and  therefore agencies have to work with vendors to develop equipment that  meets mission needs and operational requirements.", "In 2004, the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA) established  a Spectrum Relocation Fund, funded from auction proceeds, to cover  the costs incurred by federal entities that relocate to new frequency  assignments or transition to alternative technologies. The auction of  spectrum licenses in the 1710-1755 MHz band was the first with  relocation costs to take place under CSEA. Twelve agencies previously  operated communication systems in this band, including DOD. CSEA  designated 1710-1755 MHz as \u201celigible frequencies\u201d for which federal  relocation costs could be paid from the Spectrum Relocation Fund. In  September 2006, FCC concluded the auction of licenses in the 1710- 1755 MHz band and, in accordance with CSEA, a portion of the auction  proceeds is currently being used to pay spectrum relocation expenses.", "In response to the President\u2019s 2010 memorandum requiring that  additional spectrum be made available for commercial use within 10  years, in January 2011, NTIA selected the 1755-1850 MHz band as the  priority band for detailed evaluation and required federal agencies to  evaluate the feasibility of relocating systems to alternative spectrum  bands. DOD provided NTIA its input in September 2011, and NTIA  subsequently issued its assessment of the viability for accommodating  commercial wireless broadband in the band in March 2012. Most  recently, the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  published a report in July 2012 recommending specific steps to ensure  the successful implementation of the President\u2019s 2010 memorandum.  The report found, for example, that clearing and vacating federal users  from certain bands was not a sustainable basis for spectrum policy largely  because of the high cost to relocate federal agencies and disruption to  the federal missions. It recommended new policies to promote the sharing  of federal spectrum. The sharing approach has been questioned by  CTIA\u2014The Wireless Association and its members, which argue that  cleared spectrum and an exclusive-use approach to spectrum  management has enabled the U.S. wireless industry to invest hundreds of  billions of dollars to deploy mobile broadband networks resulting in  economic benefits for consumers and businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Agencies Underestimated 1710- 1755 MHz Band Relocation Costs, Although Auction Revenues Appear to Exceed Those Costs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Federal Agencies Underestimated Relocation Costs", "paragraphs": ["Actual costs to relocate communications systems for 12 federal agencies  from the 1710-1755 MHz band have exceeded original estimates by  about $474 million, or 47 percent, as of March 2013.

OMB and  NTIA officials expect the final relocation cost to be about $1.5 billion  compared with the original estimate of about $1 billion. Total actual costs  exceed estimated costs for many reasons, including unforeseen  challenges, unique issues posed by specific equipment location, the  transition timeframe, costs associated with achieving comparable  capability, and the fact that some agencies may not have properly  followed OMB and NTIA guidance to prepare the original cost estimate.

According to DOD officials, any  change to key assumptions about the bands to which systems would  move could substantially change relocation costs. Because decisions  about the time frame for relocation and the spectrum bands to which the  various systems would be reassigned have not been made yet, DOD  based its current estimate on the most likely assumptions, provided by  NTIA, some of which have already been proven inaccurate or are still  undetermined. For example:", "Relocation bands: According to DOD officials, equipment relocation  costs vary depending on the relocation band\u2019s proximity to the current  band. Moving to bands further away than the assumed relocation  bands could increase costs; moving to closer bands could decrease  costs. In addition, congestion, in both the 1755-1850 MHz band and  the potential bands to which its systems might be moved, complicates  relocation planning. Also, DOD officials said that many of the potential  spectrum bands to which DOD\u2019s systems could be relocated would  not be able to accommodate the new systems unless other actions  are also taken. For example, the 2025-2110 MHz band, into which  DOD assumed it could move several systems and operate them on a  primary basis, is currently allocated to commercial electronic news  gathering systems and other commercial systems. To accommodate  military systems within this band, FCC would need to withdraw this  spectrum from commercial use to allow NTIA to provide DOD primary  status within this band, or FCC would have to otherwise ensure that  commercial systems operate on a non-interference basis with military  systems. FCC has not initiated a rulemaking procedure to begin such  processes.", "Relocation start date: DOD\u2019s cost estimate assumed relocation  would begin in fiscal year 2013, but no auction has been approved, so  relocation efforts have not begun. According to DOD officials, new  equipment and systems continue to be deployed in and designed for  the current band, and older systems are retired. This changes the  overall profile of systems in the band, which can change the costs of  relocation. For example, a major driver of the cost increase between  DOD\u2019s 2001 and 2011 relocation estimates for the 1755-1850 MHz  band was the large increase in the use of unmanned aerial systems.  DOD deployed these systems very little in 2001, but their numbers  had increased substantially by 2011. Conversely, equipment near the  end of its life cycle when the study was completed may be retired or  replaced outside of relocation efforts, which could decrease relocation  costs.", "Inflation: Inflation will drive up costs as more time elapses before the  auction occurs.", "In addition to changing assumptions, the high-level nature of a rough- order-of-magnitude estimate means that it is not as robust as a detailed,  budget-quality lifecycle estimate, and its results should not be considered  or used with the same confidence.

Sharing could potentially  have a big impact on the price of spectrum licenses. In 2012, the  President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  advocated that sharing between federal and commercial users  become the new norm for spectrum management, especially given  the high cost and lengthy time it takes to relocate federal users.", "Certainty and Timing: Another factor that affects the value of licensed  spectrum is the certainty about when it becomes available. Any  increase in the probability that the spectrum would not be cleared on  time would have a negative effect on the price companies are willing  to pay to use it. For example, 7 years after the auction of the 1710- 1755 MHz band, federal agencies are still relocating systems. The  estimated 10-year timeframe to clear federal users from the 1755- 1850 MHz band, and potential uncertainty around that timeframe,  could negatively influence demand for the spectrum.", "Available Wireless Services: Innovation in the wireless broadband  market is expected to continue to drive demand for wireless services.
