According to State officials, the strategy represents a consensus view of key agencies. While the Department of Defense (DOD) as a whole joined in this consensus, one part of DOD\u2014the Southern Command\u2014disagreed with the strategy's characterization of the Iranian threat at the time the strategy was prepared. State also uses venues such as country team meetings and law enforcement working groups to address Iranian activities.", "While the strategy contains information on Iranian activities in the Western Hemisphere, it does not contain all the information that the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 stated it should include. GAO identified 12 distinct elements that the act stated should be included in the strategy. As shown in the figure, the strategy fully addresses 2, partially addresses 6, and does not address 4 of 12 elements. For example, the strategy contains information describing the operations of Iran, but does not include a plan to address U.S. interests to ensure energy supplies from the Western Hemisphere are free from foreign manipulation. State and ODNI officials reported several reasons why the strategy may not fully address the information identified in the law.

This includes the 1994 bombing  of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, that killed  85 people. In October 2011, the United States announced charging two  men with conspiracy to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the  United States. The alleged plot was directed by elements of the Iranian  government to murder the Ambassador with explosives while the  Ambassador was in the United States, according to the announcement. In  December 2012, Congress enacted the Countering Iran in the Western  Hemisphere Act of 2012, which stated that the policy of the United  States is to use a comprehensive government-wide strategy to counter  Iran\u2019s growing hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere  by working together with U.S. allies and partners in the region to mutually  deter threats to U.S. interests by Iran and its proxy actors. The act further  required the Department of State (State) to assess the threats posed to  the United States by Iran\u2019s activities in the Western Hemisphere and  submit to the relevant congressional committees the results of the  assessment and a strategy to address these threats.

In response to these concerns, you requested  that we review the strategy and its development. In this report, we  examine (1) State\u2019s collaboration with other key U.S. agencies and  foreign partners to address Iranian activities in the Western Hemisphere,  (2) the extent to which the strategy on addressing Iranian activities in the  Western Hemisphere included elements identified in the act, and (3) the  extent to which the strategy on addressing Iranian activities in the  Western Hemisphere included desirable characteristics of national  strategies.", "To analyze State\u2019s collaboration with key U.S. agencies and foreign  partners to address Iranian activities in the Western Hemisphere, we  reviewed agency documents and interviewed U.S. and foreign officials.

We also interviewed officials at the U.S. embassies in  Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, and host government officials in  Colombia and Mexico regarding input they may have provided regarding  the strategy.including whether they had experienced instances of Iran-linked terrorist  attacks, their bilateral relationships with the United States, and our  expected ability to engage with host government officials. The results of  our interviews with officials at these four locations are not generalizable to  all countries in the Western Hemisphere. To examine the extent to which   We chose these countries based on a number of factors,  the strategy on addressing Iranian activities in the Western Hemisphere  includes elements identified in the act, we analyzed State\u2019s submission to  Congress, including State\u2019s classified strategy report, the unclassified  summary of policy recommendations, and portions of the Intelligence  Community Assessment.
