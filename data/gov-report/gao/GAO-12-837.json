Within DHS, S&T conducts R&D and is the component responsible for coordinating R&D across the department, but other components, such as the Coast Guard and DNDO, also conduct R&D to support their respective missions. GAO was asked to identify (1) how much DHS invests in R&D and the extent to which DHS has policies and guidance for defining R&D and overseeing R&D resources and efforts across the department, and (2) the extent to which R&D is coordinated within DHS to prevent overlap, fragmentation, or unnecessary duplication. GAO reviewed information on DHS R&D budgets, contracts, and DHS spending on R&D at DOE national laboratories for fiscal years 2010 through 2012.

According to DHS, its Science & Technology Directorate (S&T), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), and U. S. Coast Guard are the only components that conduct R&D and, according to GAO\u0092s analysis, these are the only components that report budget authority, obligations, or outlays for R&D activities to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of the budget process. However, GAO identified an additional $255 million in R&D obligations by other DHS components. For example, S&T reported receiving $50 million in reimbursements from other DHS components to conduct R&D. Further, 10 components obligated $55 million for R&D contracts to third parties and $151 million to Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories for R&D-related projects, but these were not reported as R&D to OMB. According to DHS, it is difficult to identify all R&D investments across the department because DHS does not have a department wide policy defining R&D or guidance directing components how to report all R&D spending and activities. As a result, it is difficult for DHS to oversee components\u0092 R&D efforts and align them with agency wide R&D goals and priorities. Developing specific policies and guidance could assist DHS components in better understanding how to report R&D activities, and better position DHS to determine how much the agency invests in R&D to effectively oversee these investments.", "S&T has taken some steps to coordinate R&D efforts across DHS, but the department's R&D efforts are fragmented and overlapping, which increases the risk of unnecessary duplication. R&D at DHS is inherently fragmented because S&T, the Coast Guard, and DNDO were each given R&D responsibilities in law, and other DHS components may pursue and conduct their own R&D efforts as long as those activities are coordinated through S&T. S&T uses various mechanisms to coordinate its R&D efforts including component liaisons, component R&D agreements, joint R&D strategies, and integrated R&D product teams composed of S&T and component officials. However, GAO identified 35 instances of overlap among contracts that DHS components awarded for R&D projects. For example, S&T and the Transportation Security Administration both awarded overlapping contracts to different vendors to develop advanced algorithms to detect the same type of explosive. While GAO did not identify instances of unnecessary duplication among these contracts, DHS has not developed a policy defining who is responsible for coordinating R&D and what processes should be used to coordinate it, and does not have mechanisms to track all R&D activities at DHS that could help prevent overlap, fragmentation, or unnecessary duplication. For example, S&T did not track homeland security-related R&D activities that DHS components contracted through DOE national laboratories from fiscal year 2010 through 2013; thus, it could not provide information on those contracts. Developing a policy defining the roles and responsibilities for coordinating R&D, and establishing coordination processes and a mechanism to track all R&D projects could help DHS mitigate existing fragmentation and overlap, and reduce the risk of unnecessary duplication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS develop policies and guidance for defining, reporting and coordinating R&D activities across the department; and that DHS establish a mechanism to track R&D projects.

The department\u2019s Science and  Technology (S&T) Directorate conducts research, development,  demonstration, testing, and evaluation activities and also has  responsibility for coordinating and integrating all such activities of the  department, as provided by the Homeland Security Act of 2002.  Although S&T conducts R&D and has responsibility for coordinating R&D,  other DHS components, including the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office  (DNDO) and the U. S. Coast Guard, conduct R&D in support of their  respective missions.", "Since it began operations in 2003, DHS, through both S&T and other  components, has spent billions of dollars researching and developing  technologies used to support a wide range of missions, including securing  the border, detecting nuclear devices, and screening airline passengers  and baggage for explosives, among others. In May 2004, we reported  that DHS had not completed a strategic plan to identify priorities, goals,  objectives, and policies for the R&D of homeland security technologies,  and gaps remained in its efforts to coordinate with other federal agencies  that conduct homeland security R&D. We recommended that DHS  complete a strategic R&D plan and ensure that the plan was integrated  with homeland security R&D conducted by other federal agencies. DHS  agreed with our recommendation but has not yet implemented it. In June  2009, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) reported on  S&T\u2019s structure, processes, and the execution of its cross-government  leadership role. NAPA reported that although S&T was charged by  statute to provide a leading role in guiding homeland-security related  research, S&T has no authority over other federal agencies that conduct  homeland-security related research, and was in a relatively weak position  to carry out its leadership role. NAPA further reported that the  weaknesses in S&T\u2019s strategic planning increased the risk for duplication  of efforts and recommended, among other things, that S&T follow the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO guidance in  formulating a strategic plan to guide its work. In July 2012, S&T provided  a draft strategy that identifies the roles and responsibilities for  coordinating homeland security science and technology related functions  across the U.S. government to the White House\u2019s Office of Science &  Technology Policy for review, but the White House had not yet approved  that draft.", "In November 2011, we reported that while S&T developed a 5-year R&D  plan in 2008 to guide its efforts and was finalizing a new strategic plan to  align its own R&D investments and goals, DHS had not yet completed a  strategic plan to align all R&D efforts across the department, as we  previously recommended in 2004. We also reported that S&T had  undertaken a series of efforts related to its organizational structure and  underwent a new strategic planning process, developed new strategic  goals, and conducted a reorganization intended to better achieve its  strategic goals as a result of the NAPA study. We also reported that these  efforts had only recently been initiated, so it was too early to assess their  effectiveness.", "Not having a department-wide strategy for managing R&D has raised  questions about the extent to which R&D investments and efforts are  being overseen and coordinated effectively across DHS. As a result, you  requested that we conduct a review to determine how DHS oversees  R&D resources and coordinates R&D efforts across the department.  Specifically, this report addresses the following two questions:  1.  How much does DHS invest in R&D and to what extent does it have  policies and guidance for defining R&D and overseeing R&D  resources and efforts across the department? 2.  To what extent is R&D coordinated within DHS to prevent overlap,  fragmentation, and unnecessary duplication across the department?", "To determine how much DHS invests in R&D and the extent to which it  has policies and guidance for defining R&D and overseeing R&D  resources, we reviewed DHS\u2019s budget and congressional budget  justifications to identify R&D investments reported from fiscal years 2011  through 2013. To identify DHS\u2019s reported R&D budget authority, we  analyzed R&D budget authority included in budget submissions to OMB  from fiscal years 2010 through 2013. We also analyzed S&T, DNDO,  and Coast Guard budgets to identify budget authority for R&D activities in  non-R&D budget accounts. Further, we analyzed data from the Federal  Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify DHS  R&D-related contracts for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. We also  obtained data from the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) national  laboratories from fiscal years 2010 through 2012 to identify how much  DHS components obligated for R&D-related work at the national  laboratories. We assessed the reliability of the data we used by  reconciling it with published data, and interviewing officials responsible for  overseeing the relevant data systems about, among other things,  applicable quality control procedures to maintain the integrity of the data.  We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. Further, we interviewed S&T, Coast Guard, and DNDO  budget officials to determine what portions of their budgets would  appropriately capture total R&D activities, as well as DHS budget officials  to discuss R&D spending, how DHS oversees R&D funding, and DHS\u2019s  policies and guidance related to defining, overseeing, and coordinating  R&D efforts. We also interviewed other DHS component officials to  discuss the extent to which components conducted R&D, captured R&D  activities in their budgets, and coordinated with S&T. We compared DHS  efforts to develop policies and guidance with GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To determine the extent to which R&D is coordinated within DHS to  prevent overlap, fragmentation, and unnecessary duplication, we  reviewed data on about 15,000 federal procurement contract actions  coded as R&D in FPDS-NG made by DHS components from fiscal years  2007 through 2011 to identify contracts that were overlapping or  duplicative of other contracts issued by different components. We selected 50 R&D contracts that appeared to contain overlap and  interviewed the officials of the six components that issued them to discuss  the nature of those contracts. We could not determine the full extent of  duplication or overlap occurring in the department, because, among other  things, the FPDS-NG data system captures only a portion of the total  R&D activities occurring at DHS. We also used our past work on  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication across the federal government,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, and our prior  work related to federal collaboration to assess DHS\u2019s coordination of R&D  across the department. We also interviewed S&T leadership, technical  division directors, and DHS component officials to discuss S&T and  DHS\u2019s R&D coordination processes.

Specifically, S&T has agreements with CBP to develop a rapid response  prototype, the Coast Guard to develop a test bed, and TSA to coordinate  the transition of the Transportation Security Laboratory from TSA to S&T  which, was completed in 2006. S&T is also currently working with TSA on  an Aviation Security agreement that is to result in S&T supporting TSA in  various areas (as outlined in the agreement) and providing technology to  address capability gaps. S&T plans to initiate similar partnerships first  with CBP, then with ICE and FEMA.", "S&T also works with DHS components to ensure that it meets their R&D  needs by signing technology transition agreements (TTA) to ensure that  components use the technologies S&T develops. S&T has 42 TTAs with  DHS components. For example, TSA agreed to integrate automated  intent detection technologies to better detect unknown threats before they  enter the country into its behavior detection-screening program once S&T  successfully demonstrated that the technologies met performance  requirements. Additionally, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service  (USCIS) agreed to deploy rapid DNA-based screening technologies to  determine kinship to use in the refugee and asylum eligibility  determination process upon S&T demonstrating that the technology  meets certain performance criteria. According to S&T officials, none of  these TTAs has yet resulted in a technology being transitioned from S&T  to a component.", "In March 2011, S&T and TSA issued a joint R&D strategy for aviation  security that identifies TSA\u2019s R&D priorities. That plan was a result of an  internal planning process that prioritized capability gaps and focused on  the work between TSA and S&T\u2019s Explosives and Human  Factors/Behavioral Sciences Divisions. According to TSA officials, the  joint R&D strategic plan does not represent a TSA-wide R&D strategy  because it does not include surface transportation security capability  gaps. Rather, the officials said that TSA uses the National Infrastructure  Protection Plan and an R&D working group with S&T to identify those  capability gaps. S&T officials stated that it is currently updating its R&D  Strategy with TSA. S&T is also planning to work with the Secret Service,  CBP, ICE, and FEMA to build component-specific R&D strategies that are  linked to component acquisition programs.", "S&T\u2019s previous Under Secretary instituted the Capstone Integrated  Product Teams (IPT) process to coordinate R&D efforts between S&T  and components. IPTs served as S&T\u2019s primary mechanism for  coordinating R&D and consisted of members from S&T and component  agencies. In S&T\u2019s 5-year R&D plan for fiscal years 2008 through 2013,  S&T identified 12 IPTs, each of which was focused on a different topic  and brought together decision makers from DHS components and S&T,  as well as end users of technologies. Additionally, the IPT process  included teams to coordinate R&D at the project level among S&T and  components. IPTs solicited input from components to identify and  address technology gaps and needs and were intended to assist  operational units in making decisions about technology investments,  based on S&T\u2019s understanding of technology and the state of applicable  technology solutions. For example, members of the cargo security IPT  determined that the capability gap that should be addressed was  enhancing cargo screening and examination systems through detecting  or identifying terrorist contraband items, like drugs or illegal firearms. As a  result, S&T identified CanScan, a nonintrusive inspection system as a  means for addressing that gap.", "We interviewed directors of divisions responsible for coordinating R&D activities  throughout the department.

Fragmentation among R&D efforts at DHS may be  advantageous if the department determines that it could gain better or  faster results by having multiple components engage in R&D activities  toward a similar goal; however, it can be disadvantageous if those  activities are uncoordinated or unintentionally overlapping or duplicative.", "To illustrate overlap and the potential for unnecessary duplication, we  reviewed data on about 15,000 federal procurement contract actions  coded as R&D taken by DHS components from fiscal years 2007 through  2012. See appendix 1 for details on our methodology for identifying  overlap. Of those, we identified 50 R&D contracts issued by six DHS  components\u2014S&T, TSA, FEMA, the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), the  Coast Guard, and CBP\u2014that appeared to have similar activities with  another contract and interviewed component officials about those R&D  activities. We obtained 47 of those 50 contracts and reviewed their  statements of work. On the basis of that analysis and our interviews with  components, we identified 35 instances of overlap where components  awarded R&D contracts that overlapped with R&D activities conducted  elsewhere in the department. We also found that DHS did not have  tracking mechanisms or policies to help ensure that this overlap be  avoided and better coordinated. For example:", "S&T awarded four separate contracts to develop methods of detecting  ammonium nitrate and urea nitrate for the counter-IED program. TSA  also awarded a contract to a private vendor to investigate the  detection of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based  explosives. These contracts were similar in that they all addressed the  detection of the same chemical.", "S&T awarded four separate contracts to develop advanced algorithms  for explosives detection, while TSA also awarded contracts to develop  algorithms to evaluate images for explosives. We determined that  these R&D contracts overlapped because both components were  involved in developing algorithms for explosives detection.", "S&T awarded a contract to a private vendor for support and analysis  for seismic hazards, while FEMA also awarded a contract to a private  vendor to develop seismic guidelines for buildings in the event of an  earthquake. These contracts overlapped because they were both  similar in scope.", "Although the contracts we selected overlapped, we determined that they  were not duplicative based on our analysis and our interviews with  component officials. For example, TSA officials stated that all TSA R&D  contracts we requested were initially awarded when TSA still conducted  transportation security-related R&D and were managed by the  Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL), which moved into S&T in  2006. As a result, TSA did not have oversight into those contracts.  Additionally, TSA officials stated that some of the contracts may have  overlapped in the scope of work but were focused on different operational  missions. S&T officials agreed with TSA, stating that some of this overlap  occurred during a period of time when TSA was still conducting R&D  through TSL and during a time when S&T did not have the level of  contract oversight that it has now. FEMA officials stated that FEMA\u2019s  research projects are related to earthquake hazards, rather than to  multiple hazards like S&T\u2019s research projects. They stated that FEMA\u2019s  coordination with S&T is dependent on prior personal relationships rather  than through an established coordination process.", "According to S&T officials, a process does not exist at DHS or within S&T  to prevent overlap or unnecessary duplication but that relationships with  components mitigate that risk. They also stated that S&T has improved  interactions with components over time. For example, S&T officials stated  that when CBP requested mobile radios to improve communication  among its field staff, S&T knew that the Secret Service and ICE were  already working in that area. To address this technology need, S&T  provided a senior official to lead the Tactical Communication Team to  address communication among different operational components and  better coordinate those efforts.", "In conducting this analysis, we recognize that overlapping R&D activities  across similar areas may not be problematic. However, the existence of  overlapping R&D activities coupled with the lack of policies and guidance  defining R&D (as mentioned previously) and coordination processes is an  indication that not all R&D activities at DHS are coordinated to ensure  that R&D is not unnecessarily duplicative. As a result, DHS could  increase oversight of R&D, and improve coordination of R&D activities to  ensure that any duplication in R&D activities is purposeful rather than  unnecessary, as discussed later in this draft.

First, as noted earlier in this report, DHS does  not have the policies and guidance necessary to define and oversee R&D  investments across the department. While S&T has taken steps to  coordinate R&D, DHS has not developed a policy defining who is  responsible for coordinating R&D and what processes should be used to  coordinate it. Specifically, while S&T has R&D agreements with some  components, S&T officials rely on the former IPT process to coordinate  with components. For example, S&T division directors cited the IPT  process and personal relationships as the primary means to coordinate  R&D activities with components and generally felt that they were  coordinating effectively.", "However, other component officials we interviewed did not view S&T\u2019s  coordination practices as positively. Specifically, we interviewed six  components to discuss the extent to which they coordinated with S&T on  R&D activities. Four components stated that S&T did not have an  established process that detailed how S&T would work with its customers  or for coordinating all activities at DHS. For example, one component  stated that S&T has conducted R&D that it thought would address the  component\u2019s operational need but, when work was completed, the R&D  project did not fit into the operational environment to meet the  component\u2019s needs. In addition, without an established coordination  process, the risk for unnecessary duplication increases, because  components can engage in R&D activities without coordinating them  through S&T (see fig. 3).", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  policies and procedures ensure that the necessary activities occur at all  levels and functions of the organization\u2014not just from top-level  leadership. This ensures that all levels of the organization are  coordinating effectively and as part of a larger strategy. Additionally,  internal control standards provide that agencies should communicate  necessary information effectively by ensuring that they are  communicating with, and obtaining information from, external  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving  its goals. DHS and S&T could be in a better position to coordinate the  department\u2019s R&D efforts by implementing a specific policy outlining R&D  roles and responsibilities and processes for coordinating R&D.", "Furthermore, S&T and DHS have not developed a mechanism to track all  ongoing R&D projects conducted across DHS components. Specifically,  neither DHS nor S&T tracks all ongoing R&D projects across the  department, including R&D activities contracted through the national  laboratories. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave DHS the authority  to use DOE laboratories to conduct R&D and established S&T\u2019s Office of  National Laboratories (ONL) to be responsible for coordinating and using  the DOE national laboratories. Additionally, DHS Directive 143 further  directs ONL to serve as the primary point of contact to recommend  contracting activity approval for work by the national laboratories, and  review all statements of work issued from DHS and directed to the  national laboratories. According to S&T, the purpose of that review is to  ensure the proposed work is within the scope, and complies with the  terms and conditions, of the prime contract between DOE and the  national laboratories. We identified 11 components that reimbursed the  national laboratories for R&D between fiscal years 2010 and 2013, but  ONL could not provide us with any information on those activities and told  us it did not track them.information on activities across the department is limited by components  inconsistently operating within the DHS Directive 143 process for working  with the national laboratories. According to the Director of ONL, to identify  activities not reported through the DHS Directive 143 process, S&T uses  other means such as relationships with components and S&T, as well as  reviewing task orders sent to the laboratories from DHS, visiting  laboratories, and laboratories self-reporting their work to ONL.", "According to S&T, ONL's ability to provide  We previously reported in 2004 that DHS faced challenges using DOE\u2019s  laboratories and balancing the immediate needs of users of homeland  security technologies with the need to conduct R&D on advanced  technologies for the future. DHS agreed with our recommendation to  create a strategic R&D plan to identify and develop countermeasures to  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and other emerging terrorist  threats and to ensure that it detailed how DHS would work with other  federal agencies to establish governmentwide priorities, identify research  gaps, avoid duplication of effort, and leverage resources. DHS noted that  such a plan was critical to the success of the department, and stated that  S&T would complete a strategic planning process in 2004 that would be  reviewed and updated annually. To date, DHS has not yet developed a  departmentwide strategic plan for managing R&D, although S&T has  developed its own plan.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  controls are needed to provide reasonable assurance that, among other  things, reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in  reports and agencies comply with laws and regulations. In addition, in  June 2010, we reported that R&D information should be tracked in a  consolidated database in order to fully coordinate cybersecurity R&D  activities to provide essential information about ongoing and completed  R&D. We recommended that the Director of the Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP) direct its subcommittee on Networking and  Information Technology Research and Development to exercise its  leadership responsibilities by, among other things, establishing and using  a mechanism to keep track of federal cybersecurity R&D funding. OSTP  agreed with our recommendation. Additionally, we previously reported  that agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts by,  among other things, agreeing on roles and responsibilities and developing  mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results.", "DHS officials agreed that such mechanisms to track R&D activities were  necessary, and said they have faced similar challenges in managing  investments across the department. DHS has attempted to address those  challenges by, among other things, creating a database called the  Decision Support Tool that is intended to improve the flow of information  from component program offices to the DHS Management Directorate to  support its governance efforts. The Decision Support Tool could provide an example of how DHS could better track ongoing R&D projects  occurring in the department. DHS\u2019s PARM officials stated that they  recently added new data fields to capture more detailed information on  component activities, such as additional financial data, at a low cost to  DHS, and that such data fields could be added to collect information and  track R&D activities across DHS, such as contracts with private  companies or universities and the associated costs. However, we  reported in March 2012 that DHS executives were not confident enough  in the data to use the Decision Support Tool to make acquisition  decisions, and that DHS\u2019s plans to improve the quality of the data in this  database were limited. We also reported that DHS had limited plans to  improve the quality of the data because PARM only planned to check the  data quality in preparation for key milestone meetings in the acquisition  process. That could significantly diminish the Decision Support Tool\u2019s  value, because users cannot confidently identify and take action to  address problems meeting cost or schedule goals prior to program review  meetings. As a result, improvements to the Decision Support Tool\u2019s data  quality before expanding its use could improve the collecting and tracking  of R&D information and could be used as an example of how to better  track information occurring across components. DHS is taking actions to  address the limitations to the Decision Support Tool\u2019s data quality by  working to validate the Decision Support Tool\u2019s associated acquisition  data.
