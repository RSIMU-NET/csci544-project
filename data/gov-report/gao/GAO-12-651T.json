For example, individual income tax accounts for the largest portion of the tax gap, but corporate income tax and employment tax are also significant. Further, misreporting by individuals involves business income, non-business income, deductions, and credits. The extent of misreporting depends on the extent to which income tax is withheld or reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by third parties. For example, nearly 40 percent, or $179 billion, of the 2006 gross tax gap is due to misreporting of non-corporate business income and related self-employment taxes. Much of this misreporting can be attributed to sole proprietors underreporting receipts or over-reporting expenses. Unlike wage and some investment income, sole proprietors\u0092 income is not subject to withholding and only a portion is reported to IRS by third parties.", "Because noncompliance has multiple causes and spans different types of taxes and taxpayers, multiple approaches are needed to reduce the tax gap.

IRS estimated that it would eventually recover about $65  billion of this amount through late payments and enforcement actions,  leaving a net tax gap of $385 billion. The tax gap has been a persistent  problem in spite of a myriad of congressional and IRS efforts to reduce it,  as the rate at which taxpayers voluntarily comply with United States tax  laws has changed little over the past three decades. In past testimonies,  we have said that there are no easy fixes to this problem, and given  persistent levels of noncompliance, reducing the tax gap will not likely be  achieved through a single solution. Rather, the tax gap must be attacked  on multiple fronts and with multiple strategies over a sustained period of  time. Whether mistakes are intentional or unintentional, misreporting is  unfair to compliant taxpayers and undermines the equity of the tax  system. Moreover, in the face of large and growing structural deficits, it  will be especially important to understand the causes of tax  noncompliance today and continue to develop new approaches to  minimize it.", "My testimony today will answer two questions: (1) What types of  taxpayers are responsible for the tax gap, and what is the nature of their  noncompliance?

The  estimate also covers the five types of taxes that IRS administers\u2014 individual income, corporate income, employment, estate, and excise  taxes.", "The tax gap includes unintentional errors as well as intentional evasion,  such as intentionally underreporting income, intentionally over-reporting  expenses, and engaging in abusive tax shelters or frivolous tax schemes.  It does not include legal tax avoidance activities (legally lowering tax  liability), taxes due from illegally derived income, or various forms of  fraud. For example, in general, refund fraud related to identity theft would  not be included in the tax gap estimate because it does not involve  evading a tax liability. Nevertheless, as discussed later in the testimony,  actions taken to improve overall compliance and reduce the tax gap could  also potentially address identity theft related fraud.", "A critical step toward reducing the tax gap is to understand the sources  and nature of taxpayer noncompliance. As shown in table 1,  noncompliance does not come from a single source but rather occurs  across different types of taxes and taxpayers. For example, individual  income tax accounted for most of the tax gap estimate for tax year 2006.  However, corporate income tax and employment tax also contributed a  significant portion.", "As shown in table 2, individual income tax underreporting includes both  nonbusiness income tax and business income tax underreporting.  Business income for individuals includes income from a variety of  business types, including sole proprietors, partnerships, and S  corporations, many of which are small businesses. Nearly 40 percent, or  $179 billion, of the 2006 gross tax gap can be attributed to these types of  business taxpayers who underreport their business income tax, and by  extension their self-employment tax, on their individual income tax  returns. Further, the misreporting of business income tax can take on a  variety of forms. For example, misreporting of non-corporate business  income tax can be largely attributed to sole proprietors who understated  receipts or overstated expenses.", "A key reason for this misreporting is  well known. Unlike wage and some investment income, sole proprietors\u2019  income is not subject to withholding and only a portion is subject to  information reporting to IRS by third parties.", "As shown in figure 1, the extent to which individual taxpayers accurately  report their income is related to the extent to which the income is reported  to them and IRS by third parties or taxes on the income are withheld. For  example, for types of income for which there is little or no information  reporting, such as business income, individual taxpayers tend to  misreport over half of their income. In contrast, employers report most  wages, salaries, and tip compensation to employees and IRS through  Form W-2. Also, banks and other financial institutions provide information  returns (Forms 1099) to account holders and IRS showing the taxpayers\u2019  annual income from some types of investments. Findings from IRS\u2019s  study of individual tax compliance indicate that nearly 99 percent of these  types of income are accurately reported on individual tax returns.", "Taxpayers misreport income and expenses for a variety of reasons.  Some misreporting is intentional; some is unintentional. Often it is  impossible to tell from a tax return whether errors are intentional or  unintentional or even who made the error. For example, paid tax return  preparers could make errors or taxpayers could fail to share relevant  information with their preparers. Our past reports shed some light on the  extent of unintentional errors. In our report on securities cost basis  reporting, we found that among individual taxpayers who misreported  securities sales, roughly one-third over-reported income (i.e., they  overstated gains or understated losses). For sole proprietors, we  reported that 9 percent over-reported their net income, while 61 percent  underreported their net income in 2001.instances of over-reporting could be due to unintentional errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring the Tax Gap", "paragraphs": ["We have long encouraged regular tax gap measurement because these  estimates are important to gauge progress in addressing the tax gap and,  perhaps more importantly, because analyzing the data used to estimate it  can help identify ways to improve tax compliance.
