Since fiscal year 2005, when none of the Army components met recruiting goals, all have made steady progress. To achieve this growth, the Army substantially increased its number of recruiters and its funding of incentives. In addition, the active Army and Army Reserve exceeded their retention goals from fiscal years 2005 through 2008; the Army National Guard exceeded its goals in fiscal years 2006 and 2008 and achieved retention within the allowable margin in fiscal years 2005 and 2007. While the Army has increased its expenditures for bonuses by almost 75 percent since fiscal year 2005, it has not used available research to set bonuses at dollar amounts that are most cost-effective. Although a substantial body of research exists on how to cost-effectively use recruiting resources, the Army has not used this research to calculate bonus amounts. During GAO's review, Army officials stated that the main proof of success of the bonus program was that the Army had met its goals for accessions and retention. Also, because Defense guidance allows the Army to offer bonuses to enlistees in any occupation, the Army has been able to award and often has awarded bonuses to occupations that are not considered priority. Further, because each component makes decisions on bonuses independently, the amounts of bonuses awarded by different components vary widely. Since GAO completed its audit work, the Army states, however, that it has been reducing the numbers and amounts of bonuses offered enlistees. In fiscal years 2005 through 2008, the Army did not consistently meet quality goals for new recruits, as measured by the percentage who have high-school diplomas and who score in the upper half on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. The Army implemented some new programs to increase the market of eligible recruits, such as programs for overweight individuals or those without high-school diplomas. In addition, the Army has continued to use conduct waivers for candidates who fall short of entrance standards for reasons such as prior criminal misconduct. Existing analyses have shown that recruits with conduct waivers perform similarly to those without conduct waivers-- although they are more likely to be separated for adverse reasons; the Army lacks data on the cost of enlisting persons who require conduct waivers. The Army is experiencing shortages of captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels and projects that these shortages will continue. The Army has offered bonuses to captains; however, it has not offered incentives to majors or lieutenant colonels because those ranks are not considered to have retention problems. While the Army has research focused on incentive packages, this research has not been directed at calculating the most cost-effective bonus amounts. Also, the Army has no method of determining whether actions it has taken that deviate from congressional benchmarks will have any effect on the future Army officer corps."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Overseas Contingency Operation has dramatically increased the scale  of U.S. military operations and has accelerated the pace of operations for  soldiers who must deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. To help alleviate the  burden on those most seriously affected by these deployments, the  President announced a plan in January 2007 to grow the Army\u2019s end  strength by 65,000 active-duty; approximately 8,200 Army National Guard;  and approximately 1,000 Army Reserve personnel by fiscal year 2013.  These planned increases represent about a 7 percent increase in the total  size of the Army, from approximately 1.04 million personnel to a growth  goal of over 1.11 million personnel. In 2008, however, recognizing the  intensified demands on Army forces and the stress associated with their  long deployments, the Army decided to accelerate this planned growth and  complete it by fiscal year 2010. As the Army has increased its forces, it has  been faced with the added challenge of doing so in a difficult recruiting  environment, partly due to the long and repeated deployments expected of  Army servicemembers. To meet this challenge and to successfully target  youth who are qualified for service, the Army has invested heavily in  recruiting and bonuses. However, the nation is now faced with difficult  economic circumstances that are straining government resources. In this  context, all agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), will  need to rethink the way they do business and demonstrate the best  possible stewardship of federal funds.", "Given the extraordinary demands now being placed on the Army, you  asked us to examine the Army\u2019s ability to manage its planned growth in  personnel and meet its future personnel needs. This report addresses the  following questions. To what extent is the Army (1) making progress in  growing the force, (2) awarding cost-effective bonuses to attract and  retain enlistees in occupations of greatest need, (3) maintaining the quality  of its enlisted force, and (4) directing the growth in its officer force to  areas of need and determining whether short-term trade-offs it has made  to alleviate shortages will have any long-term effects on its officer corps?", "To assess the Army\u2019s progress in growing the force, we reviewed its actual  and projected end strength under both the original and the accelerated  Army growth plans. We also analyzed recruiting and retention data from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for active Army, Army  Reserve, and Army National Guard servicemembers. To assess the extent  to which the Army is awarding cost-effective bonuses to attract and retain  enlistees in occupations of greatest need, we reviewed Army data on  occupations with personnel shortages and observed the Army\u2019s processes  for allocating bonuses. To assess the efforts that the Army is making to  maintain the quality of its enlisted personnel, we analyzed data from OSD  on educational credentials and aptitude test scores for these personnel,  and we collected data from the U.S. Army Recruiting Command and the  National Guard Bureau on enlistees who were accepted into the Army  with waivers\u2014permission to join the service despite a formerly  disqualifying factor such as prior misconduct. We also reviewed the  Army\u2019s and the RAND Corporation\u2019s analyses of the outcomes for soldiers  who had received waivers. In addition, we collected information on the  Army programs designed to widen the market of eligible recruits. To  assess the extent to which the Army is directing its growth to areas of  need in its officer corps, we reviewed data on the shortages that exist  within the officer corps and collected information on the bonus programs  and other incentives used by the Army to address officer shortages. To  understand the Army\u2019s efforts to maintain the appropriate rank structure  and experience levels of its officer corps, we collected information on the  officer evaluation process and reviewed data on officer promotions from  the U.S. Army Human Resources Command. The data we reviewed for  each of our research objectives generally covered fiscal years 2005  through 2008; however, our analysis of enlistment waivers was limited to  fiscal year 2008 due to limitations in waiver data from previous years, such  as the system\u2019s failure to capture some waivers and the overcounting of  other waivers.Except in the case of the enlistment waiver data, we found  the data for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. In addition to analyzing available data and  documents, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and various  organizations within the Army, including the Army\u2019s Office of the Chief of  Staff for Programs, the Army Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Personnel, the Army Budget Office, and the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. Additionally, we  visited and interviewed officials from the U.S. Army Accessions Command,  U.S. Army Cadet Command, U.S. Army Recruiting Command, U.S. Army  Human Resources Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and National  Guard Bureau Headquarters. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2008 to March 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

According to GAO estimates, in fiscal year 2000 the average  compensation for an active-duty soldier in terms of cash and noncash  benefits and deferred benefits such as healthcare in retirement was  $101,537. In fiscal year 2007, it cost about $125,000 a year to compensate  an active-duty soldier, a rise of about 23 percent.The Army must annually  recruit and retain more than twice the number of uniformed personnel  needed by any other military service, and it has budgeted approximately  $51.8 billion for military personnel in fiscal year 2009. Each fiscal year, the  Army determines its quantity goals\u2014the number of uniformed personnel it  must recruit into the active Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army  National Guard\u2014based on the difference between the congressionally  authorized end strength for each of these components and the projected  number of currently serving personnel expected to continue their military  service through the end of the fiscal year. In addition, requirements  specific to the military services\u2019 officer corps set out in law\u2014specifically  the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act\u2014guide the Army\u2019s  management of these personnel.For example, the act sets the upper limit  on the number of officers that the Army may have at any given time, and  Senate Report No. 96-375 describes benchmarks for officer promotion  rates.  Congressional reports accompanying the Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act also contain information intended to guide management  of the officer corps.", "Since 2004, two major Army initiatives\u2014one to restructure the Army and  another to expand its size\u2014have influenced the Army\u2019s needs for both  enlisted and officer personnel.", "In 2004, the Army began its multiyear modular force restructuring,  sometimes referred to as \u201cArmy Modularity,\u201d which involves the total  redesign of the operational Army. It was initiated, in part, to support  current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The foundation of modular  restructuring is the creation of new, standardized, modular units that  change the Army\u2019s division-based force structure to a structure in which  smaller, more numerous brigade formations are embedded within  significant support elements. These new modular Brigade Combat Teams  and Multi-Functional Support Brigades are designed to be self-sufficient,  stand-alone units that are more rapidly deployable and better able to  conduct joint and expeditionary combat and support operations than were  their larger division-based predecessors. These units, along with  Functional Support Brigades and modular Headquarters Units, comprise  the Army\u2019s new modular force. In most cases, modular brigades require a  different personnel skill level mix than did the brigades they replace.  In January 2007, the President announced an initiative\u2014called Grow the  Force\u2014intended to expand the size of the Army in order to meet strategic  demands and help reduce stress on the force. Subsequently, in October  2007, the Chief of Staff of the Army announced a plan to accelerate the  original Grow the Force completion date from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal  year 2010. The original plan called for an increase in active Army end  strength of 65,000 personnel, bringing it to 547,400; an increase in Army  National Guard end strength of approximately 8,200 personnel, bringing it  to 358,200; and an increase in Army Reserve end strength of approximately  1,000, bringing it to 206,000. The accelerated plan calls for the active Army  and the Army National Guard to achieve their target end strengths by fiscal  year 2010\u20143 years earlier than initially planned; the accelerated plan does  not affect the Army Reserve\u2019s timeline. As we have previously reported,  based on the original timeline, the Army\u2019s preliminary cost estimate  indicated that expanding the Army would require approximately   $70.2 billion from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2013 for military  personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and military  construction costs.The Army also anticipates that it will need additional  supplemental funding to meet the accelerated timeline.", "The Army has control over some but not all of the factors that affect  recruiting. For example, to increase the number of recruits, the Army may  choose to increase the size of its recruiting force or to use incentives, such  as enlistment bonuses or educational benefits. However, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, the combination of the duration of ongoing  operations, the length and frequency of deployments, and the generally  difficult nature of deployments has led to some concerns about the  continuing effects of these factors on recruiting and retaining the force.Additionally, as we have previously reported, recent conditions present  some of the most difficult recruiting and retention challenges DOD has  experienced in recent history. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks on the United States, DOD has launched three major military  operations requiring the deployment of significant numbers of military  servicemembers. These are Operation Noble Eagle, which covers military  operations related to homeland security; Operation Enduring Freedom,  which includes ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and certain  other countries; and Operation Iraqi Freedom, which includes ongoing  military operations in Iraq. These military operations have greatly  increased the rate at which personnel have been deployed, especially in  the active Army, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and the Marine  Corps, which have provided the bulk of the military servicemembers for  operations in Iraq. On the other hand, the recent downturn in the   U.S. economy may increase potential recruits\u2019 interest in military service,  as DOD has historically found that more youth are willing to consider  military service during periods of high unemployment. While  unemployment rates in the United States dropped from 2003 through  2007\u2014falling from 6 percent in 2003 to 4.6 percent in 2007\u2014as of   January 2009, the unemployment rates had risen to 7.6 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Is Well Ahead of Schedule in Growing the Force", "paragraphs": ["By the end of fiscal year 2008, the Army had almost reached its overall  growth goal, although the original Grow the Force plan called for the  growth to be completed by 2013.

The Army has a  list of priority occupations that is compiled by field commanders when  they assess their units\u2019 personnel needs, but given the various factors  considered by the Enlisted Incentives Review Board, situations arise in  which some priority occupations do not receive bonuses or in which  different occupations with varying degrees of responsibility are awarded  the same amount. For example, of the 35 occupational specialties on the  Army\u2019s priority list, 9 were not designated to receive enlistment bonuses at  the time of the June 2008 Enlisted Incentives Review Board meeting.  However, at the same meeting the Enlisted Incentives Review Board  identified 52 nonpriority occupational specialties that would be offered  some level of bonus. (See table 11 in app. II for a list of occupational  specialties that were selected to receive bonuses.)", "The board\u2019s system for determining enlistment bonuses also sometimes  results in cases in which occupations with varying degrees of  responsibility receive the same bonus. For example, in June 2008, Food  Service Specialists were eligible to receive the same bonus as Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Specialists, even though the Explosive Ordnance  Disposal Specialist was listed as a priority occupational specialty and was  tasked with more dangerous responsibilities. Similarly, Infantrymen, an  occupational specialty listed by the Army as a priority specialty, received  the same level of enlistment bonus as Army band musicians. Army officials  told us that these decisions were based on factors such as the difficulty of  recruiting for some occupations and the availability of training slots for  them. DOD guidance allows the services to grant bonuses to occupations  that the services have not deemed \u201cpriority\u201d but that are experiencing  shortages or for which total accession objectives have not been met.", "Like enlistment bonuses, reenlistment bonuses are not always targeted at  priority occupational specialties. For example, in fiscal years 2007 and  2008, the active Army awarded tax-free reenlistment bonuses of up to  $15,000 to all soldiers, regardless of occupational specialty, who were  deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait while they were in theater.  Army officials reported that in fiscal year 2007, 15,984 soldiers received  these reenlistment bonuses, which averaged $10,700. As of April 2008,  4,483 soldiers had received these bonuses during fiscal year 2008; the  average 2008 bonus was $12,700. Army officials linked these tax-free  reenlistment bonuses to the Army\u2019s ability to attain high levels of  retention. For example, they reported that recently deployed units or units  currently deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait have reenlistment  rates at 110 to 120 percent of their yearly goals.", "Furthermore, because the Army\u2019s components manage their enlistment  bonus programs separately, soldiers in the same occupations might  receive bonuses of different amounts, depending on the component in  which they serve. One prominent difference among the bonuses offered by  Army components is the difference between what is offered to an active- duty enlistee and an enlistee who enters under the National Guard\u2019s Active  First incentive program. All Active First recruits get a bonus of at least  $20,000 if they sign up for 2 years in the active Army; $30,000 if they sign  up for 3 years; and $40,000 if they sign up for 4 years. Because all Active  First enlistees are eligible for bonuses, an enlistee in a specific  occupational specialty may find that he or she is eligible for a bonus for  joining the Active First program but not eligible for a bonus for joining the  active Army. According to data provided by the U.S. Army Recruiting  Command, such differences in bonuses offered by the Army\u2019s three  components resulted in a divergence in the average dollar amount of  bonus per enlistee in fiscal year 2008. As table 5 shows, bonuses ranged  from $18,304 for an active-duty enlistee to $36,966 for an enlistee in the  National Guard\u2019s Active First Program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Fallen Short of Its Quality Goals and Has Taken Steps to Expand Its Recruiting Market", "paragraphs": ["The Army components have not consistently met their quality goals for the  percentage of new recruits who have high-school diplomas and who  score in the upper half on the AFQT.

The Army  currently estimates that of the approximately 32 million young people in  the United States aged 17 to 24, only 9.7 million (or approximately 3 out of  10) are qualified without requiring a waiver for medical conditions,  conduct issues, or administrative reasons such as the number of  dependents. However, the Army emphasizes that some of these fall into a  category subject to a DOD percentage cap restriction for enlistment  because they have AFQT percentile scores below 31 or lack high-school  diplomas. Therefore, the Army estimates that only about 2 out of 10, or  6.2 million, can be considered fully qualified and eligible to enlist at any  given time (see fig. 5). Each year, the Army tries to recruit approximately  176,000 of these individuals, meaning that the Army needs almost   3 percent of this population to enlist.", "Individuals fall outside of the Army\u2019s target market for recruiting for a  variety of reasons, including physical factors (such as body fat) or  educational factors (such as not having a high-school diploma). To help  meet its recruiting goals, however, the Army has targeted its efforts to  some individuals who do not fully meet its entrance criteria, especially  those who are over the body fat limit, do not possess high-school  diplomas, or are ages 41 and 42 but fully qualified otherwise.", "The Army has implemented four initiatives to expand its recruiting  market. One of these focuses on overweight individuals. The Army has  traditionally rejected individuals whose body fat exceeds a prescribed  limit, but it has now begun to admit individuals who, although their body  fat exceeds the limit, have other characteristics that have been found to be  predictors of success in the Army. To screen for these characteristics, the  Army has developed an Assessment of Recruit Motivation and Strength  test, which assesses an individual\u2019s physical fitness and motivation and  identifies promising individuals who would otherwise have been denied  entry. The Army has also implemented a second and third program to  target individuals without high-school diplomas. In 2005, the Army  implemented a Tier Two Attrition Screen, used to screen individuals  without high-school diplomas for characteristics such as motivation and  mental and physical fitness\u2014indicators linked to relatively low rates of  attrition. In addition to the Tier Two Attrition Screen, the Army  Preparatory School was opened in August 2008 to help promising  individuals without high-school diplomas earn General Educational  Development (GED) certificates in 4 weeks and to prepare them for basic  training. The school is open to youth without high-school diplomas who  have scored in the upper half on the AFQT, who need no other waivers,  and who have passed the Tier Two Attrition Screen. The Army also  implemented a fourth initiative to expand the recruiting market by  increasing the maximum recruitment age from 40 to 42. According to the  Army, individuals in this category often bring a range of experiences that  can benefit both the Army and their fellow soldiers. This expansion of the  pool provides a larger segment of the population with a chance to serve.", "As table 7 shows, the active Army and the Army Reserve have accessed  several thousand recruits through these initiatives to expand its recruiting  market. However, many of the recruits who entered through these  programs have not yet completed their first enlistment terms, and the  Army is still evaluating each program\u2019s long-term impact and effectiveness.", "The Army has accessed nearly 1,000 recruits in fiscal year 2008 as a result  of the Assessment of Recruit Motivation and Strength program, and the  Army Reserve has accessed 366. Initial findings from this program indicate  that females who exceeded the body fat standards but were allowed to  enlist as a result of passing the Assessment of Recruit Motivation and  Strength test had attrition rates similar to those of fully qualified females;  attrition among males who exceeded the body fat standards but passed the  test was slightly higher compared to the attrition of fully qualified males.  However, these recruits had not completed their terms of enlistment at the  time of the study, and the Army plans to conduct analyses with a larger  number of subjects in the future. In fiscal year 2008, the Army accessed  6,580 soldiers for the active Army and nearly 1,000 for the Army Reserve  through the Tier Two Attrition Screen, and initial program evaluation  results show that these recruits had attrition rates higher than those with  high-school diplomas but lower than those with GEDs. However, because  this initiative was first implemented in 2005, the Army has not yet gathered  sufficient data to prove the long-term success of this program in predicting  recruits\u2019 attrition behavior. From August 2008, when the Army Preparatory  School first opened, to the end of fiscal year 2008, the Army also reported  graduating and accessing 362 new recruits in the active Army and 41 new  recruits in the Army Reserve entering through this program, but  performance in the long term has yet to be assessed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Continued to Grant Conduct Waivers for New Recruits and Analyzes the Outcomes of Recruits Entering with Conduct Waivers", "paragraphs": ["The Army has continued to grant conduct waivers to recruits who do not  meet some of the Army\u2019s entrance standards for reasons such as prior  criminal misconduct.

An Army official told us that the  Army\u2019s own analyses and the work undertaken by RAND provide a  comprehensive view of the Army\u2019s waiver policies and a mechanism for  identifying the need for any changes. According to Army officials, the  administrative cost of the waiver review process is \u201cnegligible.\u201d They  added that the primary cost metric used to measure the return on  investment for enlistees with waivers is comparing the attrition rates of  those with waivers to the rates of those without waivers. They stated that  in 2006, the Army found that there were no significant differences in  attrition rates between these two groups. However, Army officials also  acknowledge that the findings regarding the performance of those with  and without conduct waivers are \u201cmixed.\u201d As stated earlier, the Army has  found evidence that some enlistees who entered the Army in fiscal year  2007 were more likely to be separated early for adverse reasons. Because  the waiver process involves several different administrative layers, the  cost of this process may be found to be more than originally estimated.  Also, because research results on the performance of enlistees with and  without conduct waivers are not definitive, the issue of whether granting  these waivers is cost-effective is not yet clear. Completed and planned  work on waivers does not consider the costs associated with the Army\u2019s  separation of soldiers who were granted conduct waivers and were later  separated early for adverse reasons. Studying these issues is important,  given that the recruiting and training of individuals involves substantial  expenditures on the part of the Army.

In order to fill immediate needs for  captains, the Army offered a \u201cmenu of incentives\u201d to 23,053 captains in  branches with fill rates below 90 percent who began service as officers  between 1999 and 2005. From September 2007 until March 2008\u2014phase  one of this program\u2014the Army offered these captains a choice of five  incentives in return for taking on extended service obligations: (1) a cash  bonus of up to $35,000; (2) a graduate education; (3) a choice of branch;  (4) a choice of location; or (5) military school. In phase two, from April  2008 until November 2008, the Army did not offer captains the choice of  branch or choice of location, and it limited the military school option to  language training. Captains were offered these incentives in exchange for  committing to at least 3 additional years of active-duty service. Of the  15,317 captains who accepted one of these incentives, 94.6 percent chose  the cash bonus (see table 8). According to the most recent Army estimate,  the cash bonus has cost the Army $443.5 million; based on that estimate,  the average bonus was $30,488.", "Although 15,317 captains have taken advantage of one of these incentives,  the Army did not collect data that would allow it to determine the most  cost-effective amount for the cash bonus. Also, despite the requirement to  use less costly measures first, the Army did not determine whether  offering less costly measures\u2014for example, offering the menu of  incentives without the cash bonus option or the choice of graduate  school\u2014would have similar results. Before selecting this incentive  package, the Army contracted with Chadwick, Martin, and Bailey in 2006  to explore different options. The contractor conducted an online  questionnaire involving about 2,000 officers who had entered the Army in  2003, 2004, and 2005.

Because the Army did not use such data to determine which incentives  would be most cost-effective, it cannot provide evidence that its policy is  in line with DOD Directive 1304.21. Without such data, the Army cannot  determine how best to allocate the money it spends on incentives to  achieve maximum effect.", "The Army has also attempted to alleviate what it expects to be a future  demand for captains and majors by offering a precommissioning incentive  to cadets at the United States Military Academy and in the Reserve Officer  Training Corps. Under this incentive program, in return for a commitment  to at least 3 additional years of service, cadets are offered (1) a chance to  attend graduate school, (2) a choice of branch, or (3) a choice of location.  This program did not include the option of a cash bonus but did offer  cadets a graduate school education, which the Chadwick, Martin, and  Bailey study had estimated would cost $165,000 per person, the most  expensive of the incentives examined. When cadets are first  commissioned, they are obligated to serve 3 to 5 years, depending on  whether they were accessed through the Military Academy, the Reserve  Officer Training Corps, or the Officer Candidate Schools. By adding   3 years to their initial obligations, officers who participate in this program  will be required to stay in the Army until they have been captains for  several years. Some, particularly if they choose the graduate school  option, will become majors before completing their service obligations.  Army officials have stated that participation in this precommissioning  program to date has been promising; they believe the program will  significantly increase the retention of officers at the rank of captain and  beyond and close the future gap without the need for additional retention  incentives for officers.

House Report  96-1462 on the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act describes the  complexity of the promotion system and emphasizes that any change to  one variable affects the others. The report concludes that in order to  maintain a high-quality officer corps, changes to the system must be made  very carefully. While the Army provided data regarding the quality of  officers at the time of their accession\u2014such as a bachelor\u2019s degree or  Scholastic Aptitude Test score\u2014the Army had no data that could  demonstrate whether the performance of its officers had changed over  time or whether actions it had taken, such as promoting at higher rates,  would have an effect on the officer corps in the future.", "Since 1992, in order to meet the increased demand for officers, the Army  has dramatically increased its promotion rates for officers, exceeding the  benchmarks set forth in 1980 in Senate Report No. 96-375, which  accompanied the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. In order to  maintain the rank structure outlined in the act and simultaneously provide  officers with rewarding career tracks, the established promotion rates  (which are lower as officers proceed up the ranks)\u2014as well as the   \u201cup-or-out\u201d system\u2014guide the Army in promoting the best-qualified  officers to higher ranks, with the understanding that some fully qualified  officers will not be promoted. The Secretary of the Army issues guidance  defining what the Army considers to be important experience, and the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel determines which officers are to be  considered for promotion. The Army promotes only officers who have  been determined by promotion boards to be fully qualified to serve at the  next higher rank.", "The Army expects to continue this practice of promoting officers at  certain ranks at rates higher than recommended benchmarks through  fiscal year 2010. Figure 8 shows comparisons between promotion rates  established in Senate Report No. 96-375 and the Army\u2019s actual or expected  promotion rates in fiscal years 2004-2010 for captains, majors, lieutenant  colonels, and colonels.", "While promoting at these high rates, the Army has reduced the time that it  requires officers to remain at certain ranks before they are promoted. For  example, as of November 2008, the Army was promoting officers to the  rank of captain after they had served 3 years and 2 months as lieutenants,  while the other services were promoting officers to captain or the  equivalent rank only after they had served for 4 or more years. Likewise,  as of November 2008, the Army had reduced its time-in-service  requirement for promotion to major to 9 years of service, while the other  services were requiring between 9 years, 8 months; and 10 years, 2 months  of service. While shortening its time-in-service requirements for promotion  to captain, the Under Secretary of Defense suspended the requirement that  first lieutenants serve 2 years before being promoted to captain,  shortening the requirement to 18 months. For all other promotions, the  Army\u2019s requirements are within those established in Title 10 of the United  States Code, which call for officers to serve 18 months as second  lieutenants and 3 years at the rank of captain, major, and lieutenant  colonel before being considered for promotion.", "In addition to reductions in the standard time-in-service requirements for  promotion, early promotions for majors and lieutenant colonels are on the  rise. Early promotions are given to officers who, although they have less  time in service than the officers identified to be considered for promotion  in a particular year, are judged to be clearly better choices for promotion.  Early promotions do not increase the number of officers promoted; rather,  the Army draws from officers having 1 fewer year of experience to select  candidates for promotion. From fiscal years 2006 through 2008, early  promotions to major rose from 7.5 percent to 12.5 percent. Likewise, from  fiscal years 2006 through 2008, early promotions to lieutenant colonel rose  from 7.4 percent to 14.8 percent. The Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act requires authorization by the Deputy Secretary of  Defense if early promotions account for over 10 percent of promotions,  and the Army has acquired this authorization. The act also requires that  early promotions not exceed 15 percent of all promotions, and the Army  has stayed within this benchmark. Early promotions to lieutenant colonel  are moving more majors up the ranks faster. However, although this helps  to prevent shortages of lieutenant colonels, it exacerbates the shortage of  majors.", "As House Report 96-1462 stated, officer management is a complex system,  and any changes must be made carefully. While the Army moves away  from the legislative benchmarks and changes previous standards to meet  the current demands for officers, it has not yet assessed the long-term  effect of these actions on the officer corps.

However, its expenditures for bonuses and  incentives have not been as effectively targeted as they could be.

For example, although its expenditures for enlistment and reenlistment  bonuses have grown by about 75 percent, the Army does not know  whether these bonuses are set at amounts that are sufficient to meet its  enlistment and reenlistment goals and at the same time do not result in  excessive payments to achieve these results. Initial results of the effect of  admitting individuals who do not meet the Army\u2019s standard eligibility  requirements appear positive, and the Army has begun efforts to analyze  the performance outcomes of recruits with conduct waivers. While the  studies conducted by the Army, including the one it has contracted out to  RAND, may provide useful information on the performance of those  admitted with conduct waivers during a certain period of time, it will be  important for the Army to continue monitoring this population closely,  including assessing the cost-effectiveness of investing in those who require  conduct waivers in order to determine whether it is making prudent use of  its valuable resources in recruiting and training these individuals and  whether any modifications to its waiver policies are needed. This is  especially the case given that, even though data show that recruits with  conduct waivers are strong performers, other evidence indicates that they  are more likely to exhibit disciplinary problems and to be separated for  adverse reasons than those who do not need conduct waivers.", "Faced with a wartime environment, restructuring efforts that result in the  need for additional officers, and a system for developing leaders that  requires years of forward planning, the Army has been required to  promote officers at a much faster rate than it has in the past and to offer  new incentives to retain officers. While there is no easy solution to the  shortage of midlevel officers, there are trade-offs involved with each  action to alleviate the shortage. Without using research that will allow the  Army to assess the cost-effectiveness of its new incentives and the metrics  to identify trends to help shape the force appropriately, the Army will not  be in a position to make informed decisions about the choices it makes  and the risks it assumes as it manages the future officer force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to take the following four actions:    To enhance its existing processes to recruit and retain sufficient numbers  of enlisted personnel and to avoid making excessive payments to achieve  desired results, build on currently available analyses that will enable the  Army to set cost-effective enlistment and reenlistment bonuses.", "To enable the most efficient use of recruiting resources, collect data on  the cost-effectiveness of the Army\u2019s conduct waiver polices\u2014including  costs associated with the waiver review and approval process and with  future separations of soldiers with conduct waivers for adverse reasons\u2014 and use these data to inform the Army\u2019s waiver policies.", "Should the Army decide to offer incentives to officers in the future, build  on currently available analyses that will enable the Army, with the  direction and assistance of the Secretary of Defense, to set cost-effective  bonus amounts and other incentives.", "To enable the Army to make informed decisions regarding the  management of its officer corps over time, track\u2014and if necessary  correct\u2014any effects that its actions to alleviate shortages may have on the  officer corps, particularly in cases in which the Army has deviated from  benchmarks established in the Defense Officer Personnel Management  Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of Defense with a draft of this report for  review and comment.

Regarding our recommendation that the Army collect and use  data on the cost-effectiveness of its waiver policies, DOD stated that the  Army Audit Agency had begun an audit in February 2009 of the Army  components\u2019 granting of enlistment waivers. In response to our  recommendation that the Army consider the cost-effectiveness of any  future incentives offered to its officer corps, DOD concurred, stating that  DOD requires the military services to provide a detailed business case  before it grants the services the authority to employ a retention bonus. In  response to our recommendation that the Army track the effects of its  short-term actions to alleviate shortages on its officer corps, DOD partially  concurred, stating that the DOPMA guidelines are not intended to serve as  fixed mandates. We agree and state this in our report.

Specifically, we reviewed the  Army\u2019s original and accelerated Grow the Force plans to identify proposed  end strength numbers for each fiscal year of the plans. For the original  plan, this included fiscal years 2007 through 2013; for the accelerated plan,  this included fiscal years 2007 through 2010. We obtained information  from the Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs on the  actual end strength that the Army had achieved in fiscal years 2007 and  2008 and compared the proposed end strength to the actual end strength  achieved. Further, to describe the extent to which the active Army, the  Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve have met their target  recruiting and retention goals for fiscal years 2005 through 2008, we  obtained data on these metrics from the Office of the Undersecretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness.", "To determine the extent to which the Army is directing the growth in its  enlisted force to areas of most critical need, we obtained data from the  Army\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial  Management and Comptroller, on how much the components spent on  enlistment and reenlistment bonuses given to Army recruits and soldiers  for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. To determine how the Army identifies  priority occupational specialties and which ones should be awarded  bonuses, we interviewed officials from the U.S. Army Human Resources  Command; the U.S. Army Recruiting Command; and the Army\u2019s Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Enlisted Career Systems Division.  We also observed two working sessions of the Enlisted Incentives Review  Board. We reviewed data provided by the members of that Board, as well  as other documents showing fill rates, recruiting goals, and bonus levels  for the various enlisted occupational specialties.", "To determine the extent to which the Army is maintaining the quality of its  enlisted force, we obtained and reviewed data describing the extent to  which the active Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve  had met DOD\u2019s quality benchmarks for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. We  also reviewed the estimates made by the Army and others to determine the  size of the target recruiting market and discussed the Army\u2019s methodology  in applying the conclusions reached with knowledgeable Army officials.  We also obtained data on active Army and Army Reserve programs to  expand the youth target market population from the U.S. Army Recruiting  Command. Additionally, we obtained information on the numbers and  types of enlistment waivers granted by the active Army, the Army Reserve,  and the Army National Guard in fiscal years 2005 through 2008. Types of  enlistment waivers include conduct waivers, drug and alcohol waivers,  administrative waivers, and medical waivers. The U.S. Army Recruiting  Command provided data on waivers granted to recruits enlisting into the  active Army and the Army Reserve. The National Guard Bureau provided  data on waivers granted to recruits enlisting into the Army National Guard.  However, the U.S. Army Accessions Command holds responsibility for  maintaining these data for all components, and waiver information stored  in the U.S. Army Accessions Command\u2019s database originates and is  entered at Military Entrance Processing Stations. After interviewing  relevant officials from the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, we determined  that the waiver data from fiscal years 2005 through 2007 had limitations  that precluded us from presenting these data in our report. Among the  problems cited by officials were the data system\u2019s failure to capture all  waivers for recruits with multiple waivers, the overcounting of other  waivers, and the miscoding of some misdemeanors as felonies. We  determined that the Army had adequately addressed these problems for  the fiscal year 2008 waiver data, and we found this year\u2019s data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. To obtain information  on the performance of recruits with and without enlistment waivers, we  (1) reviewed the Army\u2019s 2007 and 2008 studies of the performance of the  conduct waiver population and obtained additional information about  these studies\u2019 findings and methodology through interviews with relevant  Army officials and (2) reviewed RAND\u2019s 2008 study of the performance of  recruits with waivers and obtained additional information on RAND\u2019s  ongoing and planned efforts in the area of conduct waivers from relevant  RAND and Army officials. We also reviewed DOD and Army policies  pertaining to enlistment waivers\u2014 specifically the Office of the  Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness\u2019 June 2008  Directive-Type Memorandum 08-018 on enlistment waivers and Army  Regulation 601-210, \u201cPersonnel Procurement: Active and Reserve  Components Enlistment Program\u201d (June 7, 2007).", "To assess the extent to which the Army is directing the growth in its  officer force to areas of need and the extent to which it has determined  whether short-term tradeoffs to alleviate shortages will have long-term  effects on its officer corps, we analyzed various data related to officer  demand, strength levels, promotions, and retention. We reviewed the  Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980, Senate Report   No. 96-375, House Report No. 96-1462, and corresponding provisions of  Title 10 of the U.S. Code in order to ascertain legislated benchmarks for  officer strength, promotion rates, and options available to the Army to  address shortages. We obtained data on officer authorizations and strength  levels, as well as information on programs to address officer shortages  from the Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. We  compared authorizations and strength levels to identify shortages in  specific ranks and specific branches. We analyzed existing and projected  trends in officer demand and supply for fiscal years 2003-13. We reviewed  documentation and reports on incentive programs for captains and cadets  prior to their commissioning. Additionally, we talked to Army officials  about their intent behind these programs. Furthermore, we received  information on actual promotion rates from the Army\u2019s Office of the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, which we compared to the promotion  benchmarks in Senate Report No. 96-375.", "The data we reviewed for each of our research objectives generally  covered fiscal years 2005 through 2008; however, our analysis of  enlistment waivers was limited to fiscal year 2008 due to limitations in  waiver data from previous years, such as the system\u2019s failure to capture  some waivers and the overcounting of other waivers.

Specifically, 1,048 recruits with felony waivers entered the  active Army in fiscal year 2008 (or less than 2 percent of overall  accessions). The number of recruits entering the Army Reserve and the  Army National Guard with felony waivers in fiscal year 2008 stood at 196  and 128, respectively, or less than 1 percent of these components\u2019 overall  accessions for that year. While the Army grants felony waivers in some  cases, officials said that the Army does not admit serious criminals who  may pose harm to others and to the Army\u2019s larger mission. According to  Army documents, the Army does not consider applicants convicted of the  most serious felonies, such as murder, sexually violent crimes, domestic  violence, and drug dealing, as well as alcoholism and drug dependency.  The Army also excludes individuals on probation or parole, in  confinement, awaiting criminal charges, and ordered to enter the military  in lieu of (or as a result of) being prosecuted.", "Army officials said that the Army\u2019s waiver approval process is designed so  that only the most deserving candidates are awarded waivers. In assessing  an individual for a conduct waiver, the Army uses the \u201cwhole person  concept,\u201d considering factors such as employment stability, success in  school, accomplishments in the community, references from others in the  community who have come to know the applicant, and signs of remorse  and changed behavior since the incident occurred. The process involves a  series of steps and multiple layers of review. Each individual\u2019s waiver  request is typically reviewed at 6 different levels for misdemeanors and  traffic offenses and at 10 different levels for felonies. All felony waivers  and certain serious misdemeanor waivers must be approved at the level of  the Deputy Commanding General of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command  for active Army and Army Reserve recruits and at the level of the Director  of the Army National Guard for Army National Guard recruits.", "The Army reported that the top five offenses that receive felony waivers  are burglary, narcotics and drug charges, aggravated assault, larceny, and  unlawful breaking or entering.
