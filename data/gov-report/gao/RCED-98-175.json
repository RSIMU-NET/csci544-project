Under the amendments, these states were required to have their programs implemented by November 1992. However, in November 1992, despite this requirement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a regulation that postponed the required implementation date until January 1995. I&M programs test vehicles\u2019 emissions to ensure that the vehicles are adequately maintained and working properly. If the vehicles pass these tests, they are assumed not to be emitting excessive amounts of VOCs and carbon monoxide.", "Because of concerns about the implementation of the enhanced I&M programs, you asked us to determine the status of the states\u2019 programs.

In order to address these issues, we used a mail survey to obtain information from the 23 states. (App. I presents the survey we used.)

Areas that exceeded the national ozone standard were classified as \u201cnonattainment areas,\u201d and according to the severity of their ozone problems, states were given future dates ranging from 3 to 20 years to attain the ozone standard. Title I required most ozone nonattainment areas to develop plans for EPA\u2019s approval that showed which control measures they would need to achieve a 15-percent reduction in VOC emissions by November 1996. Furthermore, the states with serious to extreme nonattainment areas were required to prepare plans showing how they would achieve additional VOC reductions beyond 1996.", "Enhanced I&M programs are designed to measure the pollution that vehicles release when they are operated under simulated driving conditions. EPA issued an enhanced I&M regulation in November 1992 that required the states to meet or exceed a stated performance standard based on a model program that included IM-240 testing equipment. Although the amendments required the states to implement their enhanced I&M programs by November 1992, EPA\u2019s regulation postponed the required start date to January 1995 and required full implementation of the program by January 1996. Appendix II describes the statutory and regulatory requirements for the enhanced I&M program.", "In August 1996, EPA recognized that the states\u2019 delays in implementing their enhanced I&M programs would prevent many of them from achieving the 15-percent reduction in VOC emissions. Subsequently, in February 1997, EPA issued guidance to allow the states that revised their enhanced I&M programs under the September 1995 revised enhanced I&M regulation or the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-59, Nov. 28, 1995) to have more flexibility in developing and implementing their programs. In order for the states to operate under the relaxed requirement, they had to demonstrate that their 15-percent reduction in VOC emissions would be achieved as soon as possible after November 1996, but no later than November 1999. The guidance allowed states to resubmit their VOC reduction plans to show that they would achieve the required reductions from the implementation of their enhanced I&M programs by November 1999.

In total, 12 states had begun testing vehicles under enhanced I&M programs by April 1998. A number of factors account for the delays in implementing enhanced I&M programs, including opposition to the stringent requirements of EPA\u2019s enhanced I&M regulation, the reluctance of some state legislatures to provide authority and funding for the programs, and difficulties in obtaining test equipment and software support.", "The 12 states that are testing vehicles account for 43 percent of the 52 million vehicles subject to the enhanced I&M testing. Furthermore, several of the other 11 states are scheduled to start testing vehicles within the next few months.

The 1992 regulation required all enhanced I&M programs to meet or exceed a performance standard based on a model program that used computer-controlled test equipment and centralized \u201ctest-only\u201d inspection centers. Some states believed that centralized programs resulted in fewer inspection centers, often making the testing programs less convenient for vehicle owners and potentially resulting in longer delays than previous I&M programs. Furthermore, the states believed that consumers would be inconvenienced by the 1992 enhanced I&M regulation because of the test-only feature of the model program, which required the owner of any vehicle that failed the inspection to go elsewhere to have repairs made and to return to the same inspection center for retesting. While the 1992 enhanced I&M regulation permitted the states to implement decentralized programs that allowed inspection centers to test and then repair vehicles, EPA determined that these programs were less effective in identifying and repairing vehicles with excessive emissions.", "Because of the opposition to the stringency of the 1992 regulation, EPA issued a revised enhanced I&M regulation in September 1995, and the Congress enacted the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, which gave the states more flexibility to develop and implement their programs. For example, the revised regulation allowed the states to implement less stringent enhanced I&M programs if they could demonstrate emission reductions from other sources. The regulation also allowed the states more leeway in inspecting and repairing failed vehicles. Eight of the 23 states took advantage of the flexibility allowed by the revised regulation by implementing less stringent enhanced programs. Additionally, the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995\u2014which prohibited EPA from requiring the states to have centralized IM-240 enhanced I&M programs\u2014allowed the states to revise their programs to include decentralized testing and provided an 18-month interim approval period for them to demonstrate that their revised programs could achieve the needed emissions reductions. Eight of the 23 states have implemented or plan to implement the more flexible enhanced I&M programs under the act.", "Even though the revised enhanced I&M regulation and the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 allowed more flexibility, nine states indicated in response to our survey that difficulties in obtaining legislative authority delayed the implementation of their enhanced I&M programs. For example, Massachusetts had planned to start inspecting vehicles under an enhanced I&M program in July 1997. However, as of November 1997, the date to which Massachusetts had committed to begin program operations, the state legislature had not enacted the needed legal authority for an enhanced I&M program, and vehicle testing had not begun. In December 1997, EPA notified Massachusetts that its enhanced I&M program was disapproved. Currently, Massachusetts is planning to begin testing vehicles in May 1999. Similarly, the Maryland legislature attempted to make the enhanced I&M program voluntary instead of mandatory, as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and this attempt delayed the implementation of the state\u2019s program. However, the governor\u2019s veto of this legislation paved the way for Maryland to start testing vehicles under its enhanced I&M program in the fall of 1997.", "In response to our survey, 13 states indicated that they have experienced problems with obtaining needed testing equipment or software support from vendors, which have delayed the implementation of their programs. These problems were especially apparent in late 1997 and early 1998, when several states were scheduled to start testing vehicles. According to EPA officials, only a limited number of vendors supply the testing equipment and the computer software needed for enhanced I&M inspection centers. With the high demand for the equipment in recent months, vendors have been unable to fill all orders. For example, Georgia had planned to have 300 inspection centers operating under an enhanced I&M program by July 1997. However, because of the vendor\u2019s problem with delivering the equipment and providing software support, Georgia now plans to start testing vehicles in July 1998\u2014a year later than originally planned.", "Overall, our survey of the 23 states identified a number of factors that delayed the states\u2019 efforts to implement enhanced I&M programs. These included opposition to the stringent requirements of EPA\u2019s initial program, difficulties in obtaining testing equipment, delays by EPA in issuing the initial regulation, difficulties in obtaining authority from state legislatures, and difficulties in certifying inspection centers and technicians.

Furthermore, seven said that they tried to educate the general public to a great or very great extent about the frequency of testing, the costs of tests, testing locations, and other pertinent information about the program. Seven states also said that they tried to educate the general public to a great or very great extent about the reasons for implementing enhanced I&M programs.", "For example, in implementing an enhanced I&M program, Georgia contracted with an advertising agency to develop and disseminate information through television and radio spots and distributed printed materials through community groups and organizations. A recent survey of the effectiveness of Georgia\u2019s public information campaign for its I&M program showed that consumers believe that cars are the largest contributing factor to air pollution. The study also showed that 88 percent of Georgia\u2019s consumers were aware of the current I&M program, and 76 percent believed that the program was doing a good job.", "In contrast, Maine initially tried to implement an enhanced I&M program in 1994 with little or no public relations efforts. After very strong public opposition to the program, the governor cancelled it. According to EPA, the opposition to the program was caused, in part, by the perception that the enhanced I&M program was being implemented as an alternative to imposing control measures on certain stationary sources. As of April 1998, Maine\u2019s enhanced I&M program had been disapproved because the state\u2019s revised plan for it did not meet all of EPA\u2019s requirements. Even though some states have been more successful than others in overcoming public opposition and other obstacles to implementing their enhanced I&M programs, EPA has made only a limited effort to identify the practices these successful states have used and to share them with other states that are in the early stages of developing and implementing their programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Delays in Implementing Enhanced I&M Programs Have Slowed Efforts to Reduce Ozone Levels", "paragraphs": ["Because of delays in implementing enhanced I&M programs, 19 of the 23 states are in jeopardy of not meeting deadlines for attaining the national ozone standard. The 19 states are relying on the enhanced I&M programs to reduce VOC emissions. In August 1996, EPA recognized that the states could not achieve a significant portion of their 15-percent VOC reductions by November 1996 because of delays in implementing enhanced I&M programs. It therefore examined other available control measures for reducing VOC emissions. EPA required the states to demonstrate in their VOC reduction plans that enhanced I&M programs were the most practical way for them to achieve the 15-percent reduction in VOC emissions. EPA then allowed the states to revise their enhanced I&M programs to claim credit for the emissions reductions that are based on the future implementation of their programs, provided they demonstrated that the required VOC reductions would be achieved as soon as possible after November 1996 but no later than November 1999. EPA also allowed the states to resubmit their VOC reduction plans to show that they would achieve the required VOC reductions from implementing their enhanced I&M programs by November 1999.

According to EPA, the states that had not implemented their enhanced I&M programs as of November 1997 may be unable to demonstrate how they will achieve required VOC reductions, and are at risk of having their VOC reduction plans disapproved because of the anticipated shortfall in VOC reductions. For example:", "EPA\u2019s conditional interim approval of New Jersey\u2019s enhanced I&M program, which accounts for 26 percent of the state\u2019s planned reductions in VOC emissions, required the program to begin by November 15, 1997, in order for all vehicles to be tested by November 1999 and for the state to receive full credit for the VOC reductions from the program. New Jersey officials advised EPA that they would not select a contractor to operate the program until April 1998. In December 1997, EPA notified New Jersey that its 15-percent reduction plan was disapproved because the state failed to meet the required November 1997 start date for its enhanced I&M program. According to a New Jersey official, it is unclear how the state will make up the shortfall in VOC reductions caused by its failure to implement an enhanced I&M program.", "The District of Columbia is required to reduce VOC emissions by 133 tons per day to attain the ozone standard by November 1999. Even though the District is relying heavily upon its enhanced I&M program to provide 48 percent of the overall VOC reductions, it does not plan to start inspecting vehicles under an enhanced I&M program until April 1999. While control measures are available to the District for reducing VOC emissions from other mobile and stationary sources, many of these measures have already been implemented, and, according to EPA officials, imposing further controls on these sources will not produce the reductions that the District is expecting to achieve with an enhanced I&M program.", "Many of the states that are required to implement enhanced I&M programs must achieve the required VOC reductions by November 1999 but still do not have final approval for their VOC reduction plans. Table 1 shows the approval status of the states\u2019 VOC reduction plans as of April 1998.", "Even though most of the states are planning to have their enhanced I&M programs account for a significant amount of the required reductions in VOC emissions, EPA and the states will not know how much of the needed VOC reductions will be met by enhanced I&M programs until each program is fully approved and operational. Thus, further delays by the states in implementing enhanced I&M programs jeopardize their efforts to achieve the required VOC reductions.", "While the states can use mobile and stationary sources in conjunction with the mandated enhanced I&M programs to attain the ozone standard these sources, especially stationary sources, have already made significant reductions in their VOC emissions, and, according to EPA, further reductions from them will be costly and take some time to achieve. In 1992, EPA estimated that the cost to reduce VOC emissions with an enhanced I&M program was $879 per ton compared with $5,000 per ton from stationary sources. According to EPA officials, with the less stringent requirements of many of the current programs, the cost per ton of VOC reductions from the enhanced I&M programs is probably higher, but not as high as further reductions from other mobile sources or stationary sources.

Therefore, states will have to look to other mobile sources as well as stationary sources to meet their goals for reducing VOC emissions.
