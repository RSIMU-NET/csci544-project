However, program outcomes do not measure the success of strategies  intended to prevent or minimize fraud and abuse such as systems for  preauthorization or precertification. OPM officials reported that although  they are concerned about program outcomes that reflect the past, they  place emphasis on ensuring that carriers have preventive antifraud  strategies, such as prepayment controls (including system edits,  preauthorizations, and precertifications), in place to prevent future  occurrences of fraud and abuse. OPM contracting office staff also collect  information about how carriers assess their antifraud activities, in part to  determine whether carriers routinely assess their own antifraud programs.", "OPM contracting office staff reported that they have not adopted specific  measures of program effectiveness for FEHBP fraud and abuse programs  because they have not identified an appropriate way to measure the  effectiveness of antifraud programs. Several factors contribute to  difficulties in developing a measure of the effectiveness for health care  antifraud programs. These factors include the following:", "A lack of information about the baseline amount of fraud and abuse in  health care. We have previously reported that there is no reliable  baseline estimate of the amount of health care fraud in the United  States. Similarly, officials from OPM\u2019s contracting office told us that  they cannot estimate the amount of fraud within FEHBP. A baseline  estimate could provide an understanding of the extent of fraud and,  with additional information on fraud and abuse program activities,  could help to clarify the effectiveness of antifraud program activities.", "The difficulty of establishing a causal link between antifraud activities  and the amount of health care fraud or abuse. Although the efforts of  federal agencies and nongovernment entities may help to reduce  health care fraud, it is difficult to isolate the effect of any individual  action or to clearly establish that any change in the amount of fraud  was due to any specific cause. Thus, for example, a carrier\u2019s  implementation of a specific fraud detection strategy may deter certain  types of fraud, but a reduction in those types of fraud could also have  been due to other causes, such as changes in laws or in prosecutorial  practice.", "The difficulty of measuring the effect of efforts to prevent or deter  fraud and abuse. Officials from OPM\u2019s contracting office reported that  they believe that FEHBP fraud and abuse program requirements and  their oversight of these programs have helped to limit the amount of  fraud in FEHBP. Officials and industry experts said, however, that it is  difficult to measure how much fraud or abuse is deterred or  prevented. For example, FEHBP carriers may place restrictions on  their provider networks to prevent individuals who are intent on fraud  from enrolling as providers, but it is difficult to measure the amount of  fraud or abuse that was prevented as a result of such restrictions.", "Despite the challenges involved in assessing the effectiveness of  antifraud activities, OPM officials acknowledged the importance of  ensuring the prevention, detection, and correction of fraud and abuse  within the FEHBP. Others in the health care sector also acknowledge the  importance of measuring the effectiveness of antifraud activities and are  working to develop appropriate measures. For example, CMS recently  began an effort to estimate probable fraud involving specific home health  care services in Medicare that could provide information on the extent of  fraud that currently exists and, in coming years, how it has changed over  time. Establishing a baseline may make it feasible to study how antifraud  activities affect the level of home health care fraud. In addition, OPM told  us that they are continuing to monitor public and private sector efforts to  develop measures of the effectiveness of antifraud activities. If reliable  and valid measures of the effectiveness of antifraud programs are  identified, it will be important for OPM to determine whether those  measures are appropriate for the FEHBP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["OPM and the OPM OIG reviewed a draft of this report and provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
