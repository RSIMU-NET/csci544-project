Sales grew rapidly, and by 2001 OxyContin had become the most prescribed brandname narcotic medication for treating moderate-to-severe pain. In early 2000, reports began to surface about abuse and diversion for illicit use of OxyContin, which contains the opioid oxycodone. GAO was asked to examine concerns about these issues. Specifically, GAO reviewed (1) how OxyContin was marketed and promoted, (2) what factors contributed to the abuse and diversion of OxyContin, and (3) what actions have been taken to address OxyContin abuse and diversion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Purdue conducted an extensive campaign to market and promote OxyContin using an expanded sales force to encourage physicians, including primary care specialists, to prescribe OxyContin not only for cancer pain but also as an initial opioid treatment for moderate-to-severe noncancer pain. OxyContin prescriptions, particularly those for noncancer pain, grew rapidly, and by 2003 nearly half of all OxyContin prescribers were primary care physicians. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has expressed concern that Purdue's aggressive marketing of OxyContin focused on promoting the drug to treat a wide range of conditions to physicians who may not have been adequately trained in pain management. FDA has taken two actions against Purdue for OxyContin advertising violations. Further, Purdue did not submit an OxyContin promotional video for FDA review upon its initial use in 1998, as required by FDA regulations. Several factors may have contributed to the abuse and diversion of OxyContin. The active ingredient in OxyContin is twice as potent as morphine, which may have made it an attractive target for misuse. Further, the original label's safety warning advising patients not to crush the tablets because of the possible rapid release of a potentially toxic amount of oxycodone may have inadvertently alerted abusers to methods for abuse. Moreover, the significant increase in OxyContin's availability in the marketplace may have increased opportunities to obtain the drug illicitly in some states. Finally, the history of abuse and diversion of prescription drugs, including opioids, in some states may have predisposed certain areas to problems with OxyContin. However, GAO could not assess the relationship between the increased availability of OxyContin and locations of abuse and diversion because the data on abuse and diversion are not reliable, comprehensive, or timely. Federal and state agencies and Purdue have taken actions to address the abuse and diversion of OxyContin. FDA approved a stronger safety warning on OxyContin's label. In addition, FDA and Purdue collaborated on a risk management plan to help detect and prevent OxyContin abuse and diversion, an approach that was not used at the time OxyContin was approved. FDA plans to provide guidance to the pharmaceutical industry by September 2004 on risk management plans, which are an optional feature of new drug applications. DEA has established a national action plan to prevent abuse and diversion of OxyContin. State agencies have investigated reports of abuse and diversion. In addition to developing a risk management plan, Purdue has initiated several OxyContin-related educational programs, taken disciplinary action against sales representatives who improperly promoted OxyContin, and referred physicians suspected of improper prescribing practices to the authorities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Patients with cancer may suffer from fairly constant pain for months or  years. Patients with other diseases or conditions, such as rheumatoid  arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, or sickle cell anemia, may also  suffer from pain that lasts for extended periods of time. Since 1986, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and others have reported that the  inadequate treatment of cancer and noncancer pain is a serious public  health concern. To address this concern, efforts have been made to better  educate health care professionals on the need to improve the treatment of  both cancer and noncancer pain, including the appropriate role of  prescription drugs.", "Amid the heightened awareness that many people were suffering from  undertreated pain, in 1995 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved the new drug OxyContin, a controlled-release semisynthetic  opioid analgesic manufactured by Purdue Pharma L.P., for the treatment  of moderate-to-severe pain lasting more than a few days. According to  Purdue, OxyContin provides patients with continuous relief from pain  over a 12-hour period, reduces pain fluctuations, requires fewer daily  doses to help patients adhere to their prescribed regimen more easily,  allows them to sleep through the night, and allows a physician to increase  the OxyContin dose for a patient as needed to relieve pain. Sales of the  drug increased rapidly following its introduction to the marketplace in  1996. By 2001, sales had exceeded $1 billion annually, and OxyContin had  become the most frequently prescribed brand-name narcotic medication  for treating moderate-to-severe pain in the United States.", "In early 2000, media reports began to surface in several states that  OxyContin was being abused\u2014that is, used for nontherapeutic purposes  or for purposes other than those for which it was prescribed\u2014and illegally  diverted. According to FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA), the abuse of OxyContin is associated with serious consequences,  including addiction, overdose, and death. When OxyContin was approved,  the federal government classified it as a schedule II controlled substance  under the Controlled Substances Act because it has a high potential for  abuse and may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. DEA  has characterized the pharmacological effects of OxyContin, and its active  ingredient oxycodone, as similar to those of heroin. Media reports  indicated that abusers were crushing OxyContin tablets and snorting the  powder or dissolving it in water and injecting it to defeat the intended  controlled-release effect of the drug and attain a \u201crush\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d through  the body\u2019s rapid absorption of oxycodone. During a December 2001  congressional hearing, witnesses from DEA and other law enforcement  officials from Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia described the growing  problem of abuse and diversion of OxyContin. Questions were raised  about what factors may have caused the abuse and diversion, including  whether Purdue\u2019s efforts to market the drug may have contributed to the  problem. In February 2002, another congressional hearing was conducted  on federal, state, and local efforts to decrease the abuse and diversion of  OxyContin.", "Because of your concerns about these issues, you asked us to examine the  marketing and promotion of OxyContin and its abuse and diversion.  Specifically, we addressed the following questions:  1.  How has Purdue marketed and promoted OxyContin?  2.  What factors contributed to the abuse and diversion of OxyContin?  3.  What actions have been taken to address OxyContin abuse and  diversion?", "To identify how Purdue marketed and promoted OxyContin, we  interviewed Purdue officials and analyzed company documents and data.  We also interviewed selected Purdue sales representatives who were high  and midrange sales performers during 2001 and physicians who were  among the highest prescribers of OxyContin. To determine how Purdue\u2019s  marketing and promotion of OxyContin compared to that of other drugs,  we examined the promotional materials and information related to FDA  actions and interviewed officials from companies that manufacture and  market three other opioid drugs, Avinza, Kadian, and Oramorph SR, that  like OxyContin are classified as schedule II controlled substances.  Because of their concern about the proprietary nature of the information,  the three companies that market these drugs did not provide us with the  same level of detail about the marketing and promotion of their drugs as  did Purdue. We also examined data from DEA on promotional  expenditures for OxyContin and two other schedule II controlled  substances. To examine what factors may have contributed to the abuse  and diversion of OxyContin, we interviewed officials from DEA, FDA, and  Purdue and physicians who prescribe OxyContin. We also analyzed IMS  Health data on sales of OxyContin nationwide and Purdue\u2019s distribution of  sales representatives, as part of an effort to compare the areas with large  sales growth and more sales representatives per capita with the areas  where abuse and diversion problems were identified. However, limitations  on the abuse and diversion data prevented an assessment of the  relationship between the availability of OxyContin and areas where the  drug was abused or diverted. To determine what actions have been taken  to address OxyContin abuse and diversion, we interviewed FDA officials  and examined FDA information regarding the drug\u2019s approval and  marketing and promotion. We also interviewed DEA officials and  examined how DEA determined the prevalence of OxyContin abuse and  diversion nationally. In addition, we examined state efforts to identify  those involved in the abuse and diversion of OxyContin. We also reviewed  actions taken by Purdue to address this problem.

The Controlled  Substances Act, which is administered by DEA, provides the legal  framework for the federal government\u2019s oversight of the manufacture and  wholesale distribution of controlled substances, that is, drugs and other  chemicals that have a potential for abuse. The states address certain issues  involving controlled substances through their own controlled substances  acts and their regulation of the practice of medicine and pharmacy.

The appropriate medical treatment varies  according to these two dimensions.", "In 1986, WHO determined that cancer pain could be relieved in most if not  all patients, and it encouraged physicians to prescribe opioid analgesics.  WHO developed a three-step analgesic ladder as a practice guideline to  provide a sequential use of different drugs for cancer pain management.  For the first pain step, treatment with nonopioid analgesics, such as  aspirin or ibuprofen, is recommended. If pain is not relieved, then an  opioid such as codeine should be used for mild-to-moderate pain as the  second step. For the third step\u2014moderate-to-severe pain\u2014opioids such as  morphine should be used.", "Beginning in the mid-1990s, various national pain-related organizations  issued pain treatment and management guidelines, which included the use  of opioid analgesics in treating both cancer and noncancer pain. In 1995,  the American Pain Society recommended that pain should be treated as  the fifth vital sign to ensure that it would become common practice for  health care providers to ask about pain when conducting patient  evaluations. The practice guidelines issued by the Agency for Health Care  Policy and Research provided physicians and other health care  professionals with information on the management of acute pain in 1992  and cancer pain in 1994, respectively. Health care providers and hospitals  were further required to ensure that their patients received appropriate  pain treatment when the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations (JCAHO), a national health care facility standards-setting  and accrediting body, implemented its pain standards for hospital  accreditation in 2001.", "OxyContin, a schedule II drug manufactured by Purdue Pharma L.P., was  approved by FDA in 1995 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain  lasting more than a few days, as indicated in the original label. OxyContin  followed Purdue\u2019s older product, MS Contin, a morphine-based product  that was approved in 1984 for a similar intensity and duration of pain and  during its early years of marketing was promoted for the treatment of  cancer pain. The active ingredient in OxyContin tablets is oxycodone, a  compound that is similar to morphine and is also found in oxycodone- combination pain relief drugs such as Percocet, Percodan, and Tylox.  Because of its controlled-release property, OxyContin contains more  active ingredient and needs to be taken less often (twice a day) than these  other oxycodone-containing drugs. The OxyContin label originally  approved by FDA indicated that the controlled-release characteristics of  OxyContin were believed to reduce its potential for abuse. The label also  contained a warning that OxyContin tablets were to be swallowed whole,  and were not to be broken, chewed, or crushed because this could lead to  the rapid release and absorption of a potentially toxic dose of oxycodone.  Such a safety warning is customary for schedule II controlled-release  medications. FDA first approved the marketing and use of OxyContin in  10-, 20-, and 40-milligram controlled-release tablets. FDA later approved  80- and 160-milligram controlled-release tablets for use by patients who  were already taking opioids. In July 2001, FDA approved the revised label  to state that the drug is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe  pain in patients who require \u201ca continuous around-the-clock analgesic for  an extended period of time.\u201d (See app. II for a summary of the changes  that were made by FDA to the original OxyContin label.)", "OxyContin sales and prescriptions grew rapidly following its market  introduction in 1996. Fortuitous timing may have contributed to this  growth, as the launching of the drug occurred during the national focus on  the inadequacy of patient pain treatment and management. In 1997,  OxyContin\u2019s sales and prescriptions began increasing significantly, and  they continued to increase through 2002. In both 2001 and 2002,  OxyContin\u2019s sales exceeded $1 billion, and prescriptions were over 7  million. The drug became Purdue\u2019s main product, accounting for 90  percent of the company\u2019s total prescription sales by 2001.", "Media reports of OxyContin abuse and diversion began to surface in 2000.  These reports first appeared in rural areas of some states, generally in the  Appalachian region, and continued to spread to other rural areas and  larger cities in several states. Rural communities in Maine, Kentucky, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia were reportedly being devastated  by the abuse and diversion of OxyContin. For example, media reports told  of persons and communities that had been adversely affected by the rise of  addiction and deaths related to OxyContin. One report noted that drug  treatment centers and emergency rooms in a particular area were  receiving new patients who were addicted to OxyContin as early as 1999.  Pain patients, teens, and recreational drug users who had abused  OxyContin reportedly entered drug treatment centers sweating and  vomiting from withdrawal. In West Virginia, as many as one-half of the  approximately 300 patients admitted to a drug treatment clinic in 2000  were treated for OxyContin addiction. The media also reported on deaths  due to OxyContin. For example, a newspaper\u2019s investigation of autopsy  reports involving oxycodone-related deaths found that OxyContin had  been involved in over 200 overdose deaths in Florida since 2000. In  another case, a forensic toxicologist commented that he had reviewed a  number of fatal overdose cases in which individuals took a large dose of  OxyContin, in combination with alcohol or other drugs.", "After learning about the initial reports of abuse and diversion of  OxyContin in Maine in 2000, Purdue formed a response team made up of  its top executives and physicians to initiate meetings with federal and  state officials in Maine to gain an understanding of the scope of the  problem and to devise strategies for preventing abuse and diversion. After  these meetings, Purdue distributed brochures to health care professionals  that described several steps that could be taken to prevent prescription  drug abuse and diversion. In response to the abuse and diversion reports,  DEA analyzed data collected from medical examiner autopsy reports and  crime scene investigation reports. The most recent data available from  DEA show that as of February 2002, the agency had verified 146 deaths  nationally involving OxyContin in 2000 and 2001.", "According to Purdue, as of early October 2003, over 300 lawsuits  concerning OxyContin were pending against Purdue, and 50 additional  lawsuits had been dismissed. The cases involve many allegations,  including, for example, that Purdue used improper sales tactics and  overpromoted OxyContin causing the drug to be inappropriately  prescribed by physicians, and that Purdue took inadequate actions to  prevent addiction, abuse, and diversion of the drug.

FDA told us that the agency takes a risk-based  approach to enforcement, whereby drugs with more serious risks, such as  opioids, are given closer scrutiny in monitoring promotional messages and  activities, but the agency has no specific guidance or policy on this  approach. The FD&C Act and its implementing regulations require that all  promotional materials for prescription drugs be submitted to FDA at the  time the materials are first disseminated or used, but it generally is not  required that these materials be approved by FDA before their use. As a  result, FDA\u2019s actions to address violations occur after the materials have  already appeared in public. In fiscal year 2002, FDA had 39 staff positions  dedicated to oversight of drug advertising and promotion of all  pharmaceuticals distributed in the United States. According to FDA, most  of the staff focuses on the oversight of promotional communications to  physicians.

Warning letters are issued for more serious  violations, such as those involving safety or health risks, or for continued  violations of the act. Warning letters generally advise a pharmaceutical  manufacturer that FDA may take further enforcement actions, such as  seeking judicial remediation, without notifying the company and may ask  the manufacturer to conduct a new advertising campaign to correct  inaccurate impressions left by the advertisements.", "Under the Controlled Substances Act, FDA notifies DEA if FDA is  reviewing a new drug application for a drug that has a stimulant,  depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system and has  abuse potential.

Also, a  prescription for a schedule II drug may not be refilled. A physician is  required to provide a new prescription each time a patient obtains more of  the drug. DEA also sets limits on the quantity of schedule II controlled  substances that may be produced in the United States in any given year.  Specifically, DEA sets aggregate production quotas that limit the  production of bulk raw materials used in the manufacture of controlled  substances.

States also  require pharmacists and pharmacies to be licensed. The regulation of the  practice of pharmacy is based on state pharmacy practice acts and  regulations enforced by the state boards of pharmacy. According to the  National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, all state pharmacy laws  require that records of prescription drugs dispensed to patients be  maintained and that state pharmacy boards have access to the prescription  records. State regulatory boards face new challenges with the advent of  Internet pharmacies, because they enable pharmacies and physicians to  anonymously reach across state borders to prescribe, sell, and dispense  prescription drugs without complying with state requirements. In some  cases, consumers can purchase prescription drugs, including controlled  substances, such as OxyContin, from Internet pharmacies without a valid  prescription.", "In addition to these regulatory boards, 15 states operate prescription drug  monitoring programs as a means to control the illegal diversion of  prescription drugs that are controlled substances. Prescription drug  monitoring programs are designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, and  reporting of information on the prescribing, dispensing, and use of  controlled substances within a state. They provide data and analysis to  state law enforcement and regulatory agencies to assist in identifying and  investigating activities potentially related to the illegal prescribing,  dispensing, and procuring of controlled substances.

However, few states  proactively analyze prescription data to identify individuals, physicians, or  pharmacies that have unusual use, prescribing, or dispensing patterns that  may suggest potential drug diversion or abuse. Although three states can  respond to requests for information within 3 to 4 hours, providing  information on suspected illegal prescribing, dispensing, or doctor  shopping at the time a prescription is written or sold would require states  to improve computer capabilities.

The  expanded sales force included sales representatives from the Hospital  Specialty Division, which was created in 2000 to increase promotional  visits on physicians located in hospitals. (See table 1.)", "The manufacturers of two of the three comparable schedule II drugs have  smaller sales forces than Purdue. Currently, the manufacturer of Kadian  has about 100 sales representatives and is considering entering into a  copromotion agreement. Elan, the current owner of Oramorph SR, has  approximately 300 representatives, but told us that it is not currently  marketing Oramorph SR. The manufacturer of Avinza had approximately  50 representatives at its product launch. In early 2003, Avinza\u2019s  manufacturer announced that more than 700 additional sales  representatives would be promoting the drug under its copromotion  agreement with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Organon\u2014for a total of  more than 800 representatives.", "By more than doubling its total sales representatives, Purdue significantly  increased the number of physicians to whom it was promoting OxyContin.  Each Purdue sales representative has a specific sales territory and is  responsible for developing a list of about 105 to 140 physicians to call on  who already prescribe opioids or who are candidates for prescribing  opioids. In 1996, the 300-plus Purdue sales representatives had a total  physician call list of approximately 33,400 to 44,500. By 2000, the nearly  700 representatives had a total call list of approximately 70,500 to 94,000  physicians. Each Purdue sales representative is expected to make about 35  physician calls per week and typically calls on each physician every 3 to 4  weeks. Each hospital sales representative is expected to make about 50  calls per week and typically calls on each facility every 4 weeks.", "Purdue stated it offered a \u201cbetter than industry average\u201d salary and sales  bonuses to attract top sales representatives and provide incentives to  boost OxyContin sales as it had done for MS Contin. Although the sales  representatives were primarily focused on OxyContin promotion, the  amount of the bonus depended on whether a representative met the sales  quotas in his or her sales territory for all company products. As  OxyContin\u2019s sales increased, Purdue\u2019s growth-based portion of the bonus  formula increased the OxyContin sales quotas necessary to earn the same  base sales bonus amounts. The amount of total bonuses that Purdue  estimated were tied to OxyContin sales increased significantly from about  $1 million in 1996, when OxyContin was first marketed, to about $40  million in 2001. Beginning in 2000, when the newly created hospital  specialty representatives began promoting OxyContin, their estimated  total bonuses were approximately $6 million annually. In 2001, the average  annual salary for a Purdue sales representative was $55,000, and the  average annual bonus was $71,500. During the same year, the highest  annual sales bonus was nearly $240,000, and the lowest was nearly  $15,000. In 2001, Purdue decided to limit the sales bonus a representative  could earn based on the growth in prescribing of a single physician after a  meeting with the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia at  which the company was informed of the possibility that a bonus could be  based on the prescribing of one physician."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purdue Employed Multiple Approaches to Market and Promote OxyContin", "paragraphs": ["In addition to expanding its sales force, Purdue used multiple approaches  to market and promote OxyContin. These approaches included expanding  its physician speaker bureau and conducting speaker training conferences,  sponsoring pain-related educational programs, issuing OxyContin starter  coupons for patients\u2019 initial prescriptions, sponsoring pain-related Web  sites, advertising OxyContin in medical journals, and distributing  OxyContin marketing items to health care professionals.", "In our report on direct-to-consumer advertising, we found that most  promotional spending is targeted to physicians. For example, in 2001, 29  percent of spending on pharmaceutical promotional activities was related  to activities of pharmaceutical sales representatives directed to  physicians, and 2 percent was for journal advertising\u2014both activities  Purdue uses for its OxyContin promotion. The remaining 69 percent of  pharmaceutical promotional spending involved sampling (55 percent),  which is the practice of providing drug samples during sales visits to  physician offices, and direct-to-consumer advertising (14 percent)\u2014both  activities that Purdue has stated it does not use for OxyContin.", "According to DEA\u2019s analysis of IMS Health data, Purdue spent  approximately 6 to 12 times more on promotional efforts during  OxyContin\u2019s first 6 years on the market than it had spent on its older  product, MS Contin, during its first 6 years, or than had been spent by  Janssen Pharmaceutical Products, L.P., for one of OxyContin\u2019s drug  competitors, Duragesic. (See fig. 1.)", "During the first 5 years that OxyContin was marketed, Purdue conducted  over 40 national pain management and speaker training conferences,  usually in resort locations such as Boca Raton, Florida, and Scottsdale,  Arizona, to recruit and train health care practitioners for its national  speaker bureau. The trained speakers were then made available to speak  about the appropriate use of opioids, including oxycodone, the active  ingredient in OxyContin, to their colleagues in various settings, such as  local medical conferences and grand round presentations in hospitals  involving physicians, residents, and interns. Over the 5 years, these  conferences were attended by more than 5,000 physicians, pharmacists,  and nurses, whose travel, lodging, and meal costs were paid by the  company. Purdue told us that less than 1 percent annually of the  physicians called on by Purdue sales representatives attended these  conferences. Purdue told us it discontinued conducting these conferences  in fall 2000. Purdue\u2019s speaker bureau list from 1996 through mid-2002  included nearly 2,500 physicians, of whom over 1,000 were active  participants. Purdue has paid participants a fee for speaking based on the  physician\u2019s qualifications; the type of program and time commitment  involved; and expenses such as airfare, hotel, and food. The company  currently marketing the comparable drug Avinza has a physician speaker  bureau, but does not sponsor speaker training and conferences at resort  locations. Kadian\u2019s current company does not have a physician speaker  bureau and has not held any conferences.", "From 1996, when OxyContin was introduced to the market, to July 2002,  Purdue has funded over 20,000 pain-related educational programs through  direct sponsorship or financial grants. These grants included support for  programs to provide physicians with opportunities to earn required  continuing medical education credits, such as grand round presentations  at hospitals and medical education seminars at state and local medical  conferences. During 2001 and 2002, Purdue funded a series of nine  programs throughout the country to educate hospital physicians and staff  on how to comply with JCAHO\u2019s pain standards for hospitals and to  discuss postoperative pain treatment. Purdue was one of only two drug  companies that provided funding for JCAHO\u2019s pain management  educational programs. Under an agreement with JCAHO, Purdue was the  only drug company allowed to distribute certain educational videos and a  book about pain management; these materials were also available for  purchase from JCAHO\u2019s Web site. Purdue\u2019s participation in these activities  with JCAHO may have facilitated its access to hospitals to promote  OxyContin.", "For the first time in marketing any of its products, Purdue used a patient  starter coupon program for OxyContin to provide patients with a free  limited-time prescription. Unlike patient assistance programs, which  provide free prescriptions to patients in financial need, a coupon program  is intended to enable a patient to try a new drug through a one-time free  prescription. A sales representative distributes coupons to a physician,  who decides whether to offer one to a patient, and then the patient  redeems it for a free prescription through a participating pharmacy. The  program began in 1998 and ran intermittently for 4 years. In 1998 and 1999,  each sales representative had 25 coupons that were redeemable for a free  30-day supply. In 2000 each representative had 90 coupons for a 7-day  supply, and in 2001 each had 10 coupons for a 7-day supply.  Approximately 34,000 coupons had been redeemed nationally when the  program was terminated following the July 2001 OxyContin label change.  The manufacturers of two of the comparable drugs we examined\u2014Avinza  and Kadian\u2014used coupon programs to introduce patients to their  products. Avinza\u2019s coupon program requires patients to make a copayment  to cover part of the drug\u2019s cost.", "Purdue has also used Web sites to provide pain-related information to  consumers and others. In addition to its corporate Web site, which  provides product information, Purdue established the \u201cPartners Against  Pain\u201d Web site in 1997 to provide consumers with information about pain  management and pain treatment options. According to FDA, the Web site  also contained information about OxyContin. Separate sections provide  information for patients and caregivers, medical professionals, and  institutions. The Web site includes a \u201cFind a Doctor\u201d feature to enable  consumers to find physicians who treat pain in their geographic area. As  of July 2002, over 33,000 physicians were included. Ligand, which markets  Avinza, one of the comparable drugs, has also used a corporate Web site to  provide product information. Purdue has also funded Web sites, such as  FamilyPractice.com, that provide physicians with free continuing medical  educational programs on pain management. Purdue has also provided  funding for Web site development and support for health care groups such  as the American Chronic Pain Association and the American Academy of  Pain Medicine. In addition, Purdue is one of 28 corporate donors\u2014which  include all three comparable drug companies\u2014listed on the Web site of  the American Pain Society, the mission of which is to improve pain-related  education, treatment, and professional practice. Purdue also sponsors  painfullyobvious.com, which it describes as a youth-focused \u201cmessage  campaign designed to provide information\u2014and stimulate open  discussions\u2014on the dangers of abusing prescription drugs.\u201d", "Purdue also provided its sales representatives with 14,000 copies of a  promotional video in 1999 to distribute to physicians. Entitled From One  Pain Patient to Another: Advice from Patients Who Have Found Relief,  the video was to encourage patients to report their pain and to alleviate  patients\u2019 concerns about taking opioids. Purdue stated that the video was  to be used \u201cin physician waiting rooms, as a \u2018check out\u2019 item for an office\u2019s  patient education library, or as an educational tool for office or hospital  staff to utilize with patients and their families.\u201d Copies of the video were  also available for ordering on the \u201cPartners Against Pain\u201d Web site from  June 2000 through July 2001. The video did not need to be submitted to  FDA for its review because it did not contain any information about  OxyContin. However, the video included a statement that opioid  analgesics have been shown to cause addiction in less than 1 percent of  patients. According to FDA, this statement has not been substantiated.", "As part of its marketing campaign, Purdue distributed several types of  branded promotional items to health care practitioners. Among these  items were OxyContin fishing hats, stuffed plush toys, coffee mugs with  heat-activated messages, music compact discs, luggage tags, and pens  containing a pullout conversion chart showing physicians how to calculate  the dosage to convert a patient to OxyContin from other opioid pain  relievers. In May 2002, in anticipation of PhRMA\u2019s voluntary guidance for  sales representatives\u2019 interactions with health care professionals, Purdue  instructed its sales force to destroy any remaining inventory of non-health- related promotional items, such as stuffed toys or golf balls. In early 2003,  Purdue began distributing an OxyContin branded goniometer\u2014a range  and motion measurement guide. According to DEA, Purdue\u2019s use of  branded promotional items to market OxyContin was unprecedented  among schedule II opioids, and was an indicator of Purdue\u2019s aggressive  and inappropriate marketing of OxyContin.", "Another approach Purdue used to promote OxyContin was to place  advertisements in medical journals. Purdue\u2019s annual spending for  OxyContin advertisements increased from about $700,000 in 1996 to about  $4.6 million in 2001. All three companies that marketed the comparable  drugs have also used medical journal advertisements to promote their  products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OxyContin Advertisements Violated the FD&C Act", "paragraphs": ["Purdue has been cited twice by FDA for using advertisements in  professional medical journals that violated the FD&C Act. In May 2000,  FDA issued an untitled letter to Purdue regarding a professional medical  journal advertisement for OxyContin. FDA noted that among other  problems, the advertisement implied that OxyContin had been studied for  all types of arthritis pain when it had been studied only in patients with  moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain, the advertisement suggested  OxyContin could be used as an initial therapy for the treatment of  osteoarthritis pain without substantial evidence to support this claim, and  the advertisement promoted OxyContin in a selected class of patients\u2014 the elderly\u2014without presenting risk information applicable to that class of  patients. Purdue agreed to stop dissemination of the advertisement. The  second action taken by FDA was more serious. In January 2003, FDA  issued a warning letter to Purdue regarding two professional medical  journal advertisements for OxyContin that minimized its risks and  overstated its efficacy, by failing to prominently present information from  the boxed warning on the potentially fatal risks associated with OxyContin  and its abuse liability, along with omitting important information about the  limitations on the indicated use of OxyContin. The FDA requested that  Purdue cease disseminating these advertisements and any similar violative  materials and provide a plan of corrective action. In response, Purdue  issued a corrected advertisement, which called attention to the warning  letter and the cited violations and directed the reader to the prominently  featured boxed warning and indication information for OxyContin. The  FDA letter was one of only four warning letters issued to drug  manufacturers during the first 8 months of 2003.", "In addition, in follow-up discussions with Purdue officials on the January  2003 warning letter, FDA expressed concerns about some of the  information on Purdue\u2019s \u201cPartners Against Pain\u201d Web site. The Web site  appeared to suggest unapproved uses of OxyContin for postoperative pain  that may have been inconsistent with OxyContin\u2019s labeling and lacked risk  information about the drug. For example, one section of the Web site did  not disclose that OxyContin is not indicated for pain in the immediate  postoperative period\u2014the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery\u2014for  patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting  has not been established. The Web site also did not disclose that  OxyContin is indicated for postoperative pain in patients already taking  the drug or for use after the first 24 hours following surgery only if the  pain is moderate to severe and expected to persist for an extended period  of time. Purdue voluntarily removed all sections of the Web site that were  of concern to FDA.", "FDA has also sent enforcement letters to other manufacturers of  controlled substances for marketing and promotion violations of the  FD&C Act. For example, in 1996, FDA issued an untitled letter to Zeneca  Pharmaceuticals, at the time the promoter of Kadian, for providing  information about the drug to a health professional prior to its approval in  the United States. Roxane Laboratories, the manufacturer of Oramorph  SR, was issued four untitled letters between 1993 and 1995 for making  misleading and possibly false statements. Roxane used children in an  advertisement even though Oramorph SR had not been evaluated in  children, and a Roxane sales representative issued a promotional letter to  a pharmacist that claimed, among other things, that Oramorph SR was  superior to MS Contin in providing pain relief.

According to recent studies, oxycodone, the active ingredient in  OxyContin, is twice as potent as morphine. In addition, OxyContin\u2019s  controlled-release feature allows a tablet to contain more active ingredient  than other, non-controlled-release oxycodone-containing drugs.", "One factor that may have contributed to the abuse and diversion of  OxyContin was FDA\u2019s original decision to label the drug as having less  abuse potential than other oxycodone products because of its controlled- release formulation. FDA officials said when OxyContin was approved the  agency believed that the controlled-release formulation would result in  less abuse potential because, when taken properly, the drug would be  absorbed slowly, without an immediate rush or high. FDA officials  acknowledged that the initial wording of OxyContin\u2019s label was  \u201cunfortunate\u201d but was based on what was known about the product at that  time.", "FDA officials told us that abusers typically seek a drug that is intense and  fast-acting. When OxyContin was approved, FDA did not recognize that if  the drug is dissolved in water and injected its controlled-release  characteristics could be disrupted, creating an immediate rush or high and  thereby increasing the potential for misuse and abuse. DEA officials told  us that OxyContin became a target for abusers and diverters because the  tablet contained larger amounts of active ingredient and the controlled- release formulation was easy for abusers to compromise.", "The safety warning on the OxyContin label may also have contributed to  the drug\u2019s potential for abuse and diversion, by inadvertently providing  abusers with information on how the drug could be misused. The label  included the warning that the tablets should not be broken, chewed, or  crushed because such action could result in the rapid release and  absorption of a potentially toxic dose of oxycodone.

Historically, oxycodone,  manufactured under brand names such as Percocet, Percodan, and Tylox,  was among the most diverted prescription drugs in Appalachia. According  to the report, OxyContin has become the drug of choice of abusers in  several areas within the region. The report indicates that many areas of the  Appalachian region are rural and poverty-stricken, and the profit potential  resulting from the illicit sale of OxyContin may have contributed to its  diversion and abuse. In some parts of Kentucky, a 20-milligram OxyContin  tablet, which can be purchased by legitimate patients for about $2, can be  sold illicitly for as much as $25.

From fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2002, DEA initiated  313 investigations involving OxyContin, resulting in 401 arrests. Most of  the investigations and arrests occurred after the initiation of the action  plan. Since the plan was enacted, DEA initiated 257 investigations and  made 302 arrests in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Among those arrested were  several physicians and pharmacists.

In October 2001 DEA  joined 21 national pain and health organizations in issuing a consensus  statement calling for a balanced policy on prescription medication use.  According to the statement, such a policy would acknowledge that health  care professionals and DEA share responsibility for ensuring that  prescription medications, such as OxyContin, are available to patients who  need them and for preventing these drugs from becoming a source of  abuse and diversion. DEA and the health organizations also called for a  renewed focus on educating health professionals, law enforcement, and  the public about the appropriate use of opioid pain medications in order to  promote responsible prescribing and limit instances of abuse and  diversion. DEA is also working with FDA to encourage state medical  boards to require, as a condition of their state licensing, that physicians  obtain continuing medical education on pain management.", "When OxyContin was first introduced to the market in 1996, DEA granted  Purdue\u2019s initial procurement quota request for oxycodone. According to  DEA, increases in the quota were granted for the first several years.  Subsequently, concern over the dramatic increases in sales caused DEA to  request additional information to support Purdue\u2019s requests to increase  the quota. In the last several years, DEA has taken the additional step of  lowering the procurement quota requested by Purdue for the manufacture  of OxyContin as a means for addressing abuse and diversion.

Purdue submitted its risk management plan to FDA for review  in August 2001. The plan includes some actions that Purdue proposed to  take, as well as others that it has already taken. Purdue\u2019s risk management  plan includes actions such as strengthening the safety warnings on  OxyContin\u2019s label for professionals and patients, training Purdue\u2019s sales  force on the revised label, conducting comprehensive education programs  for health care professionals, and developing a database for identifying  and monitoring abuse and diversion of OxyContin.", "Under the risk management plan, OxyContin\u2019s label was strengthened,  effective in July 2001, by revising the physician prescribing information  and adding a black box warning to call attention to OxyContin\u2019s potential  for misuse, abuse, and diversion. (See app. II.) Purdue trained its sales  force on the specifics of the revised label and provided sales  representatives with updated information on the appropriate use of opioid  analgesics, legal guidelines associated with promotion of its products, and  their responsibility and role in reporting adverse events. Purdue also  reiterated to its sales representatives that failure to promote products  according to the approved label, promotional materials, and applicable  FDA standards would result in disciplinary action by the company.  According to Purdue, from April 2001 through May 2003 at least 10 Purdue  employees were disciplined for using unapproved materials in promoting  OxyContin. Disciplinary actions included warning letters, suspension  without pay, and termination.", "Purdue also has provided education programs for health care  professionals and the public under its risk management plan. For example,  in 2001 Purdue supported seminars that examined ways health care  professionals can help prevent abuse and diversion of opioids. Purdue  worked with DEA and other law enforcement agencies to develop and  implement antidiversion educational programs. In 2002, Purdue also  launched the Web site painfullyobvious.com to educate teenagers, parents,  law enforcement officers, and discussion leaders about the dangers of  prescription drug abuse.", "Because reliable data on the abuse and diversion of controlled substance  drugs are not available, Purdue developed the Researched Abuse,  Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS) System, as part  of its risk management plan, to study the nature and extent of abuse of  OxyContin and other schedule II and III prescription medications and to  implement interventions to reduce abuse and diversion. According to  Purdue, RADARS collects and computes abuse, diversion, and addiction  rates for certain drugs based on population and determines national and  local trends.", "Since the launch of OxyContin, Purdue has provided its sales force with  considerable information to help target physicians and prioritize sales  contacts within a sales territory. Sales representatives routinely receive  daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly physician prescribing reports based  on IMS Health data that specify the physicians who have written  prescriptions for OxyContin and other opioid analgesics, and the number  of prescriptions written. Although this information has always been  available for use by Purdue and its sales representatives, it was not until  fall 2002 that Purdue directed its sales representatives to begin using 11  indicators to identify possible abuse and diversion and to report the  incidents to Purdue\u2019s General Counsel\u2019s Office for investigation. Among  the possible indicators are a sudden unexplained change in a physician\u2019s  prescribing patterns that is not accounted for by changes in patient  numbers, information from credible sources such as a pharmacist that a  physician or his or her patients are diverting medications, or a physician  who writes a large number of prescriptions for patients who pay with  cash. As of September 2003, Purdue\u2014through its own investigations\u2014had  identified 39 physicians and other health care professionals who were  referred to legal, medical, or regulatory authorities for further action.

Purdue also  implemented a program in 2001 to attempt to predict \u201chot spots\u201d where  OxyContin abuse and diversion were likely to occur, but discontinued the  program in 2002 when Purdue concluded that nearly two-thirds of the  counties identified had no abuse and diversion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At present, both federal agencies and the states have responsibilities  involving prescription drugs and their abuse and diversion. FDA is  responsible for approving new drugs and ensuring that the materials drug  companies use to market and promote these drugs are truthful, balanced,  and accurate. However, FDA examines these promotional materials only  after they have been used in the marketplace because the FD&C Act  generally does not give FDA authority to review these materials before the  drug companies use them. Moreover, the FD&C Act provisions governing  drug approval and promotional materials make no distinction between  controlled substances, such as OxyContin, and other prescription drugs.  DEA is responsible for registering handlers of controlled substances,  approving production quotas and monitoring distribution of controlled  substances to the retail level. It is the states, however, that are responsible  for overseeing the practice of medicine and pharmacy where drugs are  prescribed and dispensed. Some states have established prescription drug  monitoring programs to help them detect and deter abuse and diversion.  However, these programs exist in only 15 states and most do not  proactively analyze prescription data to identify individuals, physicians, or  pharmacies that have unusual use, prescribing, or dispensing patterns that  may suggest potential drug diversion or abuse.", "The significant growth in the use of OxyContin to treat patients suffering  from chronic pain has been accompanied by widespread reports of abuse  and diversion that have in some cases led to deaths. The problem of abuse  and diversion has highlighted shortcomings at the time of approval in the  labeling of schedule II controlled substances, such as OxyContin, and in  the plans in place to detect misuse, as well as in the infrastructure for  detecting and preventing the abuse and diversion of schedule II controlled  substances already on the market.", "Addressing abuse and diversion problems requires the collaborative  efforts of pharmaceutical manufacturers; the federal and state agencies  that oversee the approval and use of prescription drugs, particularly  controlled substances; the health care providers who prescribe and  dispense them; and law enforcement. After the problems with OxyContin  began to surface, FDA and Purdue collaborated on a risk management  plan to help detect and prevent abuse and diversion. Although risk  management plans were not in use when OxyContin was approved, they  are now an optional feature of new drug applications. FDA plans to  complete its guidance to the pharmaceutical industry on risk management  plans by September 30, 2004. The development of this guidance, coupled  with FDA\u2019s current review of proposed risk management plans for  modified-release opioid analgesics, provides an opportunity to help ensure  that manufacturers include a strategy to monitor the use of these drugs  and to identify potential problems with abuse and diversion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve efforts to prevent or identify the abuse and diversion of  schedule II controlled substances, we recommend that the Commissioner  of Food and Drugs ensure that FDA\u2019s risk management plan guidance  encourages pharmaceutical manufacturers that submit new drug  applications for these substances to include plans that contain a strategy  for monitoring the use of these drugs and identifying potential abuse and  diversion problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Purdue Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FDA, DEA, and Purdue, the  manufacturer of OxyContin, for their review. FDA and DEA provided  written comments. (See apps. IV and V.) Purdue\u2019s representatives provided  oral comments.", "FDA said that it agreed with our recommendation that its risk  management plan guidance should encourage all pharmaceutical  manufacturers submitting new drug applications for schedule II controlled  substances to include strategies to address abuse and diversion concerns.  FDA stated that the agency is working on the risk management plan  guidance. FDA also noted that the FD&C Act makes no distinction  between controlled substances and other prescription drugs in its  provisions regulating promotion, but that as a matter of general policy, the  agency more closely scrutinizes promotion of drugs with more serious risk  profiles. However, FDA does not have written guidance that specifies that  promotional materials for controlled substances receive priority or special  attention over similar materials for other prescription drugs. Furthermore,  our finding that FDA did not review any of the OxyContin promotional  videos provided by Purdue until we brought them to the agency\u2019s attention  raises questions about whether FDA provides extra attention to  promotional materials for controlled substances that by definition have a  high potential for abuse and may lead to severe psychological or physical  dependence. FDA recommended that we clarify our description of the  content of the warning letter issued to Purdue and provide additional  information describing the extent of the corrective action taken by  Purdue. FDA also recommended noting in the report that part of the risk  management plan in connection with the 2001 labeling changes was a  requirement that all OxyContin promotional materials be revised to reflect  the labeling changes and all future materials prominently disclose this  information. Finally, FDA noted that the promotional videos discussed in  the report were submitted by Purdue prior to the labeling change and  discontinued as a result of the labeling change. As we note in the report,  Purdue acknowledged that all the promotional videos were not submitted  to FDA at the time they were distributed. Moreover, although Purdue told  us that these videos were no longer distributed after the label change,  those videos that had been distributed were not collected and destroyed.  We revised the report to reflect FDA\u2019s general comments. FDA also  provided technical comments that we incorporated where appropriate.", "In its written comments, DEA agreed that the data on abuse and diversion  are not reliable, comprehensive, or timely, as we reported. DEA reiterated  its previous statement that Purdue\u2019s aggressive marketing of OxyContin  fueled demand for the drug and exacerbated the drug\u2019s abuse and  diversion. DEA also stated that Purdue minimized the abuse risk  associated with OxyContin. We agree with DEA that Purdue conducted an  extensive campaign to market and promote OxyContin using an expanded  sales force and multiple promotional approaches to encourage physicians,  including primary care specialists, to prescribe OxyContin as an initial  opioid treatment for noncancer pain, and that these efforts may have  contributed to the problems with abuse and diversion by increasing the  availability of the drug in the marketplace. However, we also noted that  other factors may have contributed to these problems. We also agree that  Purdue marketed OxyContin as having a low abuse liability, but we noted  that this was based on information in the original label approved by FDA.  DEA also acknowledged that the lack of a real measure of legitimate  medical need for a specific product (OxyContin), substance (oxycodone),  or even a class of substances (controlled release opioid analgesics) makes  it difficult to limit manufacturing as a means of deterring abuse and  diversion. DEA also noted that it is essential that risk management plans  be put in place prior to the introduction of controlled substances into the  marketplace, consistent with our recommendation. We revised the report  to provide some additional detail on problems associated with OxyContin  and Purdue\u2019s marketing efforts. DEA provided some technical comments  on the draft report that we incorporated where appropriate.", "Purdue representatives provided oral comments on a draft of this report.  In general, they thought the report was fair and balanced; however, they  offered both general and technical comments. Specifically, Purdue stated  that the report should add the media as a factor contributing to the abuse  and diversion of OxyContin because media stories provided the public  with information on how to \u201cget high\u201d from using OxyContin incorrectly.  Our report notes that the safety warning on the original label may have  inadvertently alerted abusers to a possible method for misusing the drug.  However, we note that the original label was publicly available from FDA  once OxyContin was approved for marketing. Purdue also suggested that  we include Duragesic, also a schedule II opioid analgesic, as a fourth  comparable drug to OxyContin. The three comparable drugs we used in  the report were chosen in consultation with FDA as comparable opioid  analgesics to OxyContin, because they were time-released, morphine- based schedule II drugs formulated as tablets like OxyContin. In contrast,  Duragesic, which contains the opioid analgesic fentanyl and provides pain  relief over a 72-hour period, is formulated as a skin patch to be worn  rather than as a tablet. Purdue representatives also provided technical  comments that were incorporated where appropriate.", "We also provided sections of this draft report to the manufacturers of  three comparative drugs we examined. Two of the three companies with a  drug product used as a comparable drug to OxyContin reviewed the  portions of the draft report concerning their own product, and provided  technical comments, which were incorporated where appropriate.

We  also analyzed the distribution of Purdue sales representatives by state and  compared them with the availability of OxyContin and abuse and diversion  data to determine whether states with high rates of OxyContin sales and  prescription dispensing and abuse and diversion problems had more sales  representatives per capita than other states.
