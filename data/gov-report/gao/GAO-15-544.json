DOD officials believe that current assessments meet the intent of the statute that requires DOD to implement a continuing gap analysis. However, DOD has not evaluated and documented the extent to which the current assessments describe existing insider-threat program capabilities, as is required by the law. Without such a documented evaluation, the department will not know whether its capabilities to address insider threats are adequate and address statutory requirements. Further, national-level security guidance states that agencies, including DOD, should assess risk posture as part of insider-threat programs. GAO found that DOD components had not incorporated risk assessments because DOD had not provided guidance on how to incorporate risk assessments into components' programs.

Disclosures by an Army service member in  2010 and a National Security Agency contractor in 2013 are among the  largest known leaks of classified information in U.S. history, according to  DOD and U.S intelligence-community leaders. In January 2014, the U.S.  intelligence community\u2019s Worldwide Threat Assessment cited the  persistent challenge and continuing critical threat that insiders pose.  Insiders have an advantage over others who may want to harm an  organization because insiders may have an awareness of their  organization\u2019s vulnerabilities, such as loosely enforced policies and  procedures, or exploitable technical flaws. Even insiders who do not  intend to cause harm may inadvertently do so through human error.  Insiders with access to DOD information and systems may be able to  conduct far more malicious activity\u2014wittingly or unwittingly\u2014than  outsiders, with potentially devastating consequences for DOD.

In 2012, the President issued the national  insider-threat policy that required agencies to implement insider-threat  programs by May 2013. The President also directed each agency\u2019s  insider-threat program to include six minimum standards: (1) designation  of senior official(s); (2) information integration, analysis, and response; (3)  insider-threat program personnel; (4) access to information; (5)  monitoring user activity on networks; and (6) employee training and  awareness.", "See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Pub.

Also, the overall methodology used for both reports is  the same.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has implemented an insider-threat  program that incorporates minimum standards and key elements to  protect classified information and systems, we evaluated initiatives that  DOD had established and policy and guidance that identify  responsibilities within the department to address the threat that insiders  pose to classified information and systems. We selected a nonprobability  sample of six DOD components to assess implementation efforts at the  component level. The six components include three combat support  agencies; one military service; one combatant command; and one service  sub-command. We selected these six components based on several  factors including their specific roles in supporting DOD networks, prior  insider-threat incidents, and reported progress in implementing insider- threat programs. In order to avoid duplication with an ongoing DOD  Inspector General evaluation, we included only one military service.  While not generalizable, the information we obtained from these selected  components provided insight about the steps that different types of  components (i.e., service, combatant command, combat support agency)  are taking and challenges they are encountering. We developed a  questionnaire based on our research objectives, the minimum standards  called for in E.O. 13587, and industry leading practices for insider-threat  programs. We administered the questionnaire and collected responses  from all six components, and conducted follow-up meetings as needed  based on responses. We also collected responses from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD ) about  the implementation of the department\u2019s insider-threat program because  the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence is the DOD senior official  responsible for the department\u2019s program. We used the questionnaire  responses and information obtained from meetings and document  reviews to assess each component\u2019s insider-threat program  implementation and content. Using a scorecard methodology, two  analysts independently rated the collective data sources against the  minimum standards to score and provide an overall rating. The two  analysts then compared their independent scores, discussed any  differences, and determined the final ratings.", "In addition to minimum standards, we identified key elements of insider- threat programs by reviewing and analyzing a range of documents  including E.O. 13587, DOD guidance and reports, Committee on National  Security Systems guidance, a set of leading practices that the National  Insider Threat Task Force recommends, practices that other federal  agencies and private industry use, and a list of essential principles  developed by a group of private-sector and U.S. government analysts.  We then organized this information into a framework of 25 key elements.  We based these elements upon the principles that we identified, but this  framework is not necessarily a comprehensive list of all elements since  other principles may exist that could benefit insider-threat programs. We  discussed this framework with DOD and private-sector officials and  incorporated their comments and changes as appropriate. In order to  assess how insider-threat programs incorporated these key elements, we  collected and analyzed information from the selected components and  OUSD (Intelligence) and interviewed relevant officials.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD and others have assessed DOD\u2019s  insider-threat program to protect classified information and systems, we  compared DOD assessment efforts occurring during the course of our  review to those described in E.O. 13587.

We did not independently verify the accuracy of the  self-assessments since it was beyond the scope of this review. We also  met with officials from the National Security Agency and National Insider  Threat Task Force involved in conducting independent assessments,  confirmed that they have assessed some DOD components, and  obtained and reviewed copies of the assessments. To determine the  extent to which DOD conducted the continuing analysis of gaps in its  insider-threat program required by the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2012, we obtained and reviewed DOD\u2019s 2013 report to  Congress, which described the department\u2019s plan for conducting a  continuing analysis, and interviewed OUSD (Intelligence) officials about  the current status of the analysis. To determine the extent to which DOD  incorporated risk assessments in its insider-threat program, we reviewed  DOD, Committee on National Security Systems, and National Insider  Threat Task Force guidance, and asked OUSD (Intelligence), DOD CIO,  and component officials about the extent to which DOD conducted risk  assessments related to insider-threat programs.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has identified any technical or policy  changes it needs to protect its classified information and systems from  insider threats in the future, we focused on initiatives to be implemented  beginning in 2015 and those initiatives not included in DOD\u2019s existing  insider-threat guidance.

However, as stated in our report, the draft  implementation plan that we reviewed focused on actions that DOD would  take to implement the minimum standards and did not provide DOD  components additional information about other key elements that  component officials told us would be helpful. We therefore believe that  DOD needs to update its draft implementation plan before it is issued to  include guidance beyond the minimum standards, or issue this guidance  in another form. This will ensure that DOD components will be better  positioned to enhance their insider-threat programs and the department  will be better positioned to protect its classified information and systems.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation to evaluate and document  the extent to which current assessments provide a continuing analysis of  gaps for all DOD components, report to Congress on the results of this  evaluation, and direct that the overall results of these assessments be  reviewed by OUSD (Intelligence).

While these assessments can  provide DOD and its components information required under E.O. 13587,  DOD did not indicate whether it would evaluate and document whether  those assessments provide a continuing analysis of gaps as identified in  Section 922 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2012. Such an evaluation is necessary to determine whether DOD is  meeting the statutory requirement to complete a continuing analysis of  gaps in security measures and of technology, policies, and processes that  are needed to increase the capability of DOD\u2019s insider-threat program to  address these gaps. We believe such an evaluation is prudent since, as  we stated in the report, the information from the self-assessments and  independent assessments cited by DOD is sometimes limited. Therefore,  we continue to believe that DOD should take steps to evaluate and  document the extent to which these current assessments provide the  same information as the statutorily-required analysis of gaps in order to  determine the adequacy of DOD\u2019s insider-threat detection and analysis  capabilities. Second, DOD stated that it met the congressional reporting  requirement with its 2013 report, which did not require additional  reporting.
