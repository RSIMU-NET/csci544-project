Researchers have shown that these interfaces\u2014if not properly secured\u2014can be exploited through direct, physical access to a vehicle, as well as remotely through short-range and long-range wireless channels. For example, researchers have shown that attackers could compromise vulnerabilities in the short-range wireless connections to vehicles' Bluetooth units\u2014which enable hands-free cell phone use\u2014to gain access to in-vehicle networks, to take control over safety-critical functions such as the brakes. Among the interfaces that can be exploited through direct access, most stakeholders we spoke with expressed concerns about the statutorily mandated on-board diagnostics port, which provides access to a broad range of vehicle systems for emissions and diagnostic testing purposes. However, the majority of selected industry stakeholders we spoke with (23 out of 32) agreed that wireless attacks, such as those exploiting vulnerabilities in vehicles' built-in cellular-calling capabilities, would pose the largest risk to passenger safety. Such attacks could potentially impact a large number of vehicles and allow an attacker to access targeted vehicles from anywhere in the world. Despite these concerns, some stakeholders pointed out that such attacks remain difficult because of the time and expertise needed to carry them out and thus far have not been reported outside of the research environment.", "a In this context, long-range refers to access at distances over 1 kilometer.", "b This port is mandated in vehicles by statute for emission-testing purposes and to facilitate diagnostic assessments of vehicles, such as by repair shops. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(6).", "Selected industry stakeholders, both in the United States and Europe, informed GAO that a range of key practices is available to identify and mitigate potential vehicle-cybersecurity vulnerabilities. For instance, the majority of selected industry stakeholders we spoke with (22 out of 32) indicated that\u2014to the extent possible\u2014automakers should locate safety-critical systems and non-safety-critical systems on separate in-vehicle networks and limit communication between the two types of systems, a concept referred to as \u201cdomain separation.\u201d However, some of these stakeholders also pointed out that complete separation is often not possible or practical because some limited communication will likely need to occur between safety-critical and other vehicle systems. In addition, selected industry stakeholders we spoke to identified technological solutions that can be incorporated into the vehicle to make it more secure. However, according to stakeholders, many of these technologies\u2014such as message encryption and authentication, which can be used to secure and verify the legitimacy of communications occurring along in-vehicle networks\u2014cannot be incorporated into existing vehicles. Rather, such technologies must be incorporated during the vehicle design and production process, which according to stakeholders, takes approximately 5 years to complete.", "Selected industry stakeholders identified several challenges they face related to vehicle cybersecurity. For instance, the lack of transparency, communication, and collaboration regarding vehicles' cybersecurity among the various levels of the automotive supply chain and the cost of incorporating cybersecurity protections into vehicles were the two most frequently cited challenges\u2014mentioned by 15 and 13 of the 32 selected industry stakeholders, respectively. However, several industry-led efforts are planned and under way that, according to stakeholders, could potentially help automakers and parts suppliers identify and mitigate vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities and address some of the challenges that industry stakeholders face. For example, two U.S. industry associations have been leading the effort to establish an Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) to collect and analyze intelligence information and provide a forum for members to anonymously share threat and vulnerability information with one another. Selected industry stakeholders we spoke to, as well as DOT officials, generally expressed positive views regarding the potential effectiveness of an Automotive ISAC.", "The Department of Transportation's (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has taken steps to address vehicle cybersecurity issues but has not determined the role it would have in responding to a real-world vehicle cyberattack. For example, NHTSA added more research capabilities in this area and is developing guidance to help the industry determine when cybersecurity vulnerabilities should be considered a safety defect, and thus merit a recall; it expects to issue this guidance by March 31, 2016. Further, pursuant to a statutory mandate, NHTSA is examining the need for government standards or regulations regarding vehicle cybersecurity. However, officials estimated that the agency will not make a final determination on this need until at least 2018. Although NHTSA's stated goal is to stay ahead of potential vehicle-cybersecurity challenges, NHTSA has not yet formally defined and documented its roles and responsibilities in the event of a real-world cyberattack. Until it develops such a plan, in the event of a cyberattack, the agency's response efforts could be slowed as agency staff may not be able to quickly identify the appropriate actions to take."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOT define and document its roles and responsibilities in response to a vehicle cyberattack involving safety-critical systems.

We also  reviewed reports and met with agency officials from DOT, the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of  Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency within the Department of  Defense. For example, we reviewed a series of reports on vehicle  cybersecurity published by NHTSA in October 2014 and NIST\u2019s  Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. In  addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 selected  industry stakeholders, including 8 automakers; 8 automotive parts  suppliers; 3 vehicle cybersecurity firms that offer automotive cybersecurity  products; and 13 subject matter experts, including 7 leading vehicle- cybersecurity researchers. Automakers were selected to ensure we had  representation from each of the 3 major auto-producing regions of the  world (the U.S., Europe, and Asia) and the two U.S. industry associations  (the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global  Automakers) that were jointly pursuing several efforts related to vehicle  cybersecurity, such as the formation of an Automotive Information  Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC). We selected the top 5 automotive  parts suppliers based on global sales in 2013 and other suppliers based  on stakeholder recommendations. We also interviewed 3 automotive  cybersecurity firms that are offering vehicle cybersecurity products for  new and existing vehicles based on stakeholder recommendations. The  subject matter experts were identified through our literature search,  relevant industry conferences, stakeholder recommendations, and our  prior work on connected-vehicle technologies, and were considered  subject matter experts based on their job titles and experience, technical  papers and publications, contributions to relevant industry conferences  (e.g., speeches, presentations, and organizing roles), and other  significant contributions related to vehicle cybersecurity. Leading  researchers were identified from the group of subject matter experts as  those with extensive applied research experience in vehicle  cybersecurity.", "After conducting interviews with our 32 selected industry stakeholders, we  summarized and analyzed their responses to identify themes relevant to  each of our research objectives. The viewpoints gathered through our  interviews with selected industry stakeholders represent the viewpoints of  the individuals interviewed and cannot be generalized to a broader  population. Our interviews with selected industry stakeholders were  conducted, in part, during site visits in 2015 to Detroit, Michigan; Silicon  Valley, California; Brussels, Belgium, and various locations within  Germany. These site visit locations were selected largely based on the  location of our selected industry stakeholders and to ensure we obtained  a diverse range of perspectives, including those of U.S.-based and  foreign companies. To assess DOT\u2019s efforts to address vehicle  cybersecurity, we also reviewed (1) GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government; (2) NHTSA\u2019s documents regarding its  strategic planning and vehicle cybersecurity-research priorities, including  its Priority Plan for Vehicle Safety and Fuel Economy 2015\u20132017; (3)  NHTSA\u2019s request for public comment on automotive electronic control  systems safety and security issued in response to MAP-21  requirements; and (4) a mandated report to Congress that summarized  and analyzed the public comments NHTSA received, among other  things.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The number of annual fatalities and injuries due to motor vehicle crashes  has declined from 42,836 fatalities and 2.8 million injuries in 2004 to  32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injuries in 2014, although, according to  NHTSA, the rate of decline has leveled off in recent years. The decline in  fatalities and injuries over this time period is due in part to vehicle safety  features, such as airbags. Automakers have also been installing a  growing number of advanced technology features into vehicles to further  improve passenger safety as well as to enhance driver and passenger  convenience. For example, all vehicles manufactured starting in model  year 2012 contain an electronic stability control feature that uses on- board sensors to detect and reduce skidding and automatically takes  limited control from the driver to prevent the vehicle from leaving the  roadway. Similarly, some new vehicles offer forward collision warning  and automatic emergency-braking systems that use on-board sensors  and cameras to provide warnings to the driver and in some cases assist  the driver to prevent a crash from occurring. As NHTSA attributed 94  percent of highway crashes to human error in 2013, such technologies  could help continue the overall decline in motor vehicle fatalities over the  past decade. Driver and passenger convenience technologies include  built-in navigation systems, keyless entry and ignition systems, and  wireless Bluetooth capabilities, among other features.", "To support these and other advancements in technology, modern  vehicles contain a number of electronic systems and components that  have grown in number and complexity since they were first introduced  into vehicles in the late 1970s. For example, a vehicle manufactured in  the late 1970s contained basic electronic components to meet federal  emissions regulations, and by the 1980s, the engines in most new  vehicles were electronically controlled. Over time, these electronic  systems have begun to replace or control many of the traditional  mechanical systems in vehicles. In 2009, NHTSA reported that a typical  vehicle had around 50 embedded electronic control units (ECU)  responsible for executing both core vehicle functions such as steering, as  well as convenience and entertainment functions. By 2014 the agency  estimated that a typical vehicle contained between 70 and 100 ECUs. In  addition, over time, ECUs have evolved from controlling a single vehicle  function and operating in isolation from other components, to controlling  multiple vehicle functions and operating in conjunction with one another.", "To facilitate communication among multiple ECUs without the need for  complicated and extensive wiring systems, automakers began locating  ECUs on in-vehicle communication networks, commonly referred to as  buses or bus systems. According to NHTSA, the controller area network  (CAN), which was first developed in 1985, has become the most  commonly used in-vehicle communication network or bus; however, other  types of networks are used by some automakers. The CAN was  designed to ensure that ECUs within the vehicle could reliably and  expediently send messages to one another. The specific configuration of  CAN and other in-vehicle communication networks can vary widely  across automakers and even across different models produced by a  single automaker, depending on the number and types of features within  the vehicle. For example, automakers may locate all ECUs on a single in- vehicle network or include one network to support safety-critical vehicle  functions, such as steering and braking, and another network to support  convenience and entertainment systems. Figure 1 illustrates how in- vehicle communications networks reduce the need for wiring while  facilitating communication among ECUs.", "While the shift from mechanical to electronically-controlled vehicle  systems has helped improve the reliability and performance of certain  vehicle features and allowed automakers to introduce new safety and  \u201cinfotainment\u201d features that are popular with consumers, it has also  increased the potential for vehicles to be affected by cybersecurity  breaches more commonly associated with the information technology (IT)  and financial services industries. In particular, as the number of ECUs  and electronic systems in vehicles has increased, the prevalence of  software code in vehicles has also increased dramatically\u2014and in some  cases exponentially. DOT publications have indicated that a modern  luxury vehicle could contain as much as 100 million lines of software  code. In comparison, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner has about 6.5 million lines  of software code (see fig. 2). According to researchers and others, the  use of software in vehicles is likely to increase as more advanced vehicle  technologies and connected vehicle technologies are incorporated. As the  lines of software code in vehicles increases, so does the potential for  software errors, such as coding errors, and related vulnerabilities.", "According to NHTSA, in the context of motor vehicles, cybersecurity is the  protection of automotive electronic systems, communication networks,  control algorithms, software, users, and underlying data from malicious  attacks, damage, unauthorized access, or manipulation. Although no  vehicle cyberattacks impacting passenger safety have been reported  outside of the research environment, our previous work has shown that  the sources of cyber-threats vary in terms of the types and capabilities of  the actors, their willingness to act, and their motives. For example,  hackers break into networks for the thrill of the challenge, bragging rights  in the hacker community, and monetary gain, among other reasons,  whereas botnet operators use a network of compromised, remotely- controlled systems to, among other things, coordinate attacks, such as  denial-of-service attacks that prevent the authorized use of networks,  systems, or applications by exhausting resources. Still others, such as  nations may use cyber tools for information-gathering and espionage  activities, while terrorists may seek to cause harm or damage public  morale and confidence.", "Responsibility for ensuring the security of vehicle systems and  components spans across the automotive supply chain and occurs  throughout the vehicle development cycle. For example, automakers  define core vehicle design requirements, including software system  requirements, to automotive parts suppliers. In turn, automotive parts  suppliers assemble vehicle systems and often rely on lower-level  suppliers, such as chip manufacturers, to obtain the specific parts (i.e.,  hardware) for the vehicle systems. Each supplier is responsible for testing  and validating its specific product and certifying that its product meets  automaker specifications. Automakers may incorporate components from  multiple suppliers to assemble the vehicle and are ultimately responsible  for validating that safety-critical systems meet minimum performance  requirements and operate as intended.", "Within DOT, NHTSA is the primary agency responsible for vehicle safety.  NHTSA\u2019s mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce economic  costs due to road traffic crashes. NHTSA developed Federal Motor  Vehicle Safety Standards, which establish the minimum performance  requirements for certain safety features, such as brakes and air bags, to  which automakers must conform and certify compliance. NHTSA also  conducts research in support of vehicle safety programs. The Office of  Vehicle Safety Research conducts research in the areas of  crashworthiness, crash avoidance, and electronic controls research. The  electronic controls research\u2014which includes research in the areas of  electronics reliability, automated vehicles, and cybersecurity\u2014is  conducted by the Electronics Systems Safety Research Divisionand is  also supported by VRTC, the agency\u2019s in-house laboratory, in East  Liberty, Ohio. In fiscal year 2015, the Office of Vehicle Safety Research  had a budget of $29 million, of which $2.5 million was dedicated to  electronics and vehicle cybersecurity research. According to NHTSA  officials, as of July 2015, five full-time staff were dedicated to vehicle  cybersecurity, automation, and electronics research. In addition, NHTSA  has research under way related to cybersecurity for connected-vehicle  technologies, which, as previously mentioned, are expected to provide  safety benefits by deterring crashes.", "Several recent laws and legislative proposals have included provisions  related to vehicle cybersecurity. For example, MAP-21\u2014which was  signed into law in July of 2012\u2014directed NHTSA to, among other things,  complete an examination of the need for safety standards with regard to  electronic systems in passenger motor vehicles and to consider various  topics, such as the security needs for those electronic components to  prevent unauthorized access. The act also required NHTSA to seek  public comment in conducting its examination and to issue a report to  Congress on the highest priority areas for safety with regard to electronic  systems. In addition, the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act  (FAST Act), enacted in 2015, requires DOT to submit a report to  Congress on the operations of the Council for Vehicle Electronics, Vehicle  Software and Emerging Technologies (Electronics Council), which was  established in MAP-21 to provide a forum for research, rulemaking, and  enforcement officials to coordinate and share information internally on  advanced vehicle electronics and new technologies. Legislative  proposals related to ensuring vehicle cybersecurity have also been  introduced by members of Congress. For example, if passed, the Security  and Privacy in Your Car Act of 2015 would require NHTSA to establish a  \u201ccyber dashboard\u201d that displays an evaluation of how well each  automaker protects the security and privacy of vehicle owners and would  require automakers to adhere to government standards for vehicle  cybersecurity. The Security and Privacy in Your Car Study Act of 2015  would require NHTSA, along with some other federal agencies, to  conduct a study to determine the appropriate standards for the regulation  of vehicle cybersecurity.", "Finally, other federal agencies and foreign governments have also  conducted cybersecurity research, particularly as it relates to connected-  vehicle technologies, which are expected to increase the need for security  protections. For example, the European Union sponsored two major  projects examining the security of connected-vehicle technology  communications. These projects resulted in guidelines for the various  security elements needed for the deployment of connected-vehicle  technologies, such as message integrity, privacy protection, and  misbehavior detection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remote Attacks Involving Safety- Critical Vehicle Systems Could Have the Greatest Impact on Passenger Safety", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cyberattacks through Direct and Remote Access Are Possible, but Remote Attacks Are of Most Concern to Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of research and industry stakeholder views,  modern vehicles contain multiple interfaces\u2014connections between the  vehicle and external networks\u2014that if not properly secured, can become  entry points\u2014or attack paths\u2014for cyber attackers.

This port is mandated in passenger  vehicles by regulation for emissions-testing purposes and to facilitate  diagnostic assessments by auto dealers, repair shops, and car owners.  In addition to being prevalent in modern vehicles, this port also provides  direct and largely unrestricted access to in-vehicle communication  networks. Thus, it can provide an attacker with sufficient access to  compromise the full range of a vehicle\u2019s systems, including safety-critical  systems, such as the brakes and steering wheel.

Such attacks could involve multiple  vehicles and cause widespread impacts including passenger injuries or  fatalities. For example, two stakeholders told us that through remote  attacks, cyber attackers could theoretically achieve massive attacks of  multiple vehicles simultaneously. Half of the selected industry  stakeholders (16 out of 32) emphasized that long-range wireless  interfaces, such as cellular connections on the telematics unit, are  especially concerning. Through such interfaces, the cyber attacker could  theoretically exploit vulnerabilities to access the target vehicles from  anywhere in the world and take control over the vehicles\u2019 safety-critical  systems.", "Researchers have played a key role in publicly demonstrating that remote  vehicle cyberattacks that impact safety are possible, because of  vulnerabilities in modern vehicles. For example, in a hacking  demonstration first reported in 2011, researchers from the University of  Washington and University of California San Diego first demonstrated the  ability to remotely attack multiple vehicles\u2019 safety-critical systems through  short- and long-range wireless channels without physical access to the  target vehicles. In this demonstration, the researchers studied two  General Motors (GM) vehicles, gaining an in-depth understanding of the  vehicles\u2019 systems, including the software code underlying various vehicle  components and the CAN messages used to send commands between  the ECUs that control the vehicle\u2019s systems. After gaining access to a  target vehicle\u2019s CAN bus by exploiting software vulnerabilities in multiple  wireless interfaces\u2014including GM\u2019s OnStar telematics system and the  Bluetooth unit\u2014the researchers were able to inject messages onto the  vehicle\u2019s CAN bus to take physical control over the vehicle, such as  controlling the display on the speedometer, shutting off the engine, and  controlling the brakes.", "The researchers also showed that by exploiting vulnerabilities in the  implementation of a telematics system\u2014which connects participating  vehicles via a cellular connection to a backend server maintained by the  automaker\u2014it would be possible to compromise multiple vehicles  simultaneously. In this demonstration, the researchers exploited  vulnerabilities in the communication protocols of GM\u2019s OnStar system in  order to send commands to the CAN buses of their two test vehicles.  For safety reasons, the researchers only sent commands to take control  of their test vehicles and only when these vehicles were in secured  environments. However, if carried out by a cyber attacker, such an attack  could have safety impacts on multiple vehicles. The researchers also  demonstrated vulnerabilities in several other interfaces\u2014including the  Bluetooth unit\u2014that could be exploited to send messages on the CAN  bus and thereby take control over the vehicle\u2019s safety-critical systems  (see fig. 4 for an overview of the researchers\u2019 hacking demonstration  involving the Bluetooth unit).", "In another example\u2014the aforementioned Jeep Cherokee hacking  demonstration reported in 2015\u2014researchers exploited several  vulnerabilities that allowed them to remotely disable a vehicle\u2019s engine  and in some cases control the brakes and steering. Similar to the 2011  GM demonstration, the researchers closely studied a test vehicle to  understand its systems\u2014including the characteristics of its software code  and CAN messages\u2014and showed it would be possible to remotely attack  target vehicles with the same vulnerabilities as the test vehicle. Also, the  researchers showed that it would be possible to exploit vulnerabilities in  the implementation of a telematics system to target multiple vehicles  participating in the telematics service. This demonstration involved  multiple steps and identified a chain of vulnerabilities related to the  vehicle\u2019s network architecture, the telematics unit, and the cellular  provider\u2019s implementation of the vehicle\u2019s telematics service (see fig.5 for  an overview of this hacking demonstration).", "In addition, researchers have demonstrated that wireless telematics  devices that consumers can plug into OBD-II ports to provide vehicle data  to third parties, such as insurance companies, contain vulnerabilities that  can be exploited remotely. By using these devices\u2014often referred to as  \u201cdongles\u201d\u2014consumers may qualify for decreased insurance rates. Also,  these dongles can provide older vehicles lacking built-in wireless  interfaces with connectivity, allowing consumers to access telematics  features\u2014such as long-range cellular connectivity\u2014that would otherwise  only be available through purchasing a modern vehicle with a built-in  telematics unit. Since, as previously mentioned, the OBD-II port connects  directly to the key in-vehicle systems, an attack on such dongles could  enable an attacker to take control of safety-critical systems and turn what  was formerly a direct attack path into a remote attack path. For example,  a recent demonstration showed that a particular manufacturer\u2019s dongles  can be discovered online and then compromised by a remote attacker.  The researchers were able to exploit vulnerabilities of the dongle,  allowing them to send messages to the vehicle\u2019s CAN buses, including  messages to remotely apply and disable the brakes. Other  demonstrations have shown similar vulnerabilities in other dongles.", "Notably, each of the above hacking demonstrations illustrate that some  overarching characteristics of the CAN bus make it more likely that a  vehicle cyberattack launched through any interface\u2014including non- safety-critical systems, such as the telematics unit\u2014could impact safety.  Specifically, these hacking demonstrations highlight a major security  weakness of CAN: it assumes that any message on the bus is sent from a  trusted sender, so messages are not secured or restricted in any way. In  other words, these demonstrations help illustrate that because of the  CAN\u2019s design, there is no way to know whether a given message on the  CAN bus originates from a legitimate source or from a cyber attacker. As  previously noted, the CAN was designed in 1985, which was long before  vehicles were connected to external networks and vehicle cybersecurity  was an issue facing the auto industry. Despite its inherent security  weaknesses, CAN is the most commonly used bus system in the auto  industry today."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Acknowledge That Remote Attacks Are Difficult to Execute, but Expressed Concern about the Future Potential for Such Attacks", "paragraphs": ["While the possibility that remote cyberattacks could occur outside the  research environment is concerning, some of the selected industry  stakeholders we spoke to (8 out of 32) have also pointed out that attacks  comparable to the hacking demonstrations described above would be  complex to execute. Specifically, most of these stakeholders noted that  such attacks would likely require a high level of hacking sophistication,  including specialized knowledge. For example, as previously mentioned,  the researchers involved in the GM and Jeep hacking demonstrations had  prolonged access to test vehicles, which they used to closely study the  vehicles\u2019 systems and key components. In another example,  representatives from a cybersecurity firm noted that one very difficult step  in such demonstrations is figuring out how to create authentic-looking  messages that will be accepted and acted upon by the vehicle\u2019s ECUs. In  addition, one leading researcher predicted that those who would execute  remote cyberattacks would be those with previous experience hacking  into other computer systems; for someone with no such experience,  hacking into a vehicle remotely would be very difficult.", "To date, there have been no remote cyberattacks with safety impacts  reported outside of the research environment. In addition, determining the  risk that such a remote cyberattack will occur in the near future is  challenging, especially because of the difficulty of predicting the actions of  cyber attackers and since modern vehicles\u2019 designs vary widely (with  some vehicle makes and models more vulnerable than others to such an  attack). However, most selected industry stakeholders we interviewed (26  out of 32) expressed concerns that real-world attacks with safety  implications could occur in the near future, particularly as automakers  begin deploying autonomous (i.e., self-driving) vehicles and connected-  vehicle technologies. For instance, some stakeholders expressed  concerns that as vehicles become increasingly autonomous\u2013and assume  control of more functions traditionally controlled by the driver such as  steering and braking\u2014it could become easier for remote cyberattacks to  reach vehicles\u2019 safety-critical systems. This is because autonomous  vehicles\u2019 systems will be tightly linked and highly responsive to inputs  from external systems, such as sensors and the Global Positioning  System, much more so than they currently are today. Also, DOT and the  auto industry are planning to implement connected-vehicle technologies  in coming years. These technologies are envisioned to further connect  vehicles to one another and infrastructure, such as traffic signals, to  increase safety overall. For example, vehicle-to-vehicle technologies  would allow nearby vehicles to share data, such as information on vehicle  speed and location, to warn drivers of and thereby help prevent imminent  collisions. However, some stakeholders expressed concerns that cyber  attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the larger wireless networks used  to facilitate these technologies to remotely cyberattack multiple vehicles  simultaneously and take control over their safety-critical systems, which  could result in accidents or other safety impacts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Variety of Key Practices and Technologies Are Available to Mitigate Vehicle Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and the Impacts of Potential Attacks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Practices Used by Other Industries Are Available for Use in the Auto Industry", "paragraphs": ["Selected industry stakeholders informed us that a range of key practices  are available to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities  in vehicles. For instance, stakeholders frequently cited key practices  used by other industries with a longer history of cybersecurity concerns,  such as the IT industry\u2019s use of penetration testing and code reviews (see  table 1). In addition, when NHTSA published A Summary of Cybersecurity  Best Practices in 2014, it drew from existing practices used in other  industries, including the IT, aviation, telecommunications, industrial  control systems, energy, medical devices, and financial payments  industries. Although the key practices identified by NHTSA were  generally broader, higher-level practices than those identified by our  selected industry stakeholders, there were some similarities. For  example, both NHTSA and our selected industry stakeholders  emphasized the importance of risk assessments in mitigating  cybersecurity vulnerabilities.", "According to some stakeholders we interviewed, the auto industry\u2019s  adoption of cybersecurity key practices varies by company and some  companies are farther along with respect to following key practices than  others. Some stakeholders pointed to the relative newness of  cybersecurity in the automotive realm to explain why some companies  are still building up their organizational capacity to address cybersecurity  issues and developing or refining cybersecurity practices. In addition,  some stakeholders also opined that until very recently some companies\u2014 primarily automakers\u2014have been reluctant to accept vehicle cyberattacks  as a real threat and take the necessary steps in response.", "One of the key practices mentioned most frequently\u2014by 23 of the 32  selected industry stakeholders we interviewed\u2014related to developing  capabilities to conduct remote, over-the-air (OTA) updates of vehicle  software and firmware (see table 1). Some of these stakeholders pointed  to OTA updates as an essential piece of automakers\u2019 response  capabilities as they would allow automakers to quickly and effectively  respond to cybersecurity incidents if and when they occur. However,  based on our interviews, only a few automakers have OTA update  capabilities, and only one\u2014Tesla\u2014can update all systems, including  safety-critical and non-safety critical systems, on a fleet-wide basis  remotely. Representatives from one automaker explained that their  company does not yet conduct OTA updates because this capability  involves hiring new staff and developing a whole new IT infrastructure to  ensure that these updates do not become a new remote attack path into  their vehicles.", "The concept of domain separation was also identified as a key practice by  the majority of selected industry stakeholders we spoke with (22 out of  32). Several automakers informed us that their companies have been  following this key practice for 7 or more years. For example, one German  automaker informed us that the company adopted this practice in the late  1990s as more functions in the vehicle became electronically controlled  and infotainment systems and telematics units were introduced into  vehicles; however, company representatives explained that the  company\u2019s initial motivation was to ensure system stability, not to mitigate  vehicle cyberattacks. In addition, several stakeholders suggested that the  FCA hacking demonstration might not have had such significant safety  impacts if the Jeep model involved had exhibited a greater degree of  domain separation. Despite general agreement that domain separation  can be a very effective mitigation strategy, some stakeholders pointed out  that complete isolation or segregation is often not possible or practical  because some limited communication will likely need to occur between  safety-critical and non-safety-critical systems. For example, in some  vehicles the infotainment system needs to receive information regarding  the vehicle\u2019s speed to keep the volume at a consistent level.", "Other key practices that were mentioned by several selected industry  stakeholders, but less frequently than those described in table 1, include  having dedicated organizational resources specifically focused on  cybersecurity, such as creating new cybersecurity divisions or high-level  managerial positions, and developing responsible disclosure policies that  facilitate communication and collaboration with researchers and other  third parties who may identify vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities. For  example, some stakeholders noted that responsible disclosure policies  are used by large IT companies, such as Microsoft, to encourage  researchers and others to report any software vulnerabilities that they  identify in the company\u2019s products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Technologies Can Be Incorporated at Multiple Vehicle Security Layers", "paragraphs": ["Selected industry stakeholders informed us of several technologies that  can help automakers and parts suppliers mitigate vehicle cybersecurity  vulnerabilities and the impacts of potential cyberattacks (see table 2). As  noted above, these stakeholders identified \u201cimplementing a layered  approach to security\u201d as a key practice. In other words, they noted that  vehicle cybersecurity is enhanced as mitigation technologies are added at  more layers, including the ECU layer, the in-vehicle network layer (e.g.,  CAN bus), and the external interfaces layer (e.g., telematics unit). In  addition, in its white paper NHTSA and Vehicle Cybersecurity, NHTSA  states that a layered approach to vehicle cybersecurity reduces the  probability of attack and mitigates the potential ramifications of a  successful intrusion.", "Notably, most of the technologies identified by selected industry  stakeholders we spoke with cannot be added on existing vehicles; rather,  they must be incorporated into the vehicle design and production process,  which as we describe later in this report, takes approximately 5 years to  complete. The one exception is intrusion detection and prevention  systems: several companies that are marketing these products for in- vehicle networks informed us that they have also developed aftermarket  versions of their products that can be incorporated onto existing vehicles.  In addition, most of the technologies identified by stakeholders serve to  mitigate the inherent security weakness of CAN, which is that messages  transmitted over a CAN bus are generally free flowing and not secured or  restricted in any way. For example, a firewall placed between two in- vehicle networks can be set up to prevent the passage of any message  that is not on a pre-determined list of approved messages (i.e., a \u201cwhite  list\u201d). Figure 6 below depicts how firewalls and some of the other  technologies listed in the table above can help mitigate vehicle  cyberattacks.", "Based on our interviews with selected industry stakeholders, automakers  are still determining whether and how to implement some technologies  that can help identify and mitigate vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities  and reduce the impacts of potential cyberattacks. For example, several  stakeholders expressed skepticism about the usefulness and  effectiveness of intrusion detection and prevention systems\u2014especially  detection-only systems\u2014and stated that these systems merit further  testing before they are widely deployed on in-vehicle networks. In  addition, as noted above, CAN has become the most commonly used in- vehicle network that facilitates communication among ECUs. However,  one mitigation option\u2014message authentication and encryption\u2014cannot  be easily incorporated onto CAN buses, as CAN does not provide  sufficient bandwidth to host these protections. Some stakeholders  informed us that this option is more feasible for higher-bandwidth  networks, such as Ethernet, but noted that these networks are currently  less prevalent than CAN and likely to remain less prevalent for some time  given the costs associated with vehicle re-designs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Face Challenges Related to Vehicle Cybersecurity, Some of Which May Be Addressed by Industry-Led Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Several Challenges Facing the Industry Related to Vehicle Cybersecurity", "paragraphs": ["The most frequently cited set of challenges facing the industry in ensuring  vehicle cybersecurity\u2014mentioned by 15 of the 32 selected industry  stakeholders we spoke with\u2014was the lack of transparency,  communication, and collaboration regarding vehicles\u2019 cybersecurity  among the various players in the automotive supply chain, as described  in the following examples.", "Several parts suppliers informed us that the security requirements  they receive from automakers often lack sufficient context about the  broader component or system. For example, one supplier stated that,  ideally, automakers should provide specific security requirements  (e.g., \u201cencrypt data X using encryption mechanism Y\u201d), as well as their  higher-level system functionality, security, and protection goals, such  as \u201censure data confidentiality of function Z.\u201d Suppliers stated that  with sufficient information, they could more readily identify potential  cybersecurity issues and recommend alternative protections and  enhancements.", "Some stakeholders also noted that it can be difficult for automakers to  oversee and exert control over suppliers\u2019 software code. They  explained that because suppliers\u2019 code is proprietary, the automakers  do not have access to it and suppliers are reluctant to share it. One  subject matter expert noted that as a result, all the automakers can  really know about the code is how it performs when tested under  certain conditions. In addition, one automaker noted that it can be  especially challenging to exert control over third parties that  manufacture dongles that plug into the OBD-II port for vehicle tracking  and other purposes. They explained that while dongles have been  shown to compromise vehicle cybersecurity, automakers are unable  to set security requirements for these devices, as dongle  manufacturers are not technically part of the automotive supply chain.", "Highlighting the lack of transparency and collaboration that exists among  the players in the automotive supply chain, one leading researcher we  spoke with stated that \u201cthe most important and interesting commonality\u201d  with respect to the vulnerabilities identified in his research was that the  vulnerabilities were located precisely at the interfaces where software  code written by different supply chain players has to interact.", "Another set of challenges cited by 13 of the 32 selected industry  stakeholders was the cost of incorporating cybersecurity protections into  vehicles. Some stakeholders informed us that profit margins for  passenger vehicles are relatively narrow; as a result, even seemingly  small modifications to enhance cybersecurity\u2014such as using hardware  with added security protections\u2014can potentially be cost prohibitive to  some automakers. Yet, according to some stakeholders, some  automakers will likely have to pursue larger-scale changes\u2014such as  redesigning their in-vehicle communication networks\u2014to significantly  enhance the cybersecurity of their vehicles. Although many stakeholders  declined to provide specific cost estimates, there was general agreement  that these larger-scale changes would comprise a major upfront expense,  which ultimately contributes to automakers\u2019 continued reliance on legacy  systems with inherent security weaknesses, such as CAN. In addition,  stakeholders noted that automakers may not be able to pass the costs of  cybersecurity protections onto consumers as they can with other features,  such as connectivity and convenience features. As a result, automakers  will have to balance the cost of cybersecurity protections against the risks  facing vehicles and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay.", "Some stakeholders (13 of 32) also identified challenges related to the  auto industry\u2019s historical lack of cybersecurity expertise and companies\u2019  efforts to build up their expertise in this area. According to stakeholders,  the existing pool of candidates with the specific mix of knowledge and  skills needed to design and validate secure vehicle systems is small. One  automaker explained that due to the shortage of automotive cybersecurity  professionals, the company often has to decide whether to hire hardware  and software professionals and teach them cybersecurity or cybersecurity  professionals and teach them hardware and software. In addition, one  leading researcher mentioned that the lack of automotive cybersecurity  professionals in particular\u2014combined with a shortage of cybersecurity  professionals more broadly\u2014produces competition for top talent both  within the industry and with major technology companies, such as  Google. However, automakers are taking some steps to address these  challenges. For example, several automakers informed us that they have  begun partnering with colleges and universities to develop college  curriculums that better meet their needs, and several U.S. and foreign  automakers have opened technology and research and development  centers in Silicon Valley, in part to be closer to the area\u2019s high  concentration of IT and cybersecurity professionals.", "Finally, 12 of the 32 selected industry stakeholders we spoke with  informed us that the auto industry\u2019s long product development cycle  creates challenges related to ensuring vehicle cybersecurity. According to  some of these stakeholders, vehicles are designed approximately 5 years  before they roll off of the assembly line. As a result, to the extent that  automakers incorporated cybersecurity protections in their 2015 model  year vehicles, these protections would have been based on technology\u2014 as well as threat information\u2014available in 2010. One stakeholder  suggested that this lag can make it easier for cyber attackers to  understand and breach vehicles\u2019 cyber protections and more difficult for  automakers to ensure their vehicles are protected against the latest  known threats. Other challenges that were mentioned by several selected  industry stakeholders, but less frequently than those cited above, include  identifying and assessing vehicle cybersecurity threats and risks and  measuring the performance and effectiveness of cybersecurity  protections. For example, stakeholders noted that there are no widely  accepted cybersecurity performance metrics, and it is difficult to prove  that a vehicle with up to 100 million lines of code is secure.

Of those stakeholders who discussed NHTSA\u2019s  research in this area, the majority (10 out of 18) told us that its research  focus and prioritization are appropriate. For example, according to some  stakeholders in our review, the research reports NHTSA issued in 2014  provide helpful background on the issue of vehicle cybersecurity.  Specifically, representatives from one automaker told us that they use the  report on characterizing vehicle cybersecurity threats to make their own  determinations about how to respond to identified vulnerabilities.  However, six selected industry stakeholders told us that NHTSA could  improve its research prioritization in this area. For example, two  stakeholders noted that NHTSA has not dedicated enough resources to  this important issue. In another example, two other stakeholders stated  that NHTSA\u2019s efforts to recreate the Jeep Cherokee hacking  demonstration are not useful since such efforts are more reactive than  proactive. However, VRTC staff told us that recreating this hacking  demonstration allowed them to determine that the initial steps that FCA  took to mitigate the vulnerabilities were not successful and additional  steps needed to be taken.", "NHTSA officials told us that their ability to conduct additional research is  in part dependent on funding and resources the agency receives for  vehicle cybersecurity and other priority research areas. In recent years,  the agency has requested an increase in funding to support additional  staff in the Office of Vehicle Safety Research, in part to conduct additional  cybersecurity research, but actual funding received was lower than  requested. For example, in fiscal year 2015, NHTSA requested $36.8  million for the Office of Vehicle Safety Research but received $29 million;  this sum was about a $4 million decrease from the $32.5 million the Office  received for fiscal year 2014. NHTSA officials told us that due to the  2015\u2019s funding being lower than requested, they had to make difficult  decisions and forgo other planned projects in order to carve out the $2.5  million that was ultimately dedicated to electronics and vehicle  cybersecurity research in fiscal year 2015. This amount was still a  decrease from the $2.7 million dedicated to this area in fiscal year 2014.  Despite lower funding levels, officials told us they have been able to  leverage resources from other programs, such as by using test vehicles  for the New Car Assessment Program for cybersecurity research. To  build on its ongoing research, the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget  requested $1 million for additional space and new equipment at VRTC, as  well as $4.1 million to enhance a program on vehicle electronics and  emerging technologies. In addition to the applied research it conducts,  officials also told us that they attend cybersecurity conferences where  researchers present findings on vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities and  participate in various working groups, such as serving as a liaison on SAE  International committees, to enhance their understanding of vehicle  cybersecurity issues. Finally, NHTSA collaborates in relevant research  efforts led by other federal agencies.

According to NHTSA officials, the differing conclusions reached  by NHTSA and FCA regarding the need for a recall in the aftermath of the  Jeep Cherokee hacking demonstration, underscored the need for this  guidance. While the guidance is not yet complete, NHTSA officials  informed us that they intend to create a document that provides a  framework and educates the industry on the methodology NHTSA uses  and the factors it considers when assessing risks associated with  cybersecurity vulnerabilities in order to make safety defect and recall  determinations. According to NHTSA officials, factors such as the number  of affected vehicles, frequency of occurrence, likelihood of exploitation,  and the resulting hazard level (i.e., impacts to safety-critical systems) can  be important when assessing risk and making safety defect  determinations; these and other factors will be explained in the guidance.  For example, the officials noted that NHTSA would be particularly  concerned with identified vulnerabilities that would enable a cyber  attacker to manipulate the safety-critical systems of multiple vehicles.

In addition to being helpful to the industry, such guidance  could also help NHTSA respond to identified vulnerabilities more  consistently. For example, several stakeholders noted that while NHTSA  requested that FCA conduct a recall in response to the 2015 Jeep  Cherokee hacking demonstration, it did not request a recall in response to  the GM hacking demonstration in 2011, despite the fact that both  demonstrations revealed similar vulnerabilities that allowed researchers  to remotely control the vehicle\u2019s safety-critical functions. NHTSA officials  informed us that due to staffing changes that have occurred since 2011,  they could not confirm why the two similar hacking demonstrations were  handled differently. However, they noted that the Jeep Cherokee  researchers planned to publicly report more details about the identified  vulnerabilities than the GM researchers had reported; and that the  release of such details could have allowed cyber attackers to replicate the  Jeep Cherokee demonstration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHTSA Has Established a Vehicle Electronics Council and Is Assessing the Need for Vehicle Cybersecurity Standards and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA is taking steps in response to the requirements set forth in MAP- 21, including establishing an Electronics Council and assessing the need  for vehicle cybersecurity standards and regulations.

More  specifically, NHTSA officials informed us that the Council\u2019s mission is to  broaden, leverage, and expand the agency\u2019s expertise in vehicle  electronics to continue ensuring that these technologies enhance vehicle  safety. NHTSA officials told us that the Council\u2019s membership includes  staff from NHTSA\u2019s Office of Vehicle Safety Research and other offices  responsible for the agency\u2019s vehicle safety work.

NHTSA  officials also informed us that the Council\u2019s meetings can serve as a  forum for collaboration between the agency and industry stakeholders.  For example, they said that the Council sometimes invites outside subject  matter experts to share information with NHTSA during its bimonthly  meetings, or recommends other training by such experts that would be  helpful for NHTSA staff to attend.", "Although NHTSA has taken some steps to examine the need for safety  standards for electronic control systems as required by MAP-21, which  could include government standards related to vehicle cybersecurity,  officials informed us the agency\u2019s examination is still ongoing. As part of  its examination, NHTSA is considering establishing process standards,  which would prescribe specific processes for developing vehicle  electronic systems. This step would be a departure from NHTSA\u2019s current  approach of developing performance standards, such as the Federal  Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which set a specific level of performance  but do not prescribe specific methods that must be used to meet a given  standard. In October 2014, NHTSA issued a request for public comment  to help inform its examination of the need for safety standards for  electronic control systems, including the need for cybersecurity  standards. Among other things, NHTSA requested comments on  available performance standards and process standards, such as ISO  26262, that could potentially be adapted and incorporated into  government standards to address vehicle cybersecurity. In January 2016,  NHTSA issued a report that summarized its analysis of the public  comments it received, including industry stakeholders\u2019 thoughts on the  need for voluntary industry standards as well as government standards  pertaining to vehicle cybersecurity. In this report, NHTSA noted that  most of the 40 stakeholders that submitted comments agreed that vehicle  cybersecurity is a dynamic, complex problem that may not be effectively  addressed with the use of \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201cprescriptive\u201d government standards.", "Half of the selected industry stakeholders we spoke with (16 out of 32)  also expressed doubts about the effectiveness of \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201cprescriptive\u201d  government standards to address vehicle cybersecurity, since threats are  constantly changing and such standards could become outdated quickly.  In addition, some stakeholders expressed concerns that regulations could  result in unintended negative consequences for cybersecurity, similar to  several existing laws and regulations. For example, as noted above, the  OBD-II port\u2014which many stakeholders identified as a key entry point for  vehicle cyberattacks\u2014is mandated by regulation for diagnostic and  testing purposes. As a result, several automakers told us that they have  limited ability to restrict access to in-vehicle networks and systems  provided by the port; however, one informed us that it was exploring what  types of OBD-II port restrictions and protections would be legally allowed.  Two automakers also expressed concerns about potential negative  impacts for vehicle cybersecurity that could stem from recent changes to  regulations implementing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In  general, this act prohibits access to and circumvention of protections  associated with digital copyrighted materials; however, in 2015, the act\u2019s  regulations were amended to include exemptions for vehicle software  accessed for diagnostic and repair purposes and \u201cgood faith\u201d research.  For example, one industry association that opposed the change stated  that increasing access to vehicle software will make it harder for  automakers to develop effective protections for their vehicles\u2019 cyber  systems. However, two leading researchers we interviewed opined that  these changes will help mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities, as they will  allow more researchers to identify vulnerabilities without fear of legal  action.", "On the other hand, some selected industry stakeholders (13 out of 32)  told us that voluntary industry standards alone would be insufficient for  ensuring vehicle cybersecurity and that thus some government standards  and federal oversight will be needed. For example, one subject matter  expert suggested that\u2014contrary to current self-certification practices that  are common in the auto industry\u2014NHTSA should establish an oversight  body to evaluate automakers\u2019 compliance with any cybersecurity-related  standards it issues and verify that these standards are being met. In  addition, another expert noted that this kind of oversight process could  help promote the use of best practices while also providing NHTSA with  additional assurance that the automotive supply chain is secure. Both  experts noted that as part of this process, NHTSA could turn to qualified  independent third parties to assess whether automakers are taking the  proper steps for vehicle cybersecurity.", "According to NHTSA officials and the agency\u2019s Priority Plan for Vehicle  Safety and Fuel Economy, 2015-2017, the agency plans to complete its  initial research on vehicle cybersecurity in 2016 and also announce an  agency decision about next steps pertaining to vehicle cybersecurity and  other issues related to electronic control systems. The decision could be  to conduct more research, initiate a rulemaking, issue guidance, or some  combination thereof. As of July 2015, officials estimated that the agency  was about 3 years away from making a final determination about the  need for additional government standards or regulation in this area; thus,  such a final determination is not expected until at least 2018. NHTSA  officials explained that this time frame is necessary in part, because they  expect several research projects that are planned and under way to help  inform their decision. In addition, NHTSA officials informed us that as they  determine the need for regulations, they want to better understand  alternative steps such as the development of voluntary industry standards  that could be taken to address this issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHTSA Has Not Yet Defined and Documented Its Roles and Responsibilities in Responding to a Vehicle Cyberattack", "paragraphs": ["In its whitepaper NHTSA and Vehicle Cybersecurity, NHTSA states that  its goal is to \u201cbe ahead of potential vehicle cybersecurity challenges, and  seek ways to address or avoid them altogether.\u201d As described above,  NHTSA has made progress in many areas in an effort to proactively  address potential cybersecurity threats to vehicle safety-critical systems;  however, NHTSA has not yet formally defined and documented the  agency\u2019s role and responsibilities in the event of a real-world vehicle  cyberattack and how the agency\u2019s response actions would be coordinated  with other federal agencies. Given that NHTSA and selected industry  stakeholders we spoke with generally agreed that the threat of a vehicle  cyberattack will increase as autonomous and connected-vehicle  technologies are deployed in the coming years, such a response plan  may be particularly important for NHTSA to develop proactively, before  the threat environment significantly changes. Until such a plan is  developed, NHTSA\u2019s response efforts\u2014regardless of the threat  environment in which an attack is carried out\u2014could be slowed as  agency staff and other stakeholders may not be able to quickly identify  the appropriate actions that NHTSA should take. In addition, the lack of  such a response plan is inconsistent with federal standards for internal  control, which\u2014among other things\u2014are intended to help agencies in  managing change associated with shifting environments and evolving  demands and priorities. Under these federal standards, agencies are  required to appropriately and clearly document their internal controls,  which include the policies, plans, methods, and procedures used to meet  agency missions, goals, and objectives; and assess risks.", "NHTSA officials offered several roles and responsibilities they believe the  agency would have in response to a vehicle cyberattack involving safety- critical systems, including quickly contacting the appropriate industry  personnel and determining what actions need to be taken, such as  regulatory or enforcement action, a Direct Final Rule, or other action. In  addition, NHTSA officials told us that the agency would also validate the  feasibility of the cybersecurity threat or event at its VRTC and take steps  to ensure that any new information regarding threats and vulnerabilities is  reflected in NHTSA\u2019s research program. However, NHTSA officials told  us that these roles have not been outlined in a formal response plan yet,  in part because the agency currently lacks clarity regarding other roles  and responsibilities it may have to fulfill in the event of an attack. For  example, according to NHTSA officials, it is currently unclear whether  NHTSA or DHS would be \u201cthe responsible agency\u201d in charge of the  government\u2019s response if a large-scale vehicle cyberattack on safety- critical systems were to occur.", "According to NHTSA officials, the agency is working with other federal  agencies, such as DHS, to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the  various agencies that would be involved in responding to a vehicle  cyberattack. NHTSA officials informed us that these interagency  discussions are still ongoing and could not provide a time frame as to  when they expect the discussions\u2014and subsequently, a plan outlining  NHTSA\u2019s roles and responsibilities in the event of an attack\u2014to be  completed. However, NHTSA officials stated that obtaining clarification on  its roles and responsibilities in the event of a cyberattack on safety-critical  vehicle systems is a priority for the agency, and in their view, a response  plan would be a useful tool for the agency to develop."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, researchers have played an instrumental role in  demonstrating that remote vehicle cyberattacks with safety implications  are possible and increasing overall awareness about vehicle  cybersecurity issues among consumers, the media, and the general  public. Despite awareness of risks related to vehicle cybersecurity since  at least 2011, the auto industry and NHTSA have only recently sharpened  their focus on this issue. As this report describes, NHTSA has taken  several important steps since 2012 to address vehicle cybersecurity,  including establishing a vehicle-cybersecurity research program and  soliciting industry input on the need for government and voluntary industry  standards. However, NHTSA does not anticipate making a final  determination on the need for government standards until 2018 when  additional cybersecurity research is expected to be completed. In  addition, several industry efforts to address vehicle cybersecurity\u2014such  as the development of an Automotive ISAC and a voluntary design and  engineering process standard for cybersecurity\u2014are still in their early  stages. As such, some of these government and industry efforts to  address vehicle cybersecurity are unlikely to provide many benefits for  vehicles already operating on the roads today or those currently in the  design and production stages.", "Given that NHTSA and industry stakeholders expect the threat of a  vehicle cyberattack to increase in the coming years as autonomous and  connected-vehicle technologies are deployed, it will be important for  NHTSA to continue to take proactive steps in the interim to ensure that it  is meeting the agency\u2019s goal of being ahead of vehicle cybersecurity  challenges. The agency\u2019s planned guidance outlining when cybersecurity  vulnerabilities constitute safety defects should help ensure consistent  responses when cybersecurity vulnerabilities are identified. However, until  NHTSA defines and documents the agency\u2019s role and responsibilities in  the event of a real-world vehicle cyberattack affecting safety-critical  systems, it may not be in a position to quickly and effectively respond  should a threat materialize."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the agency\u2019s ability to effectively respond in the event of a  real-world vehicle cyberattack, the Secretary of Transportation should  direct NHTSA to: work expeditiously to finish defining and then to document the  agency\u2019s roles and responsibilities in response to a vehicle  cyberattack involving safety-critical systems, including how  NHTSA would coordinate with other federal agencies and  stakeholders involved in the response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Transportation  (DOT), Homeland Security, Defense, and Commerce for review and  comment.

For example, we reviewed a series of reports on vehicle  cybersecurity published by NHTSA in October 2014. We also  interviewed officials from several NHTSA offices, including the Office of  Vehicle Safety Research and Office of Enforcement and the Volpe  National Transportation Systems Center. In addition, we reviewed  previous GAO reports related to connected-vehicle technologies,  information technology (IT), and cybersecurity, and identified and  reviewed relevant research papers and publications. The reviewed  citations were located through searches in bibliographic databases,  including Transport Research International Documentation and  SciSearch, or relevant industry conferences. We used three research  papers to inform our findings regarding the potential for remote vehicle  cyberattacks to impact passenger safety. We reviewed and summarized  these research papers to identify the main steps of the hacking  demonstrations and discussed them with the researchers to obtain  additional information and clarification about the demonstrations.", "In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 selected  industry stakeholders, including 8 automakers, 8 automotive parts  suppliers, 3 automotive cybersecurity firms offering vehicle cybersecurity  products, and 13 subject matter experts, including 7 leading researchers  (see table 4). These interviews informed all four of our objectives.  Automakers were selected to ensure we had representation from each of  the 3 major auto-producing regions of the world (the U.S., Europe, and  Asia) and the two U.S. industry associations (the Alliance of Automobile  Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers) that were  jointly pursuing several efforts related to vehicle cybersecurity, such as  the formation of an Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (ISAC). We also sought to include automakers that were considered  leaders in vehicle cybersecurity as well as those that had been the  subjects of cybersecurity hacking demonstrations. We selected the top 5  automotive parts suppliers based on global sales in 2013 and other  suppliers based on stakeholder recommendations. We also interviewed  3 automotive cybersecurity firms that are offering vehicle cybersecurity  products for new and existing vehicles based on stakeholder  recommendations. The subject matter experts were identified through our  literature search, relevant industry conferences, stakeholder  recommendations, and our prior work on connected-vehicle technologies,  and were considered subject matter experts based on their job titles and  experience, technical papers and publications, contributions to relevant  industry conferences (e.g., speeches, presentations, and organizing  roles), and other significant contributions related to vehicle cybersecurity  (e.g., contracted to conduct vehicle cybersecurity research for federal  agencies). We identified leading researchers from the group of subject  matter experts as those with extensive applied research experience in  vehicle cybersecurity. After conducting our interviews with selected  industry stakeholders, we summarized and analyzed their responses to  identify themes relevant to each of our research objectives, such as  themes regarding the main vehicle interfaces that could be used to  undertake vehicle cyberattacks. The viewpoints gathered through our  interviews with selected industry stakeholders represent the viewpoints of  the individuals interviewed and cannot be generalized to a broader  population.", "To identify the key vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities in modern vehicles  that could impact passenger safety and key practices and technologies  that could mitigate these vulnerabilities, we interviewed officials from  other federal agencies involved in vehicle cybersecurity research or  cybersecurity efforts more broadly. These agencies included: the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of  Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Science and  Technology Directorate, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency within the Department of Defense. We also reviewed documents  published by NIST, such as its Framework for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and based on stakeholder  recommendations, interviewed representatives from several IT and  telecommunication firms to identify key mitigation practices and  technologies. To address our objective on challenges and industry-led  efforts related to vehicle cybersecurity, we also interviewed  representatives from entities involved in those efforts, including  representatives from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the  Association of Global Automakers, AUTOSAR, the National Council of  ISACs, and Society of Automotive Engineers International.", "To assess DOT\u2019s efforts to address vehicle cybersecurity, we reviewed  applicable federal laws and regulations\u2014such as the Moving Ahead for  Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Fixing America\u2019s  Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act)\u2014including their requirements for  NHTSA pertaining to vehicle electronics and cybersecurity.
