The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the primary agency responsible for the security of over 9,000 federal government facilities across the country. The fiscal year 2010 DHS appropriations act transferred FPS from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This report addresses (1) the extent to which the FPS transition has been implemented and any remaining related challenges, and (2) the extent to which the transition will help address previously identified challenges to protecting federal facilities. GAO reviewed the 2009 FPS-NPPD transition plan; agreements between FPS, NPPD, and ICE, and best practices for scheduling and cost estimating; and interviewed DHS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since October 2009, FPS's facility protection mission and 13 of 18 mission-support functions have transferred from ICE to NPPD; however, the transition schedule for the 5 remaining mission-support functions has been delayed. For example, while functions such as human capital and budget formulation have been transferred, information technology (IT) services, business continuity and emergency preparedness, facilities, personnel security, and equal employment opportunity have not. In August 2009, DHS reported to Congress that the transition of these functions would be completed by October 2010. DHS now reports that it plans to complete the transfer of 4 of the 5 remaining mission-support functions by September or October 2011, and estimates that the transfer of IT services will not be complete until October 2012. DHS developed a transition plan to guide the planning and execution of the transfer. Among other things, the plan called for schedules with detailed tasks and end dates to be developed for all mission-support functions to ensure critical path activities were identified, managed, and resourced. DHS also developed a detailed schedule to manage the transfer of IT services, as called for in the transition plan. However, GAO's analysis of the schedule found that it did not reflect GAO's best practices for scheduling such as capturing, sequencing, and assigning resources to all activities necessary to accomplish the work. When a schedule does not accurately reflect the project, it will not serve as an appropriate basis for analysis and may result in unreliable completion dates and delays. As of May 2011, DHS estimated that it would cost $6.2 million to complete the IT transition. GAO's analysis of this cost estimate found it did not meet all the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate. For example, the estimate was not well documented because it was not supported by detailed explanation describing how the estimate was derived and did not include sufficient detail so that GAO could corroborate it. By incorporating cost estimation best practices for the IT transition cost estimate, DHS could enhance the estimate's reliability and better inform decisions about the cost to complete the transition. The transfer of FPS to NPPD could provide DHS the opportunity to better advance progress towards addressing FPS's challenges to protecting federal facilities that have been previously identified by GAO. Since 2007, GAO has reported that FPS faces significant challenges with protecting federal facilities. The transition plan noted that the transfer of FPS to NPPD would improve the mission effectiveness of both agencies. NPPD officials explained that the agency has undertaken actions that serve as a foundation for integrating FPS into NPPD. For example, FPS has begun to develop a new strategic plan to align FPS's activities and resources to support NPPD mission-related outcomes. Additionally, NPPD is assisting FPS in developing a human capital strategic plan, as recommended by GAO in July 2009. These steps are encouraging, but it is too early to tell if these planned actions will help address challenges previously identified by GAO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS improve the schedule for transferring IT services to reflect scheduling best practices, and update the IT transition cost estimate, in accordance with cost-estimating best practices.

The Federal Protective Service (FPS), established in 1971 as the  uniformed protection force of the General Services Administration (GSA),  is the primary agency responsible for the security of over 9,000 federal  government facilities across the country, including buildings; grounds; and  property owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government.", "FPS was transferred from GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service to the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with enactment of the  Homeland Security Act of 2002. Within DHS, FPS was originally a part of  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, the fiscal year  2010 DHS appropriations act transferred FPS from ICE to the National  Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), within DHS, and the  transfer became effective when the act was signed into law on October  28, 2009. DHS proposed this transfer to better align FPS\u2019s facility  protection mission with NPPD\u2019s broader critical infrastructure protection  mission.", "In light of FPS\u2019s critical role of protecting federal facilities against the  threat of terrorism and other criminal activity, it is important that FPS\u2019s  transfer to NPPD be successful. In addition to the inherent challenges any  organization would face in becoming part of another agency, our prior  work reviewing the operations of FPS and its ability to protect federal  facilities has shown that FPS brings a set of unique operational,  management, and funding challenges to NPPD that have a bearing on its  ability to accomplish its mission. The challenges include managing its  contract guard force, establishing a comprehensive human capital  strategy, evaluating its funding structure, and developing a risk  management framework that links threats and vulnerabilities to resource  requirements. Over the past 5 years, we have made numerous  recommendations to address these challenges. For example, we  recommended FPS improve its long-term human capital planning,  develop and implement performance measures in various aspects of its  operations, and improve its data collection and quality across its  operations. While FPS has generally agreed with all of our  recommendations, it has not completed many related corrective actions. If  not properly planned and effectively implemented, the transition could not  only hamper FPS\u2019s ability to carry out its mission, but impede its progress  in addressing its long-standing challenges.", "DHS prepared a transition plan for the realignment of FPS that describes  the department\u2019s ongoing planning efforts, cost estimates, and a timeline  for the planning and execution process, but members of Congress raised  questions about whether the plan provided sufficient information about  how the department would address FPS\u2019s challenges. You requested  that we review the department\u2019s transition efforts. This report addresses  (1) the extent to which the FPS transition has been implemented and any  challenges FPS and NPPD face in implementing the transition; and (2)  the extent to which the transition will help address previously identified  challenges to protecting federal facilities.", "To answer the first objective, we reviewed relevant documents, including  the August 2009 FPS-NPPD Transition Plan, transition plan updates, the  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU), and all service level agreements (SLA) signed among FPS,  NPPD, and ICE. We interviewed members of the senior-level working  group, as well as members of all working groups that were established to  carry out the transition in 18 mission-support functions, to discuss the  extent to which the mission-support functions had transferred from ICE to  NPPD. In addition, we interviewed the FPS Deputy Director, Chief of  Staff, regional and deputy regional directors, and mission support chiefs  from 6 of the 11 FPS regions around the country on a range of issues  related to the transition of FPS to NPPD. We compared the FPS  information technology (IT) transition schedule, the IT transition cost  estimate, and related documents to the practices in our Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide. We did a detailed analysis of the IT services  mission-support function because it required a significant commitment of  resources, oversight, and time by DHS to complete the transition. We  also obtained and analyzed financial documentation from the  components\u2019 accounting systems to identify transition costs. To assess  the reliability of this documentation, we (1) performed electronic testing  for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) compared the data  with other sources of information, such as cost data from the ICE Office of  Financial Management and documentation from the Intra-Governmental  Payment and Collection (IPAC) system, and (3) interviewed agency  officials knowledgeable about financial management and budgeting at all  three agencies to understand the data and to identify any data  problems. When we found discrepancies (such as data entry errors) w brought them to the officials\u2019 attention and worked with them to  correct  discrepancies before concluding our analysis. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To answer the second objective, we reviewed our prior work on  challenges facing FPS in its efforts to protect federal facilities. We also  reviewed and analyzed documentation, such as the transition plan,  testimony from key senior leaders in FPS and NPPD provided for a  hearing on the FPS transition, FPS\u2019s strategic plan, and NPPD\u2019s strategic  activities report.

FPS was originally located within GSA\u2019s  Public Buildings Service (PBS). As part of PBS, FPS was responsible for  providing law enforcement and security services to GSA\u2019s tenants and the  public at federal buildings nationwide.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established DHS to prevent and  mitigate the damage from terrorist attacks within the United States, which  includes terrorism directed at federal facilities. Under the act, FPS was  transferred from the GSA to DHS. DHS later placed it within ICE. The  President\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget requested the transfer of FPS from  ICE to NPPD. Language in the budget request stated that FPS  responsibilities, such as providing physical security and policing of federal  buildings, establishing building security policy, and ensuring compliance,  are outside the scope of ICE\u2019s immigration and customs enforcement  mission and are better aligned with NPPD\u2019s mission. The transfer of FPS  to NPPD became effective when the fiscal year 2010 DHS appropriations  act was signed into law on October 28, 2009. Figure 1 shows FPS\u2019s move  within DHS from ICE to NPPD.", "To accomplish its mission, in 2011 FPS has a total budget authority of  about $1 billion, currently employs 1,225 federal staff, and about 13,000  contract guard staff to secure over 9,000 GSA owned or leased facilities.  FPS conducts law enforcement activities as well as risk assessments to  reduce facility vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats and helps to  ensure that facilities are secure and occupants are safe.", "For the transition, FPS, NPPD, ICE, and DHS headquarters components  formed a Senior Working Group, co-chaired by the Senior Counselor to  the Under Secretary of NPPD, the ICE Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Management, and the FPS Director. DHS developed a transition plan,  the August 2009 FPS-NPPD Transition Plan, which describes DHS\u2019s  overall transition planning process and milestones for completing the  transition, among other things. The plan shifted FPS\u2019s mission and  responsibility for all of its mission-support functions, with the exception of  financial accounting services and firearms and tactical training, from ICE  to NPPD or other DHS components. While FPS has its own law  enforcement personnel to perform its mission responsibilities, it does not  perform all of its mission-support functions such as payroll, travel  services, and contracting. For this reason, FPS has traditionally relied on  GSA and ICE to carry out these functions. For example, while under  GSA, FPS\u2019s contracting functions were handled by the contracting  component of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service, and under ICE, by its  Office of Acquisition.", "The transition plan noted that most transition tasks would be completed  by October 2010. In addition, the transition plan noted staff-level working  groups were formed that consisted of subject matter experts from each of  the agencies, FPS, NPPD, and ICE, to plan in detail the transfer of FPS\u2019s  mission and each mission-support function. The working groups were  tasked with planning, tracking issues related to the FPS transition, and  reporting progress on the transition. Initially, 16 working groups were  formed to carry out the transition in 18 mission-support functions, as  reflected in figure 2.", "According to the transition plan, until the transition is complete, ICE is to  continue to provide necessary management and operational services  through continued agreements in support of FPS or until individual MOAs,  MOUs, or SLAs are concluded with NPPD and other DHS headquarters  components. For example, for fiscal year 2010, FPS and NPPD signed 12  SLAs with ICE, covering services such as training and development,  security management, and IT services, 1 MOA for legal services, and 1  MOU for financial services.

DHS\u2019s transition plan called for  working groups to develop comprehensive project management plans  (i.e., detailed schedules) with detailed tasks and end dates for the  individual mission-support functions to ensure critical path activities were  identified, managed, and resourced. DHS did not develop these  schedules for all the mission-support functions since, according to DHS  officials, in some cases the transfer of a function was relatively easy and  did not need a schedule, such as public affairs and legislative affairs.  However, the transfer of FPS\u2019s nationwide IT infrastructure and field  support is more complex. Because of the complexity of transferring IT  services, DHS developed a detailed schedule to manage the transfer of  IT services, as called for in the transition plan.", "As we have previously reported, the success of fielding any program  depends in part on having a reliable schedule that defines, among other  things, when work activities will occur, how long they will take, and how  they are related to one another. As such, the schedule not only provides  a road map for systematic execution of a program, but also provides a  means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential  problems, and promote accountability. Among other things, best practices  and related federal guidance cited in our cost estimation guide call for a  program schedule to be program-wide in scope, meaning that it should  include the integrated breakdown of the work to be performed, and  expressly identify and define relationships and dependencies among work  elements and the constraints affecting the start and completion of work  elements. Table 3 presents a summary of best practices we have  identified for applying a schedule as part of program management.", "Our analysis of the IT schedule found that it did not reflect our best  practices for scheduling, as seen in table 4.", "We shared the results of our analysis with responsible DHS IT transition  officials, who stated that they have taken note of the deficiencies and are  taking steps to improve the schedule using the scheduling practices.  According to these officials, they plan to work closely with staff in another  NPPD component agency with the expertise necessary to improve the IT  transition schedule. Nevertheless, if the schedule does not fully and  accurately reflect the project, it will not serve as an appropriate basis for  analysis and may result in unreliable completion dates, time extension  requests, and delays. With regard to the transfer of the IT services  function, it would be difficult for DHS to accurately predict the completion  date for the IT transition without a more reliable schedule. Moreover,  completing projects within projected time frames helps ensure agencies  do not incur additional costs, which is especially important in a fiscally  constrained environment. Ultimately, incorporating scheduling best  practices into the IT transition schedule could help DHS better manage  the completion of the transition and help provide reasonable assurance  that the transfer is complete within its projected timeframe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Cost Estimating Best Practices in the IT Transition Cost Estimate Could Enhance the Reliability of, and Better Inform, Decisions about the Cost to Complete the Transition", "paragraphs": ["According to best practices for cost estimates, in addition to a reliable  schedule, a reliable cost estimate is critical to the success of any  program.

DHS\u2019s  estimate provided for costs into three categories\u2014personnel, financial  management, and IT services. In 2011, the department revised the  estimate for each of the three categories, which totaled $18.5 million.

However, DHS has not yet transferred IT  services and does not expect to complete the transfer until October 2012.  Having a reliable and valid cost estimate is important for enabling  managers to make informed decisions and facilitate tracking progress  against estimates to effectively manage the transfer of IT services. While  DHS committed to using GAO\u2019s best practices in preparing cost estimates  in July 2008, our analysis of the cost estimate for the transfer of IT  services found that it only partially met one of the four characteristics of a  reliable cost estimate and minimally met the other three, as table 6  illustrates.", "DHS officials stated that there are no plans to revise the IT transition  estimate.

In response to our July 2009 report,  FPS took a number of immediate actions with respect to contract guard  management, including increasing the number of guard inspections it  conducts at federal facilities in some metropolitan areas and revising its  guard training. Further, in our April 2010 report, we recommended,  among other things, that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  Under Secretary of NPPD and the Director of FPS to develop a  mechanism to routinely monitor guards at federal facilities outside  metropolitan areas and provide building-specific and scenario-based  training and guidance to its contract guards.

Written comments from DHS are reprinted in appendix II.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  the report, we plan no further distribution for 30 days from the report date.  At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary of  Homeland Security, the Under Secretary of the National Protection and  Programs Directorate, the Director of the Federal Protective Service, the  Director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and appropriate  congressional committees. In addition, this report will be available at no  charge on the GAO web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  David C.

We address the following questions:  (1) to what extent has the FPS transition been implemented and what  related challenges, if any, did FPS and NPPD face in implementing the  transition and (2) to what extent will the transition help address previously  identified challenges to protecting federal facilities?", "To determine the extent to which the FPS transition has been  implemented and what challenges, if any, FPS and NPPD faced in  implementing the transition, we reviewed documents related to the  transition, including the August 2009 FPS-NPPD Transition Plan, all  transition plan updates, DHS delegations of authority related to the  execution and administration of FPS, and Memorandum of Agreement,  Memorandum of Understanding, and all service level agreements signed  among FPS, NPPD, and ICE. We interviewed FPS officials directly  affected by the transition\u2014including the FPS Deputy Director and Chief of  Staff headquartered in Washington, D.C., and in each of 6 of FPS\u2019s 11  regional offices, the Regional Director, Deputy Director for Operations,  and Mission Support Chief. We chose these offices on the basis of  geographical dispersion. They included: the Northwest/Arctic Region  (Federal Way, Washington); the Greater Southwest Region (Grand  Prairie, Texas); the Heartland Region (Kansas City, Missouri); the Great  Lakes Region (Chicago, Illinois); the National Capital Region  (Washington, D.C.); and the New England Region (Boston,  Massachusetts). Among other things, we asked questions about their  experiences regarding the transition of FPS\u2019s mission and mission- support functions from ICE to NPPD. While the results of these interviews  provided examples of FPS officials\u2019 experiences and perspectives, they  cannot be generalized beyond those we interviewed because we did not  use statistical sampling techniques in selecting the regional offices,  headquarters officials, and regional staff.", "Additionally, we met with members of the transition senior working group,  including the NPPD Senior Counselor to the Under Secretary and the  FPS Director, as well as interviewed members of all 16 staff-level working  groups to discuss the extent to which FPS\u2019s 18 mission-support functions  had transferred from ICE to NPPD. The working groups included officials  from FPS, NPPD, ICE, and in some groups, DHS headquarters. We  compared the FPS information technology (IT) transition schedule, the IT  transition cost estimate, and related documents to the practices in our  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. We focused on the IT mission- support function because it required a significant commitment of  resources, oversight, and time by DHS to complete the transition. For the  IT transition schedule and the cost estimate, we scored each best  practice as either being Not met\u2014DHS provided no evidence that  satisfies any of the criterion; Minimally met\u2014DHS provided evidence that  satisfies a small portion of the criterion; Partially met\u2014DHS provided  evidence that satisfies about half of the criterion; Substantially met\u2014DHS  provided evidence that satisfies a large portion of the criterion; and Met\u2014 DHS provided complete evidence that satisfies the entire criterion. We  provided the results of our schedule and cost analyses to DHS officials  and met with them to confirm the results. Based on the interviews and  additional documentation provided by DHS officials, we updated the  results of our analyses, as needed.", "We reviewed financial documentation provided by all three components  reflecting transition costs such as salaries, benefits, and expenses for  new personnel hired to support the FPS transition, financial management  services provided by ICE, and IT deployment. To assess the reliability of  this documentation, we (1) performed electronic testing for obvious errors  in accuracy and completeness; (2) compared the data with other sources  of information, such as payroll reports to payroll data, cost data from the  ICE Office of Financial Management and documentation from the Intra- Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) system; and (3)  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about financial management  and budgeting at all three agencies to discuss transition-related expenses  incurred at the time of our review, and to identify any data problems.  When we found discrepancies (such as data entry errors) we brought  them to the officials\u2019 attention and worked with them to correct  discrepancies before concluding our analysis. We found the cost data to  be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review.", "To determine the extent to which the transition will help address  previously identified challenges to protect federal facilities, we reviewed  prior GAO reports and testimonies related to FPS\u2019s facility protection  efforts, and spoke with NPPD officials about FPS\u2019s ongoing challenges in  this regard. We also reviewed and analyzed documentation, such as the  transition plan, testimony from key senior leaders in NPPD and FPS  provided for a hearing on the FPS transition, FPS\u2019s strategic plan, and  NPPD\u2019s strategic activities report. Finally, we interviewed the Senior  Counselor to the Under Secretary of NPPD, and FPS Deputy Director for  Operations and Chief of Staff, and discussed actions underway or  planned to further integrate FPS into NPPD.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 through   July 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sandra Burrell, Assistant  Director, and Valerie Kasindi, Analyst-in-Charge, managed this  assignment.
