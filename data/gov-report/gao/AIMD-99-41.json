It does this by (1) enforcing the laws governing the flow of goods and persons across U.S. borders and (2) assessing and collecting duties, taxes, and fees on imported merchandise. During fiscal year 1997, Customs collected $22.1 billion in revenue at more than 300 ports of entry, and it processed nearly 450 million passengers entering the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Customs\u2019 Core Business Operations: A Brief Description", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish its mission, Customs is organized into the following six business areas: trade compliance, outbound, passenger, finance, human resources, and investigations. Each business area is described below.", "Trade compliance includes enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the importation of goods into the United States. To do so, Customs (1) works with the trade community to promote understanding of applicable laws and regulations, (2) selectively examines cargo to ensure that only eligible goods enter the country, (3) reviews documentation associated with cargo entries to ensure that they are properly valued and classified, (4) collects billions of dollars annually in duties, taxes, and fees associated with imported cargo, (5) assesses fines and penalties for noncompliance with trade laws and regulation, (6) seizes and accounts for illegal cargo, and (7) manages the collection of these moneys to ensure that all trade-related debts due to Customs are paid and properly accounted for.", "Outbound includes Customs enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the movement of merchandise and conveyances from the United States. To do so, Customs (1) selectively inspects cargo at U.S. ports to guard against the exportation of illegal goods, such as protected technologies, stolen vehicles, and illegal currency, (2) collects, disseminates, and uses intelligence to identify high-risk cargo and passengers, (3) assesses and collects fines and penalties associated with the exportation of illegal cargo, and (4) physically examines baggage and cargo at airport facilities for explosive and nuclear materials. In addition, the outbound business includes collecting and disseminating trade data within the federal government. Accurate trade data are crucial to establishing accurate trade statistics on which to base trade policy decisions and negotiate trade agreements with other countries. By the year 2000, Customs estimates that exports will be valued at $1.2 trillion, as compared to a reported $696 billion in 1994.", "Passenger includes processing all passengers and crew of arriving and departing air, sea, and land conveyances and pedestrians. In fiscal year 1997, Customs reported that it processed nearly 450 million travelers, and by the year 2000, expects almost 500 million passengers to arrive in the United States annually. Many of Customs\u2019 passenger activities are coordinated with other federal agencies, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Activities include targeting high-risk passengers, which requires timely and accurate information, and physically inspecting selected passengers, baggage, and vehicles to determine compliance with laws and regulations.", "Finance includes asset and revenue management activities. Asset management consists of activities to (1) formulate Customs\u2019 budget, (2) properly allocate and distribute funds, and (3) acquire, manage, and account for personnel, goods, and services. Revenue management encompasses all Customs activities to identify and establish amounts owed Customs, collect these amounts, and accurately report the status of revenue from all sources. Sources of revenue include duties, fees, taxes, other user fees, and forfeited currency and property. The revenue management activities interrelate closely with the revenue collection activities in the trade compliance, outbound, and passenger business areas.", "Human resources is responsible for filling positions, providing employee benefits and services, training employees, facilitating workforce effectiveness, and processing personnel actions for Customs\u2019 18,000 employees and managers. Investigations includes activities to detect and eliminate narcotics and money laundering operations. Customs works with other agencies and foreign governments to reduce drug-related activity by interdicting (seizing and destroying) narcotics, investigating organizations involved in drug smuggling, and deterring smuggling efforts through various other methods. Customs also develops and provides information to the trade and carrier communities to assist them in their efforts to prevent smuggling organizations from using cargo containers and commercial conveyances to introduce narcotics into the United States.", "To carry out its responsibilities, Customs relies on information systems and processes to assist its staff in (1) documenting, inspecting, and accounting for the movement and disposition of imported goods and (2) collecting and accounting for the related revenues. Customs expects its reliance on information systems to increase as a result of its burgeoning workload. For 1995 through 2001, Customs estimates that the annual volume of import trade between the United States and other countries will increase from $761 billion to $1.1 trillion. This will result in Customs processing an estimated increase of 7.5 million import entries\u2014from 13.1 million to 20.6 million annually\u2014during the same period.

To speed the processing of imports and improve compliance with trade laws, the Congress enacted Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act in December 1993. Customs refers to this legislation as the \u201cCustoms Modernization and Informed Compliance Act\u201d or \u201cMod\u201d Act.", "The primary purpose of the act is to streamline and automate Customs\u2019 commercial operations by eliminating certain legislatively mandated paper requirements and requiring Customs to establish the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP). The legislation also specified certain functions that NCAP must provide, including giving members of the trade community the capability to electronically file import entries at remote locations as well as enabling Customs to electronically process \u201cdrawback\u201d claims, which are refunds of duties and taxes paid on imported goods that are subsequently exported or destroyed.

ACS is nearly 15 years old and Customs reports that it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to operate, maintain, and enhance due to the system\u2019s antiquated hardware and software and limited processing capacity.", "Currently, ACE\u2019s architecture is to include both (1) mainframe-based, centralized processing to support high-volume, repetitive transactions and (2) distributed, client-server processing and desktop PC interfaces to support port office analysis and decision support needs. The transaction-intensive applications are to run on IBM mainframes at Customs\u2019 national data center and are to be written in COBOL and C++. The distributed processing is to occur on UNIX servers and the applications are to be written in C++ and Java. To support this processing environment, Customs plans to design and implement a single, integrated agencywide database. It also plans to connect port offices to the national data center through existing communications networks comprising the Treasury Communications System, and to connect the trade community to the data center through the Internet and a combination of dial-up lines and dedicated lines.", "According to Customs, ACE will facilitate increased compliance of individuals, businesses, and governments with the trade laws and regulations of the United States and increased communication with the trade community. It will also provide an integrated, account-based, automated information system for collecting, disseminating, and analyzing trade-related data and ensuring the proper collection and allocation of revenues.", "Customs began developing ACE in 1994 and plans to develop and deploy ACE in 21 increments from 1998 through 2005. Each increment consists of the software and hardware necessary to perform a discrete portion of the total ACE functionality. The first four increments, known collectively as the NCAP prototype, will process pre-identified merchandise shipped into the U.S. via truck by three selected importers. The first two increments, NCAP 0.1 and NCAP 0.2, were deployed for operational evaluation at three pilot border port locations (Detroit, Michigan; Laredo, Texas; and Port Huron, Michigan) during May 1998 and October 1998, respectively.", "The succeeding 17 increments are intended to build upon the foundational capabilities contained within the four NCAP prototype increments, providing additional functionality including the capability to (1) process merchandise imported via rail, air, sea, and couriers, (2) process collections and refunds associated with imported cargo, (3) process warehouse entry cargo, and (4) process cargo subject to drawbacks. Until all of these deployments are completed, Customs intends to operate and maintain ACS.", "Customs\u2019 estimate of ACE costs has escalated since August 1997, when it initially estimated that ACE\u2019s 10-year life-cycle cost would be $895 million for the period 1998 through 2007. In November 1997, Customs revised this 10-year cost estimate to $987.6 million and also estimated that, over 15 years, from 1994 through 2008, it would spend $1.05 billion on ACE. It then used the $1.05 billion estimate along with estimated expected savings of $1.9 billion to justify ACE. Customs is currently reevaluating this estimate.", "Figure 1.1 compares planned and actual deployments of the NCAP increments.

Our objective was to determine whether Customs is effectively managing ACE, including whether Customs has adequately justified ACE cost-effectiveness. In making these determinations, we relied primarily on the following criteria: (1) the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and other legislative reforms that require federal agencies to develop and maintain integrated systems architectures and improve their information technology investment management processes, (2) Office of Management and Budget guidance related to the acquisition and management of information resources, (3) GAO and Treasury systems architecture guidance, and (4) related Software Engineering Institute system engineering standards concerning cost estimating and software development and acquisition maturity.", "To address our objective, we reviewed pertinent documentation (e.g., ACE project plan, system/software development process practices/standards, ACE technical architecture descriptions, and ACE project status reports) and interviewed responsible Treasury officials and Customs ACE project officials in order to identify (1) Customs\u2019 management structure for developing and deploying ACE, (2) the ACE system/software development methodology, (3) the planned ACE hardware/software and communications architecture and configuration, and (4) the current ACE system development status.", "Additionally, we met with Customs ACE officials to determine the status of the agency\u2019s implementation of recommendations we made in May 1998 to complete its systems architecture. These recommendations included (1) ensuring that the architecture fully described Customs\u2019 business functions, (2) defining the information needs and flows among these functions, (3) establishing the technical standards, products, and services that will be used to build systems that support these business functions and needs, and (4) enforcing compliance with the architecture.", "Further, we obtained and reviewed supporting documentation and interviewed Treasury officials, Customs ACE officials, and Customs Investment Review Board (IRB) officials to (1) identify the current ACE project cost and life-cycle cost estimate baselines and determine the current actual expenditures to date, (2) identify the current ACE project schedule baseline and determine the actual progress to date against scheduled milestones, (3) define what ACE is intended to do and how it is expected to benefit Customs\u2019 mission, (4) determine the extent to which ACE mission-related goals/benefits have been achieved to date and how Customs is measuring the accrued benefits, and (5) determine Customs\u2019 strategic approach to managing the development/acquisition, integration, and deployment of ACE. The documentation we analyzed included the ACE project plan and strategic plan, functional/performance requirements, and NCAP technical assessment documents, budget/financial data, cost-benefit policy and guidance, cost-benefit analyses, various life-cycle and project cost estimates, project status reports, testing problem reports, and configuration management documentation.", "Also, we reviewed project documentation to determine how the life-cycle cost baseline was estimated and how this estimating approach compared to criteria established by SEI in A Manager\u2019s Checklist for Validating Software Cost and Schedule Estimates. The SEI criteria defines seven primary questions, each supported by more detailed secondary questions, that can be used to determine whether defined and disciplined processes were used to derive a given cost estimate. We also interviewed ACE project officials.", "In addition, we assessed whether Customs thoroughly analyzed technical alternatives to ACE including the possibility of (1) enhancing and continuing to use the legacy trade system, ACS, (2) using different architectural designs for ACE, (3) following different development/acquisition strategies, and/or (4) using the Department of the Treasury\u2019s planned multiagency International Trade Data System (ITDS), instead of ACE, for some functions, such as collecting, editing, and validating trade data and collecting and accounting for trade revenue.", "Last, we used the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI\u2019s) Software Development Capability Maturity ModelSM (SW-CMM ), Software Acquisition Capability Maturity ModelSM (SA-CMM ), and its Software Capability Evaluation Method, to evaluate Customs\u2019 ability to manage its NCAP 0.1 software development project and NCAP 0.2 software acquisition effort, respectively. These models and methods provide a logical and widely accepted framework for baselining an organization\u2019s current process capabilities (i.e., strengths and weaknesses) and assessing whether an organization has the necessary process discipline in place to repeat earlier successes on similar projects. Organizations that do not satisfy the requirements for the \u201crepeatable\u201d level are by default judged to be at the \u201cinitial\u201d level of maturity, meaning that their processes are ad hoc, sometimes even chaotic, with few of the processes defined and success dependent mainly on the heroic efforts of individuals.", "In following the SEI method, GAO staff trained at SEI evaluated Customs\u2019 ACE project software development/maintenance maturity in five of the six key process areas (KPA) that are necessary to attain a \u201crepeatable\u201d level of process maturity. GAO did not evaluate Customs in the sixth repeatable level KPA, software subcontract management, because Customs did not use subcontractors on the ACE project. Additionally, GAO staff trained at SEI evaluated Customs\u2019 ACE project software acquisition maturity in the seven KPAs that are necessary to attain a repeatable level of process capability, and one KPA associated with the \u201cdefined\u201d level of process maturity\u2014acquisition risk management. The purpose of acquisition risk management is to formally identify risks as early as possible and adjust the acquisition to mitigate those risks. Many software experts consider acquisition risk management to be an integral part of the solicitation, project performance management, and contract performance management processes.", "Customs provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are presented in chapter 5, and are reprinted in appendix I.

ITDS was initiated in 1995 as a project to implement the National Performance Review recommendation to develop a coordinated, governmentwide system for the collection, use, and dissemination of trade data. At that time, a multiagency board of directors was established, headed by the Department of the Treasury with Customs and other major trade-related agencies represented.

Among these criteria were several very significant and closely intertwined requirements that are at the core of effective cost estimating.

In particular, Customs did not use a cost model. Instead, it used an unsophisticated spreadsheet to extrapolate the cost of each ACE increment. Further, Customs\u2019 approach to determining software size and reuse was not documented and was not well supported or convincing. Customs estimated the size of each ACE software increment (most of which were still undefined) by extrapolating from the estimated size of the first increment based on individuals\u2019 undocumented best judgments about increment functionality and complexity. Last, Customs did not have any historical project cost data at the time it developed the $1.05 billion estimate, and it did not account for relevant, measured, and normalized differences among the increments.

Therefore, its software acquisition and development processes must be strengthened before it can hope to acquire or develop ACE software on time and within budget, as well as to achieve expected benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In addition to previous recommendations to improve Customs\u2019 management of information technology, we recommend that Customs correct the management and technical weaknesses discussed in this report before building ACE. To accomplish this, GAO recommends that the Commissioner of Customs, with the support of Customs\u2019 CIO, ensure that Customs (1) rigorously analyze alternative approaches to building ACE, including ITDS as an alternative to developing ACE entirely within Customs and; (2) make investment decisions incrementally, i.e., for each increment: use disciplined processes to prepare a rigorous life-cycle cost estimate, including an explicit discussion of its inherent uncertainty; prepare realistic and supportable benefit expectations; require a favorable return-on-investment and compliance with Customs\u2019 architecture before making any investment; and validate actual costs and benefits once an increment is piloted, compare these with estimates, use the results in making further decisions on subsequent increments, and report the results to Customs\u2019 House and Senate appropriations and authorizing committees; and (3) strengthen ACE software acquisition management by: establishing an effective process improvement program and correcting the weaknesses in ACE software acquisition processes identified in this report, thereby bringing ACE processes to at least SEI level 2 and requiring at least SEI level 2 processes of all ACE software contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments on a draft of this report, Customs agreed with our conclusions and recommendations and stated that it is committed to addressing the problems discussed in the report. To this end, Customs cited a number of actions that it has underway and planned to improve management of information technology in general, and ACE specifically. For example, Customs stated that it has recruited a CIO with extensive experience in enterprise architecture and major systems acquisition, reorganized its Office of Information and Technology, and revised its System Development Life Cycle process. Also, Customs stated that it has engaged a contractor to update and improve the ACE cost-benefit analysis and plans for another contractor to independently review the new ACE cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, Customs reported that it revised its investment management procedures to provide for effective systems architecture enforcement, as we recommended in our May 1998 report.The report has been modified to reflect this information. To fully correct the management and technical weaknesses discussed in this report, Customs must follow through and effectively implement its plans to address all of our recommendations.
