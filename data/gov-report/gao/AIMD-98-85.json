According to the report of the President\u2019s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, the United States\u2014with close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of Internet assets\u2014is the world\u2019s most advanced and most dependent user of information technology. Should these systems\u2014which perform functions and services critical to our nation\u2014suffer disruption, it could create a widespread crisis. Accordingly, the upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge for public and private-sector organizations. For this reason, we have designated the Year 2000 computing problem as a high-risk area.", "To assist in addressing the Year 2000 computing problem, our objectives were to (1) outline the Year 2000 risks facing the government and the nation, (2) describe the evolution of the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 strategy, and (3) identify additional actions that can be taken by the Executive Branch to prepare the nation for the Year 2000. Our views are based upon over two dozen reports we have issued over the past year on the Year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies as well as on extensive consultations with various experts in information technology and our years of experience in and knowledge of federal agencies\u2019 computer systems. Appendix I contains our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 2 years, the term \u201cYear 2000 Problem\u201d has become increasingly familiar. This problem is rooted in the way in which automated information systems have, for the past several decades, typically represented the year\u2014using two digits rather than four\u2014in order to conserve electronic data storage space and reduce operating costs. Thus 1998 would be represented as simply 98. In this format, however, 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900 because both are represented only as 00. As a result, if not modified, computer systems or applications that use dates or perform date- or time-sensitive calculations may generate incorrect results beyond 1999, reading 00 as 1900 rather than 2000.", "As we testified before the Congress a year ago, correcting this problem, in government as in the private sector, will be labor-intensive and time-consuming\u2014and must be done while systems continue to operate.Many of the federal government\u2019s computer systems were originally designed and developed 20 to 25 years ago; are poorly documented; and use a wide variety of computer languages\u2014many of which are obsolete. Some applications include thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of lines of code, each of which must be examined for date-format problems. Other system components\u2014hardware, operating systems, communications interfaces, and database software\u2014may also be affected by the date problem.", "Many data exchanges and interdependencies also exist among federal, state, and local governments; the private sector; foreign countries; and international organizations. Therefore, systems are also vulnerable to failure caused by incorrectly formatted data provided by other systems, which are noncompliant.

While managers in the government and the private sector are taking many actions to mitigate these risks, a significant amount of work remains, and time frames are unrelenting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risk of Disruption to Government Services Is High", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is extremely vulnerable to the Year 2000 issue due to its widespread dependence on computer systems to process financial transactions, deliver vital public services, and carry out its operations. This challenge is made more difficult by the age and poor documentation of some of the government\u2019s existing systems and its lackluster track record in modernizing systems to deliver expected improvements and meet promised deadlines.", "Unless this issue is successfully addressed, serious consequences could ensue. For example:", "Unless the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) takes much more decisive action, there could be grounded or delayed flights, degraded safety, customer inconvenience, and increased airline costs.", "Payments to veterans with service-connected disabilities could be severely delayed if the system that issues them either halts or produces checks so erroneous that it must be shut down and checks processed manually.", "The military services could find it extremely difficult to efficiently and effectively equip and sustain their forces around the world.", "Federal systems used to track student loans could produce erroneous information on loan status, such as indicating that a paid loan was in default. Internal Revenue Service tax systems could be unable to process returns, thereby jeopardizing revenue collection and delaying refunds.", "The Social Security Administration process to provide benefits to disabled persons could be disrupted if interfaces with state systems fail.", "In addition, the year 2000 could also cause problems for the many facilities used by the federal government that were built or renovated within the last 20 years and contain embedded computer systems to control, monitor, or assist in operations. Many of these systems could malfunction due to vulnerability to the Year 2000 problem. For example, heating and air conditioning units could stop functioning properly and card-entry security systems could cease to operate.", "Year 2000-related problems have already been identified. For example, an automated Defense Logistics Agency system erroneously deactivated 90,000 inventoried items as the result of an incorrect date calculation. According to the agency, if the problem had not been corrected (which took 400 work hours), the impact would have been catastrophic and would have seriously hampered its mission to deliver materiel in a timely manner. In another case, the Department of Defense\u2019s Global Command Control System, which is used to generate a common operating picture of the battlefield for planning, executing, and managing military operations, failed testing when the date was rolled over to the Year 2000.", "In order to assist federal agencies in addressing their Year 2000 risks, we developed an enterprise readiness guide that offers a structured, step-by-step approach for reviewing the adequacy of agency planning and management of its Year 2000 program. The guide describes five phases of a Year 2000 program: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation. Over 30,000 copies of the guide\u2014which was released to the public as an exposure draft in February 1997 and issued in September 1997\u2014have been requested.", "We have also reviewed the Year 2000 programs of a number of federal agencies and have issued over two dozen reports and testimonies on this issue. (For a complete list of our reports and testimonies on the Year 2000 issue, see the \u201cRelated GAO Products\u201d section at the end of this report.) In general, our reviews found that progress has been uneven. As discussed below, some agencies are significantly behind schedule and are at high risk that they will not fix their systems in time. Other agencies have made progress, although risks remain and a great deal more work is needed. Our reports have numerous recommendations which the agencies have almost universally agreed to implement.", "Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). FAA has been severely behind schedule in completing basic awareness and assessment activities. In our January 1998 report, we concluded that at its current pace, FAA would not make it in time. Moreover, FAA had not (1) analyzed the impact of its systems\u2019 not being Year 2000 compliant, (2) inventoried and assessed all of its systems for date dependencies, or (3) developed contingency plans to ensure continuity of operations. Accordingly, we made several recommendations including that FAA should (1) assess how its business lines and the aviation industry would be affected if the Year 2000 problem were not corrected in time and use this information to help rank the agency\u2019s Year 2000 activities, (2) complete its inventory of all information systems and determine each one\u2019s criticality and decide whether each system should be converted, replaced, or retired, and (3) craft Year 2000 contingency plans for all business lines. FAA has agreed to implement our recommendations.", "Social Security Administration (SSA). A federal leader in addressing Year 2000 issues, SSA had made significant progress in assessing and renovating mission-critical mainframe software. However, we found that SSA remained at risk in that not all mission-critical systems necessary to prevent the disruption of benefit payments will be corrected before January 1, 2000. At particular risk are the 54 state disability determination systems that had not yet been assessed. In addition, SSA faced the risk that inaccurate data would be introduced into its databases by the hundreds of federal and state agencies and thousands of businesses with which it exchanges data files. Also, SSA had not developed contingency plans. We made several recommendations to the Commissioner of SSA to address these areas. SSA agreed with all of our recommendations and identified specific actions that it would take to ensure an adequate transition to the year 2000.", "Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We reported that at VA, the Veterans Benefits Administration is addressing the Year 2000 problem but needed to take additional action to correct its systems in time.Accordingly, we made 10 specific recommendations, such as (1) completing an analysis to determine whether the Veterans Benefits Administration\u2019s internal applications, interfaces, and third-party products were Year 2000 compliant and (2) developing a Year 2000 contingency plan. VA agreed to implement these recommendations. In a later review, we found that VA had initiated a number of these actions but that substantial risks remained.", "Department of Defense. We recently reported that the Department of Defense, which is responsible for about a third of the federal government\u2019s reported mission critical systems, has taken positive actions to increase awareness, promote sharing of information, and encourage components to make Year 2000 remediation efforts a priority, but that its progress in fixing systems has been slow. However, Defense lacked key management and oversight controls to enforce good management practices, to direct resources, and to establish a complete picture of its progress in fixing systems. Accordingly, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1) establish a strong department-level program office, (2) expedite efforts to establish a comprehensive, accurate departmentwide inventory of systems, interfaces, and other equipment needing repair, (3) clearly define criteria and an objective process for prioritizing systems for repair based on their mission-criticality, (4) ensure that system interfaces are adequately addressed, (5) develop an overall, departmentwide testing strategy and a plan for ensuring that adequate resources are available to perform necessary testing, (6) require components to develop contingency plans, and (7) prepare complete and accurate Year 2000 cost estimates. The Department of Defense concurred with our recommendations. We have also recommended improvements in the Year 2000 programs of the Air Force, Logistics Systems Support Center, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and the Defense Logistics Agency, including the need to develop contingency plans.", "Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). HCFA administers the Medicare program, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer. HCFA expects to process over 1 billion claims and pay $288 billion in benefits per year by 2000. In May 1997, we reported that the Heath Care Financing Administration had not taken enough initial steps, such as developing an assessment of the potential severity of the century change, to ensure that it can avoid the systems-related service disruptions that may occur as the year 2000 approaches. HCFA agreed to implement our recommendations that it identify responsibilities for managing and monitoring Year 2000 actions, prepare an assessment of the severity and timing of potential Year 2000 impact, and develop contingency plans for critical systems.", "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the deposit insurer of approximately 11,000 banks and savings institutions which are responsible for over $6 trillion in assets and have insured deposits totaling upwards of $2.7 trillion. We found that while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken aggressive efforts to ensure that the banks it oversees mitigate Year 2000 risks, it still faces significant challenges in providing a high level of assurance that individual banks will be ready. We recommended that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation work with other federal bank, credit union, and thrift institution regulators to, for example, revise their Year 2000 work program, complete guidance to institutions to mitigate risks associated with corporate customers and reliance on vendors, and establish a working group to develop contingency planning guidance. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also agreed to our recommendations to (1) develop a tactical plan and explicit road map of the actions it plans to take based on the results of its June 1998 bank assessments and (2) ensure that adequate resources are allocated to complete its internal systems\u2019 Year 2000 assessment and develop contingency plans for each of its mission critical systems and core business processes.", "National Credit Union Administration. The National Credit Union Administration supervises and insures more than 7,200 federally chartered credit unions and insures member deposits in an additional 4,200 state-chartered credit unions. In October 1997, we reported that the National Credit Union Administration had recognized the severity of the Year 2000 problem, developed a plan, and initiated action, such as issuing several letters to credit unions alerting them of Year 2000 risks. At the same time, however, in response to our recommendations, the National Credit Union Administration agreed to take several actions to strengthen their Year 2000 efforts, including requiring credit unions to (1) report on the precise status of their Year 2000 efforts at least quarterly, including the status of addressing their interfaces and (2) implement the necessary management controls to ensure that these financial institutions have adequately mitigated the risks associated with the Year 2000 problem.", "Audit offices of some states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, New York, and Virginia, and the District of Columbia have also identified significant Year 2000 concerns. Some of these risks include the potential that systems supporting benefit programs, motor vehicle records, and criminal records (i.e., prisoner release or parole eligibility determinations) may be adversely affected by the Year 2000 problem. These audit offices have made recommendations including the need for increased oversight, Year 2000 project plans, contingency plans, and personnel recruitment and retention strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Economic Sectors at Risk of Year 2000 Failures", "paragraphs": ["America\u2019s infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies at all levels. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant are: information and telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; utilities; and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important because it (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, the distribution of electrical power, and the control of gas and oil pipeline systems, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services. Illustrations of Year 2000 risks follow.", "According to the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision\u2014an international committee of banking supervisory authorities\u2014failure to address the Year 2000 issue would cause banking institutions to experience operational problems or even bankruptcy. Moreover, the Chair of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, a U.S. interagency council composed of federal bank, credit union, and thrift institution regulators, who is also the Comptroller of the Currency, stated that banking is one of America\u2019s most information-intensive businesses and that any malfunctions caused by the century date change could affect a bank\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. He also stated that of equal concern are problems that customers may experience that could prevent them from meeting their obligations to banks and that these problems, if not addressed, could have repercussions throughout the nation\u2019s economy.", "According to the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the year 2000 presents a serious challenge to the world\u2019s financial markets. Because they are highly interconnected, a disruption in one segment can spread quickly to others.", "FAA recently met with representatives of airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, fuel suppliers, telecommunications providers, and industry associations to discuss the Year 2000 issue. Participants raised the concern that their own Year 2000 compliance would be irrelevant if FAA were not compliant because of the many system interdependencies. Representatives went on to say that unless FAA was substantially Year 2000 compliant on January 1, 2000, flights would not get off the ground and that extended delays would be an economic disaster.", "Another risk associated with the transportation sector was described by the Federal Highway Administration which stated that highway safety could be severely compromised because of potential Year 2000 problems in operational transportation systems. For example, date dependent signal timing patterns could be incorrectly implemented at highway intersections if traffic signal systems run by state and local governments do not process four-digit years correctly.", "One risk associated with the utility sector is the potential loss of electrical power. For example, Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff believe that safety-related safe shutdown systems will function but that a worst-case scenario could occur in which Year 2000 failures in several nonsafety-related systems could cause a plant to shut down, resulting in the loss of off-site power and complications in tracking post-shutdown plant status and recovery.", "With respect to the health, safety, and emergency services sector, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Year 2000 issue holds serious implications for patient care and scientific research activities of the federal government, and for the nation\u2019s health care providers and researchers in general. Medical devices and scientific laboratory equipment may experience problems beginning January 1, 2000, if the computer systems, software applications, or embedded chips used in these devices contain two-digit fields for year representation. In addition, according to the Gartner Group, health care is substantially behind other industries in Year 2000 compliance and it predicts that at least 10 percent of mission-critical systems in this industry will fail because of noncompliance.", "In addition to the risks associated with the nation\u2019s key economic sectors, one of the largest, and largely unknown, risks relates to the global nature of the problem. With the advent of electronic communication and international commerce, the United States and the rest of the world have become critically dependent on computers. However, there are indications of Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena. In September 1997, the Gartner Group, a private research firm acknowledged for its expertise in Year 2000 issues, surveyed 2,400 companies in 17 countries and concluded that \u201chirty percent of all companies have not started dealing with the year 2000 problem. Small companies, health care organizations, educational institutions, and many companies in 30 percent of the world\u2019s countries are at a high risk of seeing year 2000 mission-critical failures due to a lack of readiness.\u201d", "In this survey of companies in 17 countries, the Gartner Group also ranked certain countries and areas of the world. According to it, countries/areas at level I on its scale of compliance\u2014just getting started\u2014include Eastern Europe, many African countries, many South American countries, and several Asian countries, including China. Those at level II\u2014completed the inventory process and have begun the assessment process\u2014include Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Taiwan, and Western Europe. Finally, some companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia are at levels II while others are at level III. Level III indicates that a program plan has been completed and dedicated resources are committed and in place.", "Although there are many national and international risks to key economic sectors related to the Year 2000, our limited review of these key sectors found a number of private-sector organizations that have raised awareness and provided advice through publications, conferences, and guidance.

This interagency working group subsequently developed best practices for the Year 2000 conversion. The group later evolved into the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council\u2019s Year 2000 Committee. The committee has two objectives: (1) re-emphasize information technology management practices to ensure that mission critical systems work on, before, and after January 1, 2000, and (2) identify joint efforts to leverage resources for solving the Year 2000 problem.", "In April 1996, OMB sent a memorandum to agency senior information resource management officials and CIOs requesting that agencies\u2019 5-year information resources management plans include their Year 2000 strategy. In addition, OMB stated that agencies should avoid acquiring commercial off-the-shelf products and application software that are not year 2000 compliant, except in emergency situations. In a follow-up to this memorandum, OMB sent a memorandum to the deputy heads of departments and agencies urging them to discuss the Year 2000 issue with their managers and computer professionals.", "On February 6, 1997, OMB issued a broader Year 2000 strategy for the federal government. The strategy was predicated on three assumptions: (1) senior agency managers will take whatever action is necessary to address the problem, (2) a single solution to the problem does not exist, and (3) given the limited amount of time available, emphasis will be placed on mission-critical systems. At the department or agency level, OMB\u2019s strategy relied on the CIOs to direct agency Year 2000 actions.", "To monitor individual agency efforts, OMB required the major departments and agencies to submit quarterly reports on their progress. Specifically, OMB asked agencies to report where they stand with respect to completing the assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation phases. OMB\u2019s first governmentwide progress report, based on 24 agencies\u2019 May 1997 reports, was transmitted to selected congressional committees on  June 23, 1997. While acknowledging that much work remained, OMB expressed its belief that agencies had made a good start in addressing the problem and reported that agencies had identified no mission-critical systems that were behind schedule.", "In July 1997 testimony, we disagreed with OMB\u2019s position, stating that we believed that there was ample evidence that OMB and key federal agencies needed to heighten their levels of concern and move with more urgency. First, most agencies\u2019 reported schedules left little time to resolve unanticipated problems. Second, OMB\u2019s perspective was based on agency self-reporting which had not been independently validated. Third, entities may have interpreted the term \u201cmission critical\u201d in various ways. Fourth, OMB, in its governmentwide schedule, established only 1 month for the validation phase which is critical for thorough testing and, according to the Gartner Group, testing could consume over 40 percent of the time and resources of the entire Year 2000 program.

The report stated that while progress had been made overall, it was not uniform across the agencies. Accordingly, OMB placed agencies in three tiers based on their progress in addressing the Year 2000 problem: (1) 4 agencies showed insufficient evidence of progress, (2) 12 agencies showed evidence of progress but OMB also had concerns, and (3) 8 agencies appeared to be making sufficient progress. OMB established a rebuttable presumption for agencies in the first tier that it would not fund requests for information technology investments in the fiscal year 1999 budget formulation process unless they were directly related to fixing the Year 2000 problem.", "OMB also announced other initiatives in its August 15, 1997, governmentwide report. First, OMB emphasized that validation activities were critical to success and stated that it planned to meet with agencies in the following months to discuss the adequacy of scheduled timetables for completing validation. Second, OMB said that it would address interfaces with systems external to the federal government, including those of state and local governments and the private sector.

To implement these policies, the order states that each agency head shall assure that efforts to address the Year 2000 problem receive the highest priority attention in his/her agency.", "The executive order also established the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion led by an Assistant to the President and comprised of one representative from each of the executive departments and from other federal agencies as may be determined by the Chair. The Chair of the Council was tasked with the following Year 2000 roles: (1) overseeing the activities of agencies, (2) acting as chief spokesperson in national and international forums, (3) providing policy coordination of executive branch activities with state, local, and tribal governments, and (4) promoting appropriate federal roles with respect to private sector activities. In addition, the executive order requires the Chair and OMB to report to the President quarterly on the progress of agencies in addressing the Year 2000 problem."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions Can Be Taken to Reduce Year 2000 Risks", "paragraphs": ["The increased attention that the administration has given to solving the Year 2000 problem could help minimize the disruption to the nation as the millennium approaches.

For example, the Air Force has used nearly 46 percent of its available time completing the awareness and assessment phases while the Gartner Group estimates that no more than 26 percent of an organizations\u2019 year 2000 effort should be spent on these phases.", "Consequently, priority-setting is absolutely essential. As illustrated in figure 1, according to the February 1998 agency quarterly reports, about 35 percent of federal agencies\u2019 mission-critical systems were considered to be Year 2000 compliant. This leaves over 3,500 mission-critical systems (45 percent), as well as thousands of nonmission-critical systems, still to be repaired and over 1,100 systems (15 percent) to be replaced. It is unlikely that agencies can complete this vast amount of work in time. Accordingly, it is critical that the Executive Branch identify those systems that are of the highest priority. These include those that, if not corrected, could most seriously threaten health and safety, the financial well being of American citizens, national security, or the economy.", "Despite the importance of making sure that the most critical systems are fixed and thoroughly tested, OMB has not set governmentwide priorities to help agencies determine which systems perform the most essential services and direct resources to correct these systems first. OMB\u2019s most recent guidance sets the same deadline (March 1999) for agencies to implement Year 2000 fixes for both mission and nonmission-critical systems. While OMB made this change with the intention of fixing systems in time for them to be thoroughly tested and implemented well in advance of January 1, 2000, this change could have the unintended consequence of diverting agency attention from the most critical systems.", "Agencies must also ensure that their mission critical systems can properly exchange data with other systems and are protected from errors that can be introduced by external systems. For example, agencies that administer key federal benefits payment programs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, must exchange data with the Department of the Treasury which, in turn, interfaces with financial institutions, to ensure that beneficiary checks are issued. It is important that the executive branch consider this issue because to complete end-to-end testing, agencies must secure the cooperation of other agencies and the private sector. In its February 1998 quarterly report, the Department of Transportation cited a concern about its inability to control end-to-end testing of system operations involving telephone companies and third-party operators of telecommunications links. Transportation stated that these private-sector entities must be committed to ensuring that mission-critical communications are not affected by the Year 2000. However, the executive branch has not directed that operational end-to-end testing be conducted of all steps in this process and that this testing be independently verified and validated. Without such testing and independent verification and validation, the agency authorizing the payments could find its Year 2000 efforts failing even if its own systems are Year 2000 compliant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring of Agency Progress Needs to Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s reports on agency progress do not fully and accurately reflect the federal government\u2019s true progress because not all agencies are required to report their progress and OMB\u2019s reporting requirements are incomplete.

Accordingly, the status of these agencies\u2019 Year 2000 programs has not been monitored centrally. On March 9, 1998, OMB asked an additional 31 agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, to report on their progress in fixing the Year 2000 problem by April 30, 1998. OMB plans to include a summary of those responses in its next quarterly report to the Congress. However, unlike its reporting requirements for the major departments and agencies which requires them to report quarterly, the March 9th memorandum stated that OMB did not plan to request that the independent agencies report again until next year. Since the independent agencies will not be reporting again until 1999, it will be difficult for OMB to be in a position to address any major problems. In providing comments on this report, the Chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion stated that he and OMB will ask these agencies to report more frequently if, based on their April 1998 reports, it is apparent that there are problems.", "Agencies are required to report their progress in repairing noncompliant systems but are not required to report on their progress in implementing systems to replace noncompliant systems, unless the replacement effort is behind schedule by 2 months or more. Because federal agencies have a poor history of delivering new system capabilities on time, it is essential to know agencies\u2019 progress in implementing replacement systems.", "OMB\u2019s guidance does not specify what steps must be taken to complete each phase of a Year 2000 program (i.e., assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation). Without such guidance, agencies may report that they have completed a phase when they have not. For example, while the Defense Logistics Agency told us that it had completed the assessment phase, we found that it had not addressed several critical steps associated with the assessment phase, such as prioritizing systems for correction. As previously noted, our enterprise readiness guide provides information on the key tasks that should be performed within each phase.", "In a December 1997 letter to OMB, the Chairman, Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology, House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, expressed similar concerns, stating that \u201cOMB needs to require agency plans and reports that are more comprehensive and more reliable.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contingency Plans Imperative", "paragraphs": ["In January 1998, OMB asked agencies to describe their contingency planning activities in their February 1998 quarterly reports.

Accordingly, in their February 1998 quarterly reports, several agencies reported that they planned to develop contingency plans only if they fall behind schedule in completing their Year 2000 fixes.", "Agencies that develop contingency plans only for systems currently behind schedule, however, are not addressing the need to ensure the continuity of a minimal level of core business operations in the event of unforeseen failures. As a result, when unpredicted failures occur, agencies will not have well-defined responses and may not have enough time to develop and test effective contingency plans. Contingency plans should be formulated to respond to two types of failures: those that can be predicted (e.g., system renovations that are already far behind schedule) and those that are unforeseen (e.g., a system that fails despite having been certified as Year 2000 compliant or a system that cannot be corrected by January 1, 2000, despite appearing to be on schedule today).", "Moreover, contingency plans that focus only on agency systems are inadequate. Federal agencies depend on data provided by their business partners as well as on services provided by the public infrastructure (e.g., power, water, transportation, and voice and data telecommunications). One weak link anywhere in the chain of critical dependencies can cause major disruptions to business operations. Given these interdependencies, it is imperative that contingency plans be developed for all critical core business processes and supporting systems, regardless of whether these systems are owned by the agency.", "In its latest governmentwide Year 2000 progress report, issued March 10, 1998, OMB clarified its contingency plan instructions. OMB stated that while it requires agencies to report on their contingency plans under the circumstances described above, contingency plans should be developed for all core business functions. On March 18, we issued an exposure draft of a guide to help agencies ensure the continuity of operations through contingency planning.

Without such independent reviews, OMB and others, such as the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion, have no assurance that they are receiving accurate information. For example, as previously discussed, we have found agencies reporting that they have completed the assessment phase when critical work in this phase remained. In another example, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service had not performed adequate testing to assert that certain systems it had reported as compliant were capable of transitioning into the year 2000. Specifically, managers of three systems reported as compliant indicated that they had performed some tests on the transfer and storage of dates, but had not completed all Year 2000 compliance tests.", "We are also concerned about whether agencies have completed the assessment phase or are accurately reporting their status. Over two-thirds of the agencies stated that they had completed the assessment phase by November 1997, but in February 1998, several of these same agencies reported significant changes in the total number of mission-critical systems or increases in the number of systems being replaced, repaired or retired\u2014decisions that should have been made during the assessment phase. For example, although the Department of Energy reported that it had completed the assessment phase in November, it reported in February 1998 that the number of mission-critical systems had decreased by 21 percent (468 systems to 370) with corresponding decreases in the number already compliant, being replaced, and being repaired. Most of these changes were attributed to reclassifying systems as nonmission critical. Classification of systems should have been completed in the assessment phase. In addition, from November 1997 to February 1998, the Department of Agriculture increased the number of systems being replaced by 350 percent (from 58 to 261) and increased the number being retired by 17 percent (126 to 147), even though it reported that its assessment was complete in November 1997.

Accordingly, the agencies described their current or planned verification activities in their February reports, which included internal management processes, reviews by the agencies\u2019 inspectors general, and ongoing or planned contracts with vendors to perform independent verification and validation. While this has helped provide assurance that some verification is taking place through internal checks, reviews by inspectors general, or contractors, the full scope of verification activities required by OMB has not been articulated.", "It is important that the executive branch set standards for the types of reviews needed to provide assurance regarding the agencies\u2019 Year 2000 actions.

He added that it may be necessary at a later date for agencies to further prioritize these systems.", "While priority setting is always an iterative process, it would be prudent to give this more concentrated attention now. Only a little over one-third of the 24 agencies analyzed by OMB in its governmentwide report were making satisfactory progress and many critical large departments and agencies were not. For example, we are reporting today that the Department of Defense, which is responsible for about one-third of the government\u2019s mission-critical systems, has not yet determined, at the department level, which systems have the highest impact on its mission. Consequently, we are recommending that DOD clearly define criteria and an objective process for prioritizing systems for repair based on their mission criticality, and ensure that the most mission-critical systems will be repaired first. The department concurred with our recommendation and stated that \u201c. . . the Secretary of Defense will define criteria and a process for prioritizing systems for repair based on the needs and mission of the Department of Defense.

If priorities are not clearly set, the government may find that its highest priority systems are not ready in time but that they could have been corrected had management attention and resources been properly focused earlier. To help identify the government\u2019s most critical systems, (1) the Council on Year 2000 Conversion should set governmentwide priorities and (2) agencies must ensure that all component entities evaluate their systems using consistent priority-setting criteria that accurately reflect the agencies\u2019 core mission.", "Regarding our related recommendation on end-to-end operational testing and independent verification and validation of such testing, the Chairman stated that agencies are currently developing such plans and obtaining independent verification and validation for their systems. He added that the council and OMB will monitor these activities.

Unless responsibility is clearly assigned, it will be difficult to ensure that all organizations participate constructively and expeditiously. Further, the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion will have to assume leadership and take whatever actions are warranted should difficulties arise in obtaining needed participation and cooperation from state and local governments and the private sector. We modified our recommendation to clarify our position.", "With respect to our recommendation to require all critical agencies to report their progress quarterly, the Chairman\u2019s written response pointed to the recent OMB memorandum that required an additional 31 agencies to report to OMB on their Year 2000 progress in April 1998 and again in a year\u2019s time. However, this requirement does not currently pertain to all critical governmental and quasi-governmental agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service. The Chairman also stated that agencies considered central to the success of Year 2000 readiness should report their progress to OMB more frequently but did not state which agencies are considered central to the government\u2019s Year 2000 readiness or how frequently these agencies will be required to report their progress. The Chairman later told us that OMB is considering expanding the list of reporting entities to include other organizations. In addition, he stated that he and OMB will ask the additional 31 agencies to report more frequently than annually if, based on their April 1998 reports, it is apparent that there are problems.", "Since (1) all agencies which are critical to the nation\u2019s Year 2000 readiness should be monitored and (2) problems could surface at any point in the Year 2000 remediation process, especially during the latter testing and implementation phases, it is imperative that all critical agencies be identified and be required to report to OMB regularly and be included in OMB\u2019s governmentwide progress report. Moreover, just because an agency is not experiencing problems in April 1998 does not mean that it will not later encounter problems. Therefore, it is important to continue monitoring the progress of agencies which reported making adequate progress to ensure that such progress continues.", "The Chairman disagreed with our recommendation to require agencies, as part of their quarterly reports, to cite their progress in implementing systems intended to replace noncompliant systems. He stated that the current requirement\u2014under which agencies provide an exception report to OMB on replacement systems that have fallen 2 months or more behind schedule\u2014is an appropriate level of reporting. The Chairman stated that OMB and the council will monitor this issue closely to determine if more reporting is required in the future. However, waiting until later is very risky, given the federal government\u2019s poor record of delivering new systems capabilities when promised, and the immutability of the Year 2000 milestone. Over 1,100 mission-critical systems\u201422 percent of the government\u2019s noncompliant mission-critical systems\u2014are due to be replaced. To monitor their progress effectively, we believe that the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion, OMB, and the Congress need more thorough reports, including information on whether the replacement systems have been tested.", "In reference to our recommendation related to consistent agency reporting, the Chairman stated that the council will encourage OMB to have agencies report on their progress consistent with the CIO Council\u2019s best practice guide and our enterprise readiness guide. In our March meeting, the Chairman stated that agencies should use the criteria on the Year 2000 phases contained in our enterprise readiness guide when completing their quarterly reports. He added that OMB will likely encourage agencies to do so in its next quarterly report guidance. If OMB requires agencies to use the criteria set forth in our guide, this will satisfy our recommendation.", "With respect to our recommendation to require agencies to develop contingency plans for core business processes and supporting systems, the Chairman agreed that it is important to develop contingency plans for all core business functions. He did not, however, believe that agencies would be making the most efficient use of the time remaining by developing contingency plans for every supporting system. We clarified that we are not advocating the development of contingency plans for individual mission-critical systems. Rather, contingency plans should be developed for each core business process. A core business process may rely on one or more mission-critical systems which the contingency plan would address as part of its identification and mitigation of potential system failures. Moreover, those program managers responsible for core business processes should take a leading role in developing business continuity and contingency plans because they best understand their business processes and how problems can be resolved. In this manner, the business continuity and contingency planning activity generally complements, rather than competes with, the agency\u2019s Year 2000 remediation activities. We revised our recommendation to clarify our position.", "In his written response, the Chairman did not specifically address whether the council would require agencies to develop an independent verification strategy. Instead, he agreed that independent assessments of agencies\u2019 Year 2000 programs and their testing and planning approaches are important, stating that the council will examine how best to promote those assessments. The Chairman stated that he would work with the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency to encourage inspectors general to play a role in this area. In order to assure agencies, OMB, and the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion that their Year 2000 activities are effective, agencies must develop independent verification strategies which, in accordance with our recommendations, should be required by the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. In a later meeting, the Chairman stated that he and OMB will consider issuing more explicit directions on independent verification to the agencies, especially with regard to establishing standards for the type of verification and evaluation desired.", "To improve the effectiveness of the CIO Council\u2019s Year 2000 Committee, we recommended that the Chairman ensure that (1) agencies participate in the committee and (2) the Committee\u2019s subcommittees establish and publicize plans, milestones, and enforcement mechanisms. Regarding the first recommendation, the Chairman stated that in his meetings with agencies, he will continue to encourage their awareness of, and participation in, the activities of the Year 2000 Committee. With respect to the second recommendation, he said that he was satisfied that the committee is developing plans and milestones for its work and that OMB and the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion will continue to consult with the Committee on appropriate enforcement mechanisms. If the nation is to negotiate the millennium change successfully, the Chairman needs to ensure that the Year 2000 Committee and its subcommittees continue to play a central role in addressing the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 problem. Without full participation of the agencies as well as publicity of the subcommittees\u2019 plans, milestones, and enforcement mechanisms, it is less likely that appropriate solutions to governmentwide problems will be identified and effectively addressed.", "Although the Chairman agreed that the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion should view the Year 2000 problem as more than a federal systems problem and should adopt a global perspective, he did not address our recommendation to develop a comprehensive picture of the nation\u2019s Year 2000 readiness, and he did not fully agree with our recommendation to establish a national coordination structure using private/public partnerships in appropriate sector-based forums. The Chairman stated that he believed that the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion needed to be a catalyst, facilitator, and coordinator. He later told us that the council should only create and directly manage new national forums for specific sectors of the economy. He noted that to begin with, such partnerships would be appropriate in the energy and telecommunications sectors. In addition, the Chairman stated that the council can be effective by enlisting and supporting an agency, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, to coordinate an outreach approach to the health care industry. These agencies would be empowered to determine the appropriate measures the government should take to ensure progress in these industries. Senior executives of these coordinating agencies would be the agency\u2019s representatives on the council, which would then monitor and coordinate the agency\u2019s outreach activities and help ensure that there are not gaps in the coverage.", "We believe that the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion must posture itself to be in an informed position to provide Year 2000 leadership for the nation as a whole. To provide such leadership, the council must develop an approach to receive the best guidance directly from the private sector and state and local government bodies, in addition to views and perspectives garnered by federal agency executives. Moreover, while the federal agencies should play an important role in any Year 2000 assessment of our nation\u2019s key economic sectors, they may not always be in the best position to discharge responsibility for all outreach efforts in an economic sector. First, the problems that agencies face in ensuring their own Year 2000 compliance are daunting. Second, some sectors, such as telecommunications, health, safety, and emergency services, utilities, and manufacturing and small business have limited federal government involvement. As a result, in some sectors, the leadership role may be more appropriately placed in the private sector or state and local government. To clarify our position, we have modified our recommendation related to this issue.", "In addition to the comments of the Chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion, OMB staff and the Chairwoman of the CIO Council\u2019s Year 2000 Committee provided comments on the facts presented in the report, and generally agreed with these facts. OMB staff and the Chairwoman offered technical comments on selected sections of the report, and we have incorporated their suggested changes as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion; and Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
