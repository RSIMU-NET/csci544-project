Advocates of these hospitals contend that the focused mission and dedicated resources of specialty hospitals both improve quality and reduce costs. Critics contend that specialty hospitals siphon off the most profitable procedures and patient cases, thus eroding the financial health of neighboring general hospitals and impairing their ability to provide emergency care and other essential community services. Critics also contend that physician ownership of specialty hospitals creates financial incentives that may inappropriately affect physicians' clinical and referral behavior. In April 2003, GAO reported on certain aspects of specialty hospitals, including the extent of physician ownership and the relative severity of patients treated (GAO-03-683R). For this report, GAO was asked to examine (1) state policies and local conditions associated with the location of specialty hospitals, (2) how specialty hospitals differ from general hospitals in providing emergency care and serving a community's other medical needs, and (3) how specialty and general hospitals in the same communities compare in terms of market share and financial health."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 100 existing specialty hospitals identified by GAO--hospitals that focus on cardiac, orthopedic, or women's medicine or on surgical procedures--are geographically concentrated in areas where state policy facilitates hospital growth. Although 28 states have at least 1 specialty hospital, approximately two-thirds of the 100 specialty hospitals are located in 7 states. At least an additional 26 specialty hospitals were under development in 2003 and will tend to reinforce the existing pattern of geographic concentration. Specialty hospitals are much more likely to be found in states where hospitals are permitted to add beds or build new facilities without first obtaining state approval for such health care capacity increases. Relative to general hospitals, specialty hospitals, as a group, were much less likely to have emergency departments, treated smaller percentages of Medicaid patients, and derived a smaller share of their revenues from inpatient services. For example, 45 percent of specialty hospitals, but 92 percent of general hospitals, had emergency departments. There were, however, important differences among the four specialty hospital types in these and other service indicators. Although general hospitals typically have more beds than specialty hospitals, the focused mission of specialty hospitals often resulted in their treating more patients in their given fields of specialization. Financially, specialty hospitals tended to perform about as well as general hospitals did on their Medicare inpatient business. However, specialty hospitals tended to outperform general hospitals when the costs from all lines of business and the revenues from all payers were considered. Officials from three specialty hospital organizations commented on a draft of this report. They generally agreed with the report's information and commented on key differences between specialty and general hospitals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Specialty hospitals, which tend to focus on patients with specific medical  conditions or who need surgical procedures, represent a small but growing  segment of the health care industry. Such hospitals are not an entirely new  phenomenon, as children\u2019s and other types of specialty hospitals have  existed for decades. However, the recent growth in specialty hospitals has  been controversial because it has involved a new genre of hospitals. In  contrast to earlier forms of specialty hospitals, this new genre is  characterized by hospitals that are often for-profit and frequently owned,  in part, by some of the physicians who work in them.", "Advocates of these newer specialty hospitals contend that the focused  mission and dedicated resources of specialty hospitals allow physicians to treat more patients needing the same specialty services than they could in general hospitals and that, through such specialization and economies of  scale, the potential exists to improve quality and reduce costs. In contrast,  critics are concerned that specialty hospitals may concentrate on the most  profitable procedures and serve patients that have fewer complicating  conditions\u2014leaving general hospitals with a sicker, higher-cost patient  population. They contend that this practice of drawing away a more  favorable selection of patients makes it more financially difficult for  general hospitals to fulfill their broad mission to serve all of a community\u2019s  needs, including charity care, emergency services, and stand-by capacity  to respond to communitywide disasters. Critics have also raised concerns  that physician ownership of specialty hospitals creates financial incentives  that could inappropriately affect physicians\u2019 clinical and referral behavior.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to provide information about the  newer genre of specialty hospitals. In response, we issued a report in April  2003 that provided information on four specialty hospital types\u2014cardiac,  orthopedic, surgical, and women\u2019s\u2014regarding their share of the national  hospital market, the extent to which physicians have ownership interests  in these hospitals, and the patients served by these hospitals compared  with those served by general hospitals, in terms of illness severity. This  report provides additional information related to your request.  Specifically, it examines (1) what state policies and local market  conditions are associated with the location of specialty hospitals, (2) how  specialty hospitals differ from general hospitals in providing emergency  care and serving a community\u2019s other medical needs, and (3) how  specialty and general hospitals in the same communities compare in terms  of market share and financial health.", "Our work focused on acute care hospitals that tended to treat patients for  a limited group of diseases or conditions or that tended to perform  surgical procedures. Specifically, we considered a hospital to be a  specialty hospital if the diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification for  two-thirds of its Medicare patients (or two-thirds of all of its patients  where such data were available) fell into no more than two major  diagnosis categories, such as diseases of the circulatory system (cardiac),  or if at least two-thirds of its patients were classified in surgical DRGs. We  excluded hospitals that specialized in providing long-term care or  otherwise had missions that were largely distinct from the missions of  short-term, acute care general hospitals. We classified the hospitals that  fit these criteria into five specialty types\u2014cardiac, orthopedic, surgical,  women\u2019s, and other specialty. The other-specialty category contained six  hospitals that specialized in a variety of areas, such as eye and ear, nose,  and throat procedures. Because summary statistics for such a diverse  group would not be meaningful, we excluded these six hospitals from our  analysis.", "The information in this report is derived from our analysis of hospital  inpatient discharge data, responses to our 2003 survey of specialty  hospitals, responses to our 2002 survey of general hospitals, and other  data. We analyzed Medicare inpatient discharge data from all hospitals  nationwide to help identify specialty hospitals. We also used Healthcare  Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data on all patient discharges in 2000  from hospitals located in six states to help identify specialty hospitals.These six states contained slightly more than one-fourth of the existing  specialty hospitals that we identified nationwide. Our findings related to  the percentage of each hospital\u2019s patients covered by Medicaid or  Medicare, and hospitals\u2019 market shares are based on an analysis of HCUP  data from urban specialty and general hospitals in these six states. Our  findings related to hospitals\u2019 financial performance are based on fiscal  year 2001 data that hospitals nationwide submitted to Medicare. These  data include 55 of the 100 specialty hospitals we identified. (Although the  2001 data are the most recent available, many specialty hospitals were too  new to be included.) Other findings in this report are based on hospitals\u2019  responses to the survey that we sent to all of the specialty hospitals that  we identified or information that hospitals provided to Medicare or the  American Hospital Association (AHA).

One issue concerns physician ownership of specialty  hospitals and whether such ownership might inappropriately affect  physicians\u2019 clinical decision-making and referral behavior. A related issue  concerns the potential for specialty hospitals to benefit financially by  treating patients who are less severely ill, and therefore less costly, while  leaving general hospitals responsible for a mix of patients who need more  care and are more expensive to treat. Our April 2003 report provided  information on both issues: the extent of physician ownership at specialty  hospitals and the relative severity of patients\u2019 illnesses at specialty and  general hospitals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Physician Self-Referral Law and Hospital Payment Rules Provide Context for Issues Regarding Specialty Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["Much of the concern about specialty hospitals centers on physician  ownership issues. Federal law generally prohibits physicians from  referring Medicare patients for specific health care services to facilities in  which they (or their immediate family members) have financial interests.This prohibition, a key component of the Medicare self-referral or Stark  law (named after its chief sponsor in the House of Representatives,  Representative Pete Stark) was enacted after several studies found that  physicians with ownership interests in separate clinical laboratories,  diagnostic imaging centers, or physical therapy providers tended to make  more referrals to them and order substantially more services at higher  costs.", "The Stark law contains an exception that is relevant in the case of referrals  to specialty hospitals. The law includes an exception that permits  physicians who have an ownership interest in an entire hospital and who  also are authorized to perform services there to refer patients to that  hospital. The premise is that any referral or decision made by a physician  who has a stake in an entire hospital would produce little personal  economic gain because hospitals tend to provide a diverse and large group  of services. However, the Stark law does prohibit physicians who have  ownership interest only in a hospital subdivision from referring patients to  that subdivision. With respect to specialty hospitals, the concern exists  that, as these hospitals are usually much smaller in size and scope than  general hospitals and closer in size to hospital departments, the exception  to Stark could allow physician owners to influence their hospitals\u2019\u2014and  therefore their own\u2014financial gain through practice patterns and  referrals.", "The question of favorable patient selection\u2014the contention that specialty  hospitals treat a more financially favorable selection of patients as  compared to general hospitals\u2014has added to the debate about the  advantages and drawbacks of specialty hospitals. This issue is linked to  the way hospitals are paid. The fixed-rate, lump-sum payments that  Medicare and many other health care payers typically make to hospitals  for inpatient care for patients with a given diagnosis, regardless of the  costs of serving particular patients, are designed to promote efficiency by  discouraging hospitals from providing unnecessary services as a way to  boost revenues. However, these lump-sum payments foster undesirable  incentives, as hospitals may gain financially by serving a disproportionate  share of lower-cost patients with the same diagnoses. Medicare\u2019s hospital  payment system rules illustrate this principle.", "Under its system of prospective payments, Medicare pays a predetermined  rate for each hospital discharge, based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis and  whether the patient received surgery. In other words, the payments reflect  an average bundle of services that the beneficiary is expected to receive as  an inpatient for a particular diagnosis. Discharges are classified according  to a list of DRGs. DRG payment rates are based on the expected cost of  the diagnosis group\u2019s typical case compared with the cost for all Medicare  inpatient cases. The DRG payment is not adjusted for within-DRG  differences in severity of illness. Therefore, hospitals have a financial  incentive to treat as many patients as possible whose costs are low relative  to the costs of the average patient in each DRG.", "Our April 2003 study found that 21 out of 25 specialty hospitals treated a  lower percentage of patients who were severely ill compared with patients  in the same diagnosis categories treated at general hospitals in the same  urban areas. For example, in an urban area in Texas, 3 percent of an  orthopedic hospital\u2019s patients with that hospital\u2019s most common diagnoses  were classified as severely ill, as compared with 8 percent of patients with  the same diagnoses treated by the area\u2019s more than four dozen general  hospitals. In an urban area in Arizona, about 17 percent of a cardiac  hospital\u2019s patients with that hospital\u2019s most common diagnoses were  classified as severely ill, as compared to 22 percent of patients with the  same diagnoses treated by the area\u2019s more than two dozen general  hospitals. Not all specialty hospitals treated patients who were, by  comparison, less sick. Two of the 25 specialty hospitals treated a higher  percentage of severely ill patients and two others treated about the same  percentage as area general hospitals.

However, in the communities in which they locate, specialty  hospitals may treat a relatively large share of patients who have specific  medical conditions or need specific medical procedures. For the share of  the market that those patients represent, specialty hospitals are often  among the larger competitors that general hospitals face. In addition, the  number of specialty hospitals is growing rapidly. In the next few months  or years, the number of specialty hospitals that we identified is expected  to increase by at least 25 percent.", "The policy issue regarding emergency care may be one that is focused  more on access to such care and less on whether every specialty hospital  should have an emergency department. Although some specialty  hospitals\u2014especially cardiac hospitals\u2014provide at least a limited amount  of emergency care, individuals who need emergency care typically must  obtain treatment at general hospitals. Critics of specialty hospitals are  concerned that such facilities may erode the financial health of general  hospitals and impair their ability to provide emergency care and meet  other basic community needs, such as stand-by capacity to respond to  communitywide disasters. In this report, we did not attempt to determine  the financial effect that specialty hospitals may have on neighboring  general hospitals.", "Finally, we previously reported that the 25 urban specialty hospitals that  we studied in six states tended to treat patients who were less severely ill  relative to patients treated at neighboring general hospitals.
