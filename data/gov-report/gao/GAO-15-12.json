It is scheduled to go into effect in January 2015, although a challenge to the rule is currently pending in federal court. When developing the rule, DOL considered several factors, including the growth and specialization of the home care workforce, as well as the amount of time needed to make adjustments.", "Representatives from national organizations GAO interviewed identified potential effects of the Home Care Rule on jobs and earnings, employer costs, and care, but did not always agree. Some representatives said extending FLSA protections to home care workers will create more full-time employment opportunities for part-time workers, while others said those who work more than 40 hours in a workweek may see reduced hours and earnings. Some representatives said employers may face increased business costs to pay overtime and some said that certain consumers could be placed in institutions because of possible service cost increases. Effects on Medicaid home care services will vary by state. Officials in five of six states GAO visited explained that they were still assessing possible changes to their programs, while one state had determined what changes it would make to comply with the new rule.", "After the Home Care Rule was published, DOL collaborated with other federal agencies and stakeholders to develop guidance, conduct outreach, and provide technical assistance to help stakeholders plan for implementation. For example, DOL worked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to develop guidance on applying FLSA principles to different home care living arrangements commonly funded by Medicaid. DOL officials said they are focusing on technical assistance to help employers and states with implementation and have developed a phased-in enforcement strategy.

Home care services may be provided by one or more  worker(s); however, given the personal nature of the work, experts have  noted the benefits of maintaining continuity among home care workers,  and consumers often prefer to receive care from a limited number of  workers. Home care needs depend on many factors including each  consumer\u2019s functional limitations and the availability of informal supports,  such as those provided by family members, so the amount of time a  home care worker provides care can vary. For example, home care  workers may provide a few hours of home care per week or up to 24  hours per day depending on an individual\u2019s needs. Home care workers  may be employed directly by the consumer or by a third party home  health care agency that matches workers with consumers.

State Medicaid spending for most services is matched by  the federal government at a rate that is based in part on each state\u2019s per  capita income according to a formula established by law. State Medicaid  programs cover home care services through a wide and complex range of  options within Medicaid, which include providing this coverage as an  alternative to institutional care. The Medicaid program requires states to  cover certain home health services, and states may also elect to cover  additional home and community-based services under their Medicaid  programs, or through special waivers that allow them added flexibility in  covering these services. CMS has been working in partnership with  states, consumers, providers, and other stakeholders to create a  sustainable, person-driven long-term support system. According to CMS,  the system aims to allow people with disabilities and chronic conditions to  exercise choice and control, and to access quality services that assure  optimal outcomes, such as independence and quality of life.

In March 2012, Congress held a hearing to examine the  proposed rule and the possible effects of the narrowed definition of  companionship services. According to testimony from a DOL official, the  home care industry has \u201cundergone a dramatic transformation\u201d \u2013due in  part to increased demand for home care\u2014since DOL issued its  regulations on the companionship and live-in exemptions in 1975. For  example, the official stated that the number of certified home health care  agencies had increased from 2,242 in 1975 to more than 10,000 at the  end of 2009. The DOL official stated that the demand for home care has  increased as a result of the growth in the aging population, the rising  costs of institutional care, and the availability of funding assistance from  federally supported programs, such as Medicaid. Similarly, the number of  home care workers has increased. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  has reported that the total number of home care workers has more than  doubled in each of the last two decades\u2013with nearly 2.1 million workers in  2012\u2013and is expected to be among the fastest growing occupations in the  coming years. DOL officials also told us that as the industry has grown,  home care workers\u2019 duties have become more specialized. Home care  workers are assisting consumers with many more services than they had  been when the exemptions were enacted. According to DOL officials,  home care workers are increasingly providing specialized care, such as  assistance with activities of daily living and limited medical-related care\u2014 services that were previously provided in nursing homes or other  professional settings by trained nurses.", "With the expected continued growth in the demand for home care, DOL  officials also told us that in developing the proposed rule, they considered  how to improve worker wages and address high worker turnover. DOL  officials have noted that the growth in the industry and worker  responsibilities has not translated to growth in home care workers\u2019 wages,  which are among the lowest in the country. Additionally, home care  worker turnover has been a concern and one national group describes  the characteristics of the home care workforce to have \u201cchronically high  rates of workforce instability.\u201d DOL officials said the Home Care Rule is  an important step in ensuring that the home care industry attracts and  retains qualified workers, which the industry will need in the future.", "The basic process by which federal agencies typically develop and issue  regulations is set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as  certain other statutes and Executive Orders. Federal rulemaking  procedures generally include issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (NPRM) and providing an opportunity for public comment before issuing a  final rule, and may also include conducting a cost-benefit analysis, among  other things. During the rulemaking process for the Home Care Rule,  DOL officials said that in addition to considering the thousands of public  comments received in response to the proposed rule, the agency also  sought input from stakeholders in a variety of forums. Figure 3 highlights  some of the outreach that DOL conducted during the rulemaking process.", "During the comment period, DOL received more than 26,000 public  comments from various stakeholders. Comments were submitted by a  range of stakeholders, including individuals and organizations  representing home care workers, consumers of home care services,  public and private home care agencies, the disability community, and  state and federal government agencies.

The description of services that are subject to this limit was changed in the final  rule from the description in the proposed rule. referred to these services as \u201cintimate personal care services that are  incidental to the provision of fellowship and protection.\u201d While DOL  retained the fundamental purpose of the description, to make it easier  for the regulated community to understand, the final rule defines the  provision of care as assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs)  and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).", "Updated its estimate of the overall economic impact from a net cost of  $4.7 million per year in the proposed rule to a net benefit in the final  rule of between $3.9 and $27.3 million per year on average over 10  years.  DOL officials told us that developing estimates of the number  of home care workers was one of the greatest challenges they faced  when estimating economic impacts. However, they said that they  believe that their assumptions related to their earlier estimate resulted  in an overestimation of the number of workers. In general, limited data  are available on the number of home care workers or the amount of  services provided. As a result, information is limited on the  characteristics of the home care workforce, the terms under which  they are employed, the wage rates they currently earn, or the hours  they currently work. The updated estimate of economic impact  reflects changes to DOL\u2019s assumptions including, among others: (1)  how employers might respond to overtime requirements; (2) the  number of current home care workers without overtime coverage; (3)  the costs associated with hiring new workers; and (4) an estimate of  the benefits of reduced worker turnover resulting from workers  receiving increased wages through travel reimbursement and  overtime compensation.", "In the final rule, DOL also responded to some commenters\u2019 questions  about how existing FLSA principles\u2014those not changed by the Home  Care Rule\u2014will likely apply to home care workers. Many of these  questions were raised because when the Home Care Rule becomes  effective, the FLSA will apply to many home care arrangements that were  not originally structured with FLSA requirements in mind. For example,  many stakeholders raised questions about how to calculate work hours  for live-in home care workers who spend some of their time sleeping,  traveling, eating, or engaging in personal pursuits. DOL also responded to  comments in the final rule related to applying FLSA principles to various  home care structures, including those with shared living arrangements  and those where more than one entity could be considered a worker\u2019s  employer under the FLSA (known as joint employment).

One possibility these representatives mentioned is that  employers may avoid increased costs associated with overtime pay by  limiting workers\u2019 hours.

In addition, some family caregivers may rely on the income  they receive by providing care. In two states we visited, state officials  specifically expressed concern over situations where family members\u2019  work hours may be reduced in response to the Home Care Rule in  order to minimize overtime payments, which could reduce the family\u2019s  income. In another state, officials were less concerned about the  Home Care Rule\u2019s potential effect on family caregivers because one  of their Medicaid home care programs includes certain restrictions on  hiring a family member and limits the number of hours a family worker  can provide care.", "Though DOL guidance describes the parameters of an employment  relationship versus a familial relationship for the purposes of the  Home Care Rule, officials from one national organization told us that  it may be a challenge for some consumers and their family caregivers  to determine when FLSA principles apply. According to DOL  guidance, family workers may be entitled to FLSA minimum wage and  overtime protections depending on the specific circumstances of the  work arrangement.", "What are family caregivers?", "Paid family caregivers are typically not career  home care workers; rather they are usually  close family members and friends willing to  help the consumer. DOL guidance states that  in situations where family members are paid  care providers, there is both a familial and an  employment relationship, and only hours  worked within the scope of the employment  relationship are covered by the FLSA. In  these circumstances, the employment  relationship is usually limited by a \u201cplan of  care\u201d or other written agreement approved by  the program funding the services. For  example, a familial relationship rather than an  employment relationship would exist for a  father who has an adult son with a physical  disability and helps his son with eating dinner  and bathing in the evenings. If the son enrolls  in a Medicaid-funded program and the father  becomes his paid care provider under a  program-approved plan of care that funds 8  hours of services per day, then the father  would also be in an employment relationship  with his son for purposes of the FLSA for  those 8 hours. respite care\u2014a break from caregiving responsibilities\u2014to family  caregivers. In one state we visited, officials expressed concern that  FLSA principles would apply to respite workers. For example, officials  in this state said a worker may easily incur overtime in overnight  respite situations, which could potentially strain a consumer\u2019s budget  for care. Introducing additional workers to provide respite in order to  avoid overtime costs may not always be practical. For example, one  state official said it may be very disruptive for some consumers, such  as those with intellectual and developmental disabilities who do not  handle changes well, to have different caregivers in a respite situation  over the course of a weekend.", "Live-in arrangements\u2014Under some Medicaid-funded programs, home  care workers and consumers may live together. Officials in two of the  states we visited told us they were concerned about how FLSA  requirements may affect live-in care arrangements for those  consumers who require substantial care and how it could be costly to  comply with the FLSA in certain live-in situations. Many of these live- in arrangements were designed without consideration of FLSA  overtime requirements and were made affordable by reliance on the  companionship and live-in exemptions. State officials in one state we  visited said they may redesign one of their live-in programs in  response to the Home Care Rule to help keep overtime costs down.  However, they said it would require time to reevaluate and possibly  rewrite parts of existing program guidance.", "State budgets\u2014Officials in all of the six states we visited said the  Home Care Rule has the potential to strain limited state budgets. For  example, officials in three states said that Medicaid rates may not be  sufficient to cover additional costs incurred as a result of the rule,  including compensable travel time between Medicaid beneficiaries.  According to state officials in three of the states we visited, their state  legislatures had not yet budgeted additional funding that may be  needed to comply with the Home Care Rule once it goes into effect.  States may have to make systems changes to track overtime among  workers, for example, which could be costly and would require time to  implement. States are also facing their own unique budgetary  challenges. For example, officials from at least two states we visited  mentioned wages increasing, which could also pose a financial strain  and mean that implementing the Home Care Rule\u2019s overtime  requirements will cost more. In one state we visited, the minimum  wage is set to increase from $8.00 to $9.00 by December 31, 2015.", "Capacity\u2014In addition to implementing the Home Care Rule, state  officials we interviewed expressed concern over resources and having  the capacity to implement and comply with other recent federal  requirements. For example, officials in three states said that the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s penalties for employers  failing to offer full-time employees affordable health insurance are  scheduled to go into effect at roughly the same time as the Home  Care Rule. CMS also recently issued regulations on home and  community-based services and some state officials said that they  have been focusing their attention on complying with these  regulations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOL Worked with Federal Agencies and Stakeholders to Develop Guidance on Implementing the Home Care Rule", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL Developed Implementation Guidance", "paragraphs": ["After the Home Care Rule was published, DOL developed guidance,  conducted outreach, and provided technical assistance to help state  Medicaid programs and other stakeholders plan for implementation. For  example, to help workers and consumers determine if federal minimum  wage and overtime pay are required, DOL has made available on its  website several self-assessment tools which ask a series of questions  about the nature of the work, the employer, and the services performed.  In addition, DOL has answered various Frequently Asked Questions  (FAQs) and developed fact sheets to explain how the Home Care Rule  will apply. For example, DOL answers questions on its website about how  to apply FLSA to the hours a worker spends sleeping, as is the case  when a home care worker lives with a consumer. DOL has also published  several fact sheets on specific topics on its website to provide  stakeholders with compliance assistance, such as how the FLSA will  apply to paid family caregivers once the Home Care Rule goes into effect.  DOL officials said they have trained staff in the national and regional  offices in order to expand their capacity for compliance assistance, such  as providing technical assistance.", "In its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, DOL states that one of its goals is to  improve compliance with federal wage and overtime laws by providing  compliance assistance and conducting outreach with stakeholders. After  the final rule was issued, DOL collaborated with federal agencies and  conducted outreach with stakeholders to help them better understand the  implications of the rule on state Medicaid programs and develop  applicable guidance (see fig. 5). Since many Medicaid programs  providing home care services were created with the expectation that the  workers would be exempt from the FLSA, DOL initiated an interagency  workgroup comprised of individuals from DOL, CMS, and DOJ to  understand the variation among different state Medicaid programs and  the laws that protect people with disabilities. DOL identified two areas in  which Medicaid programs could use additional guidance and developed  written guidance, sponsored webinars, and conducted outreach with all  50 states to assist with compliance. In addition, CMS also issued  guidance to assist states in understanding options for consumer-directed  programs in implementing the changes made by the Home Care Rule.", "The two major guidance documents DOL issued pertain to:", "Shared living arrangements\u2014In response to the proposed rule, DOL  received many comments from stakeholders requesting that it clarify  how FLSA wage and hour requirements apply to certain shared living  arrangements funded under Medicaid. DOL consulted with  stakeholders to learn about the different types of shared living models  used by states and the differences among them. In March 2014, DOL  issued an Administrator\u2019s Interpretation, which provided guidance on  how FLSA principles apply to shared living arrangements.representative from one national organization we interviewed said that  it was collaborating with another national organization to develop a  reader-friendly guide on shared living to further help state Medicaid  agencies and other home care providers implement FLSA  requirements. The design of states\u2019 shared living programs can vary  greatly, as can the specific facts and circumstances around these  living situations. For example, in one state we visited, a state official  said that most shared living arrangements in the state consist of home  care providers opening up their homes to consumers. In another state  we visited, home care workers typically move into the home of the  consumer. The shared living guidance provides detailed examples  about different types of live-in arrangements including: (1) those in  which a consumer lives in a home care worker\u2019s house, (2) those in  which a home care worker lives in a consumer\u2019s house, and (3) those  in which the two move into a new house together (see fig. 6).", "The guidance on shared living also explains that FLSA requirements may  or may not apply to home care workers in these arrangements and will  depend, in part, on whether the home care worker would be considered  an employee or an independent contractor. To determine this, DOL  uses the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test, which reviews a series of factors.  Some of the factors reviewed in determining whether a worker is an  employee or an independent contractor include who sets wages and work  hours and who determines how the work is performed. The guidance  also provides various examples of shared living arrangements and what  the result would be under the economic realities test. According to the  guidance, in most situations where a consumer moves into the home care  worker\u2019s existing home, the worker will not be considered an employee of  the consumer under the FLSA. This is primarily because the home care  worker has a greater degree of control over the work and investment in  the arrangement, including maintaining and modifying the residence. On  the other hand, the guidance says that when a worker moves into the  home of a consumer, the worker will typically be considered an employee  of the consumer under the FLSA, because the consumer has invested in  and controls the residence, and likely sets the schedule and directs how  and when tasks are to be performed. Several of the national  organizations and states we interviewed appreciated DOL\u2019s efforts to  explain how these different types of Medicaid services are delivered and  the specific examples provided in the shared living guidance. Based on  the guidance, officials in two states we visited said that they do not  anticipate having to make changes because they believe the FLSA does  not apply to them based on the way their shared living programs are  structured.", "Joint employment\u2014DOL reached out to stakeholders to understand  how different Medicaid programs are structured to develop guidance  on the application of FLSA joint employment principles and to help  states implement the Home Care Rule. Under the FLSA, a single  worker may be an employee of two or more employers at the same  time. For example, in the context of home care, a consumer and a  third party such as a state Medicaid agency or a private home care  agency may jointly employ a worker. Because the FLSA will apply to  many more home care workers once the Home Care Rule goes into  effect, in June 2014 DOL issued an Administrator\u2019s Interpretation  providing guidance on joint employment. This guidance could help  stakeholders understand situations in which there is a third party joint  employer for purposes of FLSA, such as in certain Medicaid-funded  consumer-directed programs. According to DOL, most, but not all,  consumer-directed programs will have a third party joint employer  such as a private agency, non-profit organization, or public entity in  addition to the consumer.", "States have been reexamining their roles and responsibilities under  Medicaid in order to determine if they are third party joint employers in  certain situations and therefore responsible for meeting the FLSA\u2019s  minimum wage and overtime requirements, according to an official at  the National Association of Medicaid Directors. States are particularly  concerned about situations in which they may be a joint employer to  home care workers who provide care for multiple consumers because  such workers may accrue overtime. For example, in one state we  visited, a home care worker said she works for three different  consumers under the state\u2019s consumer-directed programs where the  consumer or a family member is considered the employer. She does  not work for any one consumer for more than 40 hours per week. If  the state is a joint employer for these programs, it may be responsible  for compensating the worker with overtime wages any time she works  more than 40 hours per week cumulatively across any of the  consumers (see fig. 7).", "Certain states have already determined that they are joint employers.  Prior to issuing the Administrator\u2019s Interpretation on joint employment,  DOL responded to specific inquiries from states about the application  of FLSA to specific scenarios. For example, an Oregon state official  asked DOL to provide an official opinion on whether the state would  be considered a joint employer of home care workers who provided  services under their Oregon-sponsored consumer-directed Medicaid  program. DOL applied the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test used by the courts,  using information provided by the state and determined that the state  would be considered a joint employer in that program. One state we  visited, California, has already determined based on prior experience  that it would be considered a joint employer under the FLSA in certain  Medicaid-funded situations and would therefore be responsible for  paying eligible workers overtime under the new rule. For one  California program, the state considered limiting workers\u2019 hours to 40  hours per week to help control costs, but ultimately budgeted more  than $170 million to pay the approximately 50,000 workers in that  program who work up to a certain amount of overtime, with that cost  expected to increase.", "However, five of the six states we visited were still in the process of  trying to determine how the FLSA joint employment principles apply to  their specific Medicaid programs and whether they will have to make  any changes to their programs to keep the cost of home care services  affordable. Two of these states also said they need additional time to  understand the joint employment guidance in order to determine how  their existing Medicaid programs may be affected by the FLSA  framework and what steps they may need to take to comply. Officials  in these two states also said they are trying to figure out if any of their  programmatic changes would require CMS approval. CMS officials  said the approval process could take from 90 to 180 days, depending  on the type of change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Plans a Phased-In Enforcement Strategy but Does Not Have Plans to Evaluate the Effects of the Rule", "paragraphs": ["While DOL has several enforcement mechanisms in place to oversee the  Home Care Rule\u2019s implementation once it goes into effect, DOL officials  said they are currently focusing their efforts on technical assistance to  help employers and states with implementing the rule. For example, in  October 2014, DOL announced that it will not bring enforcement actions  against any employer for violations of FLSA resulting from the Home Care  Rule through June 2015. DOL stated that it had received requests from  national organizations representing state Medicaid programs and  disability advocates and two states to extend the effective date of the  Home Care Rule. According to DOL, these entities requested additional  time to make programmatic, budgetary, and operational adjustments to  state Medicaid programs. DOL also said it received requests from  national organizations and worker advocates to implement the Home  Care Rule on the published date of January 1, 2015 so that workers could  be protected by the FLSA without delay. While DOL did not extend the  effective date of the Home Care Rule, the agency recognized that the  implementation of the Home Care Rule raised sensitive issues and it has  been working with employers to minimize the effects on consumers who  rely on home care. For these reasons, DOL stated that during the six  month period of non-enforcement, it will concentrate its resources on  providing intensive technical assistance to the community, particularly  state agencies administering home care programs. In the notice, DOL  stated that from July 1, 2015 until December 31, 2015, it will make  determinations on a case-by-case basis as to whether to bring  enforcement actions in the home care context and will give strong  consideration to an employer\u2019s efforts to meet the requirements under the  FLSA. During this time period, DOL plans to continue extensive outreach  and technical assistance.", "While DOL has adopted this phased-in enforcement strategy to promote  compliance, the effects of the Home Care Rule still remain uncertain. In  2011, the President signed Executive Order 13563, entitled Improving  Regulation and Regulatory Review. The order states that our regulatory  system \u201cmust promote predictability and reduce uncertainty.\u201d The order  directed each federal executive agency to develop a plan for conducting  retrospective reviews of existing significant regulations, to determine  whether they should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed to  make the agency\u2019s regulatory program more effective or less  burdensome. We previously reported that retrospective reviews are  useful because regulations can change the behavior of regulated entities  and the public in ways that cannot be predicted prior to implementation. In  addition, these reviews may result in various outcomes such as changes  to regulations, changes or additions to guidance, decisions to conduct  additional studies, or validation that existing rules were working as  planned. We have also observed that it is important for agencies to  consider in advance how they will evaluate their regulations, to better  position them to conduct future retrospective analyses. DOL officials told  us it would be premature to think about the effects of the rule since they  are developing further implementation plans and focusing on providing  technical assistance. DOL officials also said they had not made any plans  for evaluating the Home Care Rule and that it is too early to design such  a study. In 2007, we recommended that during the promulgation of  certain new rules, agencies consider how and when they will measure the  performance of the regulation, including how and when they will collect,  analyze, and report the data needed to conduct a retrospective review.  Consistent with that recommendation, guidance from the Office of  Management and Budget also states that regulations should be designed  and written in ways that facilitate evaluation of their consequences and  thus promote retrospective analyses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Home care agencies and state Medicaid programs are responding to the  Home Care Rule through programmatic and policy changes, and while  more home care workers will be entitled to receive federal minimum wage  and overtime pay protections as a result of the Home Care Rule, the  effects of the rule will remain unclear until after it is implemented. The  effects on workers and consumers will largely depend on how employers  respond to overtime requirements and the changes that are made to state  Medicaid programs. Given that many state Medicaid programs have  relied on the companionship services exemption and emphasize  providing care at home, state Medicaid officials continue to be concerned  about maintaining services for consumers in their homes as opposed to  institutions. DOL\u2019s recent announcement regarding the phase-in of its  enforcement, coupled with its substantial outreach to stakeholders and  revised estimate of the economic impact of the rule, highlight the  challenges and complexity of implementing the rule. The future of the  Home Care Rule will depend on the outcome of pending litigation and  DOL\u2019s subsequent decisions about implementation. Should the rule go  into effect as scheduled, once it is fully implemented, DOL will have an  opportunity to examine some of the broader implications of the Home  Care Rule such as whether the workforce grows as a result to meet any  increased demand for home care and whether there is any resulting  increase in the use of institutional care. However, in the absence of a plan  to evaluate the effects of the rule, DOL may be unprepared to collect the  necessary data to take advantage of this opportunity.
