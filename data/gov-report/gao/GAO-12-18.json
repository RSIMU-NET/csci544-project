The diversity of Reserve Bank boards was limited from 2006 to 2010. For example, in 2006 minorities accounted for 13 of 108 director positions, and in 2010 they accounted for 15 of 108 director positions. Specifically, in 2010 Reserve Bank directors included 78 white men, 15 white women, 12 minority men, and 3 minority women. According to the Federal Reserve Act, Class B and C directors are to be elected with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumer representation. During this period, labor and consumer groups had less representation than other industries. In 2010, 56 of the 91 directors that responded to GAO's survey had financial markets experience. Reserve Banks generally review the current demographics of their boards and use a combination of personal networking and community outreach efforts to identify potential candidates for directors. Reserve Bank officials said that they generally limit their director search efforts to senior executives. GAO's analysis of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data found that diversity among senior executives is generally limited. While some Reserve Banks recruit more broadly, GAO recommends that the Federal Reserve Board encourage all Reserve Banks to consider ways to help enhance the economic and demographic diversity of perspectives on the boards, including by broadening their potential candidate pool. The Federal Reserve System mitigates and manages the actual and potential conflicts of interest by, among other things, defining the directors' roles and responsibilities, monitoring adherence to conflict-of-interest policies, and establishing internal controls to identify and manage potential conflicts. Reserve Bank directors are often affiliated with a variety of financial firms, nonprofits, and private and public companies. As the financial services industry evolves, more companies are becoming involved in financial services or interconnected with financial institutions. As a result, directors of all three classes can have ties to the financial sector. While these relationships may not give rise to actual conflicts of interest, they can create the appearance of a conflict as illustrated by the participation of director-affiliated institutions in the Federal Reserve System's emergency programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To increase transparency, GAO recommends that all Reserve Banks clearly document the directors' role in supervision and regulation activities in their bylaws. One option for addressing directors' conflicts of interest is for the Reserve Bank to request a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board, which, according to officials, is rare. Most Reserve Banks do not have a process for formally requesting such waivers. To strengthen governance practices and increase transparency, GAO recommends that the Reserve Banks develop and document a process for requesting conflict waivers for directors. The Federal Reserve System's governance practices are generally similar to those of selected central banks and comparable institutions such as bank holding companies and have similar selection procedures for directors. However, Reserve Bank governance practices tend to be less transparent than those of these institutions. For instance, comparable organizations make information on their board committees and ethics policies available on their websites; most Reserve banks do not."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Reserve System, which consists of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), 12 regional  Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),  played a key role in the U.S. government\u2019s policy responses to the  financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007. From late 2007  through mid-2010, Reserve Banks provided more than a trillion dollars in  emergency loans to the financial sector to address strains in credit  markets and to avert failures of individual institutions believed to be a  threat to the stability of the financial system. The scale and nature of this  assistance amounted to a rare and significant exercise of the Federal  Reserve System\u2019s emergency powers as a lender of last resort.", "Unlike the Federal Reserve Board, the Reserve Banks are not federal  agencies. Each Reserve Bank is a federally chartered corporation with a  board of directors. The membership of each Reserve Bank board  includes three directors who represent commercial banks that are  members of the Federal Reserve System and six directors who represent  the public. During the crisis, the Federal Reserve System came under  scrutiny when it became known that several institutions that borrowed  from the emergency programs were affiliated with Reserve Bank  directors. Some Members of Congress and others raised concerns about  actual or potential conflicts of interest that may have been created by  these affiliations and the possibility that some directors had exerted  influence on the emergency lending activities of the Reserve Banks. More  broadly, the Reserve Bank board structure that includes three directors  who represent banks supervised by the Reserve Banks caused public  concern about the governance of the banks, including the selection and  roles of directors and the extent to which directors elected to represent  the public do so. For example, questions were raised as to whether the  directors representing member banks had any involvement in the  Reserve Banks\u2019 role in supervising member banks.", "Title XI of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection  Act (Dodd-Frank Act) contains provisions intended to enhance  transparency and accountability related to the Federal Reserve System\u2019s  emergency lending activities as well as a change to the elections of  Reserve Bank presidents.

We created a descriptive profile of  the demographic characteristics, including race, gender, and industry, of  Reserve Bank directors from 2006 through 2010. We used (1) the  demographic characteristics of directors obtained from the Federal  Reserve Board, and (2) the demographic characteristics of executives  who would likely meet the criteria for potential directors using Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) data. We determined  whether the diversity trends of Reserve Bank directors are generally  consistent with the trends illustrated by the Employer Information Report  (EEO-1) data. The EEO-1 data represent the pool of potential  candidates with the requisite skills and experience from which the Federa Reserve generally selects directors. To assess the reliability of the  Federal Reserve Board data, we interviewed Federal Reserve Board staf about steps they took to maintain the integrity and reliability of the  database. To assess the reliability of the EEO-1 data, we reviewed  documentation related to the data and interviewed EEOC officials on the  methods used to collect data and checks performed to ensure data  reliability. We believe that these data are sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our analysis. Also, to obtain baseline information from all  current directors on a cross section of high-level issues, we conducted a  web-based survey of the 105 Reserve Bank directors that served for thefull year during 2010. Of the 105 directors surveyed, 91 responded to the  survey overall. However, the number of responses to individual questio ns  varied. We collected and summarized additional information from thesedirectors, such as their other board positions, prior employment, an education. For a full description of the methodology of the survey, see  appendix II.

We surveyed all Reserve Bank directors who  served for the full year during 2010 to collect their perception of their roles  and responsibilities and to determine whether they are aware of any past  or present conflict of interest. Also, we interviewed selected Reserve  Bank directors and Reserve Bank officials from each Reserve Bank to  collect information on directors\u2019 roles and responsibilities, any conflict of  interest concerns and procedures for addressing the appearance of or  actual conflicts, and potential changes to Reserve Bank governance.  Specifically, at each of the 12 Reserve Banks, we interviewed at least one  director from each class (A, B, and C), all board and audit committee  chairs, the president, general counsel or ethics officer, and corporate  secretary. In addition, to identify any discussions on instances of potential  or actual conflicts of interest during board meetings, we reviewed board  minutes for each of the 12 Reserve Banks for the period of November  2007 to October 2010. To address the Reserve Bank directors\u2019  involvement in the establishment and operations of the Federal Reserve  emergency programs, we leveraged our work from the recent Federal  Reserve Emergency Program review, which conducted related work  under the Dodd-Frank Act. We reviewed relevant documents from each  of the 12 Reserve Banks, including bylaws, procurement policies and any  policies for waivers to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies on director  eligibility, qualifications, and rotation. We also reviewed Reserve Bank  board minutes to help determine the extent of the directors\u2019 involvement  in any activities associated with the emergency programs and supervision  and regulation matters. In addition, we interviewed a sample of directors  and relevant Reserve Bank officials as noted earlier to determine the  directors\u2019 involvement in the implementation and operation of the  programs.", "To compare Reserve Bank governance practices with the practices of  selected organizations, we reviewed literature on current best practices  for governance within major financial institutions, analyzed similar  institutions in other countries or the United States to evaluate best  practices or alternative structures, and relied on the results of our work  done for our other objectives. We examined how the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s governance practices compare with relevant practices at  selected foreign central banks, a self-regulatory organization, a  government-sponsored enterprise, and several large bank holding  companies. For the foreign central banks, we contacted officials at foreign  central banks in Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United  Kingdom to obtain governance documents and we analyzed governance  policies and practices in order to compare governance of the Reserve  Banks with governance of other foreign central banks. We spoke to  academic researchers knowledgeable about central bank governance.  We verified the accuracy of our analysis and interpretations of  governance documents by requesting comments on the relevant draft  sections from each of the central banks included in our review. We  incorporated their comments as appropriate. For the self-regulatory  organization and the government-sponsored entity, we identified and  analyzed the relevant governance policies and practices of the Financial  Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA) and for the cooperative system, the  Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks).

The Federal Reserve Board  has defined the term \u201cmonetary policy\u201d as the actions undertaken by a  central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System, to influence the  availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national  economic goals. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, gave the  Federal Reserve System responsibility for setting monetary policy.

Each Reserve Bank is a federally chartered corporation with a board of  directors and member banks who are stockholders in the Reserve Banks.  The membership of each Reserve Bank board of directors is determined  by a process established by statute that is intended to ensure that each  bank board represents both the public and member banks in its district.  Under the Federal Reserve Act, Reserve Banks are subject to the general  supervision of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board  has delegated some of its supervisory responsibilities to the Reserve  Banks, such as responsibility for examining bank and thrift holding  companies and state member banks under rules, regulations and policies  established by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Act  authorizes the Reserve Banks to make discount window loans, in  accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Federal  Reserve Board, and to execute monetary policy operations at the  direction of the FOMC. The Reserve Banks also provide payment  services, such as check clearing and wire transfers, to depository  institutions, the Treasury, and government agencies. The provision of  these payment services to depository institutions is subject to the full cost  recovery provisions of the Monetary Control Act of 1980. Reserve Banks  also provide cash services to financial institutions and serve as the  Treasury\u2019s Fiscal Agent.", "The FOMC plays a central role in the execution of the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s monetary policy mandate to promote price stability and  maximum employment. The FOMC consists of the seven members of the  Board of Governors, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York, and four other Reserve Bank presidents who serve on a rotating  basis. All presidents participate in FOMC deliberations even though not  all vote. The FOMC is responsible for directing open market operations to  influence the total amount of money and credit available in the economy.

Each group is responsible for one of the three Class A  directorships and one of the three Class B directorships. Each member  bank in the group may nominate a candidate for an open directorship  within its group. Once nominations close, each member bank in the group  receives the list of nominees and a ballot to vote in the election. Directors  serve 3-year terms, and the terms are staggered so that one position in  each class becomes vacant every year. Although directors can be  reelected to an indefinite number of terms, the Federal Reserve Board  recommends that the Reserve Banks follow a limit of two consecutive  appointments for a given director.", "The Federal Reserve Act does not prescribe how the Federal Reserve  Board is to identify and appoint the candidates for Class C directors.  Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act, one Class C director, who must be  a person of \u201ctested banking experience,\u201d is designated by the Federal  Reserve Board as chairman of the Reserve Bank board of directors, and  the Federal Reserve Board also designates another Class C director as  deputy chairman. The Federal Reserve Act provides that the chairman of  the board, like all Class C directors, cannot be an officer, director,  employee, or stockholder of any bank. The Federal Reserve Board policy  extends this limitation to prevent affiliations by Class B and Class C  directors with any thrift, credit union, bank holding company, foreign bank,  and other similar institutions and affiliates. Additionally, the Federal  Reserve Act states that Class C directors must have been residents of  the district of their Reserve Bank for 2 years prior to appointment. As with  the election of Class A and B directors, the appointment of Class C  directors is staggered so that one director position becomes vacant every  year.

One Reserve Bank corporate secretary we spoke  with said that it was difficult to recruit diverse candidates within his district  because of a lack of overall diversity in the region.", "To obtain information from all current directors on a cross section of high- level issues, we conducted a web-based survey of the 105 Reserve Bank  directors that served for the full year during 2010. We collected and  summarized additional demographic information for 2010 directors, such  as their prior work experience, education, and other board positions.  Many Reserve Bank directors responding to the survey typically had  experience in the finance industry and almost all currently serve on a  variety of other boards. At least 56 have had some financial industry  experience. After the financial industry, the next most reported work  experiences by industry were manufacturing; professional, scientific, and  technical services; retail trade; and real estate and rental leasing. The  vast majority of the directors who responded to the survey reported that  they had completed a bachelor\u2019s degree. More specifically, over half of  the directors responding to the survey (55) reported that they had  completed some type of advanced degree, such as a master\u2019s, juris  doctor, or doctorate. In 2010, 86 of 91 Reserve Bank directors responding  to our survey served on a variety of nonprofit, private, and public  company boards. For example, directors held board positions at public  and private universities; for-profit companies such as Loews Corporation,  Safeway, Inc., and Energizer Holdings; and nonprofit organizations such  as the Ford Foundation and Ronald McDonald House Charities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reserve Bank Directors Are Generally Senior Executives, a Subset of Management That Is Less Diverse", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed EEOC\u2019s EEO-1 data for employers with 100 or more  employees from 2007 through 2009. The EEO-1 data provide information  on racial/ethnic and gender representation for various occupations within  a broad range of industries. We used the EEO-1 \u201cexecutive and senior  level officials and managers\u201d job category as the basis for our analysis  because this is the category of employees from which Reserve Banks  would most likely recruit directors. EEOC defines the job category of  executive and senior level officials and managers as individuals residing  in the highest levels of organizations who plan, direct, and formulate  policies, and provide overall direction for the development and delivery of  products and services. Figure 7 provides EEO-1 data for individual  minority groups and illustrates their trend in representation at the  management level, which varied by group.", "As shown in figure 7, among all EEO-1 reporters, senior management  representation by whites and Asians increased from 2007 through 2009.  For example, whites accounted for 87.4 percent of all industry senior  management positions in 2007; and they accounted for 88.6 percent of  senior managers in 2009. Moreover, while representation by Asians also  increased during this period, African Americans and Hispanics in senior  management decreased steadily. For example, Hispanics accounted for  4.5 percent of all industry senior management positions in 2007; and they  accounted for 3.5 percent in 2009. Representation for \u201cOther\u201d races  remained constant from 2007 through 2009.", "Figure 7 also compares race and ethnicity and gender between the EEO- 1 and Federal Reserve Board datasets. EEO-1 data show that the pool of  senior managers\u2014a possible pipeline for potential Federal Reserve  directors\u2014has limited diversity. For example, minorities accounted for  12.6 percent of all senior management positions in 2007 and 11.4 percent  in 2009. Similarly, minorities accounted for 12.4 percent of Federal  Reserve directors in 2009.", "As shown in figure 8, diversity was limited among senior-level  management in the commercial banking industry. Because Class A  directors are nominated and elected by the member banks in each  Federal Reserve district to represent the stockholding banks, they are  generally officers or directors of a member commercial bank. EEO-1  data show that, on average, the pool of senior managers in the  commercial banking industry, a source that provides the pool of  candidates for Class A directors, is less diverse than senior management  in terms of race and ethnicity in all other industries combined. In 2009, the  percentage of senior management positions held by minorities ranged  from an average of 9.6 percent for commercial banking institutions to an  average of 11.5 percent for all other industries combined. However, the  average percentage of positions held by women was relatively consistent  between commercial banking institutions and all other industries, 29.0  percent and 28.3 percent, respectively.", "Reserve Bank officials said they generally focus their search on senior  executives. To explore whether Reserve Banks expanding their search to  include nonexecutives would increase diversity, we spoke with officials  and directors about their views on this matter. Several Reserve Bank  executives and directors told us that having senior executives on the  board of directors helps elevate the stature of the board. In addition, they  said that individuals working at the top of their organization may have a  broader view of how their industry is being affected by the economy. On  the other hand, one Reserve Bank official told us that he felt looking  below the executive level for potential directors was important. Further, at  one Reserve Bank, the corporate secretary told us the bank actively looks  for directors who may not be senior-level executives in an attempt to  increase diversity. At another Reserve Bank, the corporate secretary  stated that the bank has had nonexecutives serve on the board both  currently and in the past.", "In previous work on diversity in the financial services industry, we found  that individuals holding positions one level below senior management  were more diverse than senior management. According to this work,  EEOC data showed that generally, management-level representation by  minority women and men increased from 11.1 percent to 17.4 percent  from 1993 through 2008. However, these EEOC data overstated minority  representation at senior management levels, because the category  included midlevel management positions, such as assistant branch  manager, that may have greater minority representation. In 2008, EEOC  reported revised data for senior-level positions only, which showed that  minorities held 10 percent of such positions compared with 17.4 percent  of all management positions. This suggests that by broadening its pool of  potential candidates below the executive level, Reserve Banks may be  able to attract more diverse director candidates with potentially more  diverse backgrounds and perspectives on the economy.", "We also analyzed EEO-1 data by Federal Reserve district to determine  district-level trends in senior management across all industries. This  analysis demonstrates that diversity of senior managers in the Federal  Reserve districts varies. As shown in figure 9, certain Federal Reserve  districts\u2019 territories are somewhat more diverse than others at the senior  management level. For example, in 2009, the percentage of senior  management positions held by minorities ranged from a high of 18.7  percent within the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s territory to a  low of 4.0 percent within the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  territory, indicating that diversity among senior managers does vary by  district.", "Reserve Banks select candidates to fill director vacancies based upon  criteria in the Federal Reserve Act and guidance from the Federal  Reserve Board. The act provides requirements for the nomination and  election of directors. The act requires that member banks of each district  be classified into three groups consisting of banks of similar  capitalization\u2014small, medium, and large. The member banks in each  group nominate and elect one Class A director to represent that group\u2019s  banks and one Class B director to represent the public. After the  candidates are identified and a list of their names is forwarded to the  member banks, each bank may cast one vote for a Class A director and  one vote for a Class B director. Class C directors, who also represent the  public, are recommended by the Reserve Banks and appointed by the  Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also provides  guidance on director election and eligibility requirements in the Federal  Reserve Administrative Manual (FRAM). Additionally, the act specifies  that all directors shall be chosen without discrimination as to race, creed,  color, sex, or national origin and that Class B and Class C directors who  represent the public shall be elected \u201cwith due but not exclusive  consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services,  labor, and consumers.\u201d Each year the Federal Reserve Board provides a  memorandum to Reserve Banks with priority objectives for the  recruitment of individuals with independent and diverse views and  potential sources from which to obtain diverse directors. In addition, it  distributes a yearly report on the demographic and industry  characteristics of directors to each of the Reserve Banks for their use as  they seek to identify and consider potential candidates.", "Reserve Banks review the current demographics and areas of expertise  of their boards when selecting candidates to fill director vacancies. At  each Reserve Bank, the corporate secretary works collaboratively with  the president and other senior bank staff to assess the demographics of  their board and identify areas where additional representation may be  needed. Several Reserve Bank officials with whom we spoke told us they  also consider geography and educational background as selection  criteria, in addition to those outlined in the act. Three Reserve Bank  officials told us that while they strive to find diverse candidates from a  variety of industries, they also want to find people who have the skills and  knowledge that will fill a gap in the board\u2019s existing knowledge and skill  set. Additionally, Reserve Bank officials said they generally focus their  search on senior executives, usually chief executive officers (CEO) or  presidents. For example, of the 108 directors serving in 2010, 82 were the  president or CEO of their company. Further, we identified at least 23 who  were employed by Fortune 500 companies in 2010. Three Reserve  Bank officials we spoke with indicated that CEOs generally have a better  familiarity with the economic and business community of their district than  less senior managers. However, as discussed previously, while having  executives on the boards may elevate the stature of the board, it may limit  the diversity of the pool of potential candidates.", "Reserve Banks identify potential director candidates in a variety of ways  and often use different recruitment methods. In general, Reserve Banks  use a combination of personal networking and community outreach  efforts to identify potential candidates. Two directors with whom we spoke  told us they have recommended personal or business acquaintances they  believe would be qualified to serve as directors. In addition, some  Reserve Banks contact former directors for help in identifying possible  candidates. Several Reserve Bank presidents and senior staff also attend  community roundtables and forums to network and identify potential  candidates. Several Reserve Banks use their advisory councils and  branch boards as a source for potential candidates. One Reserve Bank  official told us that they look for candidates in a variety of industry lists  such as a Forbes\u2019 magazine list of the most powerful women in business.  At another Reserve Bank, member banks of the states represented in the  district have agreed to a rotating nomination process for Class A and  Class B directors to help ensure geographic representation. That is, when  it is one particular state\u2019s turn to nominate a candidate, the state\u2019s  Banking Association identifies potential candidates. At least one Class C  director said he self-identified for the position and approached the  Reserve Bank to express his interest in serving on the board when a  vacancy came up.", "Some Reserve Banks also use nominating committees to identify  qualified director candidates. These committees may do so by recruiting  candidates to fill vacant seats on the board, reviewing candidates  recommended by the Reserve Banks and others, or conducting inquiries  into the backgrounds and qualifications of potential candidates. Five  Reserve Banks use nominating committees to identify potential  candidates. For example, one Reserve Bank has a nominating committee  that considers candidates for the Federal Reserve Board-appointed Class  C directors. At another Reserve Bank, the nominating committee currently  consists of three Class C directors and two Class A directors that meet to  consider and make recommendations concerning board membership for  all classes of directors. Guidelines in the FRAM require that nominating  committees recommending Class A and Class B director candidates not  include Reserve Bank officers and employees.", "Typically, a Reserve Bank identifies and vets potential candidates for  Class A and B directors, and communicates their names and credentials  to member banks for their nomination and election. Reserve Banks  generally submit an open call for nominations to the district\u2019s voting  banks, even if they also have a nominating committee. Typically, the  member banks will elect the Class A and B candidates identified and  vetted by the Reserve Bank\u2019s nominating committee. However, member  banks can nominate and elect a candidate that has not been vetted by  the Reserve Bank. In such cases, the bank will inform the nominee of a  director\u2019s eligibility requirements, to determine if the candidate is eligible  to serve, if elected. We found that member bank voter turnout was often  low at some Reserve Banks. Although the Federal Reserve Act sets forth  specific procedures and voting requirements for director elections,  shareholder elections of Reserve Bank directors do not have a  requirement for a minimum number of votes.", "The Federal Reserve Board requires every Reserve Bank to provide a  slate of at least two candidates for each Class C vacancy to the Federal  Reserve Board for appointment. Typically, the Federal Reserve Board will  appoint a candidate from the slate provided by the Reserve Banks to  serve as a Class C director. However, the Federal Reserve Board may  ask for further explanation of why Reserve Banks selected certain  candidates or ask for alternative candidates.", "Several Reserve Banks indicated that recruiting directors for several  groups\u2014specifically women, minority, and labor or consumer  representatives\u2014can be challenging. According to Reserve Bank  officials, recruiting labor and consumer representatives is particularly  difficult because many of them are politically active and the Federal  Reserve Board policy generally restricts a director\u2019s political activity. They  also noted that Reserve Bank directors\u2019 roles and responsibilities can be  time consuming and that compensation is low compared with that  available in other opportunities to serve on private boards. After the  passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, directors are limited in the  number of public company boards on which they can serve; therefore,  Reserve Banks compete with other private corporations for these  directors\u2019 time, especially women and minorities. In addition, some  individuals do not want to divest of their stock holdings in the banking- related industry (which would be required for Class C) and also may not  wish to refrain from political participation, according to Federal Reserve  System officials.", "As we have previously reported, many private and public organizations  have recognized the importance of recruiting and retaining minority and  women candidates for key positions as the U.S. workforce has become  increasingly diverse. Some Reserve Bank officials told us that many  organizations are searching for diverse directors to have on their boards,  and the Reserve Banks are competing with private corporations for the  same small pool of qualified individuals. Although the policies of private  corporate boards we reviewed do not have specific requirements for board  diversity, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently started  requiring companies to identify steps taken to ensure diversity of their  boards in their proxy statement to shareholders. In our review of the proxy  statements from the 10 largest bank holding companies in 2010, we found  that companies generally did not list specific steps taken to identify and  select diverse board members (see app. IV for a list of the 10 largest bank  holding companies included in our review). Rather they provided a broad  statement about diversity. For example, one company stated, \u201cThe   Committee evaluates diversity in a broad sense, recognizing  the benefits of racial and gender diversity, but also considering the breadth  of backgrounds, skills, and experiences that directors and candidates may  bring to our Board.\u201d", "Having a demographically and economically diverse board strengthens  an organization by bringing a wider variety of perspectives and  approaches to the organization. While officials at some Reserve Banks  told us they consider candidates who are not chief-level executives (i.e.,  not chief financial officers, chief operating officers, or executive vice  presidents), the vast majority of directors in 2010 held such positions in  their organizations. By broadening their pool of candidates, Reserve  Banks may be able to improve diversity, and ultimately public  representation, on the Reserve Bank boards. Such diversification can  help ensure that the Federal Reserve System receives a broader  spectrum of information useful for the formation and execution of  monetary policy and the oversight of Reserve Bank operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Steps Needed to Manage Directors\u2019 Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest and Outside Affiliations", "paragraphs": ["From the creation of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve  Act has required the Reserve Banks to include Class A directors on their  boards to be representative of the member banks, as each of the Reserve  Banks is owned by the member banks in its district. While Class A  directors are not required to be officers or employees of member banks,  in practice, most Class A directors are officers or directors of member  banks in the district. The requirement to have representatives of member  banks creates an appearance of a conflict of interest because, as noted  previously, the Federal Reserve System has supervisory authority over  state-chartered member banks and bank holding companies. Conflicts of  interest involving directors have been historically addressed through both  federal law and Federal Reserve System policies and procedures, such  as by defining roles and responsibilities and implementing codes of  conduct to identify, manage, and mitigate potential conflicts.  Nevertheless, directors\u2019 affiliations with financial firms and former  directors\u2019 business relationships with Reserve Banks continue to pose  reputational risks to the Federal Reserve System. When the Federal  Reserve System played a key role in providing assistance to financial  institutions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Reserve Bank board  governance came under scrutiny because, among other things, a number  of director-affiliated banks and nonbank financial institutions participated  in the Federal Reserve System\u2019s emergency programs. Since then,  Congress, the Federal Reserve Board, and Reserve Banks have made a  number of changes to the policies and procedures that address Reserve  Bank governance. However, without more complete documentation of the  directors\u2019 roles and responsibilities with regard to the supervision and  regulation functions, as well as increased public disclosure on  governance practices to enhance accountability and transparency,  questions about Reserve Bank governance will remain."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Directors\u2019 Affiliations Can Expose Reserve Banks to Reputational Risk", "paragraphs": ["The three classes of Reserve Bank directors have varying degrees of  involvement in the financial services industry, and their affiliations with  financial companies could create reputational risk for the Reserve Banks.  In addition, relationships between current and former directors and  interactions between former directors and the Reserve Banks could also  raise questions about the independence of the directors and actions of  the Reserve Banks. Finally, questions about directors\u2019 involvement in the  emergency programs authorized by the Federal Reserve Board during  the financial crisis spurred allegations of conflicts of interest. As we  reported in our July 2010 report on the emergency programs, our review  found that the boards of directors generally were not directly involved in  the development and implementation of emergency programs.", "Federal Reserve Bank directors often serve on the boards of a variety of  financial firms as well as those of nonprofit, private, and public  companies. For example, in 2010, 86 of 91 Reserve Bank directors  responding to our survey held board positions at public and private  companies, public and private universities, and nonprofit organizations.  As noted earlier, our survey indicated that most of the Reserve Banks  have directors who have held positions at financial services firms or  insurance companies as well as banks. This includes Class A directors  who are officials of banks that hold stock in the Reserve Bank, and Class  C directors, who are required by the Federal Reserve Act to be persons  of tested banking experience, which the Federal Reserve Board says has  come to be interpreted as requiring familiarity with banking or financial  services. In addition, as the financial services industry has evolved, more  companies are involved in financial services or otherwise interconnected  with financial institutions. These changes have resulted in a few Class B  and Class C directors who were previously employed by financial  institutions or have served on their boards.", "A recent example that raised questions about affiliations, and the nature  of director affiliations with financial firms, involved the then-FRBNY  chairman in late 2008, who was former chairman and a current board  member and shareholder of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman  Sachs). As illustrated in figure 10, when the then-FRBNY chairman joined  the FRBNY board as a Class C director in January 2008, Goldman Sachs  was an investment bank outside the supervisory authority of the Federal  Reserve System. However, in September 2008, in response to the  unfolding financial crisis, Goldman Sachs applied for and was approved  by the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company. As a  result, under Federal Reserve Board policy, the then-FRBNY chairman  became ineligible to serve as a Class C director because he was then a  director and stockholder of a bank holding company. Without  consultation with the full FRBNY board, FRBNY sought a waiver to allow  the then-FRBNY chairman to continue to serve on the board. According  to an FRBNY official, FRBNY sought the waiver in October 2008 for a  number of reasons. First, finding a new chairman during the financial  crisis would have been difficult, given that FRBNY already had one  director vacancy on its board at the time. Further, the event leading to the  need for a waiver was unexpected and unforeseen. In late November  2008, an additional concern was raised that the then-FRBNY president  was expected to be nominated as the Secretary of the Treasury, thereby  raising the potential that FRBNY would be searching for both a new  president and a new chairman simultaneously, with the added  complication that, as the chair of the FRBNY board, the then-FRBNY  chairman would be heading the search committee for a new president.  The waiver was granted by the Federal Reserve Board in January 2009  on the basis of these considerations. However, the Federal Reserve  Board was unaware that the then-FRBNY chairman had purchased  additional shares in Goldman Sachs via an automatic stock purchase  program. The then-FRBNY chair resigned in May 2009. As discussed  later, on the basis of this waiver experience, the Federal Reserve Board  decided to develop and institute a formal policy governing the treatment  of situations in which Class B or C directors\u2019 stockholdings unexpectedly  become impermissible. This policy has since been adopted. FRBNY also  changed its policy, which would require that waivers be discussed by the  board of directors before going to the Federal Reserve Board.", "Federal Reserve Board officials told us that after receiving the waiver  request from FRBNY, they contacted other Reserve Bank boards to  determine whether any other directors held stocks in companies that had  recently converted to bank holding companies. According to these  officials, this review identified a director from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis who held less than $100,000 in stock in Merrill Lynch & Co.,  Inc., an investment bank, which had been acquired by Bank of America, a  bank holding company. This director remained on the board and a waiver  was granted by the Federal Reserve Board, but nonetheless, he  subsequently divested the shares in January 2009.", "Another situation that raised questions about affiliations involved a  FRBNY Class B director. The director was the Chief Executive Officer of  Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman), an investment bank that  experienced significant financial problems during the unfolding financial  crisis and ultimately failed. An FRBNY official said that he met with the  FRBNY president and chairman about Lehman\u2019s deteriorating financial  condition, without the full board, and concluded that FRBNY faced  reputational risk regardless of the action taken. Specifically, it was  concluded that although the board of directors was not involved in  approving and implementing the emergency programs, a recusal from  board meetings by the Lehman director might not have managed the  appearance of a conflict and a public resignation might have sent a  negative signal to the market and hastened the collapse of the firm.  Under Federal Reserve Board practice, Reserve Bank directors affiliated  with troubled financial institutions are encouraged to resign or risk  removal from the board. Federal Reserve System officials said that the  director voluntarily resigned before Lehman filed for bankruptcy.", "Although directors\u2019 affiliations with financial firms do not necessarily  create conflicts of interest, they may complicate the directors\u2019  relationships with the Reserve Banks and increase public scrutiny of  them. One issue relates to directors\u2019 communications with Reserve Bank  officials in their roles as senior executives of their companies. These  situations have raised questions as to whether directors have greater  access to Reserve Bank officials than other financial institution officials  and whether they have influence over matters that may affect banks or  institutions with which they are affiliated. Reserve Bank officials with  whom we spoke said that there are no restrictions on directors  communicating with Reserve Bank staff about their respective banks or  holding companies in their capacity as officials of the bank nor are there  restrictions on conversations about the financial markets. However,  according to Federal Reserve Board officials, members of the Reserve  Bank board of directors are not granted special access to supervisory  staff, and it has been the practice of the Federal Reserve Board and the  Reserve Banks to restrict their involvement in supervision issues. Further,  Reserve Bank officials said that requests from other financial institutions  to meet with Reserve Bank staff are processed in the same manner as  those from the directors. As discussed later, the financial crisis  highlighted situations where directors were in contact with Reserve Bank  staff in their capacity as representatives of their financial institutions and  market participants.", "After completing their terms, directors who had represented member  banks or who have affiliations with other financial institutions may  maintain contact with Federal Reserve Bank officials for various reasons.  FRBNY officials said that actions such as the Reserve Banks\u2019  management of such communications may help safeguard against  improprieties. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the company  of a former FRBNY director was negotiating with FRBNY regarding  assets the Reserve Bank had acquired when it extended credit against  the assets of Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. The former director felt that  there was a miscommunication and contacted a number of FRBNY staff  he knew to discuss the issue. The director\u2019s preexisting relationship with  FRBNY raised questions about the appropriateness of FRBNY\u2019s actions  in its negotiations with the former director\u2019s firm. Recently, FRBNY  implemented a procedure to document contacts involving directors by  reporting calls and their content in a memo to the chairman of the board\u2019s  Audit and Operational Risk Committee.", "Reserve Bank officials said that many of the Reserve Banks maintain  programs to keep in touch with former directors. These can be formal  programs such as annual holiday functions or informal ways to continue  to seek former directors\u2019 views on the economy and their industries.  Reserve Bank officials described these contacts as \u201cunobjectionable.\u201d A  former Federal Reserve Board governor with whom we spoke also  thought that these contacts are appropriate. As discussed later, indirect  connections between directors\u2019 firms and Reserve Banks when the firms  used the emergency programs or acted as service providers have also  raised questions.", "The Federal Reserve Board, and in some cases, the FOMC, authorized  the creation and modification of most of the emergency programs under  authorities granted by the Federal Reserve Act. Although a number of  Reserve Bank directors were affiliated with institutions that borrowed from  the emergency programs, we did not find evidence that Reserve Bank  boards of directors participated directly in making any decisions about  authorizing, setting the terms of, or approving a borrower\u2019s participation in  the emergency programs.", "Our review did not reveal that Reserve Bank directors received nonpublic  information on the emergency programs. A review of minutes from the 12  Reserve Bank board meetings during the unfolding crisis revealed that  discussions of emergency programs during board meetings appeared to  have occurred after the emergency programs had been publicly  announced. Further, presentations by Reserve Bank staff generally  covered explanations of the related emergency lending authority,  administration of the program, descriptive information about the  programs\u2019 operations and risks, and the impact on the Reserve Banks\u2019  balance sheets. Moreover, Federal Reserve Board officials and Reserve  Bank directors from all 12 Reserve Banks with whom we spoke told us  that the Reserve Bank boards did not play a role in the creation or  implementation of the emergency programs. Federal Reserve Board  officials also pointed out that all Reserve Bank directors are prohibited  from disclosing nonpublic information related to the programs and such  disclosures may risk violating insider trading laws.", "While all Reserve Banks implemented the Term Auction Facility, FRBNY  implemented the majority of the emergency programs. A number of  FRBNY\u2019s directors played a limited oversight role as prescribed in a  written Audit and Operational Risk Committee (AORC) protocol that  states the oversight by the directors was focused on operational risks. For  example, according to FRBNY officials, FRBNY staff periodically briefed  the committee on the composition of an asset portfolio that was created to  assist Bear Stearns when it was near failure to help ensure that the  directors were aware of how the bank was managing certain high-risk  assets. FRBNY has five directors on the audit committee. During the  financial crisis, at least one Class A director served on this committee at  any given time. According to FRBNY officials, to help ensure that one  class of directors does not have undue influence, FRBNY strengthened  its governance structure by revising its AORC charter to permit only two  out of five committee members to be Class A directors. Although  implemented after the unwinding of many of the emergency programs,  the enhanced standards helped mitigate the appearance of actual and  potential director conflicts by ensuring that Class A directors are not the  majority on the AORC. Appendix III provides more information on the  Reserve Bank committees.", "As mentioned earlier, in their role as market participants, some FRBNY  directors were consulted by FRBNY management and staff as certain  emergency facilities were being created. According to FRBNY officials, a  director providing information to FRBNY management and staff in his or  her role as chief executive officer of an institution does not equate to  \u201cparticipating personally and substantially\u201d\u2014as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7  208, discussed below\u2014because the director is not playing a direct role  with respect to approving a program or providing a recommendation.  According to FRBNY officials, FRBNY\u2019s Capital Markets Group contacted  representatives from primary dealers, commercial paper issuers, and  other institutions to gain a sense of how to design and calibrate some of  the emergency programs. For example, FRBNY officials said that General  Electric Company (General Electric), whose chief executive officer was  serving as a Class B director at the time, was one of the largest issuers of  commercial paper and General Electric was one of the companies  FRBNY consulted when creating the emergency program to assist with  the commercial paper market. FRBNY officials said they contacted  institutions for this purpose irrespective of whether one of FRBNY\u2019s  directors was affiliated with the institution.", "Some of the institutions that borrowed from the emergency programs had  senior executives and stockholders that served on Reserve Banks\u2019 board  of directors. These relationships contributed to questions about Reserve  Bank governance and also raised concerns about conflicts of interest. We  identified at least 18 former and current Class A, B, and C directors from  9 Reserve Banks who were affiliated with institutions that used at least  one emergency program. In those cases, 11 Class A directors who  served between 2008 and 2010 worked for member banks that used an  emergency program. There are 2 Class B directors who served between  2008 and 2010 and worked for companies that used an emergency  program. Similarly, one Class C director who served between 2008 and  2009 was affiliated with a company that used at least one program. In  addition, there are 4 former Class A directors who served between 2006  and 2007 whose companies used the emergency facilities. The Term  Auction Facility was the most commonly used facility.", "According to Federal Reserve Board officials, the Federal Reserve Board  allowed borrowers to access its emergency programs only if they satisfied  publicly announced eligibility criteria. Thus, Reserve Banks granted  access to borrowing institutions affiliated with Reserve Bank directors  only if these institutions satisfied the proper criteria, regardless of  potential director-affiliated outreach or whether the institution was  affiliated with a director. As we reported in our July report, our analysis  did not find evidence indicating a systemic bias toward favoring one or  more eligible institutions. While some institutions that borrowed from  these programs were affiliated with a Reserve Bank director, these  institutions were subject to the same terms and conditions as those that  had no such affiliation.", "As another example, the Chief Executive Officer of JP Morgan Chase &  Co. (JP Morgan Chase) served on the FRBNY board of directors at the  same time that his bank participated in various emergency programs and  served as one of the clearing banks for emergency lending programs.  According to Federal Reserve Board officials, there are only two entities,  including JP Morgan Chase, that offer services as clearing banks for  triparty repurchase agreements and both banks served as clearing banks  for the emergency programs. Similarly, Lehman\u2019s Chief Executive  Officer served on the FRBNY board while Lehman\u2019s broker-dealer  subsidiary participated in emergency programs such as the Primary  Dealer Credit Facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Policies and Procedures to Manage and Mitigate Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest Involving Directors", "paragraphs": ["Having the Class A directors, who represent member banks, and the  Class B directors, who are elected by member banks, as required by the  Federal Reserve Act, creates an appearance of a conflict of interest. This  is because Class A or B directors might own stock in banks or Class A  directors might work for banks that are supervised by the Reserve Bank  while also overseeing aspects of the Reserve Banks\u2019 operations,  including the bank presidents\u2019 evaluation and salary and personnel  decisions for the supervision and regulation function. In addition, Class  B directors are involved in the president selection process. In turn, the  president oversees the supervision and regulation function, which  regulates the member banks that vote for the Class A and B directors.  The president also may serve on the FOMC.", "Conflicts of interest involving directors have been historically addressed  through both federal law and Federal Reserve System policies and  procedures. First, individuals serving on the boards of directors of the  Reserve Banks are generally subject to the federal criminal conflict-of-  interest restrictions in section 208 of title 18 of the U.S. Code and its  implementing regulations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 generally prohibits Reserve  Bank directors from participating personally and substantially in their  official capacities in any matter in which, to their knowledge, they have a  financial interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable  effect on that interest. The Office of Government Ethics regulations  implementing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 include provisions concerning divestiture,  disqualification (recusal), and waivers or exemptions from  disqualification. The regulations also provide that Reserve Bank  directors may participate in specified matters, even though they may be  particular matters in which they have a disqualifying financial interest.  These matters concern the establishment of rates to be charged to  member banks for all advances and discounts; consideration of monetary  policy matters and other matters of broad applicability; and approval or  ratification of extensions of credit, advances or discounts to healthy  depository institutions, or in certain conditions, to depository institutions in  hazardous condition. As the rulemaking for these exemptions notes,  because of their ties to the financial services industry and their  communities, it is likely that at least some directors will have financial  conflicts with their duties, and the exemptions adopted by the Office of  Government Ethics were necessary to resolve any possible conflict  between the directors\u2019 statutorily mandated function and the performance  of their official duties.", "The Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Banks have policies and  procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate conflicts of interest that  could result from a Reserve Bank director having financial or other  interests that conflict with the interests of the Reserve Bank. These steps  include defining the roles and responsibilities of directors to avoid  conflicts, managing and mitigating conflicts of interest through adherence  to federal law and the Federal Reserve board\u2019s conflict-of-interest  policies, and establishing internal controls and policies to identify and  manage potential conflicts.", "The Federal Reserve Board, within the requirements of the Federal  Reserve Act, defines Reserve Bank directors\u2019 overall roles and  responsibilities. In doing so, it manages and mitigates conflicts with  respect to directors\u2019 involvement with bank supervision and regulation by  precluding director involvement in institution-specific supervision matters  and establishes restrictions on directors\u2019 interaction with the Reserve  Banks\u2019 supervision and regulation function. Additionally the Federal  Reserve Board monitors the performance of the Supervision and  Regulation Department of the Reserve Banks. Actual or potential conflicts  of interest could arise if directors were consulted about supervisory  matters because of their stock ownership or affiliation with the supervised  entity or with a competitor or customer of the supervised entity. Our  analysis of the board minutes, interviews, and survey of Reserve Bank  directors reveals that interaction between the directors and the  supervision and regulation staff was generally limited and that the  directors were not involved in the day-to-day operations of supervision  and regulation or specific bank supervisory matters such as bank  examination ratings or potential enforcement actions. Reserve Bank  officials and directors told us that when supervision and regulation staff  report on the operations in board meetings, they do not provide details on  examination issues or identify institutions by name. Our review of board  minutes showed a few instances where supervision and regulation staff  shared summary information concerning the general condition of banking  institutions in the district.", "According to Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Bank officials, because  the Federal Reserve Board has delegated the examination of bank and  financial holding companies, member banks, and affiliates to the Reserve  Bank staff, the staff report through the Reserve Bank presidents to the  Federal Reserve Board and not directly to the boards of directors of the  Reserve Bank. Further, although Supervision and Regulation generally  reviews and approves member bank applications to purchase other banks  or establish branch offices, among other things, applications that involve  institutions affiliated with a Reserve Bank director are approved by the  Federal Reserve Board. As an example, Goldman Sachs\u2019s application to  become a bank holding company in September 2008 was reviewed by  the Federal Reserve Board because one of the company\u2019s directors was  also a director on the board of the Reserve Bank.", "Questions also have been raised about the role of the Reserve Bank  board in approving the Reserve Banks\u2019 discount window lending and  whether conflicts of interest arise because officials from member banks  that borrow from the discount window may serve as Class A directors on  Reserve Bank boards. To avoid this potential conflict, no boards take part  in loan approval, although some boards ratify loans that have already  been granted under the discount window on a quarterly basis. Moreover,  directors and Reserve Bank officials we spoke with said that Class A  directors recuse themselves from the loan approval discussion when their  institution has borrowed.", "As explained more fully earlier, Reserve Bank directors are subject to the  federal criminal conflict of interest restrictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208,  which generally prohibits Reserve Bank directors from participating  personally and substantially in their official capacities in any matter in  which, to their knowledge, they have a financial interest, if the particular  matter will have a direct and predictable effect on that interest. In addition,  Reserve Bank directors are expected to follow relevant policies in the  FRAM developed by the Federal Reserve Board. As stated in the FRAM\u2019s  \u201cGuide to Conduct for Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks and  Branches,\u201d directors are expected to be \u201cabove reproach\u201d in their  personal financial dealings and should never use information they obtain  as directors for personal gain. The FRAM states that in carrying out their  responsibilities, directors should avoid any action that might result in or  create the appearance of (1) affecting adversely the confidence of the  public in the integrity of the Federal Reserve System, (2) using their  position as director for private gain, or (3) giving unwarranted preferential  treatment to any organization or person. Moreover, it states that directors  should strictly preserve the confidentiality of Reserve Bank and Federal  Reserve System information, and should avoid making public statements  that suggest the nature of any monetary policy action that has not been  officially disclosed. Directors also are expected to adhere to high ethical  standards of conduct. In addition, directors are also expected to comply  fully with all applicable laws and regulations governing their actions as  directors and in their conduct outside of the Federal Reserve System.  The FRAM also prohibits directors from engaging in certain types of  political activities. As a general principle, it states that directors should not  engage in any political activity or serve in any public office where such  activity or service might be interpreted as associating the Reserve Bank  or the Federal Reserve System with any political party or partisan political  activity, might embarrass the Reserve Bank or the Federal Reserve  System in the conduct of its operations, or might raise any question as to  the independence of the individual\u2019s judgment or ability to perform his or  her duties with the Reserve Bank or System. The Federal Reserve  Board\u2019s policy does not prohibit directors from participating in activities as  individual voters or as members of nonpartisan public service bodies  when that would not be potentially embarrassing to the Federal Reserve  System.", "The Reserve Banks have internal controls, including annual certifications,  oaths, and affirmations, to help the banks monitor directors\u2019 compliance  with the FRAM and conflict of interest policies and procedures. These  mechanisms require directors to report new directorships or affiliations,  and to reaffirm that they are free of conflicts of interest. While directors  are not required to disclose their financial holdings, Reserve Banks  provide updates to directors whenever there is a change to the list of  prohibited investments and affiliations (based on institutions that become  bank holding companies or other institutions supervised by the Federal  Reserve System). Also, during the directors\u2019 selection process, Reserve  Bank officials conduct a background check using publicly available  information on the directors and the financial status of the directors\u2019  companies. Once directors are on the board, the Reserve Banks rely on  the directors to self report any actual or potential conflicts of interest.  Additionally, the directors receive training at the beginning of their terms,  from both the Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal  Reserve Board training includes meetings where the directors are able to  meet the Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Board staff, and other  directors from across the system. The training provided by the Reserve  Banks includes information on the FRAM\u2019s \u201cGuide to Conduct for  Directors of Federal Reserve Banks and Branches,\u201d roles and  responsibilities, ethics, oaths, affidavits, and certifications. Many directors  also receive ethics training annually, in addition to the beginning of their  terms. Reserve Banks provide training to directors to guide them in  determining what investments/affiliations may be prohibited. The Federal  Reserve Board also offers midterm training to all directors, which officials  said is generally well attended.", "According to Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Bank officials with  whom we spoke, the most likely potential conflict of interest involves  procurement matters, and the Reserve Banks have taken a variety of  steps to address them. Some Reserve Bank boards are involved in  approving the bank\u2019s vendor contracts. Because some directors are  affiliated with businesses in the banks\u2019 district that may offer services the  Reserve Bank seeks, they could potentially have a conflict of interest if  their firms or competitors were to compete for the contracts. To help  ensure that procurement practices are untainted by actual or potential  conflicts of interest from directors, the Federal Reserve Board requires all  of the Reserve Banks to have procurement policies that provide guidance  for directors that includes the role of directors in procurements, the nature  of the procurement, an education program for directors, written  procedures for the directors to follow for recusal, written certification  process, and record keeping of training materials and attendance,  recusals, and procurement certifications. Our review noted that all banks  require the directors to sign certifications stating whether or not they have  a conflict of interest with a procurement that is being considered. All  Reserve Banks have processes and certifications to help ensure that  directors do not have conflicts. Likewise, all Reserve Banks have  delegated certain procurement decisions to management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 Ethics Policies and Practices Are Generally Consistent with Other Organizations\u2019 Policies and Practices, but Waiver Policies Could be Improved", "paragraphs": ["We compared the Federal Reserve System\u2019s ethics and related policies  and practices with those of other organizations, including other central  banks, a self-regulatory organization whose members serve on its board  of directors, a government-sponsored enterprise, and large bank holding  companies.

All four central banks and the U.S. Reserve Banks  emphasized that directors must demonstrate a high level of ethical  conduct and adhere to applicable laws and regulations, but policies for  managing conflicts of interest varied. For example, the Reserve Bank of  Australia waives all conflict of interest requirements for its board, and  allows directors to participate in policy deliberations as long as they  disclose their interests to the bank annually. However, the Reserve Bank  of Australia prohibits directors from working for or having a material  financial interest in private financial companies in Australia. Conversely,  the Bank of Canada Act requires that directors (1) disclose any material  interest in writing or in the minutes of board meetings, (2) disclose the  conflict as quickly as possible after the conflict is discovered or realized,  and (3) not vote in any resolution or action related to the conflict.  Directors must also avoid or withdraw from participation in any activity or  situation that places them in a real, potential, or apparent conflict of  interest. The Bank of Canada prohibits directors from having affiliations  with entities that perform clearing and settlement functions in the financial  services industry, serving as a dealer for government securities, or being  government employees. Table 2 provides additional information on the  ethics and conflict-of-interest practices of the central banks we reviewed.", "Reserve Banks\u2019 ethics policies were generally consistent with those of  FINRA and those required of the FHLBanks and public companies listed  on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). FINRA prohibits directors who  have a substantial financial interest or are affiliated with a regulated entity  from participating in any regulatory matter, disciplinary action,  investigation, or decision regarding an application from that entity for an  exemption. The Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2014FHLBanks\u2019  regulator\u2014requires that FHLBanks have a conflict of interest policy and  that directors promptly disclose any actual or apparent conflicts of interest  and recuse themselves from issues in which they have a conflict. Public  companies listed on the NYSE\u2014including the 10 largest bank holding  companies included in our review\u2014must adopt and disclose a code of  business conduct and ethics. The code must contain a policy that  prohibits conflicts of interest and allows directors to communicate  potential conflicts with the company. Table 3 shows the ethics and conflict  of interest practices of the comparable organizations we reviewed.", "Federal Reserve Banks do not require directors to periodically disclose  their financial interests. Officials at the Federal Reserve Board stated that  directors were doing a civic duty by serving on a Reserve Bank board and  that the Federal Reserve Board does not want to make it burdensome for  them to serve. The officials also noted that directors\u2019 investments may  change frequently, so keeping accurate information on all investments  would be difficult. Class C directors submit an annual certification stating  that they do not have any prohibited stockholdings. Although Federal  Reserve Bank directors do not submit an annual disclosure of non- financial interests, both Class B and Class C directors are required to  submit an annual certification stating that they do not have any prohibited  affiliations. The directors are required to notify the corporate secretary if  there are any changes in their affiliations or stockholdings, as appropriate.  All four central banks we reviewed required directors to disclose some  information about their personal affiliations with other organizations, such  as other directorships. The Reserve Bank of Australia requires directors  to disclose material personal financial interests\u2014including financial and  nonfinancial\u2014to the treasurer on a yearly basis. The European Central  Bank (ECB) requires all Governing Council members (i.e., Executive  Board members and governors of the National Central Banks) to annually  disclose their public and private affiliations, and Executive Board  members must also complete a yearly financial disclosure.", "FINRA governors annually disclose their relationships with other  organizations, such as other directorships, but do not typically provide  financial information annually, according to FINRA officials. FHLBanks  are required to file an annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and  Exchange Commission. This form includes information about the  directors\u2019 other directorships on the boards of publicly traded companies  or investment companies. Most FHLBanks do not require directors to file  a comprehensive annual financial disclosure, but most of the banks  require directors to sign an annual certification agreeing to adhere to the  ethics policies. All public companies\u2014including the bank holding  companies we reviewed\u2014are also required by SEC to file a Form 10-K,  which includes information about any other directorships of board  members.", "Other comparable organizations had a variety of policies on waiving ethics  and related requirements. Central banks in our review varied in the extent  to which they had policies or procedures for directors to apply for waivers to  their ethics policies. The Bank of Canada does not have a waiver process.  An official at the bank stated that waivers would be inconsistent with the  bank\u2019s conflict of interest policy, which requires that directors avoid or  withdraw from participation in any activity that places the director in a real,  potential, or apparent conflict of interest. The European Central Bank Code  of Conduct instructs Governing Council members to seek counsel from an  ethics adviser if a conflict arises. The adviser either decides the issue or  forwards it to the Governing Council. The NYSE requires that listed  companies, including the large bank holding companies we reviewed,  promptly disclose any waivers of codes of conduct for directors or  executive directors. Only boards and board committees can grant waivers,  which must be disclosed to shareholders within 4 business days, using  either a press release, the institutional website, or an SEC Form 8-K.  FINRA\u2019s code of conduct for directors states the board must approve  waivers from the code. However, FINRA officials told us that in practice, its  governors have chosen to manage conflicts through recusal rather than  seeking waivers. About half of the FHLBanks reported that they have a  process in place for directors to request a waiver of the code of conduct.", "There are two types of waivers relevant to Reserve Bank directors. First, as  discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve Board can grant waivers to directors  in connection with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208, pursuant to applicable federal  regulations. Second, Reserve Banks may request waivers from the Federal  Reserve Board\u2019s policies related to director eligibility, qualifications and  rotation, such as allowing directors to remain on the Reserve Bank board  despite having a prohibited investment or other prohibited affiliation.  Federal Reserve Board officials said they have received few waiver  requests. According to the officials, the Federal Reserve Board waiver  process permits Reserve Banks to make informal inquiries of Federal  Reserve Board staff as to whether a given action would be appropriate.  The officials noted that most of the time Reserve Banks\u2019 questions could be  resolved without an official waiver request. Additionally, Reserve Bank  officials told us that they frequently receive questions from directors about  the policies, which they either discuss and handle internally, or contact the  ethics officer or corporate secretary at the Federal Reserve Board to  determine the appropriate actions that should be taken. For example, one  director checked with the general counsel at the Reserve Bank to discuss a  situation in which family members had inherited bank stock that was held in  a trust for which the director was named trustee. The general counsel  discussed the issue with relevant officials at the Reserve Bank and advised  the director to resign his position in the trust so that he would not have a  conflict of interest.", "Not all Reserve Banks have procedures in place for directors to request a  waiver of the eligibility policy from the Federal Reserve Board. We found  that the Reserve Banks are not required to have a waiver request process  and only FRBNY has a formal process in place to review waiver requests.  An official from one Reserve Bank told us that the bank does not have a  formal process for considering waiver requests nor has it had directors who  needed to request a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board. When  FRBNY sought the waiver on behalf of the then-FRBNY chairman from the  Federal Reserve Board, FRBNY did not have a formal waiver process and  did not consult with the board of directors before making a waiver request  to the Federal Reserve Board. An FRBNY official told us that in hindsight  the board should have been involved. On the basis of this experience,  FRBNY implemented a formal waiver process. While we recognize that the  need to request a waiver from Federal Reserve Board policies may be rare,  a crisis situation may create unanticipated conflicts without providing time  for comprehensive actions before a decision must be made. However,  without a formal process in place to consider a request for a waiver from  Federal Reserve Board policies, Reserve Banks risk inconsistent treatment  of requests and being exposed to questions about their governance  practice and the integrity of their decisions and actions.", "If waivers to policies are granted, making the process and decisions  transparent is vital. Given the public nature of Reserve Bank activities,  disclosing waivers provided to directors is one way to improve  transparency and accountability and reduce the appearance of conflicts of  interest. Public companies listed on the NYSE are required to promptly  disclose any waivers of the code of conduct for directors and executive  officers, which can be made only by the board or a committee of the  board. To the extent that a waiver of the code of conduct is granted, the  waiver must be disclosed to shareholders within 4 business days of the  decision, by distributing a press release, providing website disclosure, or  filing a report with SEC. Reserve Banks are not required to disclose  information to the public about waivers of the policy on director eligibility  and qualifications for one of their directors that were granted by the  Federal Reserve Board. As demonstrated during the recent financial  crisis and the waiver request for the then-FRBNY chairman, a lack of  transparency around the waiver request process and outcome contributed  to greater distrust of Reserve Bank governance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Steps Are Needed to Improve Transparency and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Congress and the Federal Reserve System have taken steps aimed at  improving Reserve Bank governance. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on  July 21, 2010, made several amendments to the Federal Reserve Act.  One of these amendments changed the selection process for Reserve  Bank presidents and first vice presidents. Before the amendment, all  directors acted to appoint the president of the Reserve Bank, subject to  the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. This created the  appearance of a conflict because the Class A directors voted to appoint  the Reserve Bank president, who would play a role in supervision and  regulation and may be a voting member of the FOMC. After the  amendment, only Class B directors (who are elected by district member  banks to represent the public) and Class C directors (who are appointed  by the Federal Reserve Board to represent the public) may appoint the  Reserve Bank presidents. Class A directors, who are elected by member  banks to represent member banks, may no longer appoint presidents of  the Federal Reserve Banks. This same change also affects the  appointment of the first vice president.", "In part because of the financial crisis that started in mid 2007 and the  increased scrutiny of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve  Board conducted a study of the governance of the Federal Reserve  Banks, which included a review of the roles and responsibilities of the  Reserve Bank directors. In November 2009, the results of this study were  presented to the Reserve Bank presidents, corporate secretaries, and  board chairmen, which led some banks to conduct reviews of the roles  and responsibilities of their bank directors. As a result of the Federal  Reserve Board review, the board revised two policies governing directors.", "First, the board amended the eligibility policy to explicitly address  situations in which Class B or C directors\u2019 stockholdings unexpectedly  become impermissible, such as if a company in which a director holds  stock converts to a bank holding company. Before this revision, the  Federal Reserve Board did not have a formal policy governing the  treatment of such situations. The revised policy requires directors to  resign from the board or divest their interests within 60 days from the time  the Reserve Bank or director learned about an impermissible situation.  During this time, the director would have to recuse himself or herself from  all duties related to service as a Reserve Bank director until the affiliation  is severed. Second, the Federal Reserve Board revised its policy on  director conduct by requiring Reserve Banks to adopt a policy that  governs instances when directors are involved with procurement, as  discussed previously.", "Since this Federal Reserve Board study and the Dodd-Frank Act  amendments, all of the Reserve Banks have changed the directors\u2019 roles  to remove the Class A directors from the process of appointing the bank  president. In addition, some banks have included additional restrictions  on Class A directors\u2019 involvement in supervision and regulation personnel  and other matters. For example, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,  Richmond, and Minneapolis restricted Class A directors\u2019 involvement in  personnel appointments for supervision and regulation. Moreover, after  the recent study, the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  reevaluated its procedures so that the Class A directors are not involved  with personnel matters related to the senior vice president of its  supervision and regulation function, or any institution-specific matters.", "According to Federal Reserve System officials, it has been a standing  practice, predating the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, that Reserve  Bank directors do not vote on institution-specific supervisory matters.  Beyond that practice, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,  Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis recently revised their bylaws to  include the role of their boards of directors with regard to supervision and  regulation. FRBNY made clear that Class A directors are prohibited from  voting on appointment, termination, and compensation of employees in  the Financial Institutions Supervision group. Federal Reserve Bank of  Richmond stated directors cannot vote on institution-specific supervision  and regulation matters and that Class A directors should not vote on the  budget for the supervision and regulation function and matters related to  senior personnel in that function. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  states that actions by the board of directors related to oversight of the  supervision and regulation function shall be upon a vote of a majority of  the Class B and Class C directors present at any such meeting. Similarly,  Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis stated that directors are not  involved in institution-specific supervision and regulation matters and  Class A and Class B directors should not vote on matters of an  administrative nature.", "Although there are restrictions on directors\u2019 involvement in supervision  and regulation matters, the Reserve Banks are not required to document  the directors\u2019 roles in their bylaws. As a result, 8 of the 12 Reserve Banks  have not documented the extent of board of directors\u2019 involvement in  supervision and regulation in their bylaws. The Federal Reserve Banks of  Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San  Francisco do not document the directors\u2019 roles and responsibilities to  further clarify the extent of their involvement in supervision and regulation  matters.", "Although Reserve Bank directors may be cognizant of their roles and  responsibilities, a lack of a clear statement in the bylaws on the directors\u2019  involvement in supervision and regulation matters could contribute to lack  of clarity around the directors\u2019 roles, create confusion for the public, and  lead to questions about Reserve Bank governance. Moreover, by  documenting the roles of directors with regard to such matters, the  Federal Reserve System could help enhance the public\u2019s understanding  of the roles of the directors and reduce the appearance of conflicts of  interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the Structure of the Reserve Banks\u2019 Boards to Further Strengthen Governance Involve Trade-offs", "paragraphs": ["Some officials, directors, and academics with whom we spoke also  suggested potential changes to the Reserve Bank board structure that  could further strengthen governance, but these changes would involve  tradeoffs. First, some suggested that increasing the number of directors  appointed by the Federal Reserve Board who represent the public could  help alleviate the appearance of member bank control. This could be  accomplished by expanding the Reserve Bank board size by increasing  the number of Class C directors or by adding a fourth class of 3 directors  appointed by the Federal Reserve Board. By adding 3 more appointed  directors to the Reserve Bank board, the boards would have an equal  number of directors elected by member banks and directors appointed by  the Federal Reserve Board, therefore eliminating the perception of  member bank control of the boards. We have previously reported that  board size is not one-size-fits-all and should be based on the needs and  complexity of the organization. As discussed later in the report, board  size for other public and private organizations varies, but a board size of  12 members would still be within the range of board sizes at other  comparable organizations such as central banks, self-regulatory  organizations, and large bank holding companies. A larger board could  also enhance opportunities for diverse candidates. However, adding 3  board members would create more positions for Reserve Banks to fill,  and it may be more difficult for some of the Reserve Banks to fill these  positions. As of September 16, 2011, there were two director positions in  the 12 Reserve Banks open. Additionally, some Reserve Bank officials  and directors stated that a larger board size could reduce the opportunity  for directors to participate in the meeting and may increase absences or  decrease committee participation because directors could feel that their  contributions were less important because there were more directors to  accomplish the necessary board work. Additionally, an increase in the  size of the Reserve Bank board would require an amendment to the  Federal Reserve Act.", "Second, some Reserve Bank officials and directors suggested that the  Federal Reserve Board could appoint Class B directors to represent the  public rather than having them elected by member banks. The perception  of conflicts of interest and member bank control could be reduced by  making this change. However, we heard from several academics and  Reserve Bank officials that the current system provides a set of checks  and balances between the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C.,  and the 12 Reserve Banks and their members. By allowing the Federal  Reserve Board to appoint two-thirds of the Reserve Bank boards, the  balance of power would shift to the Federal Reserve Board. Officials and  directors we spoke with emphasized the importance of regional input in  the Federal Reserve System, which includes the ability of the regions to  select their representatives on the Reserve Bank board. Additionally, as  discussed earlier, while the FRAM prohibits bank officials and employees  from serving on nomination committees for Class A and B directors,  Reserve Bank officials told us that they played a significant role in the  identification, vetting, and recruiting of Class B directors before they are  nominated and elected by member banks. Because Reserve Bank  officials are involved in the identification and vetting process for both  types of candidates, whether changing the selection process for Class B  directors would change the outcome significantly is unclear.

One academic told  us that making them branches would help address concerns about the  current governance structure because it would eliminate the need for  boards of directors and thereby eliminate conflicts. As an example, the  central bank of Germany follows this model. However, others we  interviewed noted that this would concentrate all of the power and  influence with the Federal Reserve Board. Moreover, it would increase  the size of the federal agency. In addition, others have said that  converting boards to advisory councils in the districts would undermine  governance by reducing the responsibility of the boards and would make  it harder to attract quality candidates to serve on the councils.", "Second, some have questioned the need for 12 Reserve Banks given  changes in the financial markets and advances in technology. The views  of Federal Reserve System officials varied. A few of the individuals we  interviewed thought there could be fewer banks because the current  structure was outdated and reflected a U.S. economy that existed 100  years ago.

Some  believe that the central bank should be focused exclusively on monetary  policy and that supervision and regulation should be conducted by another  regulatory entity. Others viewed the two functions as critically intertwined,  and ultimately, this approach to reform was not pursued by Congress in the  Dodd-Frank Act. Rather, the Federal Reserve System\u2019s supervisory role  was increased to include thrift holding companies and systemically  important financial institutions. Others have taken a less sweeping  approach to reform by questioning the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s delegation  of supervision to the Reserve Banks. However, consolidating supervision  with the Federal Reserve Board would require a substantial increase in the  federal workforce for the Federal Reserve Board to conduct this function.  Currently, the supervision and regulation staff at the Reserve Banks are not  federal employees because they are employees of the Reserve Banks and  not the Federal Reserve Board.

As we have seen, the boards of the organizations we  studied had from 9 to 23 members (see table 4). Neither the NYSE nor  SEC has size requirements for the boards of listed and public companies,  and most of the bank holding companies we reviewed included provisions  in their bylaws that allowed for flexibility in board size. For example, one  company\u2019s bylaws state the board has the authority to determine the  number of directors and that the number should be in the range of 13 to  19, with the flexibility to increase the size as needs and circumstances  change. The number of allowable directors under the bylaws of bank  holding companies we studied ranged from 3 to 36, while the actual  number of directors on the boards of bank holding companies included in  our study ranged from 11 to 15.", "According to NYSE, independence for directors means having no material  relationship with the listed company, either directly or as a partner,  shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the  company. Central bank literature typically refers to independence in terms  of the central bank being independent of the government; therefore,  independent directors are those who do not work for the central bank or  other government entity. Independence is an important aspect of board  governance because it provides accountability and an outside  perspective. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) notes that boards must be able to exercise  objective judgment in order to fulfill their duties and that, to accomplish  this goal, a sufficient number of board members should be independent of  management.", "Reserve Bank directors have varying levels of independence. As  discussed earlier in this report, Class C directors are appointed by the  Federal Reserve Board.

Class B directors are elected by member banks and are statutorily  required to represent the public. They meet almost all of the  independence requirements listed above, with the exception that they can  be a stockholder in a bank. Class A directors, who represent the member  banks that elect them, are the least independent of the Reserve Bank  directors. Some have questioned whether Reserve Bank boards have  enough independence from the member banks that the Reserve Banks  supervise. FINRA\u2019s bylaws balance public and industry representation by  requiring that members representing the public outnumber those  representing industry on the board. No FHLBank managers serve on the  FHLBank boards, and by law at least two-fifths of the directors must be  independent and not affiliated with member banks. Additionally, at least  two of the independent directors must be \u201cpublic interest\u201d directors with at  least 4 years of experience representing community or consumer  interests in banking services, credit needs, housing, or consumer financial  protections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Term Lengths and Limits and Selection Procedures Were Comparable across Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Reserve Bank directors\u2019 term lengths and limits were also within the range  of term lengths and limits we observed for other comparable entities.

Other board members (including governors and other  government officials) served 5- to 8-year terms. FHLB directors may serve  up to three consecutive 4-year terms. The NYSE and SEC do not have  requirements for listed or public companies regarding term length or limits.  Two of the large bank holding companies we reviewed opted to have  directors serve 1-year terms so that each director had to be reelected by  the stockholders each year, but none of the companies enacted term limits  for their directors. One company noted in its annual proxy statement that  although term limits might be a source of fresh ideas and viewpoints, they  had the disadvantage of potentially reducing the knowledge and insight that  experienced directors gained over time. Another bank holding company\u2019s  proxy statement said that the company favored monitoring individual  director performance over term limits.", "Selection procedures for directors varied across the entities we  examined. As we have discussed, Federal Reserve Bank boards consist  of both appointed and elected directors. However, all the boards of the  four central banks we reviewed had directors who were appointed to the  board by various entities. For example, for the ECB Executive Board,  members are nominated by the governments of euro-area member  states. Both the ECB\u2019s Governing Council and the European Parliament  are consulted on prospective candidates and issue opinions on them. The  European Parliament holds a hearing for the nominated candidate, and  the European Council (only member states that have adopted the euro)  votes to appoint a new Executive Board member. The 17 euro-area  National Central Bank governors who are members of the Governing  Council in addition to the 6 Executive Board members are selected  according to national procedures. The directors of the Reserve Bank of  Australia and independent directors of the Bank of Canada are appointed  by the Treasurer and Minister of Finance, respectively. The Queen of  England appoints governors and nonexecutive directors to the Court of  Directors at the Bank of England.", "The other comparable organizations we studied had a combination of  elected and appointed members and used nominating committees as part  of the director selection process. FINRA\u2019s bylaws require that all  members be nominated by a committee and certified by the corporate  secretary. Of the 10 industry directors, 7 are elected by their constituents.  The 3 remaining industry directors and all of the public directors are  appointed by FINRA\u2019s Board of Governors after nomination by the  committee. FHLBank member directors are nominated and voted on by  member institutions within their state, whereas independent directors are  nominated by the FHLBank\u2019s board of directors, after consultation with its  Advisory Council, and elected by the FHLBanks\u2019 members at-large.  Companies listed on the NYSE must have nominating/corporate  governance committees composed entirely of independent directors to  identify qualified individuals and select them or recommend them to the  board for selection. Stockholders elect the directors of the 10 largest bank  holding companies we reviewed.", "Like the Reserve Banks, other comparable entities also considered skills  and experience as key factors in selecting board members. Reserve  Banks recruit directors in accordance with the requirements in the Federal  Reserve Act, which stipulate that directors shall be chosen without  discrimination as to race, creed, color, sex, or national origin and that  Class B and Class C directors who represent the public shall be elected  \u201cwith due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture,  commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumers.\u201d Some Reserve  Bank officials told us that while they strive to find diverse candidates from  a variety of industries, they primarily want to find people who have the  skills and knowledge that will fill gaps in the board\u2019s existing knowledge  and skill set. Similarly, all four central banks we reviewed had skill or  experience qualifications for board members. For example, the Bank of  Canada focuses on the collective skills of the board of directors in areas  such as accounting, human resources, corporate governance, and  financial markets.", "FHLBanks and FINRA also look for directors with particular skills and  experience to complement the boards. FHLBank nonmember directors  are required to have experience in, or knowledge of, one or more of the  following areas: auditing and accounting, derivatives, financial  management, organizational management, project development, risk  management practices, and the law. FINRA officials stated that they had  no written qualifications but added that for each opening they analyzed  the type of expertise the board lacked\u2014for example, technological, legal,  or academic\u2014to identify skills that would complement the existing  expertise. SEC requires public companies to disclose information about  the qualifications of directors and nominees for director and to provide  reasons why each should serve but does not require specific types of  experience or expertise.", "As with the Federal Reserve Banks, none of the comparable entities had  specific requirements for gender or race and ethnic diversity for their  boards. One central bank required that directors represent different  geographies and industries within the country. As discussed earlier,  public companies must report in their proxy and information statement on  how the nominating committee considered diversity when reviewing  candidates for director. In our analysis of the 10 largest bank holding  companies in 2010, proxy statements indicated that companies primarily  value candidates that will bring complementary skills and experience to  the board but also consider diversity in selecting them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 Accountability Measures Are Consistent with Comparable Organizations\u2019 Measures", "paragraphs": ["Reserve Banks and comparable institutions, both public and private, have  a variety of accountability measures in place, including annual  performance reviews of the organization and management, internal and  self-assessments, and external audits.

Similarly, a  committee of the board at the Bank of England\u2014the Committee of the  Court (NedCo)\u2014is responsible for reviewing the bank\u2019s performance in  relation to its objectives and strategy, monitoring the extent to which its  financial management objectives are met, reviewing the procedures of the  Monetary Policy Committee and the bank\u2019s internal controls, and  determining the pay and terms of employment of the governors, executive  directors and external Monetary Policy Committee members. To a large  extent, NedCo\u2019s work is done through the Court of Directors; it is chaired  by the Court\u2019s chairman and consists of all nonexecutive members.", "Internal reviews and self-assessments are also part of board  accountability practices across the institutions that we reviewed. Within  the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Board relies on  RBOPS to oversee Reserve Banks\u2019 management and operations.  RBOPS reviews each Reserve Bank at least every 3 years. In addition, 6  of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank boards of directors conduct an annual  self-evaluation. Some of the other organizations that we reviewed had  similar evaluations conducted by their boards. For example, the Bank of  similar evaluations conducted by their boards. For example, the Bank of  Canada\u2019s board conducts an annual self-assessment through one-on-one  interviews between each director and the lead director, supported by a  survey that solicits directors\u2019 views on various elements of the board\u2019s  operations, governance, and effectiveness. The survey is completed  electronically and aggregated results are distributed to directors for  discussion in open session. The board also has developed and maintains  a skills map of the current directors\u2019 competencies and takes note of any  gaps or deficiencies. Further, companies listed on the NYSE must adopt  corporate governance guidelines that include provisions for the board to  conduct a self-evaluation at least annually to determine whether it and its  committees are functioning effectively.", "Reserve Bank boards and publicly listed companies also hold meetings of  nonmanagement directors to promote accountability by encouraging  nonmanagement directors to serve as a more effective check on  management. All Federal Reserve Bank boards have executive  committees that vary across banks in terms of the composition of Class  A, B, and C directors (see app. III for more information on the Reserve  Bank committees). The NYSE requires that nonmanagement directors of  each listed company meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions  without management.", "Some of the organizations that we reviewed, including the Federal  Reserve Banks, had audit committees in place. Each Reserve Bank has  an audit committee that oversees the bank\u2019s internal auditor and reviews  and approves the annual audit plan. The audit committee is also  responsible for coordinating with external auditors and helping ensure  that audit recommendations and concerns are properly addressed.  Similarly, the Bank of England has two committees that play a role in  accountability. First, as previously discussed, the Committee of the Court,  NedCo, is responsible for conducting a performance assessment of the  central bank. Second, the Risk and Audit Committee provides  independent assurance to the Court of Directors that the bank\u2019s internal  controls are appropriate. The committee meets regularly and reviews the  work of internal and external auditors, annual financial statements, and  the appropriateness of the accounting policies and procedures adopted. It  also makes recommendations on the appointment of the external  auditors, including their independence and fees, and reviews the bank\u2019s  risk matrix and specific business controls. The Reserve Bank of Australia  and the Bank of Canada also have audit committees that play a role  similar to that of the Reserve Banks\u2019 committees.", "FINRA\u2019s bylaws require the board to have an audit committee of four or  five governors, none of them officers or employees of the corporation and  including at least two public governors. The audit committee\u2019s functions  are similar to those of committees at other organizations previously  discussed. Finally, NYSE-listed companies are required to have audit  committees with at least three independent members. NYSE guidelines  stipulate that audit committees must assist with board oversight of the  company\u2019s financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory  requirements, the independent auditor\u2019s qualifications and independence,  and the performance of the company\u2019s internal audit function and  independent auditors.

While the Federal Reserve  Board notes vacant positions among its list of Reserve Bank board  directors, the Reserve Banks do not publish information about vacant  director positions on their websites. Additionally, all Reserve Banks have  publicly accessible websites, but most banks post only the names, titles,  and employers of current directors rather than richer biographical  information. Four of the Reserve Banks provide descriptions of the board  and their roles, and two banks post more comprehensive information.

One researcher  stated that as a result of the lack of transparency around the director  election process, there is a lack of understanding of how and why  directors were chosen to serve on Reserve Bank boards. This can also  cause increased concern about potential conflicts of interest among the  directors because how and why certain individuals were selected for the  board is not clear to the public. Further, in our survey of Reserve Bank  directors, one director noted that transparency around the election  process should be improved. The director noted that the topic was not  discussed in board meetings or executive sessions of board meetings.  Federal Reserve Board officials said that two Reserve Banks are publicly  announcing board vacancies, but because Class A and B directors are  elected by the member banks, Class C directors were the only vacancies  for which the general public could apply. Further, officials said that while  they could enhance transparency by advertising a vacant Class C  position, the nature of the job and the need for a specific skill set  generally meant that it was better for the banks themselves to recruit  candidates instead of publicly seeking applications.", "Enhanced transparency of the director selection process, including  posting director vacancies and selection procedures, could not only make  the election process more transparent but also help increase the diversity  of the candidate pool. Some of the institutions we reviewed have taken  steps to increase transparency of their director selection process. Two of  the central banks we reviewed publicized and solicited applications for  governor/director positions. It was announced in July 2008 that the Bank  of England would advertise vacant positions. Additionally, in Canada, a  government website permits individuals to submit their names for  consideration as directors of government. Also ministers responsible for  entities requiring directors maintain a pool of all eligible candidates, so the  Minister of Finance develops this pool of candidates for the Bank of  Canada. As previously noted, about half of the FHLBanks publish  information on their websites about the director election process and  provide applications for potential candidates to submit to be considered  by the nomination committee. Further, as previously mentioned, some  Members of Congress and others raised questions about the governance  of the Reserve Banks, including the selection and roles of directors.  Improving the transparency of the Reserve Bank director selection  process is one way to help address concerns about Reserve Bank  governance.", "The Federal Reserve System has taken some important steps to increase  transparency. For example, the Federal Reserve Board has recently  taken steps to increase transparency of the monetary policy-making  process. In March, the Federal Reserve Board announced that the  Chairman would hold press briefings four times per year to present the  Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s current economic projections and to  provide additional context for its policy decisions. The first press  conference was held in April 2011. Additionally, some Reserve Banks  have begun placing additional information about governance  arrangements on their public websites. The Federal Reserve Board  describes these postings as a recent trend and said that FRBNY has  been a leader in this area.", "Further, the Reserve Bank boards conduct community outreach that  focuses primarily on financial literacy and informing the public on their  role in monetary policy. One of the three main roles for Reserve Bank  directors is to be a liaison between the bank and the community. Several  directors and bank officials told us that they believe that public outreach  was necessary to help reduce the public\u2019s misperception about the roles  and responsibilities of the Reserve Banks. In our survey of Reserve Bank  directors, some directors noted that outreach should be continued to  create a more transparent environment and strengthen governance. For  example, one director said that one way to strengthen Reserve Bank  governance was to continue to foster an environment of transparency,  with open and frequent communication. Further, the director noted that  not everyone understood the difference between monetary and fiscal  policy and that the Reserve Banks could help to educate the general  public and the media. One director also noted that outreach activities  generated goodwill and awareness throughout the community and the  district and led to better public representation on Reserve Bank boards.  Additionally, another director noted that the Reserve Banks needed to  continue their outreach to educate the public about monetary policy and  the need for an independent Federal Reserve System but cited the  Reserve Banks\u2019 budget constraints as a limitation to their outreach efforts.", "Officials at the Federal Reserve Board noted that the Federal Reserve  System functions more effectively and efficiently when each Reserve  Bank is implementing good governance procedures because good  corporate governance is a key element in improving economic efficiency.

Under this public-private partnership, the Reserve Bank directors  serve a role in bringing information from their communities to inform the  monetary policy deliberations of the central bank and helping oversee the  operations of the Reserve Banks. The directors, like the Federal Reserve  Board, are also part of the governance framework of the Reserve Banks.  However, the operations and governance of the Federal Reserve System  came to the forefront during the 2007-2009 financial crisis when it played  a prominent role in stabilizing financial markets through the use of its  emergency lending authorities. These unprecedented actions resulted in  Congress and the public raising questions about the Reserve Banks\u2019  governance practices and potential conflicts of interest involving the  directors.", "Specifically, some questioned how well the Reserve Bank boards  represent the public, which in part could be measured by the economic  and demographic diversity of the directors. Our analysis shows that from  2006 through 2010 labor and consumer groups tended to be less  represented than other industry groups on both head office and branch  boards. While the Federal Reserve Board encouraged the Reserve Banks  to recruit directors from consumer and labor organizations, restrictions on  directors\u2019 political activities appeared to be a challenge in recruiting  representatives from these organizations, who tend to be politically active.  Our analysis also shows that while there is some variation among the  Reserve Banks in the representation of women and minorities at head  office and branch boards, overall, it has remained limited. Although it is  difficult to know whether the board\u2019s decisions would have been different  had there been greater diversity on the boards, the public that the board  represents is becoming increasingly diverse. Officials from most Reserve  Banks generally focus their search for candidates on senior corporate  executives, who are perceived to have a relatively broad perspective on  the economy. However, seeking directors from among senior or chief- level executives may contribute to the limited diversity on the boards  because as our analysis of EEOC data shows, diversity at the senior  executive level is more limited than at the senior manager level across  industries. To the extent that director searches are limited to chief-level  executives, the Reserve Banks not only limit the diversity of the pool of  potential candidates but also risk limiting the perspectives shared about  the economy in the formation of monetary policy.", "The statutory requirement for three classes of directors was intended to  provide representation of both stockholding banks and the public.  However, the existence of Class A and to a lesser extent Class B  directors on the boards creates an appearance of a conflict of interest,  particularly in matters involving supervision and regulation. Moreover,  directors from all three classes could have past and current affiliations  with financial institutions. These affiliations have given rise to  relationships that pose reputational risk to the Reserve Banks. While  director conflicts can be identified and managed, interconnectedness  between directors and financial institutions cannot be eliminated;  therefore, ongoing challenges remain. For example, the credibility of the  Federal Reserve System will be affected by the perceived effectiveness  of its ability to manage conflict issues. While the Federal Reserve System  has recognized the importance of public perception and made changes to  Reserve Bank governance practices, more could be done to increase the  flow of information on the directors\u2019 roles to the public and strengthen  controls. Specifically, greater transparency could assist the public in  understanding the roles and functioning of the Reserve Bank boards,  such as clarifying the limited nature of Reserve Bank directors\u2019  involvement in supervision and regulation operations with a statement in  the Reserve Bank board bylaws could help to improve the public\u2019s  confidence in Reserve Bank governance. While waivers are one way the  Federal Reserve System mitigates conflicts involving Federal Reserve  Board eligibility requirements, not all Reserve Banks have procedures for  requesting a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board. Moreover, if  waivers are granted, there is no requirement to make that information  public. Failing to make the process and decisions more transparent can  decrease confidence in the Federal Reserve System and has resulted in  questions about the integrity of Reserve Banks\u2019 operations and the  appearance of conflicts of interest.", "Finally, while the Federal Reserve System has taken steps to increase  transparency of governance practices as well as transparency overall,  Reserve Bank governance practices were generally not as transparent as  those of other central banks and financial institutions that we studied. In a  time when the Federal Reserve System\u2019s emergency actions have  resulted in relationships between Reserve Banks and directors and the  relationships between directors and financial firms being questioned,  more transparent governance practices are essential to the effective and  credible functioning of the Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve  System as a whole. While the Federal Reserve System has taken some  steps to increase the transparency of its governance practices, such as  conducting quarterly press conferences after the FOMC meetings,  additional actions such as making key governance documents easily  accessible to the public could enhance transparency and protect  organizational reputation.

Figure 11  provides a timeline for the establishment, modification, and termination of  Federal Reserve System emergency programs subject to this review.", "In the months before the authorization of TAF and new swap line  arrangements, which were the first of the emergency programs subject to  this review, the Federal Reserve Board took steps to ease emerging strains  in credit markets through its traditional monetary policy tools. In late summer  2007, sudden strains in term interbank lending markets emerged primarily  due to intensifying investor concerns about commercial banks\u2019 actual  exposures to various mortgage-related securities. The cost of term funding  (loans provided at terms of 1 month or longer) spiked suddenly in August  2007, and commercial banks increasingly had to borrow overnight to meet  their funding needs. The Federal Reserve Board feared that the disorderly  functioning of interbank lending markets would impair the ability of  commercial banks to provide credit to households and businesses. To ease  stresses in these markets, on August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board  made two temporary changes to the terms at which Reserve Banks  extended loans through the discount window. First, it approved the reduction  of the discount rate\u2014the interest rate at which the Reserve Banks extended  collateralized loans at the discount window\u2014by 50 basis points. Second, to  address specific strains in term-funding markets, the Federal Reserve Board  approved extending the discount window lending term from overnight to up  to 30 days, with the possibility of renewal. According to a Federal Reserve  Board study, this change initially resulted in little additional borrowing from  the discount window. In addition to the discount window changes, starting in  September 2007, the FOMC announced a series of reductions in the target  federal funds rate\u2014the FOMC-established target interest rate that banks  charge each other for loans. In October 2007, tension in term funding  subsided temporarily. However, issues reappeared in late November and  early December, possibly driven in part by a seasonal contraction in the  supply of year-end funding.", "On December 12, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board announced the  creation of TAF to address continuing disruptions in U.S. term interbank  lending markets. The Federal Reserve Board authorized Reserve Banks  to extend credit through TAF by revising the regulations governing  Reserve Bank discount window lending. TAF was intended to help  provide term funding to depository institutions eligible to borrow from the  discount window. In contrast to the traditional discount window program,  which loaned funds to individual institutions at the discount rate, TAF was  designed to auction loans to many eligible institutions at once at a  market-determined interest rate. Federal Reserve Board officials noted  that one important advantage of this auction approach was that it could  address concerns among eligible borrowers about the perceived stigma  of discount window borrowing. Federal Reserve Board officials noted   that an institution might be reluctant to borrow from the discount window  out of concern that its creditors and other counterparties might become  aware of its discount window use and perceive it as a sign of distress.  The auction format allowed banks to approach the Reserve Banks  collectively rather than individually and obtain funds at an interest rate set  by auction rather than at a premium set by the Federal Reserve Board.  Additionally, whereas discount window loan funds could be obtained  immediately by an institution facing severe funding pressures, TAF  borrowers did not receive loan funds until 3 days after the auction. For  these reasons, TAF-eligible borrowers may have attached less of a  stigma to auctions than to traditional discount window borrowing. The first  TAF auction was held on December 17, 2007, with subsequent auctions  occurring approximately every 2 weeks until the final TAF auction on  March 8, 2010.", "Concurrent with the announcement of TAF, the FOMC announced the  establishment of dollar swap arrangements with two foreign central banks  to address similar disruptions in dollar funding markets abroad. In a  typical swap line transaction, FRBNY exchanged dollars for the foreign  central bank\u2019s currency at the prevailing exchange rate, and the foreign  central bank agreed to buy back its currency (to \u201cunwind\u201d the exchange)  at this same exchange rate at an agreed upon future date. The market for  interbank funding in U.S. dollars is global, and many foreign banks hold  U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and fund these assets by borrowing in  U.S. dollars. In contrast to U.S. commercial banks, foreign banks did not  hold significant U.S.-dollar deposits, and as a result, dollar funding  disruptions were particularly acute for many foreign banks during the  recent crisis. In December 2007, the European Central Bank and Swiss  National Bank requested dollar swap arrangements with the Federal  Reserve System to increase their ability to provide U.S. dollar loans to  banks in their jurisdictions. Federal Reserve Board staff memorandums  recommending that the FOMC approve these swap arrangements noted  that continuing tension in dollar funding markets abroad could further  exacerbate tensions in U.S. funding markets. On December 6, 2007,  the FOMC approved requests from the European Central Bank and Sw National Bank and authorized FRBNY to establish temporary swap lines  under section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act. During 2008, the FOMC  iss  approved temporary swap lines with 12 other foreign central banks.  FRBNY\u2019s swap lines with the 14 central banks closed on February 1,  2010. In May 2010, to address the re-emergence of strains in dollar  funding markets, FRBNY reopened swap lines with the Bank of Canada,  the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and  the Swiss National Bank through January 2011. On December 21, 2010,  the FOMC announced an extension of these lines through August 1,  2011. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board announced an  extension of these swap lines through August 1, 2012."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In March 2008, the Federal Reserve Board Invoked Emergency Authority to Facilitate Sale of Bear Stearns and Expansion of Liquidity Support to Primary Dealers", "paragraphs": ["In early March 2008, the Federal Reserve Board observed growing tension  in the repurchase agreement markets\u2014large, short-term collateralized  funding markets\u2014that many financial institutions rely on to finance a wide  range of securities. Under a repurchase agreement, a borrowing institution  generally acquires funds by selling securities to a lending institution and  agreeing to repurchase the securities after a specified time at a given price.  The securities, in effect, are collateral provided by the borrower to the  lender. In the event of a borrower\u2019s default on the repurchase transaction,  the lender would be able to take (and sell) the collateral provided by the  borrower. Lenders typically will not provide a loan for the full market value  of the posted securities, and the difference between the values of the  securities and the loan is called a margin or haircut. This deduction is  intended to protect the lenders against a decline in the price of the  securities provided as collateral. In early March, the Federal Reserve  Board found that repurchase agreement lenders were requiring higher  haircuts for loans against a range of securities and were becoming  reluctant to lend against mortgage-related securities. As a result, many  financial institutions increasingly had to rely on higher-quality collateral,  such as U.S. Treasury securities, to obtain cash in these markets, and a  shortage of such high-quality collateral emerged. In March 2008, the  Federal Reserve Board cited \u201cunusual and exigent circumstances\u201d in  invoking section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to authorize FRBNY to  implement four emergency actions to address deteriorating conditions in  these markets: (1) TSLF, (2) a bridge loan to Bear Stearns, (3) a  commitment to lend up to $30 billion against Bear Stearns assets that  resulted in the creation of Maiden Lane LLC, and (4) PDCF.", "On March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation  of the TSLF to auction 28-day loans of U.S. Treasury securities to primary  dealers to increase the amount of high-quality collateral available for  these dealers to borrow against in the repurchase agreement markets.  Through competitive auctions that allowed dealers to bid a fee to  exchange harder-to-finance collateral for easier-to-finance Treasury  securities, TSLF was intended to promote confidence among lenders and  to reduce the need for dealers to sell illiquid assets into the markets,  which could have further depressed the prices of these assets and  contributed to a downward price spiral. TSLF auctioned loans of  Treasury securities against two schedules of collateral. Schedule 1  collateral included treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS collateral  that FRBNY accepted in repurchase agreements for traditional open  market operations with primary dealers. Schedule 2 included schedule 1  collateral as well as a broader range of assets, including highly rated  mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve Board determined  that providing funding support for private mortgage-backed securities  through the schedule 2 auctions fell outside the scope of FRBNY\u2019s  authority to conduct its securities lending program under section 14 of the  Federal Reserve Act. Accordingly, for the first time during this crisis, the  Federal Reserve Board invoked section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act  to authorize the extension of credit, in this case in the form of Treasury  securities, to nondepository institutions\u2014in this case, the primary dealers.  As discussed later in this appendix the Federal Reserve Board later  expanded the range of collateral eligible for TSLF as the crisis intensified.  TSLF closed on February 1, 2010.", "Shortly following the announcement of TSLF, the Federal Reserve Board  invoked its emergency authority for a second time to authorize an  emergency loan to avert a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns. TSLF was  announced on March 11, 2008, and the first TSLF auction was held on  March 27, 2008. Federal Reserve Board officials noted that although  TSLF was announced to address market tensions affecting many firms,  some market participants concluded that its establishment was driven by  specific concerns about Bear Stearns. Over a few days, Bear Stearns  experienced a run on its liquidity as many of its lenders grew concerned  that the firm would suffer greater losses in the future and stopped  providing funding to the firm, even on a fully secured basis with high- quality assets provided as collateral. Late on Thursday, March 13, 2008,  the senior management of Bear Stearns notified the Federal Reserve that  it would likely have to file for bankruptcy protection the following day  unless the Federal Reserve provided the firm with an emergency loan.  The Federal Reserve Board feared that the sudden failure of Bear  Stearns could have serious adverse impacts on markets in which Bear  Stearns was a significant participant, including the repurchase  agreements market. In particular, a Bear Stearns failure may have  threatened the liquidity and solvency of other large institutions that relied  heavily on short-term secured funding markets. On Friday, March 14,  2008, the Federal Reserve Board voted to authorize FRBNY to provide a  $12.9 billion loan to Bear Stearns through JP Morgan Chase Bank,  National Association, the largest bank subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase &  Co. (JPMC), and to accept $13.8 billion of Bear Stearns assets as  collateral. This back-to-back loan transaction was repaid on Monday,  March 17, 2008, with almost $4 million of interest. This emergency loan  enabled Bear Stearns to avoid bankruptcy and continue to operate  through the weekend. This provided time for potential acquirers, including  JPMC, to assess Bear Stearns\u2019s financial condition and for FRBNY to  prepare a new liquidity program, PDCF, to address strains that could  emerge from a possible Bear Stearns bankruptcy announcement the  following Monday. Federal Reserve Board and FRBNY officials hoped  that bankruptcy could be averted by the announcement that a private  sector firm would acquire Bear Stearns and stand behind its liabilities  when the markets reopened on the following Monday.", "On Sunday, March 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board announced that  FRBNY would lend up to $30 billion against certain Bear Stearns assets  to facilitate JPMC\u2019s acquisition of Bear Stearns. Over the weekend, JPMC  had emerged as the only viable acquirer of Bear Stearns. In  congressional testimony, Timothy Geithner, who was the President of  FRBNY in March 2008, provided the following account:  \u201cBear approached several major financial institutions, beginning on March  13. Those discussions intensified on Friday and Saturday. Bear\u2019s  management provided us with periodic progress reports about a possible  merger. Although several different institutions expressed interest in  acquiring all or part of Bear, it was clear that the size of Bear, the  apparent risk in its balance sheet, and the limited amount of time  available for a possible acquirer to conduct due diligence compounded  the difficulty. Ultimately, only JPMorgan Chase was willing to consider an  offer of a binding commitment to acquire the firm and to stand behind  Bear\u2019s substantial short-term obligations.\u201d", "According to FRBNY officials, on the morning of Sunday, March 16, 2008,  JPMC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer told FRBNY that the merger would be  possible only if certain mortgage-related assets were taken off Bear  Stearns\u2019s balance sheet. Negotiations between JPMC and FRBNY senior  management resulted in a preliminary agreement under which FRBNY  would make a $30 billion nonrecourse loan to JPMC collateralized by  these Bear Stearns assets. A March 16, 2008, letter from then-FRBNY  president Geithner to JPMC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer documented the  terms of the preliminary agreement.", "Significant issues that threatened to unravel the merger agreement  emerged soon after the announcement. Bear Stearns board members  and shareholders thought JPMC\u2019s offer to purchase the firm at $2 per  share was too low and threatened to vote against the merger. Perceived  ambiguity in the terms of the merger agreement raised further concerns  that JPMC could be forced to stand behind Bear Stearns\u2019s obligations  even in the event that the merger was rejected. Moreover, some Bear  Stearns counterparties stopped trading with Bear Stearns because of  uncertainty about whether JPMC would honor certain Bear Stearns  obligations. FRBNY also had concerns with the level of protection  provided under the preliminary lending agreement, under which FRBNY  had agreed to lend on a nonrecourse basis against risky collateral. The  risks of an unraveled merger agreement included a possible Bear Stearns  bankruptcy and losses for JPMC, which might have been legally required  to stand behind the obligations of a failed institution. Recognizing the risk  that an unraveled merger posed to JPMC and the broader financial  markets, FRBNY officials sought to renegotiate the lending agreement.", "During the following week, the terms of this agreement were renegotiated,  resulting in the creation of a new lending structure in the form of Maiden  Lane LLC. From March 17 to March 24, 2008, FRBNY, JPMC, and Bear  Stearns engaged in dual track negotiations to address each party\u2019s  concerns with the preliminary merger and lending agreements. On March  24, 2008, FRBNY and JPMC agreed to a new lending structure that  incorporated greater loss protections for FRBNY. Specifically, FRBNY  created a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), Maiden Lane LLC, that used  proceeds from a $28.82 billion FRBNY senior loan and a $1.15 billion  JPMC subordinated loan to purchase Bear Stearns assets.", "While one team of Federal Reserve Board and FRBNY staff worked on  options to avert a Bear Stearns failure, another team worked to ready  PDCF for launch by Monday, March 17, 2008, when Federal Reserve  Board officials feared a Bear Stearns bankruptcy announcement might  trigger runs on the liquidity of other primary dealers. The liquidity support  from TSLF would not become available until the first TSLF auction later in  the month. On March 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board announced  the creation of PDCF to provide overnight collateralized cash loans to the  primary dealers. FRBNY quickly implemented PDCF by leveraging its  existing legal and operational infrastructure for its existing repurchase  agreement relationships with the primary dealers. Although the Bear  Stearns bankruptcy was averted, PDCF commenced operation on March  17, 2008, and in its first week extended loans to 10 primary dealers. Bear  Stearns was consistently the largest PDCF borrower until June 2008.  Eligible PDCF collateral initially included investment-grade corporate  securities, municipal securities, and asset-backed securities, including  mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve Board authorized an  expansion of collateral types eligible for PDCF loans later in the crisis.  This program was terminated on February 1, 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Fall 2008, the Federal Reserve Board Modified Existing Programs and Launched Additional Programs to Support Other Key Markets", "paragraphs": ["In September 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered an  intensification of the financial crisis, and the Federal Reserve Board  modified the terms for its existing liquidity programs to address worsening  conditions. On September 14, 2008, shortly before Lehman Brothers  announced it would file for bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve Board  announced changes to TSLF and PDCF to provide expanded liquidity  support to primary dealers. Specifically, the Federal Reserve Board  announced that TSLF-eligible collateral would be expanded to include all  investment-grade debt securities and PDCF-eligible collateral would be  expanded to include all securities eligible to be pledged in the triparty  repurchase agreements system, including noninvestment grade securities  and equities. In addition, TSLF schedule 2 auctions would take place  weekly rather than only biweekly. On September 21, 2008, the Federal  Reserve Board announced that it would extend credit\u2014on terms similar to  those applicable for PDCF loans\u2014to the U.S. and London broker-dealer  subsidiaries of Merrill Lynch & Co. (Merrill Lynch), Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (Goldman Sachs), and Morgan Stanley to provide support to these  subsidiaries as they became part of bank holding companies that would be  regulated by the Federal Reserve System. On September 29, 2008, the  Federal Reserve Board also announced expanded support through TAF  and the dollar swap lines. Specifically, the Federal Reserve Board doubled  the amount of funds that would be available in each TAF auction cycle from  $150 billion to $300 billion, and the FOMC authorized a $330 billion  expansion of the swap line arrangements with foreign central banks.", "In the months following Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve Board  authorized several new liquidity programs under section 13(3) of the  Federal Reserve Act to provide support to other key funding markets,  such as the commercial paper and the asset-backed security markets. In  contrast to earlier emergency programs that represented relatively  modest extensions of established Federal Reserve System lending or  open market operation activities, these newer programs incorporated  more novel design features and targeted new market participants with  which the Reserve Banks had not historically transacted. As was the case  with the earlier programs, many of these newer programs were designed  and launched under extraordinary time constraints as the Federal  Reserve Board sought to address rapidly deteriorating market conditions.  In order of their announcement, these programs included (1) Asset- Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility  (AMLF) to provide liquidity support to money market mutual funds  (MMMF) in meeting redemption demands from investors and to foster  liquidity in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, (2)  Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to provide a liquidity backstop  to eligible issuers of commercial paper, (3) the Money Market Investor  Funding Facility (MMIFF) to serve as an additional backstop for MMMFs,  and (4) the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to assist  certain securitization markets that supported the flow of credit to  households and businesses.", "On September 19, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBB to  establish AMLF to provide liquidity support to MMMFs facing redemption  pressures. According to FRBB staff, the processes and procedures to  implement AMLF were designed over the weekend before FRBB  commenced operation of AMLF on September 22, 2008. MMMFs were a  major source of short-term credit for financial institutions, including  through MMMFs\u2019 purchases and holdings of ABCP. ABCP continued to  be an important source of funding for many businesses. Following the  announcement that a large MMMF had \u201cbroken the buck\u201d\u2014net asset  value fell below $1 per share\u2014as a result of losses on Lehman\u2019s  commercial paper, other MMMFs faced a large wave of redemption  requests as investors sought to limit their potential exposures to the  financial sector. The Federal Reserve Board was concerned that attempts  by MMMFs to raise cash through forced sales of ABCP and other assets  into illiquid markets could further depress the prices of these assets and  exacerbate strains in short-term funding markets. AMLF\u2019s design, which  relied on intermediary borrowers to use Reserve Bank loans to fund the  same-day purchase of eligible ABCP from MMMFs, reflected the need to  overcome practical constraints in lending to MMMFs directly. According to  Federal Reserve System officials, MMMFs would have had limited  capacity to borrow directly from the Reserve Banks in amounts that would  be sufficient to meet redemption requests because of statutory and fund- specific limitations on fund borrowing. To quickly support the MMMF  market, the Federal Reserve Board authorized loans to entities that  conduct funding and custodial activities, which include holding and  administering the accounts with MMMF assets, with MMMFs to fund the  purchase of ABCP from MMMFs. Eligible borrowers were identified as  discount-window-eligible depository institutions (U.S. depository  institutions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks) and U.S.  bank holding companies and their U.S. broker-dealer affiliates. The  interest rate on AMLF loans was lower than the returns on eligible ABCP,  providing incentives for eligible intermediary borrowers to participate.  AMLF closed on February 1, 2010.", "On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation  of CPFF to provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial  paper. Commercial paper is an important source of short-term funding for  U.S. financial and nonfinancial businesses. CPFF became operational  on October 27, 2008, and was operated by FRBNY. In establishing  CPFF, FRBNY created an SPV that was to directly purchase new issues  of eligible ABCP and unsecured commercial paper with the proceeds of  loans it received from FRBNY for that purpose. In the weeks leading up  to CPFF\u2019s announcement, the commercial paper markets showed clear  signs of strain: the volume of commercial paper outstanding declined,  interest rates on longer-term commercial paper increased significantly,  and increasing amounts of commercial paper were issued on an  overnight basis as money market funds and other investors became  reluctant to purchase commercial paper at longer-dated maturities.", "During this time, MMMFs faced a surge of redemption demands from  investors concerned about losses on presumably safe instruments. The  Federal Reserve Board concluded that disruptions in the commercial  paper markets, combined with tension in other credit markets, threatened  the broader economy as many large commercial paper issuers promoted  the flow of credit to households and businesses. By standing ready to  purchase eligible commercial paper, CPFF was intended to eliminate  much of the risk that commercial paper issuers would be unable to issue  new commercial paper to replace their maturing commercial paper  obligations. By reducing this risk, CPFF was expected to encourage  investors to continue or resume their purchases of commercial paper at  longer maturities. CPFF closed on February 1, 2010.", "On October 21, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY to  work with the private sector to create MMIFF to serve as an additional  backstop for MMMFs. MMIFF complemented AMLF by standing ready to  purchase a broader range of short-term debt instruments held by MMMFs,  including certificates of deposit and bank notes. MMIFF\u2019s design featured a  complex lending structure through which five SPVs would purchase eligible  instruments from eligible funds. In contrast to other Federal Reserve Board  programs that created SPVs, MMIFF SPVs were set up and managed by  private sector entities. According to FRBNY staff, JPMC, in collaboration  with other firms that sponsored large MMMFs, brought the idea for an  MMIFF-like facility to FRBNY in early October 2008, FRBNY worked with  JPMC to set up the MMIFF SPVs but did not contract directly with JPMC or  the firm that managed the MMIFF program. While MMIFF became  operational in late November 2008, it was never used.", "In November 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY to  create TALF to reopen the securitization markets in an effort to improve  access to credit for consumers and businesses. During the recent  financial crisis, the value of many asset-backed securities (ABS) dropped  precipitously, bringing originations in the securitization markets to a virtual  halt. Problems in the securitization markets threatened to make it more  difficult for households and small businesses to access the credit that  they needed to, among other things, buy cars and homes and expand  inventories and operations. TALF provided nonrecourse loans to eligible  U.S. companies and individuals in return for collateral in the form of  securities that could be forfeited if the loans were not repaid. TALF was  one of the more operationally complex programs, and the first TALF  subscription was not held until March 2009. In contrast to other programs  that had been launched in days or weeks, TALF required several months  of preparation to refine program terms and conditions and consider how  to leverage vendor firms to best achieve TALF policy objectives.

(AIG);   (2) Citigroup, Inc. (Citigroup); and (3) Bank of America Corporation (Bank  of America).", "In September 2008, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury  determined through analysis of information provided by AIG and  insurance regulators, as well as publicly available information, that market  events could cause AIG to fail, which would pose systemic risk to  financial markets. The Federal Reserve Board and subsequently  Treasury took steps to ensure that AIG obtained sufficient liquidity and  could complete an orderly sale of some of its operating assets and  continue to meet its obligations. On September 16, 2008, one day after  the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy announcement, the Federal Reserve  Board authorized FRBNY to provide a revolving credit facility (RCF) of up  to $85 billion to help AIG meet its obligations. The AIG RCF was created  to provide AIG with a revolving loan that AIG and its subsidiaries could  use to address strains on their liquidity. The announcement of this  assistance followed a downgrade of the firm\u2019s credit rating, which had  prompted collateral calls by its counterparties and raised concerns that a  rapid failure of the company would further destabilize financial markets.  Two key sources of AIG\u2019s difficulties were AIG Financial Products Corp.  (AIGFP) and a securities lending program operated by insurance  subsidiaries of AIG. AIGFP faced growing collateral calls on credit  default swaps it had written on collateralized debt obligations (CDO).  Meanwhile, AIG faced demands on its liquidity from securities lending  counterparties who were returning borrowed securities and demanding  that AIG return their cash collateral. Despite the announcement of the  AIG RCF, AIG\u2019s condition continued to decline rapidly in fall 2008.", "On subsequent occasions, the Federal Reserve Board invoked section  13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to authorize either new assistance or a  restructuring of existing assistance to AIG.  \uf0b7  First, in October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized the  creation of the securities borrowing facility (SBF) to provide up to  $37.8 billion of direct funding support to a securities lending program  operated by AIG\u2019s domestic insurance companies. From October 8,  2008, through December 11, 2008, FRBNY provided cash loans to  AIG\u2019s domestic life insurance companies, collateralized by investment  grade debt obligations.", "In November 2008, as part of plans to restructure the assistance to  AIG to further strengthen its financial condition, and once again avert  the failure of the company, the Federal Reserve Board and Treasury  restructured AIG\u2019s debt. Under the restructured terms, Treasury  purchased $40 billion in shares of AIG preferred stock and the cash  from the sale was used to pay down a portion of AIG\u2019s outstanding  balance from the AIG RCF. The limit on the facility also was reduced  to $60 billion, and other changes were made.  \uf0b7  Also in November 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized the  creation of two SPVs\u2014Maiden Lane II LLC and Maiden Lane III  LLC\u2014to purchase certain AIG-related assets. Similar to Maiden Lane  LLC, these SPVs funded most of these asset purchases with a senior  loan from FRBNY. Maiden Lane II replaced the AIG SBF and served  as a longer-term solution to the liquidity problems facing AIG\u2019s  securities lending program. Maiden Lane III purchased the underlying  CDOs from AIG counterparties in connection with the termination of  credit default swap contracts issued by AIGFP and thus the  elimination of liquidity drain from collateral calls on the credit default  swaps sold by AIGFP.", "In March 2009, the Federal Reserve Board and Treasury announced  plans to further restructure AIG\u2019s assistance. According to the Federal  Reserve Board, debt owed by AIG on the AIG RCF would be reduced  by $25 billion in exchange for FRBNY\u2019s receipt of preferred equity  interests totaling $25 billion in two SPVs. AIG created both SPVs to  hold the outstanding common stock of two life insurance company  subsidiaries\u2014American Life Insurance Company and AIA Group  Limited.  \uf0b7  Also in March 2009, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY to  provide additional liquidity to AIG by extending credit by purchasing a  contemplated securitization of income from certain AIG life insurance  operations. FRBNY staff said this life insurance securitization option  was abandoned for a number of reasons, including that it would have  required FRBNY to manage a long-term exposure to life insurance  businesses with which it had little experience.", "On November 23, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY to  provide a lending commitment to Citigroup as part of a package of  coordinated actions by Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board  to avert a disorderly failure of the company. As discussed in our April  2010 report on Treasury\u2019s use of the systemic risk determination,  Treasury, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board said they provided  emergency assistance to Citigroup because they were concerned that the  failure of a firm of Citigroup\u2019s size and interconnectedness would have  had systemic implications. FRBNY agreed to lend against the residual  value of approximately $300 billion of Citigroup assets if losses on these  assets exceeded certain thresholds. On the basis of analyses by the  various parties and an outside vendor, FRBNY determined that it would  be unlikely that losses on the Citigroup \u201cring-fence\u201d assets would reach  the amount at which FRBNY would be obligated to provide a loan. At  Citigroup\u2019s request, Treasury, FDIC, and FRBNY agreed to terminate this  loss sharing agreement in December 2009. As part of the termination  agreement, Citigroup agreed to pay a $50 million termination fee to  FRBNY. FRBNY never provided a loan to Citigroup under this lending  commitment.", "On January 15, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBR to  provide a lending commitment to Bank of America. As with Citigroup, the  Federal Reserve Board authorized this assistance as part of a  coordinated effort with Treasury and FDIC to assist an institution that the  agencies determined to be systemically important. The circumstances  surrounding the agencies\u2019 decision to provide this arrangement for Bank  of America, however, were somewhat different and were the subject of  congressional hearings. While the Citigroup loss-sharing agreement  emerged during a weekend over which the agencies attempted to avert  an impending failure of the firm, the agencies\u2019 discussions with Bank of  America about a possible similar arrangement occurred over several  weeks during which Bank of America was not facing imminent failure.  According to Federal Reserve Board officials, possible assistance for  Bank of America was first discussed in late December 2008 when Bank of  America management raised concerns about the financial impact of  completing the merger with Merrill Lynch, which was expected at the time  to announce larger than anticipated losses (and did in fact announce  these losses the following month). Following the January 1, 2009,  completion of Bank of America\u2019s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Federal  Reserve Board and the other agencies agreed to provide a loss-sharing  agreement on selected Merrill Lynch and Bank of America assets to  assure markets that unusually large losses on these assets would not  destabilize Bank of America. On September 21, 2009, the agencies and  FRBR terminated the agreement in principle to enter into a loss sharing  agreement with Bank of America. The agreement was never finalized,  and FRBR never provided a loan to Bank of America under this lending  commitment. As part of the agreement to terminate the agreement in  principle, Bank of America paid $57 million to FRBR in compensation for  out-of-pocket expenses incurred by FRBR and an amount equal to the  commitment fees required by the agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In 2009 and 2010, FRBNY Executed Large-Scale Purchases of Agency MBS to Provide Broader Support to the Economy", "paragraphs": ["On November 25, 2008, the FOMC announced that FRBNY would  purchase up to $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities to  support the housing market and the broader economy. The FOMC  authorized the Agency MBS program under its authority to direct open  market operations under section 14 of Federal Reserve Act. By  purchasing MBS securities with longer maturities, the Agency MBS  program was intended to lower long-term interest rates and to improve  conditions in mortgage and other financial markets. The Agency MBS  program commenced purchases on January 5, 2009, a little more than a  month after the initial announcement. FRBNY staff noted that a key  operational challenge for the program was its size. FRBNY hired external  investment managers to provide execution support and advisory services  needed to help execute purchases on such a large scale. In March 2009,  the FOMC increased the total amount of planned purchases from $500  billion to up to $1.25 trillion. The program executed its final purchases in  March 2010 and settlement was completed in August 2010.", "On several occasions, the Federal Reserve Board authorized extensions  of its emergency loan programs, and most of these programs closed on  February 1, 2010.

Directors were sent an e-mail invitation to complete  the survey on a GAO web server using a unique username and  password. Nonrespondents received a reminder e-mail from GAO to  complete the survey. We also contacted the corporate secretaries at  every bank and asked them to encourage their directors to participate in  the survey. Even though we received responses from a majority of  directors in all 12 banks, it is possible some bias may exist in certain  survey responses if characteristics of respondents differed from those of  nonrespondents in ways that affect the responses (e.g., if any knew of a  potential conflict of interest at their bank they may or may not be less  likely to respond to the survey).", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  additional nonsampling errors, such as difficulties interpreting a particular  question, which can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors by pretesting the  questionnaire with three directors in February and March 2011. We  conducted pretests to make sure that the questions were clear and  unbiased and that the questionnaire did not place an undue burden on  respondents. An independent reviewer within GAO also reviewed a draft  of the questionnaire prior to its administration.
