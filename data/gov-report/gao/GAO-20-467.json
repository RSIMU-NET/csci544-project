Specifically, tuna industry officials stated that firms in  the U.S. canned tuna market are highly competitive in price setting as  opposed to differentiating their product lines. A tuna canning industry  official stated that price competition and the financial pressures of the  recent anti-trust judgements have forced the U.S. canned tuna market  into a cost-cutting environment. According to the same tuna canning  industry official, firms must look to lower costs related to labor, energy  usage, and shipping to remain competitive in the U.S. market. The official  stated that firms implicated in the price-fixing scheme have agreed as part  of a legal settlement resulting from a lawsuit to supply their product at  lower prices.

One employer said that it  could not recruit without minimum wage increases. Another employer  stated that even low-paid workers often leave the island to obtain  better pay in higher-paying countries. Some employers and workers  noted that the lack of staff, especially nurses and teachers, has led to  challenges, such as a negative impact on healthcare and education  on the island. One of these employers stated that the minimum wage  is too low and there is a lack of good teachers on the island. This  employer was upset that the local school did not have a math teacher,  noting that teachers leave or simply do not come to work because the  pay is too low.

Another employer noted concerns  about inflation, stating that minimum wage increases might drive up  prices and rent.", "Cultural considerations. Multiple employers and workers cited the  importance of considering American Samoa\u2019s unique culture when  setting minimum wage increases. While some workers and an  employer noted that the cost of living in American Samoa is unique in  that communal land and living off the land through fishing and  gardening could minimize housing and food costs, others noted that  community and church financial obligations are significant costs. One  employer stated that these costs could amount to up to a quarter of  worker\u2019s paycheck. A worker stated that nonresidents, like many of  the cannery workers, pay much higher medical costs; and an  employer stated that foreign workers pay much higher housing costs.", "Other economic challenges.

Specifically, we selected the following employers and their workers: (1)  the American Samoa government, (2) StarKist Samoa, (3) American  Samoa Medical Center, (4) American Samoa Community College, and (5)  American Samoa Power Authority. To supplement these employers and  workers, we requested that the American Samoa Chamber of Commerce  identify additional employers and their workers on the basis of criteria  related to the tuna canning, construction, and retail industries, among  other things. The American Samoa Chamber of Commerce arranged a  group of 15 employers and their workers belonging to its membership and  related to the tuna canning, construction, and retail industries, as well as  a group of eight employers related to the territory\u2019s ethnic (including  Filipino, Chinese, Korean) business community.

A prior GAO  report found that the minimum wage increases narrowed the gap between  lower- and higher-paid workers in American Samoa from 2007 to  2009. We first examined whether the tax data also show that the gap  narrowed during this period and then examined trends through 2018. One  limitation of this analysis was that it was restricted to the private sector  excluding the canneries. Therefore, any patterns that we documented in  this sector may not reflect changes to the American Samoa workforce as  a whole. We began our analysis in 2006 to provide information before the  Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. To measure a worker\u2019s annual earnings,  we summed all of the worker\u2019s gross wages from his or her tax records in  a given tax year. According to the tax data, in 2006, workers at the 50th  percentile of annual earnings earned $6,031. This amount is only 8  percent higher than what full-time workers would have earned if they were  continuously employed at the lowest minimum wage that was in effect in  American Samoa in 2006 ($2.68 per hour). In comparison, in the same  year workers at the 90th percentile earned $18,747, or 3.1 times higher  than the 50th percentile.

To illustrate tuna  canning costs for other business models, we compared the labor and  tariff costs associated with three potential business models for the  cannery operations currently used by firms in the global tuna industry.  The following analysis provides cost estimates for the three possible  models, assuming constant total production under each model. Our  analysis considers only labor costs and tariffs to show the effect of  variation across different models. Our analysis excludes other  associated costs, including transportation and refrigeration, as well as  costs associated with establishing multiple production locations.  Therefore, we assume that shipping costs and other conversion costs,  such as for electricity usage, are identical. We also assume that fixed  costs for starting operations in a new location (i.e., search costs) are  equal to zero. We assume the alternative country is Thailand, on the  basis of prior related reports and interviews with relevant officials and  stakeholders. All of the tariff and tax assumptions used in our analysis are  based on input from tuna canning industry officials.", "Model A (maintaining all loining and canning in American Samoa):  This is the current production process for the remaining cannery  operating in American Samoa. Tuna processing currently performed  in American Samoa remains entirely in American Samoa. The  cannery located in American Samoa hires local and foreign workers to  loin\u2014clean, cook, and cut\u2014and can the fish. With an estimated  workforce of 2,000 employees in American Samoa, the associated  labor cost was an estimated $23 million in 2019. The canned tuna  from American Samoa is exported directly to the United States and,  according to cannery officials who utilize this model, such canned  tuna is eligible for tariff-free access to the U.S. market. The cannery,  which is a qualified domestic corporation, according to cannery  officials, receives an estimated $5 million as a federal tax credit.", "Model B (relocating loining to Thailand or another country with low  labor costs and canning processed loins in the U.S. states): This is  the current production process for a firm operating a cannery outside  of American Samoa. The loining operation\u2014the most labor-intensive  part of the operation\u2014would move to a country with low labor costs,  such as Thailand, where the fish would be loined, sealed in pouches,  and frozen. The loined, frozen fish would then be exported to the U.S.  mainland, where it would be canned. With an estimated workforce of  1,700 employees in a country with low labor costs making $1.25 per  hour, the associated labor cost would be $4.4 million; and with an  estimated workforce of 300 employees in the U.S. mainland at $15  per hour, the associated labor cost would be $9.4 million. Therefore,  the total associated labor cost in 2019 for this model would be $14  million. No workers would remain in American Samoa, and 300  workers would be employed on the U.S. mainland. The imported fish  would carry an average tariff of $11 per metric ton. This model  assumes that the firm operating outside of American Samoa would  not qualify for the American Samoa economic development credit.", "Model C (relocating all loining and canning to Thailand or another  country with low labor costs):  This is an alternative production  process for operating canneries outside of American Samoa. Tuna  processing currently performed in American Samoa would relocate to  a foreign country with low labor costs. All operations, including loining  and canning the fish, would take place in this foreign country. With an  estimated workforce of 2,000 employees in a country with low labor  costs making $1.25 per hour, the associated labor cost in 2019 would  be $5 million. No workers would remain in American Samoa and no  workers would be employed in the U.S. mainland. The imported fish  would carry an average tariff of 12 percent of export revenue. This  model assumes that a firm operating outside of American Samoa  would not qualify for the American Samoa economic development  credit.", "Figure 16 shows that, considering labor and tariff costs along with tax  credits, Model A has higher costs than Model B. Model B presents cost  savings; however, importing processed loins to the United States would  incur tariffs, and wages for canning in any of the 50 U.S. states would be  higher than in competing tuna processing countries.
