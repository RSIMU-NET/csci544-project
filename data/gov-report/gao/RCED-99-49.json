McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, in part because of concerns that the needs of homeless people were not being met through existing assistance programs. Although previous legislation had responded to homeless people\u2019s needs for food and shelter, the McKinney Act was the first comprehensive law designed to address the diverse needs of homeless people. The act encompassed both existing and new programs, including those providing emergency food and shelter, those offering longer-term housing and supportive services, and those designed to demonstrate effective approaches for providing homeless people with other services, such as physical and mental health care, education, and job training.", "Over the years, some of the original McKinney Act programs were consolidated or eliminated, and some new programs were added. Today, homeless people receive assistance through these programs, as well as through other federal programs that were not authorized under the McKinney Act but are nevertheless specifically targeted to serve homeless people. In addition, assistance is potentially available to the homeless through nontargeted programs designed for low-income people generally. Yet despite the assistance available through these various sources, homelessness persists. Concerned that the federal approach to meeting the needs of homeless people may not be effective, seven Senate Committee and Subcommittee Chairmen asked us to conduct a series of studies on this issue. In this first study, we agreed to (1) identify and describe characteristics of the federal programs specifically targeted, or reserved, for the homeless, and the key nontargeted programs available to assist low-income people generally; (2) identify the amounts and types of funding for these programs in fiscal year 1997; and (3) determine if federal agencies have coordinated their efforts to assist homeless people and developed outcome measures for their targeted programs. We included key nontargeted programs, such as the Food Stamp Program, Medicaid, and Head Start, if they (1) were means tested and had reported annual obligations of $100 million or more, (2) included homelessness as a criterion of eligibility, (3) provided services similar to those offered by targeted programs, or (4) were considered by agency officials to be critical in meeting the needs of the homeless. Because other programs that can serve homeless people did not meet these criteria, this report does not include all programs that can serve homeless people."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (P.L. 100-77, July 1987) was the first comprehensive federal law designed to assist the homeless.", "Although the McKinney Act authorized a number of direct assistance programs to provide shelter and support services for the homeless, it did not consolidate the funding for or administration of these programs. It did, however, establish the Interagency Council on the Homeless to promote coordination. Originally, the Council was authorized by the Congress as an independent council with its own funding, full-time executive director, and staff. Its members were the heads of 12 Cabinet departments (or their designees), the heads of several other designated agencies, and the heads of other federal entities as determined by the Council. In 1994, however, because of congressional concern that the Council was not effectively coordinating a streamlined federal approach to homelessness, funds were not appropriated for the Council and it became a voluntary working group under the President\u2019s Domestic Policy Council. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) currently staffs the Council with a part-time executive director, two professional staff, and one clerical staff and provides administrative funding.", "Entitlements, such as for the Food Stamp Program, are under the control of authorizing committees and, under the appropriations process, are mandatory. A direct payment is financial assistance that the federal government provides directly to recipients who satisfy federal eligibility requirements, without placing any restrictions on how the recipients spend the money. According to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, formula grants are federal funds typically allocated to a state or one of its subdivisions in accordance with a distribution formula prescribed by law or administrative regulation, for activities of a continuing nature not confined to a specific project. Project grants are provided for a fixed or known period for a specific project or for the delivery of specific services or products. Nonprofit organizations and other entities usually apply directly to agencies to receive funding for these specific types of services.", "The Results Act establishes a formal process for holding federal agencies accountable for their programs\u2019 performance. It requires these agencies to develop (1) long-term (generally 5-year) strategic plans, the first of which were due to the Congress by September 30, 1997, and (2) annual performance plans, the first of which covered fiscal year 1999 and were submitted to the Congress in the spring of 1998. The annual performance plans are to (1) identify annual performance goals and measures for each of an agency\u2019s program activities, including those that cut across agency lines; (2) discuss the strategies and resources needed to achieve annual performance goals; and (3) explain what procedures the agency will use to verify and validate its performance data.

In some instances, different programs may offer the same types of services. Some of the targeted programs are available to the general homeless population, while others are reserved for specific groups within this population, such as children and youth or veterans.

For example, six agencies operate programs that offer food and nutrition services, five agencies administer education programs (or programs that have an educational component), and four agencies administer housing assistance programs that can serve homeless people.", "As table 1 shows, 16 of the 50 programs we identified are targeted, or designed exclusively for homeless people. Thirty-four programs are nontargeted, or designed for a broader group of people with low incomes and/or special needs, such as disabilities or HIV/AIDS. While this broader group may include homeless people, information on the number served is generally not available. Because eligibility for the nontargeted programs is based on income or other criteria unrelated to homelessness, the programs generally do not\u2014and are not required to\u2014track data on the number of homeless persons served. A few nontargeted programs are, however, beginning to collect such data. For example, USDA\u2019s Summer Food Service Program tracks the average number of children who receive meals at shelters for the homeless during the summer, and HUD\u2019s Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program collects data on the number of homeless people served. A chart of the 50 programs and their eligible services appears in appendix I, while detailed information about the programs appears in appendix II.", "In addition, federal agencies and advocacy groups identified other resources and activities that can assist the homeless. While these activities are also important, we did not include them in our list of 50 programs. Some of the activities require little or no extra resources. For example, the Department of Energy provides insulation to qualifying homeless shelter dwellings, and USDA\u2019s Rural Housing Service, HUD, and VA make foreclosed properties available to nonprofit organizations for housing homeless people. More information on these resources and activities is included in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs Offer a Wide Range of Services, Many of Which Appear Similar", "paragraphs": ["As table 2 indicates, both targeted and nontargeted programs can offer a variety of services that often appear similar. For example, four agencies administer 23 different programs (11 targeted and 12 nontargeted) that provide some type of housing assistance, including emergency shelter, transitional housing, and other housing assistance.", "Similarly, six agencies administer 26 programs (11 targeted and 15 nontargeted) that deliver food and nutrition services. For example, USDA provides food and nutrition services ranging from funding for school lunches and breakfasts to food stamps, while FEMA funds the distribution of groceries to food pantries and food banks. Of the 50 programs, 10 (5 targeted and 5 nontargeted) provide assistance to prevent homelessness. For example, FEMA\u2019s targeted Emergency Food and Shelter Program and HHS\u2019 nontargeted Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program can provide rental assistance to prevent evictions, which could lead to homelessness. HUD\u2019s nontargeted HOPWA program also provides short-term assistance to cover rent, mortgage and/or utility payments to prevent homelessness. However, the existence of programs that offer similar services does not necessarily mean that there is duplication because the particular services provided by each program may differ. For example, USDA\u2019s Homeless Children Nutrition Program focuses on providing food services throughout the year to homeless children in emergency shelters, while VA\u2019s Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program provides food only to veterans who are involved with that program at a given time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Programs Serve the Homeless Population as a Whole, While Others Target Subgroups", "paragraphs": ["Some of the targeted programs are available to the general homeless population, while others are reserved for specific groups within this population.

As table 3 indicates, four of the targeted programs, including HUD\u2019s Supportive Housing Program and FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food and Shelter Program, serve the homeless population as a whole. Five targeted programs, such as Education\u2019s Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, serve only homeless children and youth, and four other targeted programs, such as VA\u2019s Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program, serve only homeless veterans.

Over three-fourths of the funding for the targeted programs, such as the Health Care for the Homeless and Supportive Housing programs, is provided through project grants, which are allocated to service providers. Most of the remainder for targeted programs is allocated to states and local governments through formula grants. Of the amount spent for targeted programs, about 70 percent was for programs administered by HUD.", "Roughly $215 billion in obligations was reported for nontargeted programs that serve people with low incomes, who may be homeless. Information is not available on how much of the funding for nontargeted programs is used to assist homeless people. However, a significant portion of the funding for nontargeted programs does not go to serving the homeless. As figure 1 shows, in fiscal year 1997, about 64 percent of the nontargeted funding is for Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and TANF, which are primarily intended for families, the disabled, or the elderly, rather than able-bodied single men. However, single men make up the majority of the homeless population. About 20 percent of the funding for nontargeted programs is provided through formula grants. These grants are flexible funding sources that can be used to serve the general homeless population. The remainder of the funding for nontargeted programs consists of direct payments for the Food Stamp Program and project grants for several programs whose services are generally available to the homeless. The reported obligations for each program for fiscal years 1995-98 are shown in appendix V.", "While the funding for nontargeted programs can be used to benefit the homeless, the agencies generally do not, and are not required to, track or report what portion is used for this purpose. Although HHS does not track the dollar value of the benefits that homeless people receive through its nontargeted programs, the Secretary informed the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, in an October 1997 letter, that HHS provides \u201cbillions of dollars worth of resources\u201d to meet the needs of low-income people, including the homeless, through large block grants, such as TANF, as well as through other programs for delivering mental, primary, and children\u2019s health care services and for preventing substance abuse and domestic violence. Officials at other agencies, such as VA and Education, emphasized that their programs are available to all who qualify, including the homeless, but said that they have not tried to determine how much of the funding for their programs is used to serve the homeless. Officials also said that although their nontargeted programs appear to have sufficient resources, they are sometimes unable to serve all those who are eligible. For example, Labor\u2019s Director of Operations and Programs said that the Department is not able to serve all who qualify for its Job Training Partnership programs. Similarly, an official with USDA\u2019s Commodity Supplemental Food Program\u2014which provides food, such as peanut butter, to certain low-income groups\u2014said resources depend on each fiscal year\u2019s appropriation, which determines the number of caseload slots that are available in each state. Once the slots are filled, no additional persons can be served."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Procedures May Affect Efforts to Assist Homeless People", "paragraphs": ["About 20 percent of the funding for nontargeted programs is provided through formula grants, which are typically distributed to the states according to a formula, and the states decide how to spend these funds within federal guidelines. Compared with some project grants, formula grants are broader in scope, generally receive more funds, and offer greater discretion in the use of funds. These funds can then be used for a variety of activities within a broad functional area, such as social services or mental health services. The flexibility inherent in some formula grant programs, such as HUD\u2019s HOPWA program, allows states and localities to define and implement programs\u2014that may or may not include services for the homeless\u2014in response to their particular needs. Although service providers who receive these funds often cannot identify their source, since the funds flow through the state and/or local government, the providers appreciate the steady flow of funds. However, some service providers expressed concern that because of the flexible nature of formula grant programs, vulnerable populations, such as the homeless, are rarely guaranteed a measure of assistance, posing a problem in communities that do not place a priority on spending for the homeless.", "In contrast to nontargeted programs, targeted programs are likely to be funded through project grants. Nine of the 16 targeted programs are funded through such grants, while 5 are funded through formula grants. Two of VA\u2019s programs receive funding through the agency\u2019s Mental Health Strategic Healthcare Group, which provides the funds directly to VA medical centers for the programs. Project grants enable nonprofit organizations and service providers to apply directly to federal agencies to receive funding for specific types of services offered exclusively to the homeless population; however, funding is often limited and programs are not offered at all locations. For example, VA\u2019s Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program offered resources to VA facilities that chose to implement the program, but the Department does not require all of its facilities to provide domiciliary care for homeless veterans. According to a June 1997 VA report, only 35 of VA\u2019s 173 hospitals offered this program. In addition, the agency\u2019s Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans program is not available in every state or locality with a significant number of eligible homeless veterans. According to a 1995 HUD study, the unpredictability of competitive grant funding levels and the varying lengths of grant awards are not consistent with a long-term strategy for eliminating homelessness. In addition, the types of projects eligible for funding may be poorly matched to local needs, and differing eligibility and reporting requirements across agencies present administrative complications for service providers who receive funds from multiple project grants. HUD has sought to minimize the disadvantages associated with project grants by consolidating the process of applying for its programs to assist the homeless. HUD also requires community service providers to collaborate through its Continuum of Care approach, discussed later in this report. State coordinators and local providers of services for the homeless in Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., identified HUD\u2019s targeted programs, as well as a few of HUD\u2019s nontargeted programs, as the ones they used most frequently to meet their state and local funding needs.

Coordination can take place through (1) the Interagency Council on the Homeless, which brings together representatives of federal agencies that administer programs or resources that can be used to alleviate homelessness; (2) jointly administered programs and policies adopted by some agencies to encourage coordination; and (3) compliance with guidance on implementing the Results Act, which requires federal agencies to identify crosscutting responsibilities, specify in their strategic plans how they will work together to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, and develop appropriate performance measures for evaluating their programs\u2019 results. Although coordination is occurring, agencies have not yet taken full advantage of the Results Act\u2019s potential as a coordinating mechanism to do much more than identify crosscutting responsibilities.

The full Council, consisting of the Cabinet Secretaries or other high-level administrators, has not met since March 1996. However, the Council\u2019s policy group is scheduled to meet every 2 months. Between December 1997 and November 1998, the policy group met four times, and staff from various agencies attended one or more of the meetings. Among other things, the policy group is coordinating a major survey of homeless assistance providers and clients. Other activities include discussing efforts to periodically distribute a list of federal resources available to assist homeless people; coordinating the distribution of surplus real property on base closure property, as well as the distribution of surplus blankets; and conducting a round table discussion with representatives of major homeless advocacy groups. Recently, the group has discussed the need to better connect targeted homeless assistance programs with nontargeted programs that provide housing, health care, income, and social services. While such responses to immediate issues and exchanges of information are useful, Council staff and the executive directors of two major homeless advocacy groups believe that the Council lost much of its influence after the Congress stopped its funding in 1994 and it became a voluntary working group.

For example, VA and HUD officials collaborate on referring appropriate homeless veterans to local housing authorities for certain Section 8 rental assistance vouchers. FEMA and the Department of Defense work together to make unmarketable but edible food available to assistance providers, and Education collaborates with HHS to provide services to elementary and secondary school children through HHS\u2019 Runaway and Homeless Youth and Education\u2019s Education for Homeless Children and Youth programs. Labor and VA also collaborate to provide services that are intended to increase the employability of homeless veterans. USDA has developed a multipurpose application form for free and reduced-price meals provided through its children\u2019s nutrition programs that allows households applying for meal benefits to indicate that they want information on HHS\u2019 State Children\u2019s Health Insurance program and Medicaid.", "Some agencies, such as HUD and VA, have adopted policies that encourage coordination between service providers at the local level. For example, HUD\u2019s Continuum of Care policy promotes coordination by encouraging service providers to take advantage of programs offered by other agencies, as well as other HUD programs. This policy, which is designed to shift attention from individual programs or projects to communitywide strategies for solving the problem of homelessness, can be used to leverage services from many sources in a community, according to HUD. HUD\u2019s Continuum of Care strategy grew out of a 1994 Interagency Council report that proposed to address the diverse needs of homeless people. According to the report, these needs include (1) outreach and needs assessments, (2) emergency shelters with appropriate supportive services, (3) transitional housing with appropriate supportive services, and (4) permanent housing. The report recommended consolidating HUD\u2019s McKinney Act programs and FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food and Shelter Program into a single HUD block grant. VA, under its nationwide Community Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups program (CHALENG), began hosting meetings to bring together public and private providers of assistance to determine the met and unmet needs of homeless veterans and to identify the assistance available from non-VA providers.

Few performance plans contain evidence of substantive coordination, and none discusses coordination with nontargeted programs to decrease overlaps or fill gaps in services. For example, HUD\u2019s 1999 performance plan indicates that the Department will work with other federal agencies to promote self-sufficiency but does not identify all the departments or programs through which it will do so. This finding is not surprising in view of the time and effort required to coordinate crosscutting programs\u2014an issue we have discussed in reviewing federal agencies\u2019 implementation of the Results Act. In general, we have found that agencies have made inconsistent progress in coordinating crosscutting programs.", "Given the large number of programs that can assist the homeless and the multiple agencies that administer them, increased coordination\u2014 including, ultimately, the development of common outcome measures\u2014could strengthen the agencies\u2019 management.

For example, Education established process measures, but not outcome measures, for its Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. Its measures include proposing changes to state and local laws to remove obstacles to the education of homeless children and youth and reducing barriers to school enrollment, such as lack of immunizations and transportation. Additionally, HHS\u2019 Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program has an output measure that will encourage at least 70 percent of participating state and local PATH-funded agencies to offer outreach services. Output measures also appear in HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance plan. Among these are increasing the number of transitional beds linked to supportive services. This emphasis on output measures is consistent with the results of our reviews of agencies\u2019 annual performance plans as a whole. In these reviews, we also found that the plans did not consistently contain results-oriented goals.", "Some agencies did develop outcome measures, while others said that they planned to include outcome measures in future performance plans for their targeted programs. Other agencies believe that developing such measures would be too difficult. For example, Labor established an outcome measure for its targeted Homeless Veterans Reintegration program\u2014helping 1,800 homeless veterans find jobs. HUD also included an outcome measure in its plan\u2014the percentage of homeless people who move each year from HUD transitional housing to permanent housing. This measure may vary from year to year, depending on the resources available for the program. Finally, according to VA\u2019s Director for Homeless Programs, the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s performance plan for fiscal year 2000 includes two outcome measures for veterans who have completed residential care in targeted VA programs. These measures set goals for the percentages of veterans who (1) are housed in their own apartment, room, or house upon discharge from residential treatment and (2) are employed upon discharge from residential treatment. USDA has not created outcome measures for its Homeless Children Nutrition program because it believes that the limited nature of the program would make the effort too difficult. In a summary of its fiscal year 1999 performance plan, HHS said that measures of output and process are more practical and realistic than outcome measures, particularly for annual assessments of programs that affect people. HHS also said that for many health and human service programs, it is unrealistic to expect meaningful changes in people\u2019s lives because of an individual program. In our assessment of HHS\u2019 plan, we noted that future plans would be more useful and would better meet the purposes of the Results Act if HHS made greater use of outcome goals and measures, instead of output or process goals.
