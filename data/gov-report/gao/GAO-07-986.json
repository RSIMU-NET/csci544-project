Once the $500 million was spent, SSA began to use its general appropriation to fund the remaining costs of implementing MMA activities. SSA used its cost analysis system to track the total costs of its implementation of MMA activities. As of February 20, 2007, SSA had completed implementation of 16 of the 22 tasks for the six provisions under the act. SSA had agencywide policies and procedures in place for its cost tracking and allocation, asset accountability, and invoice review processes. It also established specific guidance to assign and better allocate SSA's costs in implementing MMA. There were some instances though where SSA did not comply with these policies and procedures. SSA did not effectively communicate the specific MMA-related guidance to all affected staff. SSA subsequently identified and corrected at least $4.6 million of costs that initially were incorrectly allocated to MMA, but had not corrected approximately $313,000 misallocated credit card purchase transactions. In addition, GAO found instances where accountable assets purchased with MMA funds, such as electronic and computer equipment, were not being properly tracked by SSA in accordance with its policies and instances where purchase card transactions were not properly supported.

SSA continues to have a role in  the outreach to low-income Medicare beneficiaries for payment of  Medicare cost-sharing under the Medicaid program. SSA is also required to  verify the eligibility of applicants for the subsidy under MMA who self- certify their income, resources, and family size. To determine whether a  Medicare beneficiary is eligible for a subsidy, SSA collects information on  whether the individual has income up to 150 percent of the federal poverty  guidelines. SSA has established a database to maintain the information it  collects and shares information on those eligible and ineligible for  subsidies with CMS.", "To implement the new responsibilities under MMA, SSA established a  Medicare Prescription Drug Planning and Implementation Task Force in  December 2003. The objectives of the task force included identifying the  potentially eligible population, the number and locations of potential  workloads and staff and material resource needs, and agreeing on specific  responsibilities with other federal government agencies. SSA also  identified the specific tasks to carry out the implementation of the  activities for each of the provisions under MMA, including designing and  managing the planning and implementation processes; issuing regulations;  and developing and implementing communication strategies, budget,  appeals process, subsidy-changing event process, redetermination  process, and strategies for service delivery.", "Under MMA, the Congress provided SSA with a $500 million appropriation  to fund SSA\u2019s start-up administrative costs to implement MMA, during  fiscal years 2004 and 2005, but later extended this budget authority to  fiscal year 2006. SSA reported that the $500 million for these  administrative costs was exhausted in January 2006, and MMA costs are  now funded using the LAE. LAE is SSA\u2019s basic administrative account and  is an annual appropriation financed from the Social Security and Medicare  trust funds.", "The total amount of SSA administrative costs covered by the Medicare  Trust Funds to fund SSA\u2019s Medicare responsibilities has increased with the  enactment of MMA. Prior to the establishment of Part D under MMA,  Medicare did not generally pay for outpatient prescription drugs, but it did  provide health insurance to individuals who are either 65 or older or  disabled.

SSA\u2019s financial reports showed that almost all of the funding  reported was used for personnel-related expenses, contractors, and  indirect costs (see table 2). More than half of the funds were spent on  personnel-related expenses for staff hours used on MMA activities at SSA\u2019s  headquarters and field offices. Once the $500 million was spent, MMA  costs were funded by SSA\u2019s LAE appropriation. SSA used its financial  accounting and reporting system, SSOARS, and its cost analysis system  (CAS) to track overall costs related to the implementation of MMA  legislation. SSA did not separately track the administrative costs incurred  to implement the individual provisions under MMA legislation because the  act did not specifically require SSA to do so and it was not cost effective to  do so.", "SSA reported that it spent approximately $261 million on personnel-related  expenses, which consisted of salaries and related benefits for both newly  hired and existing SSA employees. As a result of MMA, SSA hired and  trained more than 2,200 new employees at its field offices and 500 at  headquarters to handle the additional workload created by SSA\u2019s new  responsibilities under MMA. Personnel-related expenses included salaries  for current SSA employees who were also involved in activities related to  implementing MMA, including the new Medicare Part D responsibilities.  Many of these employees may have been engaged in work on other SSA  programs during the same time. SSA used CAS to prorate these employees\u2019  salaries and related expenses based on the amount of time employees  charged to MMA and various other SSA responsibilities.", "SSA reported indirect costs of approximately $117 million for MMA  implementation. During each year, SSA incurred administrative costs in  support of the various programs. For example, SSA makes rental payments  for most of the approximately 1,300 regional field offices it has located  around the country and staff in these offices perform duties related to all  of the programs administered by SSA, including MMA. In order to allocate  these administrative costs to each of its programs, SSA used its cost  analysis system, CAS, to charge certain types of costs either proportionally  or in full against the MMA appropriation. SSA charges both direct and  indirect costs to its programs either by directly charging specific program- related amounts to the affected program in SSOARS or using CAS to  allocate personnel-related and general administrative costs that apply to  more than one SSA program. CAS accounts for work-years and costs for  each program administered by SSA by specific subfunctions within the  SSA programs. It is a centralized, computer-based system that uses data  from the financial reporting system to break out costs at SSA by program  and major functions. The main objective of CAS is to distribute costs  equitably across programs and among the various trust funds and general  funds. However, SSA stated that systems modifications to enable tracking  MMA administrative costs by each of the MMA provisions were not  required by the legislation and that it would not have been cost effective to  modify the system.", "SSA reported that $119.6 million in MMA funds went to contractors,  vendors, and other government agencies that provided various goods and  services necessary for SSA to meet its responsibilities under MMA. Some  of the largest reported expenditures included    $34.2 million paid to one contractor for software systems development    $23 million paid to one contractor for telephone-based beneficiary  outreach and information distribution;    $18.6 million to the United States Postal Service for mass mailings and  other paper-based information distribution;    $11.4 million to one contractor for computer hardware and software    $6.5 million to the Government Printing Office for the design and  production of informational mailings, posters, and other printed  materials.", "The remaining expenditures to other contractors, vendors, and  government agencies for goods and services charged to the MMA  implementation appropriation included additional computer hardware,  software development, and information systems support, as well as  installation and reconfiguration of MMA service centers workstations.", "As of February 2007, SSA reported it had completed 16 of the 22 tasks for  implementing six provisions of MMA.

Some of these misallocations  were subsequently detected by SSA and corrected during SSA\u2019s review  process. In the area of purchase card transactions, which represented   0.5 percent of the $500 million, we found some instances where credit card  purchases had not yet been correctly allocated to MMA. In addition, we  found that some purchases made with credit cards were not properly  supported or reviewed and may not have been a proper use of MMA funds.

In  addition, SSA developed specific cost accounting principles for each of its  major offices which, when appropriately applied, would enable the offices  to allocate nonpersonnel costs among MMA-related activities and across  other SSA operating activities. However, the lack of a formal process to  ensure that this critical information was communicated to the appropriate  level within the SSA offices resulted in misallocation of costs to MMA.", "In January 2004, SSA initiated a process to expand on its cost accounting  process to track and report the cost of implementing the MMA-related  activities. The Deputy Commissioner for Finance, Assessment, and  Management issued a series of three memoranda to senior officials  containing policies and procedures for reporting time spent and updating  cost accounting principles associated with MMA planning and  implementation efforts. These memoranda included accounting codes and  procedures for tracking costs specific to implementing MMA activities,  reporting formats for MMA-related costs, and updated cost accounting  principles for LAE and MMA allocations.", "In May 2005 the Deputy Commissioner for Finance, Assessment, and  Management issued a memorandum to the deputy commissioners and  other key officers for all SSA offices, which reemphasized the need to  properly account for MMA-related costs, provided updated cost  accounting principles for costs associated with the planning and  implementation of MMA, and requested SSA-wide assistance in accurately  applying these principles. The updated cost accounting principles were  included in a table that was attached to the memorandum. The table  provided specific guidance for each office on the cost principle  methodology to apply for specific types of costs in order to allocate the  costs between the component\u2019s regular resource allocations and the MMA  funding. In addition, the memorandum requested that each component  identify an individual who would aid in ensuring these principles were  appropriately applied.", "We met with SSA staff to discuss the policies and procedures in place to  disseminate these critical memoranda within SSA. We found that not all  staff responsible for MMA activities were aware of the guidance. We were  told that there was no specific guidance related to the dissemination of  key management memoranda. The May 2005 memorandum was addressed  to the deputy commissioners of each of SSA\u2019s major offices, and it clearly  stated the importance of applying the principles described. We obtained  information and documentation from the individuals identified as the  contact employee for each component to aid in the effort.

Our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  for an entity to run and control its operations, it must have relevant,  reliable, and timely communications relating to internal as well as external  events. Information is needed throughout the agency to achieve its internal  control objectives. Operating information is also needed to determine  whether the agency is achieving its compliance requirements under  various laws and regulations. Pertinent information should be identified,  captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to  perform their duties efficiently. Effective communications should occur in  a broad sense with information flowing down, across, and up through the  organization.", "As a result of the ineffective communication of MMA-related guidance, at  least $4.6 million of costs were initially incorrectly allocated to MMA.  SSA\u2019s offices went through a process to review the allocation of the  charges between MMA and LAE appropriation activities, and make  appropriate adjustments. The offices identified numerous transactions and  adjusted the transaction amounts to reflect the appropriate allocation of  costs between MMA and the LAE appropriation. In total they identified  transactions totaling more than $4.6 million that had not initially been  properly allocated to LAE. However, SSA officials agreed that they had  probably not identified all of the transactions that had not been properly  allocated and should have been adjusted, such as purchase card  purchases.", "In addition, during our review of the supporting documentation of MMA  purchase card transactions, we found 48 purchases totaling $375,313 that  had been charged entirely to MMA when a portion of those costs should  have been allocated to other SSA programs. The purchases included more  than 160 digital projectors, furniture, and other IT equipment such as  routers, servers, and tape libraries. While some of these items were  initially purchased to carry out MMA-related activities, such as beneficiary  outreach, SSA realized that they would also be used for SSA programs  other than MMA in the future. Therefore, according to the guidance on  accounting for MMA-related expenses, the offices should have charged  only one-sixth of the costs for equipment to MMA, with the remainder of  the cost charged to the LAE appropriation account to be further allocated  across other SSA programs.

Without effective internal control, management  does not have adequate assurance that fraudulent, improper, and abusive  purchases are being prevented or, if occurring, are being promptly  detected with appropriate corrective actions taken. Supervisory approval  of purchase requests is a principal means of ensuring that only valid  transactions are initiated or entered into by persons acting within the  scope of their authority, and the proper amounts are paid to contractors  and appropriately charged. A supervisory review of purchase requests is  also critical because a supervisor or approving official may be the only  person other than the purchaser who would be in a position to identify an  inappropriate purchase.

SSA stated its belief that our  recommendation was too broad and its guidance for contracting officers  and micro-purchasers is sufficient.

On the basis of the clean audit opinion on SSA\u2019s  financial statements and no related findings, we did not perform testing on  the payroll and cost accounting areas. As a result, we focused our testing  of transactions on contractor and vendor payments.", "To determine whether SSA\u2019s contractor expenditures were properly  supported as valid uses of MMA funds, we selected and tested a monetary  unit sample of 59 transactions totaling $82.6 million from a population of  20,736 transactions totaling $123.5 million paid from January 2004 through  February 2006. We found no exceptions during testing. We also used  various nonstatistical sampling methods (data mining, document analysis,  and other forensic techniques) to nonstatistically select 208 transactions  to test adequate supporting documentation of requests, authorization,  evidence of purchase and receipt, and applicability to MMA. We discussed  all testing exceptions with the appropriate SSA officials and staff involved  with the specific transaction.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Md., from  March 2006 through April 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Comments from the Social  Security Administration  COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO) DRAFT  REPORT, \"SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION:  POLICIES AND  PROCEDURES WERE IN PLACE OVER MMA SPENDING, BUT INSTANCES OF  NONCOMPLIANCE OCCURRED\u201d (GAO-07-986)", "Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the draft report.  We feel that the  title \u201cPolicies and Procedures Were in Place Over MMA Spending, but Instances of  Noncompliance Occurred,\u201d does not accurately reflect the findings in the report and would  recommend that it be changed to \u201cPolicies and Procedures Were In Place Over MMA  Spending And There Was Compliance\u201d.", "Also, the summary page and pages 3, 12 and 13 of the report state that \u201cSSA subsequently  identified and corrected at least $4.6 million of amounts  misallocated between MMA  and other SSA program activities, but had not corrected approximately $313,000 misallocated  credit card purchase transactions.\u201d  The fact is that $4.6 million was initially not correctly  allocated to MMA.  However, the original plan on allocation was to review the ongoing  transactions to assure policy consistency.  That being said, the $4.6 million was correctly  allocated as planned.  As a result, the statement on page 10 that the \u201cineffective  communications resulted in millions of dollars of costs being misallocated to MMA\u201d needs to  be appropriately modified.  Also, no mention is made that the $313,000 in misallocated credit  card purchase transactions represents only 0.06 percent of the total amount appropriated.", "Our comments on the draft report recommendations, along with technical revisions to assist in  the clarity of the report, are as follows:    Establish procedures to ensure better dissemination of policies and procedures to all relevant  offices and staff.", "We agree in theory.  As the recommendation exists, we do not feel it accurately reflects what  needs to be done and find it too broad.  In reference to memoranda regarding accounting for  costs, rather than establishing specific procedures, which would require interpretation by staff,  future memorandum providing guidance similar to that issued for MMA implementation will  contain specific instructions for distribution.", "With respect to acquisition policy, we believe that we have already established sufficient  dissemination methods for acquisition related issues.  Our Office of Acquisition and Grants  (OAG) uses Acquisition Alerts to disseminate policy related to micro-purchasers (and, when  noted, to all persons with delegated acquisition authority).  Additionally, we have established  an email distribution list consisting of project officers, who are requestors for purchases at  various dollar levels, in order to better disseminate policies and procedures applicable to  them.", "Establish additional detailed procedures for purchase card supporting documentation review and  approval process to help ensure that purchase card payments are properly supported, allowable,  and allocated.", "We disagree.  With respect to the policies and procedures directed to micro-purchasers and  contracting officers (not requestors), we do not concur with this recommendation and find it  too broad.  Contracting officers (COs) are already aware of the file documentation required  for their purchases, whether paid with the purchase card or otherwise.  We believe that our  current guidance, \u201cMicro-purchasing in SSA,\u201d contains sufficient information for micro- purchasers and their approving officials regarding file documentation and retention.  Micro- purchasers and approving officials must take this course prior to being appointed and,  beginning in fiscal year 2008, they will be required to take refresher training every three  years.", "Additionally, OAG and regional COs conduct acquisition management reviews (AMRs) of  micro-purchase activity.  When OAG conducts reviews of purchases made by micro- purchasers in Headquarters, and when regional COs conduct on-site AMRs within their  regions, we review the purchase log and the file documentation associated with the purchases.   OAG also conducts \u201cremote\u201d AMRs of purchases made in the regions.  These remote reviews  currently do not entail a review of an entire contract file.  We are currently considering  altering this process to request, for select cases, that the cardholder under review send us a  copy of all the file documentation related to the purchase being reviewed.", "Regarding the issue of proper allocation of purchase card transactions, we will review this  area with the appropriate component officials.", "Reinforce existing policies and procedures for accountable assets purchased to help ensure that  accountable assets are bar coded, recorded in SSA\u2019s asset inventory system, and inventoried  periodically.", "We agree.  As previously stated, we will add this policy to the \u201cAcquisition Special Topics\u201d  webpage on the OAG intranet page.  A notice and other cross-references to this permanent  location of the policy will be disseminated via Acquisition Alerts and Acquisition Updates. We anticipate completing this by the end of September 2007.", "With regard to accountable assets and related policies, since December 2006, our Office of  Publications and Logistics Management have undertaken actions to reinforce existing policies  and procedures and to implement an improvement work plan.  These include:   Entering into collaborative agreements with our Operations and Systems components  to establish mechanisms for correcting Property Management issues and policies;   Developing a new User\u2019s Guide for the Sunflower Asset System (SFA), our Property  Management System.  The new guide contains not only the \u201chow\u201d but also the \u201cwhy\u201d  to give users a better understanding of Property Management;   Reviewing and revising internal policy guides, Administrative Instructions Manual  Systems (AIMS Guides);   Developing stronger lines of communication with employees responsible for property  management (e.g., established a Quarterly Property Management Teleconference,  updated and distributed news letters on Property Management, offered Sunflower  training sessions, website updates, etc.);   Updating and clarifying the listing of \u201cItems to be Bar-coded\u201d; and    Continuing to reinforce the importance of asset accountability and management.", "Finally, for the 317 assets noted on page 13 of the report, we have requested GAO provide us  specific asset details to assure our inventory system includes the required information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["The following team members made key contributions to this report:  Steven R.
