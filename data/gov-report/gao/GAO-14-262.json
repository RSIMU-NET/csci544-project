Russell National School  Lunch Act (NSLA)\u2014established the National School Lunch Program  (NSLP), and in 1966 the Child Nutrition Act established the School  Breakfast Program (SBP). These programs provide reimbursement to  school districts and independent schools based on the number of meals  served that meet certain federal requirements. Any child may purchase a  meal through the NSLP or SBP; however, depending on household  income, children may be eligible for reduced-price or free meals. The  NSLP and SBP have the same eligibility requirements\u2014families with  incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible  for free meals, and those with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of  the federal poverty level are eligible for reduced-price meals.

All schools participating in the NSLP or SBP must make free and reduced-price meals available to eligible  children. Individual student or household eligibility for free or reduced- price meals is determined by school-district review of applications  submitted by households or through a process referred to as \u201cdirect  certification.\u201d Under direct certification, state agencies provide school  districts with a list of students whose households receive certain public- assistance benefits, such as through the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP), and school districts confer eligibility for free  school meals to these students. Thus, participants are automatically  certified for school-meals benefits without having to fill out a separate  school-meals application. Students receiving certain public-assistance  benefits or meeting an approved designation, such as if they are  homeless or foster children, are categorically eligible for free-meal  benefits. Categorically eligible students can be certified into the school- meals program either through an application or direct certification.

Because our data were limited to federal-employee households  in 25 school districts that were selected on a nonrandom basis, the  results of our cases cannot be generalized to a larger population of  school-meals participants or to the entire federal workforce.", "Once we identified the sample, we contacted the school districts and the  states in our sample to obtain supporting documentation. For the 25  households that submitted a school-meals application, we requested and  reviewed the available applications from the 2010-2011 school year to  see what the applicant listed as his or her household income and  household size. We used the school-meals income-eligibility guidelines to  determine whether school districts correctly determined eligibility based  upon the information stated on the application. We also reviewed school- meals applications from the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years, if  submitted. For the 23 directly certified households, we obtained and  reviewed the public-assistance application associated with the household  from state agencies in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Texas, and  Virginia to see what the applicant listed as the household income and  composition.", "We then reviewed the payroll records of the applicant or other household  member to obtain information on their actual minimum income during the  period the application was signed and to determine whether the federal  employee\u2019s income stated on the school-meals or public-assistance  application was accurate. If the applicant\u2019s income, along with the income  of other household members listed on the application, exceeded the  eligibility guideline based on the number of household members stated on  the application, we considered these households to be potentially  ineligible for school-meals benefits.", "To conduct our investigative work, we interviewed individuals from the 48  households in our nongeneralizable sample\u201423 households that were  directly certified and 25 that applied for benefits. We interviewed these  individuals to determine whether the information entered on the  applications was accurate, to confirm their income, and to determine the  composition of their households. Investigators also conducted a review of  the associated payroll records and school-meals application or public- assistance application to inform the interviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to May 2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We conducted our related  investigative work from June 2013 to May 2014 in accordance with  standards prescribed by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity  and Efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Benefits Based on Eligibility in the School-Meals Programs", "paragraphs": ["Schools and households that enroll students in free or reduced-price  school meals may be eligible for additional federal and state benefits. For  example, the U.S. Department of Education, through Title I of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act, provided approximately $13.8  billion in funds to schools with high concentrations of low-income families  during fiscal year 2013. The distribution of federal Title I funds within  schools and school districts can be based, in part, on the number of  students eligible for free and reduced-price meals. In addition, separate  state funding for schools can also be tied to the percentage of students  eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Further, the Universal  Service Program for Schools and Libraries, also known as the E-rate  program\u2014created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996\u2014provides  schools with discounts on eligible telecommunications services, Internet  access, and internal connections (such as network wiring). Discounts  can range from 20 to 90 percent, and the primary measure for  determining the discount is the percentage of students eligible under the  National School Lunch Program (NSLP) for free or reduced-price meals.", "Households can also receive additional benefits by participating in the  school-meals programs. For example, the Lifeline Program, administered  by the Universal Service Administration Company on behalf of the  Federal Communications Commission, provides phone service discounts  for households that participate in the NSLP or other qualifying assistance  programs. We reviewed guidance from one school district that provides  other benefits to households qualifying for free or reduced-price meals,  including textbook assistance, and waiving college application fees and  athletic fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Responsibilities of the Food and Nutrition Service, State Agencies, and School Districts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Sample School-Meals Household Application", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comparison between Federal and Private-Sector Employees", "paragraphs": ["According to a January 2012 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Report,  in 2010, 1.7 percent of the U.S. workforce was made up of federal civilian  employees\u2014approximately 2.3 million compared to 111 million that were  employed by the private sector and 20 million employed by state and  local governments. Another 800,000 are employed by government  enterprises that typically pay for employee compensation through the sale  of services rather than through tax revenue, the United States Postal  Service (USPS) being the largest such employer. Further, federal  employees can be both part-time and intermittent, such as census  enumerators, whose jobs last from 2 to 8 weeks.", "According to CBO\u2019s study, employees of the federal government have  varying levels of educational attainment. For example, about 50 percent  of federal employees have either a high-school diploma or less or, at  most, some college, compared to about 70 percent of the private-sector  workforce. In the federal government, about 50 percent of employees  have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher education attainment, while in the  private sector about 30 percent of the workforce has comparable  education. The wages of federal versus private-sector employees vary  when considering level of education attained. In addition, CBO found that  federal civilian workers with no more than a high-school education earned  about 21 percent more, on average, than similar workers in the private  sector, while those with some college earned 15 percent more, on  average than similar workers in the private sector. Employees whose  highest level of education is a bachelor\u2019s degree earned roughly the same  hourly wage, on average, in the federal government as in the private  sector. Federal workers with a doctorate or professional degree earned  23 percent less per hour, on average than similar workers in the private  sector.", "While this CBO report does provide a point of comparison between  civilian federal workers and the private sector, the data analyzed do not  mirror the federal-employee population used in this report. For example,  the CBO report does not include workers in government enterprises,  including USPS, seasonal, or part-time civilian federal employees, while  our analysis does. Therefore, while the results of the CBO report are   presented for informational purposes, they should not be used to draw  conclusions about civilian federal-employee and USPS pay used in our  analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Heather Dunahoo (Assistant  Director), John W.
