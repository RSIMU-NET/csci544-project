Among other things, Plan Colombia proposed to reduce the cultivation of coca and the processing and distribution of narcotics by 50 percent over 6 years. To assist in this effort, in July 2000, the United States committed to providing about $1.3 billion to Colombia, other Andean countries, and U.S. agencies involved in drug interdiction and law enforcement, part of which was intended for alternative development. More recently, in January 2002, the  Andean Counterdrug Initiative was passed, which provides $625 million  for counternarcotics programs, including alternative development, in  Andean countries.", "Although coca cultivation in Bolivia and Peru has been reduced in recent  years, you expressed concern about whether the alternative development  program in Colombia will achieve its objectives and contribute to reducing  the production of illicit drugs there.

USAID has implemented a series of alternative  development projects in the coca-producing regions of these countries,while the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and State\u2019s Bureau for  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement have supported interdiction  and voluntary and forced coca eradication programs. Due at least in part  to these efforts, substantial reductions in coca cultivation were achieved  in Bolivia and Peru during the mid-to-late 1990s.

It  also enables the monitoring of compliance with voluntary eradication  agreements. To promote and sustain coca cultivation reductions, the host  government must have a strong commitment to carry out effective  interdiction and eradication policies. Without interdiction and eradication  as disincentives, growers are unlikely to abandon more lucrative and  easily cultivated coca crops in favor of less profitable and harder to grow  licit crops or to pursue legal employment. Further, alternative  development, interdiction, and eradication efforts must be carefully  coordinated to achieve mutually reinforcing benefits.", "Table 2 summarizes several of the key lessons learned in Bolivia and Peru.  Descriptions of the programs in Bolivia and Peru and more detailed  discussions of the lessons learned from them are in appendixes I and II,  respectively.", "Alternative development progress in Bolivia and Peru has required years  of sustained U.S. assistance. The United States has supported alternative  development projects in these countries for two decades.

Other U.S.  agencies have supported interdiction and eradication efforts in Bolivia and  Peru for an even longer period\u2014nearly three decades. In combination,  these programs have helped achieve reductions in the amount of coca  grown in these countries. Nonetheless, the host government agencies  involved in these efforts continue to depend heavily on U.S. support. For  example, according to USAID officials, the United States currently  finances and indirectly oversees most of the Bolivian government\u2019s  alternative development agencies in the Chapare region because the  Bolivian government does not have the resources to do so on its own.  Similarly, the United States provides 60 to 70 percent of the total funding  for the Peruvian alternative development agency, and USAID officials said  that the Peruvian government would not be able to fund the agency\u2019s  activities without U.S. support.

USAID\u2019s  current program emphasizes alternative development efforts in the coca- growing regions of southern Colombia to complement other U.S.- supported counternarcotics activities there. Alternative development  activities in both poppy- and coca-growing areas are just beginning.

To quickly launch these efforts,  USAID reallocated $1 million of the $10 million originally intended to  support poppy eradication to fund projects aimed at strengthening PNDA\u2019s  capacity to expand its activities in coca-growing areas. USAID\u2019s projects  targeted PNDA\u2019s information technology, financial accountability,  telecommunications systems, and public relations capabilities for  improvement.", "In April 2001, using Plan Colombia funds, USAID awarded an  $87.5 million, 5-year contract to Chemonics to oversee, administer, and  carry out alternative development activities in the coca-growing areas in  the Putumayo and Caqueta departments.

The program is intended to provide incentives for  small farmers (with 3 hectares or less of coca) to voluntarily eradicate  their coca plants. In negotiating the community pacts, PNDA  representatives met with groups of small farmers to obtain their  commitment to voluntarily eradicate the illicit crops. After an eradication  pact was signed, PNDA planned to provide the farmers with food crop  seeds and plants or other immediate assistance. Once this assistance  began, farmers were obliged to eradicate their illicit crops within 1 year.", "According to USAID officials, Colombian government officials recently  stated that most of the coca cultivation covered by the pacts already  agreed to should be voluntarily eradicated by the end of July 2002.", "As eradication progresses, farmers are to receive more comprehensive  assistance from USAID. Initial efforts are focused on municipalities in the  Putumayo, where USAID plans to support crop substitution and other  income-generating activities by providing agricultural incentives, modern  production and processing expertise, and credit and marketing assistance.  USAID also plans to support environmental improvements through tree- growing programs in remote indigenous and tropical areas and training in  pest control, forest management, and other areas. In addition, USAID  plans to improve the social infrastructure in project areas by enhancing  access to schools, health services, potable water, sewerage, and  electricity.", "In August 2001, USAID reported that its goal is the voluntary eradication of  11,500 hectares of coca grown on small farms by the end of 2002, with the  aim of eliminating a total of 30,000 hectares by 2005. USAID also reported  that approximately 33 community eradication pacts had been signed,  which covered more than 37,000 hectares of coca in the Putumayo  department. In its initial design plan, USAID also noted that sustainability  will be measured in terms of permanent eradication of coca and the  number of farm families permanently engaged in licit productive activities  and not returning to coca cultivation.", "USAID alternative development project activities have been limited to  date, and the pace is not expected to quicken significantly until 2002. As  illustrated in table 4, of the $10 million originally programmed to support  poppy eradication and institutional strengthening of PNDA, USAID\u2019s  actual expenditures were only about $1.3 million, or 13 percent, as of  September 30, 2001. Of the $42.5 million programmed from Plan Colombia  funding, USAID\u2019s actual expenditures were only about $4.4 million, or  10 percent, as of the same date.

The administration had requested an  additional $60.5 million for such activities in fiscal year 2002, but the  Congress reduced the overall administration request for its Andean  Counternarcotics Initiative from $731 million to $625 million, a reduction  that will likely result in less funding for alternative development.

Without government control of project sites, narcotics traffickers and  guerrilla forces will continue to profit from illicit drug operations and  impede legal economic activities generated by alternative development  programs.", "USAID officials told us that armed groups have already intimidated some  farmers and municipal leaders cooperating with the Colombian  government. More recently, in September 2001, four employees of  Colombian nongovernmental organizations working with PNDA in the  Putumayo were kidnapped. According to USAID officials, two are  confirmed murdered and the other two were released. As a result of these  incidents, a number of nongovernmental organizations working with  PNDA temporarily suspended their activities in the Putumayo in October  2001.", "While Colombia uses aerial spray operations to carry out an active  eradication program, the government\u2019s lack of control over many coca- growing areas limits its ability to carry out sustained ground-based  interdiction operations\u2014an essential component of the successful efforts  in Bolivia and Peru. Colombian military and law enforcement units destroy  some cocaine laboratories and seize narcotics and precursor chemicals  during individual counternarcotics operations; however, they lack  sufficient forces to maintain the permanent presence to sustain such  operations on a day-to-day basis. Further complicating the problem is that  a large land area ceded to one of the guerilla groups is off limits to U.S.  and Colombian agencies, but is reportedly an increasing source of coca  and precursor supplies. Throughout these areas, insurgents and  paramilitaries operate largely with impunity. The experiences in Bolivia  and Peru showed that sustained interdiction operations are necessary to  disrupt coca markets and thus produce declines in the prices of coca.  Without these declines, alternative development efforts are not as  effective.", "The Colombian government\u2019s ability to effectively coordinate eradication  and alternative development activities remains uncertain. Careful  coordination of these efforts was critical to their effectiveness in Bolivia  and Peru. In December and February 2000, while conducting aerial  eradication operations, the Colombian National Police accidentally  sprayed approximately 600 to 700 hectares of an area where communities  were negotiating pacts for participation in alternative development. Also,  PNDA officials told us that eradication authorities had sprayed most of the  Bolivar department, even though PNDA had targeted some communities in  the department for participation in the alternative development program.  This will likely complicate PNDA\u2019s relations with farmers in that region.

USAID originally intended to work through the Colombian International  Cooperation Agency as a host-country contracting agency for its  alternative development projects. However, USAID officials told us they  did not have confidence that the Colombian agency could account for the  assistance in accordance with USAID requirements. USAID chose instead  to contract with Chemonics to manage program resources, including  procuring goods and services and awarding and managing grants.  Chemonics is working on a day-to-day basis with PNDA\u2014the institution  established by the Colombian government in 1995 to deal specifically with  alternative development. As noted, USAID was required to focus its initial  efforts on strengthening PNDA because the organization is institutionally  weak. USAID officials said that PNDA may have difficulty effectively using  the additional funding that it is projected to receive for alternative  development projects.", "While PNDA may have trouble absorbing this additional funding, the  institution will have difficulty carrying out its responsibilities without it.  Yet funding for important components of PNDA\u2019s alternative development  plans\u2014from making infrastructure improvements to promoting licit crops  and livestock\u2014is not ensured. PNDA is supposed to provide immediate,  short-term support to farmers cooperating in alternative development  programs, bridging the gap between the signing of voluntary eradication  agreements and receiving USAID assistance. Colombia developed these  plans based on the expectation that it would receive about $300 million  from European donors. However, little of that assistance has materialized  to date. U.S. embassy officials told us that European donors are reluctant  to participate in the program because, based on experiences in Bolivia and  Peru, they associate it with the U.S.-supported forced eradication effort in  Colombia.", "The poor quality of the soil and infrastructure and the remoteness of  project sites in coca-growing areas are further obstacles. Unlike the  poppy-growing areas in northern Colombia\u2014which have richer soils and  better developed infrastructure and are closer to markets\u2014much of the  coca-growing areas in southern Colombia have soils that are poorly suited  for licit crops and a lack of basic infrastructure. According to USAID  officials, these problems are more severe in the coca-growing areas of  Colombia than they were in counterpart areas of Bolivia and Peru. Even  when suitable crops are identified, the distances involved make it difficult  to transport produce for further processing or to potential markets. For  instance, a palmito (heart of palm) canning plant that the United Nations  Drug Control Program built in the Putumayo department in the mid-1990s  sat dormant for a number of years because the farmers growing the palm  were too far away to transport their produce to the plant before it spoiled.

According to USAID  officials, the involvement of beneficiaries, local community groups, and  municipalities in its alternative development programs was necessary to  promote sustainability. Communities have a greater incentive to embrace  and sustain alternative development activities if they are involved in the  design, implementation, and funding of projects that raise the quality of  life in their communities. Both the UHAD project and ADP included social  infrastructure activities in which communities benefited from and  contributed to alternative development-supported schools, water systems,  and health posts.", "ADP, in particular, has promoted the development and strengthening of  regional and local community groups such as municipal associations,  producer associations, and credit groups to encourage local communities  to take ownership of their projects and expose them to the democratic  process. According to USAID, strengthening local organizations is  particularly important in Peru because of the national government\u2019s highly  centralized decision making and resource allocation processes. Under  ADP, USAID requires local communities to prioritize their social service  needs and contribute both financial and labor resources to the projects  they choose. USAID also helped coffee and cacao farmers develop  producer associations to assist them in marketing their crops."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Viable Roads", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and Peruvian officials acknowledged that a viable rural road network  is a precondition that encourages farmers to consider alternative  economic activity and reduce their illicit crops voluntarily. Good roads  allow farmers to obtain higher prices for their alternative crops by linking  them to higher-paying nonlocal markets and by reducing transportation  costs. In contrast, farmers can market coca leaves without roads by  carrying coca leaves or coca paste out of their valleys or by having  narcotics traffickers pick up the products from farms by airplane.", "Under the UHAD project, USAID had supported the completion of roads  that would have linked Upper Huallaga Valley farmers to lucrative markets  in Lima. However, a lack of security prevented their completion. Under  ADP, USAID is supporting the rehabilitation and upgrading of important  secondary rural roads and bridges in program areas. In some cases, USAID  is supporting cobblestone paving of dirt roads, which also generates local  employment in program areas. USAID is also supporting the formation of  community-based road maintenance microenterprises."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Dave Artadi, Mike Courts,  Christian Hougen, Jason Venner, and Janey Cohen made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
