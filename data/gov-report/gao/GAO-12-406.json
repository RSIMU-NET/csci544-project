However, for several years, GAO and others have reported continuing deficiencies with Army military payroll processes and controls, raising questions about the validity and accuracy of reported Army military pay and whether it is auditable. The Department of Defense (DOD) has recently accelerated its Statement of Budgetary Resources audit readiness goal by 3 months to 2014 and is required to achieve audit readiness for a full set of DOD financial statements by 2017. GAO performed basic audit procedures for the Army\u0092s active duty military payroll to assess the Army\u0092s ability to (1) identify a valid population of payroll transactions and (2) test a sample of payroll transactions for validity and accuracy. GAO reviewed applicable laws and regulations, analyzed DOD and Army policies and procedures, drew a statistical sample of payroll transactions to test their accuracy and validity, and met with DOD, DFAS-IN, Army, and Defense Manpower Data Center officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army could not readily identify the population of Army military payroll accounts given its existing procedures and systems. The Army and DFAS-IN did not have an effective, repeatable process for identifying the population of active duty payroll records. For example, it took 3 months and repeated attempts before DFAS-IN could provide a population of service members who received active duty Army military pay in fiscal year 2010. Further, because the Army does not have an integrated military personnel and payroll system, it was necessary to compare the payroll file to active Army personnel records. However, the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), DOD\u0092s central repository for information on DOD-affiliated personnel, did not have an effective process for comparing military pay account files with military personnel files to identify a valid population of military payroll transactions. It took DMDC over 2 months and labor-intensive research to compare and reconcile the total number of fiscal year 2010 active duty payroll accounts to its database of personnel files. DOD\u0092s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance states that identifying the population of transactions is a key task essential to achieving audit readiness. Without effective processes for identifying the population of Army military pay records and comparing military pay accounts to personnel records, the Army will have difficulty meeting DOD\u0092s 2014 audit readiness goal for the Statement of Budgetary Resources.", "In addition, the Army does not have an efficient or effective process or system for providing supporting documents for Army military payroll. For example, DFAS-IN had difficulty retrieving and providing usable Leave and Earnings Statement files and the Army was unable to locate or provide supporting personnel documents for GAO\u0092s statistical sample of fiscal year 2010 Army military pay accounts. GAO\u0092s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and DOD\u0092s FIAR Guidance provide that audited entities document transactions and events and assure that supporting documentation can be identified, located, and provided for examination. Although the Army deployed the Interactive Personnel Management System (iPERMS) as the Army\u0092s Official Military Personnel File in 2007, it had not consistently or completely populated iPERMS with personnel records. At the end of September 2011, 6 months after receiving GAO\u0092s 250 statistical sample items, the Army and DFAS-IN were able to provide complete documentation for 2 of GAO\u0092s sample items and provided partial documentation for 3 items, but provided no documentation for 245 of GAO\u0092s 250 sample items.", "The Army has begun several military pay audit readiness efforts that, if successfully implemented, could help increase the likelihood of meeting DOD\u0092s 2014 Statement of Budgetary Resources audit readiness goal and the 2017 mandate for audit readiness on a complete set of DOD financial statements. These efforts include documenting and testing payroll system application controls, documenting Army military pay business processes, identifying the range of supporting documents for military pay, and developing an integrated military personnel and payroll system.

Further, DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance states that  identifying and evaluating supporting documentation for individual  transactions and balances, as well as the location and sources of  supporting documentation and confirming that appropriate supporting  documentation exists, is a key audit readiness step. Without the  capability to readily locate and provide supporting documentation for  military payroll transactions within a short timeframe, the Army\u2019s ability to  pass a financial statement audit will be impeded.", "A sample item constitutes a soldier\u2019s pay account for fiscal year 2010, including reported  Leave and Earnings Statements for all 12 months of the fiscal year. our 250 sample items, partial support for 3 sample items, and no support  for the remaining 245 sample items. Our review of the partial  documentation provided for 3 sample items showed that the Army was  unable to provide supporting documentation for common elements of its  military pay, including basic allowance for housing, cost of living  allowance, hardship duty pay-location, and hostile fire/imminent danger  pay. Specifically,", "The Army was unable to provide supporting documentation for basic  allowance for housing for one service member. In general, a service  member on active duty is authorized a housing allowance based on  the member\u2019s grade, dependency status, and location. Basic  allowance for housing is based on the median housing costs and is  paid independently of the service member\u2019s actual housing costs. At  the conclusion of our fieldwork, a DFAS-IN official told us they had  requested this documentation from the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA); however, they had not yet received it.", "For two sample items, the Army did not provide adequate  documentation that the two service members were appropriately paid  for clothing allowance. A clothing allowance is paid to enlisted service  members annually in the anniversary month each year after they  received their first clothing allowance. At the end of our field work,  DFAS-IN had not provided an explanation as to why these service  members received their clothing allowance in a month other than their  anniversary date.", "The Army was unable to provide supporting documentation for one  service member residing within the continental United States receiving  a cost-of-living allowance. A cost-of-living allowance for soldiers  stationed in the United States is a supplemental allowance designed  to help offset higher prices in high-cost locations. At the end of our  field work, a DFAS-IN official told us they had requested the  documentation from NARA; however, they had not yet received it.", "Finally, for two service members, the Army was unable to provide  supporting documentation for hardship duty pay and hostile  fire/imminent danger pay. Service members are entitled to hardship  duty pay for location assignments when there is a permanent change  of station duty or temporary/deployed/attached duty of over 30 days in  a specific location. Additionally, a service member is entitled to hostile  fire/imminent danger pay when, as certified by the appropriate  commander, the member is (1) subject to hostile fire or explosion of a  hostile mine; (2) on duty in an area close to hostile fire incidents and  the member is in danger of being exposed to the same dangers  experienced by other service members; or (3) killed, injured, or  wounded by hostile fire and the service member is on official duty in a  designated imminent danger pay area. At the end of our field work,  the Army was unable to provide adequate support for the dates that  each of these service members reported for duty at the specified  location which triggered the start of these two types of pay, and it was  unable to provide documentation that one service member had been  ordered to report to duty in the designated location.", "As shown in figure 3, the Army provided complete documentation for  soldier pay accounts associated with sample items #2 and #4, but it was  unable to provide complete documentation for sample items #1, #3, and  #5. Further, after 6 months, the Army was still unable to provide any  documentation for the remaining 245 pay account sample items.", "One of the reasons the Army was unable to provide supporting  documentation is that it does not have a centralized repository for pay- affecting documents. Army personnel and finance documentation  supporting basic pay and allowances resides in numerous systems, and  original hard copy documents are scattered across the country\u2014at  hundreds of Army units and NARA federal records centers. According to  Army and DFAS-IN officials, there are at least 45 separate systems that  the Army uses to perform personnel and pay functions with no single,  overarching personnel system. Although these systems contain personnel  data on military members and their dependents and feed these data to  DJMS-AC, the systems do not contain source documents.", "Army Regulation No. 600-8-104, Military Personnel Information  Management/Records, establishes requirements for the Army\u2019s Official  Military Personnel File. Army policies indicate that iPERMS is intended  to serve as the system of record for the Official Military Personnel File.  The Army deployed iPERMS in 2007 and designated iPERMS as the  Army\u2019s Official Military Personnel File. However, when we attempted to  find supporting documents in iPERMS, we found that this system had not  been consistently populated with the required service member  documents, resulting in incomplete personnel records. For example,  when attempting to test our sample, we discovered that documents, such  as orders to support a special duty assignment, permanent change of  station orders, and release or discharge from active duty, that should  have been in iPERMS were not. The Army has designated the Human  Resources Command as the owner of iPERMS; however, local  installation personnel offices across the country are responsible for  entering most documents into individual service member iPERMS  accounts, and the Army has not established a mechanism for periodic  monitoring, review, and accountability of iPERMS to ensure that  personnel files are complete. For example, we found that documents  needed to support pay transactions are not in iPERMS because (1) Army  Regulation 600-8-104 does not require the personnel form to be included  and (2) the documents are finance documents and not personnel  documents.", "Efforts to achieve auditablity are further compounded by payroll system  limitations. DJMS\u2013AC, used to process Army active duty military pay, is  an aging, Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) mainframe-based system that has had minimum system maintenance because DOD  planned to transition to the Forward Capability Pay System and then to  the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS).DJMS-AC lacks key payroll computation abilities to pay active duty Army  service members. To address these functionality limitations, DFAS has  developed approximately 70 workaround procedures that are currently  being used to compensate for the lack of functionality in DJMS-AC. An  audit of Army military pay would necessitate an evaluation of these  procedures and related controls.", "Another factor in the Army\u2019s inability to provide support for military payroll  is that the Army has not adequately documented its personnel processes  and controls related to military pay. During our audit, we spent  considerable time attempting to identify the range of personnel and  finance documents that would be needed to support basic military pay  and allowances reported on service members\u2019 Leave and Earnings  Statements and the appropriate office responsible for providing the  documentation.

The Army plans to complete these  efforts by December 31, 2013. However, it is not yet clear who will be  responsible for entering pay-supporting documents in the repository  and what process will be used for ensuring completeness of the files.  As previously discussed, Army Regulation No. 600-8-104, Military  Personnel Information Management/Records, established  requirements for the Official Military Personnel File, but the regulation  did not include requirements for ensuring that personnel documents  are centrally located, retained in the service members\u2019 Official Military  Personnel File, or otherwise readily accessible.

Effective development of such a matrix will  be critical to ensuring that payroll transactions are supported and,  therefore, audit ready. The need for such a matrix became apparent  nearly 1 year ago, but the Army has not yet completed such a matrix  or identified personnel responsible for providing needed documents.  Further, it has not established a central repository for these  documents, or designated iPERMS as the official repository, and it  has not established a mechanism for periodic monitoring, review, and  accountability to ensure that the central repository will be effectively  maintained.", "In addition, the Army is in the process of developing the Integrated  Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A). However, the current  targeted IPPS-A implementation date of 2017 will require the Army to  rely on its current systems for purposes of meeting DOD\u2019s Statement  of Budgetary Resources audit readiness date of September 30, 2014.  IPPS\u2013A is planned to be developed and implemented in two  increments, with multiple releases. The Army plans to employ 14- to  18-month development cycles for each release, with the goal of  fielding capabilities every 12 months. The Army intends for Increment  I to consist of a trusted data source of soldier personnel and human  resource data and to provide the foundation for Increment II, which is  expected to provide integrated personnel and pay services, to be  developed and implemented across multiple releases. In response to  our findings in this report, Army IPPS-A officials told us that they have  recently begun efforts to determine how IPPS-A will link to personnel  records that will be needed to support Army military payroll amounts.  The Army\u2019s strategy is for each release of IPPS-A to incrementally  build upon the prior release\u2019s design and capability, to ultimately  contribute toward the Army\u2019s goal of reaching financial auditability by  fiscal year 2017. Because implementation of the IPPS-A is not  targeted for completion until 2017, a slippage in the implementation  date could impede the Army\u2019s efforts to support DOD\u2019s financial  statement audit readiness goal of September 30, 2017.

The Army has several military pay audit readiness  efforts that are planned or under way. Timely and effective  implementation of these efforts could help reduce the risk related to  DOD\u2019s 2014 Statement of Budgetary Resources audit readiness goal.  However, most of these actions are in the early planning stages.  Moreover, these initiatives, while important, do not address (1)  establishing effective processes and systems for identifying a valid  population of military payroll records, (2) ensuring Leave and Earnings  Statement files and supporting personnel documents are readily available  for verifying the accuracy of payroll records, (3) ensuring key personnel  and other pay-related documents that support military payroll transactions  are centrally located, retained in service member Official Military  Personnel Files, or otherwise readily accessible, and (4) requiring the  Army\u2019s Human Resources Command to periodically review and confirm  that service member Official Military Personnel File records in iPERMS or  other master personnel record systems are consistent and complete to  support annual financial audit requirements. These same issues, if not  effectively resolved, could also jeopardize the 2017 goal for audit  readiness on the complete set of DOD financial statements. In addition,  the Army\u2019s military pay auditability weaknesses have departmentwide  implications as the other military components, such as the Air Force and  the Navy, share some of the same military pay process and systems risks  as the Army.

Those basic  audit procedures included (1) identifying a valid population of military  payroll transactions, and (2) testing a sample of payroll transactions for  validity and accuracy.", "To identify the population of Army active duty payroll transactions, we  obtained Army active duty military payroll records from the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service, Indianapolis (DFAS-IN). DFAS-IN  processes military payroll for the Army. At our request, DFAS-IN made  three attempts from November 2010 through January 2011 to provide us  a complete file of service members who were paid in fiscal year 2010.  The first attempt included 11,940 pay accounts that were duplicate, and  the total number of pay accounts included in the second attempt  increased by 28,035 records over the first attempt, necessitating a third  request for the population of fiscal year 2010 active duty pay records. To  obtain assurance that the overall population of Army fiscal year 2010  payroll accounts matched the sum of monthly payroll accounts, we  requested the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) compare the  results of our third request for the population of Army fiscal year 2010  payroll accounts against its compilation of monthly active duty payroll  data that it received from DFAS-IN. We were able to reconcile all but  1,025 pay accounts (less than 1 percent of the total, which is not  considered material). We did not reconcile military payroll amounts to the  related disbursements because an Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer (OUSD(C)) contractor  was in the process of performing a pilot reconciliation.", "In addition, because the Army does not have an integrated military  personnel and payroll system, we worked with the DMDC to match payroll  accounts to personnel records to determine whether the population of  Army military payroll accounts was in agreement with the population in  the DMDC database. We relied on work performed by DMDC because  we reviewed its quality control procedures and found them to be  adequate, for our purposes. We compared the total number of records in  DFAS-IN\u2019s population and DMDC\u2019s database for the service members  who received active duty Army military pay in fiscal year 2010. We did not  separately validate Army personnel file data. DMDC\u2019s file comparison of  Army active duty pay accounts to military personnel records identified  67,243 pay accounts that were not matched to a file of military personnel  records on September 30, 2010. We asked DMDC to perform more  detailed comparisons of these differences. These differences related  primarily to personnel who were not active Army service members  because they had either left or were scheduled to leave the service, were  reserve component soldiers released from active duty, or were soldiers  that had died during fiscal year 2010. Finally, we confirmed six duplicate  SSNs in personnel records with different names with the Social Security  Administration and referred these records to DMDC and the Army for  further research and appropriate action.", "To address our second objective, we documented key controls, laws, and  pay regulations and used the population of matched personnel and  payroll records to select a statistical sample of 250 soldiers for testing the  accuracy and validity of Army military payroll. We obtained 12 months of  fiscal year 2010 Leave and Earnings Statement files for each soldier in  our sample, the most recent data available at the time, to compare with  supporting Army personnel documents indicating such information as  military orders, special duty and expertise entitlements, marital status,  and dependent information. We gained an understanding of Army  processes with a focus on key steps involved in establishing military  personnel records related to specific pay and allowance amounts. We  also performed process walkthroughs at DFAS-IN and assessed key  controls over the accuracy of payroll payments made to service members.  To document the process for capturing pay-related information and  setting up military personnel records, we interviewed Army personnel,  Human Resources Command, and Finance Command officials and  visited a Military Enlistment Program Station in Indianapolis and a military  reception battalion at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. We also interviewed  finance officials at Defense Military Pay Offices at Fort Jackson, South  Carolina, and Fort Carson, Colorado, to gain an understanding of how  pay adjustments are initiated, input, and reviewed.
