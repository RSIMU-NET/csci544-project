State is currently implementing a pilot program to expand overseas assignments for Civil Service employees. Efforts to expand the limited number of these assignments must overcome some key challenges, such as addressing new gaps when Civil Service employees leave their headquarters positions and identifying qualified Civil Service applicants to fill overseas vacancies. State also hires retirees on a limited basis for both full-time and short-term positions. For example, State used limited congressional authority to offer dual compensation waivers to hire 57 retirees in 2011. As a step toward mitigating experience gaps overseas, State began a pilot program offering workshops that include mentoring for first-time supervisors.

State has faced midlevel gaps for years and, according to the August  2011 Five Year Workforce Plan, the midlevel gap grew from 2010 to  2011.

In prior reports, we found that midlevel experience gaps  compromise diplomatic readiness, and State officials confirmed that these  gaps continue to impact overseas operations.", "State officials noted that midlevel gaps will decrease as recent hires are  promoted. According to State\u2019s Five Year Workforce Plan, officers hired in  fiscal years 2009 and 2010 under the first wave of Diplomacy 3.0 hiring  will begin to be eligible for promotion to the midlevels in fiscal years 2014  or 2015. In recent years, State has accelerated the average time it takes  for officers to be promoted into the midlevels, in part to fill gaps.

Additionally, when positions are filled, posts of greatest hardship are 81  percent more likely to use an upstretch candidate than posts with low or  no hardship differentials.

Appendix II describes our analysis of the  likelihood of various positions being vacant or filled with an upstretch  assignment in further detail.", "We found no significant difference between the rates at which generalist  and specialist positions are filled. However, the likelihood of generalist  positions being filled with upstretch assignments is somewhat higher than  for specialist positions. We also found that there are differences in  vacancy and upstretch rates for specific functions within both the  generalist and specialist fields and that some position categories are  more difficult to fill.", "Among generalists, the consular section has the largest gaps, in terms of  the total number of positions that are vacant or filled with upstretch  assignments, because it is the largest generalist section. According to our  analysis, about 170 consular positions were vacant as of October 31,  2011, and about 250 consular positions were filled with upstretch  assignments.

In  addition, the Public Diplomacy section has a relatively high upstretch rate,  with nearly one-quarter of all Public Diplomacy positions filled with  upstretch assignments. State officials noted that gaps within the Public  Diplomacy section, particularly at the midlevels, have persisted since the  late 1990s, when the U.S. Information Agency\u2014which had responsibility  for public diplomacy\u2014was integrated into State.

Over one-third of all  OMS positions, or nearly 300 positions, are either vacant or filled with  upstretch assignments. Regional bureau and post officials cited OMS  positions as being among the most difficult to fill. For example, officials in  Brazil noted that both the embassy in Brasilia and the consulate in Sao  Paulo had OMS positions that were vacant for 2 years. Security specialist  skill groups also face substantial gaps. The Security Technician and  Security Engineer fields have fewer positions than some of the larger  specialist fields, but about 30 percent of positions in both fields are vacant  or filled with upstretch assignments. Further, security officers have one of  the highest vacancy rates among specialist fields, with about 17 percent  of those positions unfilled.

Officials noted that in the most recent cycle for  assignments starting in the summer of 2012, State filled about three- quarters of all positions in AIP posts before the regular bid round began.", "Regional bureau officials noted that this should have a positive effect on  staffing elsewhere because it limits the number of people pulled from  other assignments. State continues to fill AIP positions year-round and  often uses people from other posts on temporary assignments in AIP  posts.

State also holds an \u201curgent vacancies\u201d bid  round in the spring to fill positions that were not filled in earlier cycles.", "State uses a decentralized process for prioritizing and filling overseas  positions, which officials stated helps ensure important positions are filled.  While AIP posts are the only official department priority for staffing, State  officials said regional bureaus informally set their own priorities by  determining which of the positions within the bureau that are up for bid are  most critical and actively recruiting candidates for those positions. Officials  from State\u2019s Office of Career Development and Assignments stated that  the regional bureaus are in the best position to assess the needs across  posts and prioritize positions accordingly. Regional bureau officials stated  that, in order to minimize the impact of experience gaps, they will consider  factors such as the size of the post or the availability of upper-level support  in addition to the needs of the position itself when determining whether a  position can remain vacant or be filled through an upstretch assignment.  For example, officials stated they may prefer to fill a single position in a  small, difficult-to-fill post ahead of multiple positions in a much larger post.  Similarly, they may be more likely to allow an upstretch assignment for a  lower midlevel position in a large post because larger posts are likely to  have more layers of upper management support.", "As we reported in 2009, State has created a wide range of measures and  financial and nonfinancial incentives to encourage officers to bid on  assignments at hardship posts. For example, Foreign Service employees  may receive favorable consideration for promotion for service in hardship  posts. Additionally, State uses Fair Share bidding rules, which require  employees who have not served in a hardship location within the last 8  years to bid on at least three positions in hardship posts. Officials in the  bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and South and Central Asian Affairs  stated that they regularly collect feedback on the impact of incentives in  encouraging officers to bid on positions in AIP posts. One official noted  that, in addition to financial incentives, nonfinancial incentives, such as  additional opportunities or the feeling that they are doing something  important, often help to attract bidders. According to State officials,  through this system of incentives and bidding rules, State has always  been able to find volunteers to fill critical needs. While the department has  the authority to direct Foreign Service employees to specific assignments  if it does not have adequate bidders for a position, according to State  officials, the department has not used these directed assignments\u2014 outside of assigning Foreign Service employees in their first or second  rotation.

In addition, department officials noted that Civil Service  employees have concerns about losing future opportunities for desirable  Civil Service positions while serving overseas. Another challenge is that  State cannot always identify a sufficient number of qualified Civil Service  employees to apply for the overseas vacancies it seeks to fill. State  officials noted that hard-to-fill positions are typically not in the more  desirable locations, which they said contributes to limited interest among  qualified Civil Servants.

The assignments in the pilot differ from the hard-to-fill  assignments in two key ways. First, these are not positions that Foreign  Service bidders initially passed over. Second, the re-employment rules  are more flexible, according to Human Resources Bureau officials;  affected bureaus do not have to hold a position for the Civil Service  employees who participate in the pilot. Instead, returning Civil Service  employees can be placed in a bureau different from the one they vacated.", "According to State officials, the department has agreed with AFSA to limit  the total to about 20 assignments at any one time during the pilot to  ensure that the program does not limit career development opportunities  for Foreign Service employees. The officials noted that Foreign Service  employees operate in an \u201cup-or-out\u201d personnel system, which requires  them to have sufficient experience and responsibilities to progress in their  careers. In addition, efforts to increase the number of Civil Service  assignments to Foreign Service positions must be consistent with State\u2019s  human capital rules, which state that the department\u2019s goal is to fill  Foreign Service positions with Foreign Service employees except under  special circumstances. The overseas positions in the pilot program  continue to be designated as Foreign Service positions and can be filled  by Foreign Service employees after the Civil Service employees complete  their assignments.", "Human Resources Bureau officials stated that they expect this pilot  program to help the department assess its ability to identify overseas  positions that match the skills and experience of potential Civil Service  applicants. It will also identify potential staffing impacts on affected  bureaus and posts, as well as career development needs of the Foreign  Service. However, according to the officials, the department has not  finalized plans for evaluating the results of the pilot program. They also  noted that it will be more than 2 years before the first set of assignments  is completed and they can begin to survey participants and stakeholders  to assess results of the pilot program.", "State\u2019s QDDR also included a goal of expanding opportunities for Civil  Service employees to convert to the Foreign Service to help fill  experience gaps overseas. The QDDR stated that, while all State  personnel can apply to enter the Foreign Service through the traditional  selection process, it is in the department\u2019s interest to offer more and  quicker pathways for qualified and interested Civil Service employees to  join the Foreign Service. However, State\u2019s Foreign Service Conversion  Program has strict eligibility requirements, which limit the number of  conversions. The program\u2019s application and review process resulted in  only three Civil Service applicants recommended for conversion in 2010  and four in 2011.", "State only opens positions for conversion that it projects to be in deficit or  otherwise approved by the Director General and lists them in an annual  cable that it circulates throughout the department. The department  convenes a review panel to confirm that applicants meet minimum  qualifications, which include 24 months in Foreign Service positions  abroad out of the previous 6 years; and 30 months of service\u2014 domestically or overseas\u2014in the desired skill code in the previous 6  years. The panel then determines if applicants have the skills and  experience necessary to perform successfully in the positions for which  they are applying. Applicants offered an opportunity to convert based on  the panel review must then submit a proctored writing sample, which  must earn a passing grade from the Foreign Service Board of Examiners  to be recommended for conversion.", "According to Human Resources Bureau officials, in 2011, State identified  88 Foreign Service generalist positions as open for conversion from Civil  Service, as well as Foreign Service generalist and specialist. Twenty-six  Civil Service applicants applied. Ultimately, the process resulted in seven  applicants given the opportunity to convert and four of the seven passing  the writing test requirement. Table 1 shows the number of applicants who  qualified at key stages in the process in 2010 and 2011.", "Human Resources Bureau officials noted that in 2011, the department  sought to ease the qualification requirements somewhat, including  reducing the number of months served overseas from 30 months to 24  months; however, the number of qualified applicants actually dropped  from 30 in 2010 to 26 in 2011.

However, other than State\u2019s  Office of Inspector General, the department has not formally sought  expanded congressional authority to offer waivers to hire Foreign Service  retirees. The Office of Inspector General is seeking separate  congressional authority for additional dual compensation waivers to help  meet its staffing needs, including filling positions at its overseas posts in  hardship locations, such as Amman, Jordan; Cairo, Egypt; and Kabul,  Afghanistan.", "State hires many more Foreign Service retirees for temporary, part-time  work than it does for full-time assignments. These retirees work on a  \u201cWhen Actually Employed\u201d schedule and are commonly referred to as  \u201cWAEs.\u201d WAEs do not fill vacant positions overseas but are an important  means of addressing workforce gaps, according to State officials. For  example, posts often rely on WAEs to fill staffing gaps during summer  rotations of Foreign Service employees, according to State officials.  Officials also noted that WAEs can be particularly helpful when short-term  needs arise requiring special skills and expertise, such as helping posts  prepare for a presidential visit or evacuating an embassy during a crisis.  Newer staff also can benefit from the experience and expertise that  WAEs share during their assignments.", "Federal rules, and high salary and travel costs, limit the extent to which  State uses WAEs. State bureaus typically hire them for short assignments  of 1 to 3 months. Federal law enables Foreign Service retirees to earn a  salary while continuing to receive their retirement annuity as long as their  total earnings do not exceed the greater of an amount equal to the basic  pay they earned when they retired or the highest annual rate of basic pay  for full-time employment in the position for which they have been re- employed. This limits the amount of time they can work in a calendar  year. According to State officials, WAEs also have a cap of 1,040 hours of  employment per calendar year. In addition to rules in federal statute that  limit their use, WAEs are also a relatively expensive option because of  their high salaries and travel costs, according to State officials from the  geographic bureaus and the Bureau of Consular Affairs\u2014the primary  users of WAEs. Table 2 shows the number of WAE appointments these  bureaus used in 2011 and the average duration of each appointment.

However, those new hires will not be  eligible for promotion to the midlevels until at least fiscal year 2014 and  projections for future annual hiring increases have been reduced due to  budgetary constraints. As a result, State likely will continue to face  staffing and experience gaps for the foreseeable future. These gaps will  continue to affect diplomatic readiness as positions remain unfilled or are  staffed by Foreign Service employees whose experience does not match  the position requirements. In the meantime, State has taken steps to  implement goals highlighted in the QDDR to address midlevel overseas  gaps, including developing pilot programs for increasing the use of Civil  Service employees overseas and providing new workshops with  mentoring for first-time supervisors overseas. Although these efforts are  currently small in relation to the size of the overall gaps, their impact and  the extent to which they can be expanded in the future have yet to be  analyzed by State and are, therefore, unclear.

We compared the number of positions  that were vacant, filled with upstretch assignments, and filled at grade or  higher with the total number of authorized overseas positions. We did not  validate whether the total number of authorized overseas positions was  appropriate or met State\u2019s needs. We calculated total vacancy and  upstretch rates across all overseas Foreign Service positions for both the  2008 and 2011 data. We also calculated vacancy and upstretch rates for  both data sets by each of the following characteristics: level (i.e., entry-,  mid-, or senior-level); type (i.e., generalist or specialist); and function  (e.g., consular or information management). For 2011 data only, we  supplemented the GEMS data with additional State data on hardship  differentials and embassy and nonembassy rankings from State\u2019s  Overseas Staffing Models and also calculated vacancy and upstretch  rates by each of these characteristics.", "To calculate vacancy rates, we divided the total number of positions by  the number of vacant positions. To calculate upstretch rates, we divided  the total number of positions by the number of upstretch assignments. We  considered any assignment in which the grade of incumbent was at least  one grade lower than that of the position as an upstretch assignment, with  one exception: According to State officials, tenured Foreign Service  generalists with a position grade of 04 are not considered in an upstretch  assignment if they encumber a position with an 03 grade because  tenured 04 grade officers are expected to fill positions with an 03 grade, if  possible. We, therefore, did not consider tenured 04 grade officers to be  in an upstretch assignment when they filled positions graded as 03. We  considered senior-level positions at the Career Minister, Minister  Counselor, and Counselor level to be of a comparable grade and,  therefore, did not consider officers with any of these grades to be in an  upstretch assignment. According to State officials, the department does  not consider any employee in an entry-level position to be in an upstretch  assignment. However, for the purposes of our analysis, we defined any  assignment in which the position\u2019s grade is higher than the incumbent\u2019s  grade to be an upstretch assignment. Therefore, because State assigns  different grades to positions within the entry levels, we considered entry- level assignments where a position\u2019s grade was higher than the  employee\u2019s grade to be upstretch assignments.", "We eliminated a small number of positions from our analysis of each data  set because we could not clearly or completely identify where the  positions were located. We also eliminated 57 Security Protective  Specialist positions from the 2011 data because, according to State  officials, it was a new job category and was not intended for permanent  Foreign Service Officers, but rather employees hired under short-term  limited noncareer appointments. In total, we did not use 88 positions, or  about 1 percent of the total, from the September 30, 2008, data and 207  positions, or about 2 percent of the total, from the October 31, 2011, data,  which we determined did not substantially affect our findings.", "We also conducted an analysis of the likelihood of overseas positions  being vacant or filled through upstretch assignments based on the various  characteristics described above. For a detailed discussion of the  methodology and results of that analysis, see appendix II.", "We obtained staffing and position data from State\u2019s GEMS database.  Since we have previously checked the reliability of this database, we  inquired if State had made any major changes to the database since our  2009 report. State indicated that it had not made major changes to the  system. We also tested the data for completeness, confirmed the general  accuracy of the data with select overseas posts, and interviewed  knowledgeable officials from the Office of Resource Management and  Organizational Analysis concerning the reliability of the data. Data from  Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan (AIP) posts often show higher vacancy  rates than actually exist at the post; however, it does so because State  relies heavily on short-term assignments to fill positions in these  locations. These short-term assignments do not show up in GEMS, and  the position, therefore, appears vacant. Positions in GEMS represent a  need for full-time, permanent Foreign Service employees, and, therefore,  we determined that the GEMS data accurately reflect State\u2019s ability to fill  positions in these locations with full-time, permanent Foreign Service  employees. Additionally, because State often pulls staff from other  overseas assignments to fill short-term temporary assignments in AIP  countries, the vacancy rate for all overseas positions is most accurately  captured when all posts are included. Therefore, based on our analysis of  the data and discussions with the officials, we determined the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

We analyzed that data based on the number of  assignments made, rather than the number of retirees used, as State  officials noted that some individuals may be used in multiple assignments.  In addition, we collected and analyzed data on overseas LNA  assignments of Civil Service employees for fiscal years 2009 through  2011 from State\u2019s Bureau of Human Resources. Because these  assignments may be for multiple years, the number of assignments made  does not necessarily reflect the number of Civil Service employees  serving overseas at any one time.

We first considered a set of bivariate tables (or two- way cross-classifications) that indicated what percentage of positions  were filled and left vacant, across categories that reflected  the level of the position (entry level, midlevel, and upper level);  the hardship category associated with the position (least, medium,  and greatest);  the type of position (generalist versus specialist);  the Overseas Staffing Model ranking and type of post where the  position was located (embassies ranked 1 or 2 were combined and  contrasted with embassies ranked 3, 3+, 4, 5, 5+, and nonembassies  of any rank);  region (Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, Near  East, South and Central Asia, and Western Hemisphere); and whether the position was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Pakistan (collectively  referred to as AIP) or elsewhere (non-AIP).", "We then calculated odds and odds ratios from the observed percentages  in these tables, which allowed us to summarize the differences in the  likelihoods of positions remaining vacant across the different types of  positions, and conducted a series of bivariate and multivariate regression  analyses to estimate the significance of those differences when we  considered each of these six factors one at a time, when we considered  five of them simultaneously (all but AIP), and finally when we considered  all six of them simultaneously. Finally, we conducted parallel analyses  that involved looking at the same types of two-way tables and estimating  the same bivariate and multivariate regression models to determine,  among those positions that were filled, whether they were filled by  upstretch assignments as opposed to officers at or above grade. We  describe these analyses as follows.", "The first three columns of numbers in table 3 show the percentage of  positions that were filled and vacant across the categories of the six  factors just described, and the numbers of positions in each category on  which those percentages were based. A slightly smaller percentage of  upper-level positions than entry-level positions were vacant (12.6 percent  versus 14.9 percent), and a much larger percentage of the positions in  the greatest hardship category (20.5 percent) than in the least hardship  category (10.4 percent) were left vacant. While there was little difference  between generalist positions and specialist positions, there were some  sizable differences across different posts with different rankings, with  positions in the highest-ranked embassies (20.9 percent) and in  nonembassies (16.4 percent) showing the highest percentages of  vacancies. Higher percentages of positions in the Near East (22.3  percent) and South and Central Asia (24.2 percent) were left vacant  compared with other regions, and positions in AIP countries were much  more likely to be vacant than those in non-AIP locations (39.5 percent vs.  11.4 percent).", "In the last two columns of table 3, we show the odds on positions being  vacant, and odds ratios that indicate the proportional differences in those  odds across the different categories of positions. The odds on positions  being vacant are calculated by dividing the percentage of positions that  are vacant by the percentages that are filled, within each of the categories  of the different positions. For entry-level positions, for example, we divide  14.9 by 85.1 to obtain 0.18, which indicates that 0.18 positions were  vacant for every one that was filled or, alternatively, that 18 were vacant  for every 100 that were filled. Similar calculations for midlevel and upper- level positions yield slightly smaller odds (equal to 0.17 and 0.14,  respectively), and odds that differ quite substantially across other  categories of positions, such as those with the greatest hardship (0.26)  versus least hardship (0.12), and those in South and Central Asia (0.32)  versus the Western Hemisphere (0.13).", "The odds ratios in the final column of table 3 indicate the proportional  differences in the odds of positions remaining vacant across the  categories of each of the position characteristics. To estimate these odds  ratios, we choose one category of each characteristic as the referent  category (indicated by REF in the table), and divide the odds for the other  categories by the odds for the referent category. For example, we chose  midlevel positions as the referent category with respect to position level,  divided 0.18 and 0.14 by 0.17, and the resultant odds ratios indicate that  entry-level positions had slightly higher odds of remaining vacant than  midlevel positions, by a factor of 1.04, while upper-level positions had  slightly lower odds than midlevel positions of remaining vacant, by a  factor of 0.86. Similar calculations using the different categories of the  other position characteristics reveal that positions with greatest and  medium hardship were more likely to be vacant than those with least  hardship, by factors of 2.22 and 1.36, respectively, while specialist  positions had only slightly higher odds than generalist positions of  remaining vacant, by a factor of 1.07. Also, all of the lower-ranked  embassies had roughly half or less than half the odds of embassies  ranked 5+ of remaining vacant, and nonembassies had odds that were  lower than the highest-ranked embassies by a factor of 0.74. Finally,  positions in Africa had lower odds on remaining vacant than positions in  the Western Hemisphere (by a factor of 0.78), positions in East Asia and  the Pacific and in Europe had odds that were very similar, and positions  in the Near East and South and Central Asia had higher odds on  remaining vacant than positions in the Western Hemisphere, by factors of  2.25 and 2.51, respectively. As the final multivariate model in table 4  shows, some of these regional differences were because AIP countries  were more than five times as likely as those in other areas to be vacant.", "Odds ratios identical to those just discussed, apart from slight rounding  error, are shown in the first column of table 4. The unadjusted odds ratios  in the first column of table 4, however, were estimated using a series of  bivariate logistic regression models, which allow us to test whether the  different contrasts specified by the various odds ratios are significantly  different than 1. Significant odds ratios are bolded in the table, and we  can see the unadjusted ratios reflecting the differences in the odds on  positions remaining vacant across position level categories and between  generalist and specialist positions are not significant; in addition, the  differences between positions in the East Asia and Pacific region, Europe,  and the Western hemisphere are not significant. All of the other  unadjusted (or bivariate) odds ratios are significant, though our judgment  about both the size and significance of these differences is only tentative  since they are unadjusted and fail to take into account that the different  position characteristics\u2014for example, hardship level and region\u2014may be  related to one another and, as such, the estimated unadjusted effect of  one characteristic may be accounted for by the effect of another.", "In the middle column of the table, we show the results of re-estimating  these odds ratios using a multivariate model that estimates the effects on  positions remaining vacant of all of these factors simultaneously, except for  the AIP indicator. Under this model, most of the effects remain significant,  though the difference between nonembassy positions and embassy  positions is diminished and insignificant, and the difference between entry- level and midlevel positions increases and becomes significant.", "In the final column, we show the results of re-estimating these odds ratios  using a multivariate model that estimates the effects of all six factors  simultaneously, including the war zone indicator. As can be seen, the  adjusted difference between AIP and non-AIP positions is sizable (OR =  4.12), and allowing for that difference accounts for all of the differences  between embassies of different ranks and nonembassies, and most of the  differences between regions (the exception being the difference between  positions in Africa and the Western Hemisphere). In summary, when all  factors are considered simultaneously and the associations between  characteristics are taken into account, the differences that are statistically  significant are as follows: entry-level positions have higher odds of remaining vacant than  midlevel positions, by a factor of 1.36; positions in the greatest hardship and medium hardship categories  are more likely than those in the least hardship category to remain  vacant, by factors of 1.44 and 1.22, respectively; positions in Africa are less likely to remain vacant than those in the  Western hemisphere, by a factor of 0.67; and", "AIP positions are slightly more than four times as likely to remain  vacant as non-AIP positions.", "Table 5 shows similar bivariate results in which these six characteristics  are cross-classified by whether the position was filled by employees  whose grades were lower than the grades of the position they filled, and  table 6 shows the significant and insignificant odds ratios from bivariate  and multivariate models used to estimate the effects of those  characteristics on this outcome. While there is no need to labor over a  discussion of all of the percentages and odds and odds ratios in table 5,  which show the unadjusted and sometimes sizable differences across  categories of position in the likelihood of being filled by a lower-graded  employee, they are there for the reader to see. Our bottom-line findings,  from the multivariate model coefficients in the final column of table 6 in  which all position characteristics are considered simultaneously and the  effect of each is estimated net of the others, are as follows:", "Upper-level positions are more than twice as likely as midlevel  positions to be filled by upstretch assignments.", "Positions in the greatest hardship and medium hardship categories  are more likely than those in the least hardship category to be filled by  lower-level employees, by factors of 1.81 and 1.47, respectively.", "Specialist positions are less likely than generalist positions to be filled  by employees whose grades are lower than the positions, by a factor  of 0.75.", "Positions in East Asia and the Pacific and Europe are less likely to be  filled by upstretch assignments than those in the Western  hemisphere, by factors of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.", "The lowest-ranked embassies (ranks 1 and 2) are only about half as  likely as the embassies ranked 5+ to be filled by upstretch  assignments, while embassies with other ranks and nonembasssies  are not significantly different from embassies ranked 5+.", "AIP positions are half as likely to be filled by upstretch assignments as  non-AIP positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Anthony Moran, Assistant  Director; Howard Cott; Kara Marshall; Grant Mallie; Doug Sloane; Martin  De Alteriis; Karen Deans; and Grace Lui provided significant contributions  to the work."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
