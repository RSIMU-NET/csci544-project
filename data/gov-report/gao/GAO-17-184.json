HHS identified four key efforts related to post-acute care settings; however, the lack of measurement of the effectiveness of these efforts is contrary to leading principles of sound planning. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is planning to survey providers in post-acute settings to gather baseline data on the rates of EHR adoption and activities that demonstrate ways to electronically exchange health information. However, these surveys are not intended to assess the effectiveness of HHS's efforts to promote EHR use. In addition, most of the key efforts lack specific plans for evaluating their progress. Therefore, HHS cannot determine if its efforts are contributing to its goal, or if they should be adjusted. In addition, although HHS's goal depends in part on actions by post-acute care providers and EHR vendors, HHS lacks a comprehensive plan with specific action steps to achieve this goal. HHS's planning also does not address how to overcome key external factors that may adversely affect its key efforts.

Providers of  post-acute care can facilitate patients\u2019 continued recovery, helping to  restore medical and functional capacity and prevent health deterioration.  When patients transition from acute care to post-acute care settings, it is  important that the providers share patient health information, such as  health records and test results. This can help coordinate care, avoid  duplication of tests and procedures, and prevent medication and other  errors. However, researchers have estimated that across the health care  system, the costs associated with failed care coordination were between  $25 billion and $45 billion in 2011, and studies have shown that  transitions between acute care settings and post-acute care settings  account for as much as 60 percent of medication errors. The use of health information technology (IT), such as electronic health records  (EHRs), to exchange information during transitions between acute and  post-acute settings can facilitate prompt care coordination and thus has  the potential to help improve health care quality and reduce costs.", "Despite the potential benefits of EHRs, available evidence suggests the  use of EHRs is limited in post-acute settings.

At that time, ONC noted that a survey of some post-acute settings\u2014 specifically long-term acute care hospitals and rehabilitation  hospitals\u2014 conducted in 2009 showed adoption rates for EHRs of six percent and  four percent, respectively. Furthermore, a 2014 survey of post-acute  care providers in New York found that only one-quarter reported receiving  an electronic document when a patient transitioned to their care. In  contrast, ONC has reported that most acute care hospitals possessed  EHRs in 2015.", "Neither the Medicare nor Medicaid programs incentivize the use of EHRs  in post-acute care settings.

According to ONC, EHR  systems also can allow access to evidence-based tools that providers use  to make decisions about a person\u2019s care, and they can automate and  streamline provider workflow. ONC states that one of the key potential  benefits of an EHR is that it can allow health information to be created  and managed in a digital format capable of being shared with other  providers across more than one health care organization. This exchange  may occur between hospitals, primary care physicians, specialty  physicians, pharmacies, laboratories, and post-acute care providers. (See  fig. 1.)", "Even when providers adopt an EHR system, they may not be able to use  that system to exchange health information with other providers, and the  EHR systems will not necessarily be interoperable with other health IT  systems, including EHRs and health IT systems belonging to laboratories,  specialists, and post-acute care settings. When EHR systems are  interoperable, information can be exchanged\u2014sent from one provider to  another\u2014and then seamlessly integrated into the receiving provider\u2019s  EHR system, allowing the provider to use that health information to inform  clinical care. We previously reported that EHR systems often use different  formats and terminology while exchanging health information, which limits  interoperability.  We also reported that the electronic exchange of health  information and interoperability  relies, in part, on business arrangements  between health care providers who must agree on the rules for exchange,  without which the ability to exchange information may be hampered. As  a result, even when health information can be exchanged electronically,  there is no guarantee that the information can and will be automatically  integrated into the receiving system, and therefore the EHR systems may  not be interoperable. ONC has studied the extent to which non-federal  acute care hospitals performed tasks that demonstrate the ability to be  interoperable. In particular, for 2015 ONC reported the percentage of  surveyed hospitals electronically sending (85 percent), receiving (65  percent), finding (52 percent), and using or integrating key clinical  information (38 percent). According to ONC, even fewer hospitals\u2014about  25 percent\u2014performed all four of these tasks.", "Health care providers can use different mechanisms for the electronic  exchange of health care information. For example, if two providers\u2019 EHR  systems are interoperable with each other, then the providers can  electronically share information directly from one provider\u2019s EHR system  to the other provider\u2019s EHR system. Another mechanism is Direct, which  is a set of specifications that allows users to send secure messages,  including documents, to known and trusted recipients over the internet.  With Direct, one health care provider can electronically transmit  documents with health information to another. However, the provider may  send documents with information in a format that is difficult for the  receiving provider to access and consider in a timely or efficient manner,  which can limit the ability to ensure coordination of care and avoid errors.  Another way of electronically exchanging health information is through  health information exchange (HIE) organizations, which are entities that  bring together health care stakeholders within a defined geographic area  to share health information. An HIE organization can facilitate the  electronic exchange of health information by providing data connections among stakeholders, such as laboratories, public health departments,  hospitals, and physicians. We previously identified some concerns  associated with HIEs, including costs.", "One of the ways to standardize the information that acute care facilities  and other providers may exchange electronically is by using the  Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA). It provides a  common structure for sharing information and was developed to help  providers manage a complex set of documents and reduce duplicative  and conflicting standards issued by different organizations.

According to a survey of care providers in New York, the costs associated  with the adoption of EHRs in long-term and post-acute care settings  varied significantly. Two-thirds of the surveyed providers reported that  they spent more than $100,000 on EHRs, and nearly 20 percent reported  spending more than $500,000. In addition to the high cost of the initial  purchase of EHR software, stakeholders indicated that post-acute care  providers must also often purchase additional software modules so that  their EHRs can be used to send health information electronically, which is  considered a more advanced function. Furthermore, stakeholders told us  that the additional fees for maintaining an EHR can add more costs in  addition to fees associated with adding the capability to exchange health  information electronically. For example, one stakeholder noted the costs  of connecting EHRs to allow them to be interoperable with other facilities\u2019  EHRs and ongoing maintenance fees that some vendors charge can be  more challenging to pay for than the initial purchase of the EHR.", "We previously reported on similar experiences among acute care  providers, who expressed challenges with the upfront costs associated  with purchasing and implementing EHRs, as well as with fees for  participating in state and local HIEs and per-transaction fees for  exchanging health information. According to stakeholders, these costs  are particularly challenging in cases when post-acute care providers have  small profit margins and may therefore not have the financial resources to purchase EHR technology. For example, one stakeholder stated that  post-acute care providers struggling financially will only invest in EHR  systems if they have an incentive to do so, such as the promise of  receiving more patient referrals.", "Stakeholders also noted that post-acute care settings did not receive  federal incentives for meaningful use of EHRs aimed at acute-care  hospitals and other providers. Without financial incentives, or a mandate  to adopt EHR technology, there is no business case for post-acute care  providers to adopt EHR technology, several stakeholders told us.  According to stakeholders, post-acute facilities generally do not see an  immediate financial benefit from adopting or using EHRs, because  purchasing and implementing an EHR is expensive and challenging, and  post-acute facilities are not eligible for financial incentives. As a result,  providers may not perceive that the value of an EHR is worth the cost,  and they are less likely to use EHRs. In addition, stakeholders stated that  purchasing an EHR does not result in more revenue for the provider.  CMS officials noted that post-acute care facilities are not eligible to  receive \u201cmeaningful use\u201d incentive payments through the Medicare or  Medicaid programs, consistent with the Health Information Technology for  Economic and Clinical Health Act.", "Implementation of Standards: There are a number of health data  standards\u2014technical specifications for standardized terminology that  define how information should be packaged and communicated from one  entity to another\u2014to help facilitate the electronic exchange of health  information. However, 19 of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed  described concerns with the implementation of these standards that affect  their use of EHRs and the electronic exchange of health information.  Concerns included variability in the implementation of standards and the  difficulty of finding relevant information when it is exchanged.", "Stakeholders stated that variability  in the implementation of standards  allows each post-acute care provider to make individual  adjustments to its  EHR, which can make it difficult to electronically exchange health  information from one provider to another. These statements were similar  to findings from our previous work, in which we found that health IT  standards are not implemented consistently. For example,", "One stakeholder said different providers may not store similar data in  the same location within their EHRs, which can cause challenges  when communicating with providers in other health care settings.", "Another stakeholder stated there is no universal guidance on how to  apply existing standards; therefore, providers can apply the standards  differently. Other stakeholders added that vendors may implement  standards differently, which creates inconsistencies when exchanging  health information electronically.", "Customizing an EHR results in variability of terminology and formatting in  EHR products and may cause difficultly exchanging health information  between two EHR systems. In our previous work, we reported that  information that is electronically exchanged from one provider to another  must adhere to the same standards and these standards must be  implemented uniformly, in order for the information to be interpreted and  used in EHRs, thereby enabling interoperability.", "However, even if the implementation of standards were more consistent,  concerns about the length and usability of a major standard, the C-CDA,  would remain. Several stakeholders mentioned limitations with the C- CDA, which is a set of templates that can capture information from one or  more health care encounters and can be exchanged when patients  transfer from one provider to another. Stakeholders reported the C-CDA  is not reader-friendly, includes information that is irrelevant to post-acute  care providers, and is too long to easily find information that is relevant for  post-acute care providers. For example, stakeholders told us that post- acute care providers only need a limited set of information when a patient  transfers from an acute care facility, but stakeholders report that they  typically have to search through as many as 50 to 100 pages of a C-CDA  for the relevant information.", "Another concern stakeholders mentioned about the implementation of  standards relates to limitations of certified EHRs for post-acute care  settings. ONC offers certification for EHRs to ensure they meet certain  standards; however, stakeholders told us that there are few vendors that  offer certified EHRs for post-acute care settings. Post-acute care  developers and vendors wishing to certify a health information  technology, including EHRs, must have their product tested and certified  by an approved body to demonstrate that it meets criteria related to  comprehensiveness, functionality, interoperability,  and security. These  criteria were developed by a workgroup of industry representatives and  are designed to support primary clinical needs for post-acute care  providers. The criteria include standards to help facilitate data exchange.  While ONC offers certification of EHR software for post-acute care  settings to ensure that the software meets certain standards and  implementation specifications, this certification is voluntary. One  stakeholder stated that vendors are unlikely to undertake voluntary  certification for their EHR products because it requires an investment of  time and money. According to stakeholders, unless using certified EHR  technology is required, post-acute care providers are not likely to acquire  the certified technology. Furthermore, one stakeholder told us that even if  providers use certified EHRs for post-acute care, those certified EHRs do  not necessarily standardize how providers enter data into an EHR. ONC  officials told us the 2015 health IT certification criteria\u2014the most recent  version\u2014adopted more specific and detailed standards intended to  improve health information exchange. Officials noted, however, that  providers have only recently begun to use technology certified based on  these standards.", "Stakeholders also reported that existing standards do not address  challenges related to matching patients with the correct health information  when electronically exchanging information. According to stakeholders we  interviewed, the lack of a standard method to identify patients and match  them to records, such as a national patient identifier for each unique  patient, contributes to these challenges. Many EHR systems use  demographic information, such as a patient\u2019s name, date of birth, and  home address, to match patients with their correct health information. We  have previously reported that challenges matching patients to their health  records can occur because demographic variables do not always yield  accurate results; for example, there could be more than one patient with  the same information. In addition, one stakeholder indicated that if post- acute patients move from their primary residences to long-term care  facilities, their home address may no longer match facilities\u2019 health  records.", "Workflow disruptions: Sixteen of the 20 stakeholders mentioned that  providers faced challenges with their workflow\u2014everyday work  processes\u2014 when implementing an EHR. For example, stakeholders we  interviewed stated that providers may be reluctant to implement an EHR  because it would require them to make changes to their workflow, which  can be disruptive. For example, one stakeholder stated that they are  more efficient recording information on paper than they would be doing so  electronically.", "Stakeholders noted that there were important differences between the  workflow of post-acute care settings and acute care settings that affect  the use of EHRs. As an example, one stakeholder stated that  implementing an EHR is more complicated in a post-acute care setting  because multiple services\u2014such as pharmacy and radiology\u2014are not  located in a single location, which increases the challenge to  interoperability.  In contrast, an acute care setting\u2014such as a hospital\u2014 often has all providers in a single location. Other stakeholders pointed out  that patients stay longer in post-acute care settings than they do in an  acute care setting, and that this longer length of stay affects how  information is recorded in EHRs.", "Some stakeholders also reported delays of as much as 72 hours when  attempting to electronically exchange health information. Other  stakeholders noted that delays can be caused by inefficient internal  facility workflow processes for electronic exchange, such as needing to  wait for physicians to electronically approve documents. One stakeholder  further stated that printing and faxing a patient\u2019s health information can be  faster than electronic exchange, and therefore providers often use this  method in emergency situations.", "Technological Challenges: Sixteen of the 20 stakeholders stated that  technological challenges prevent some facilities from using EHRs or  electronically exchanging health information. For example, one  stakeholder told us that limited internet access in some areas of the  country prevents home health providers from using EHRs, because these  providers cannot rely on being able to access an EHR in patients\u2019 homes.  Furthermore, stakeholders indicated that some post-acute care facilities  may have EHRs that are used primarily for administrative and billing  purposes rather than for clinical care. According to stakeholders, these  EHRs may not be capable of sending and receiving health-related  information electronically and may not have other advanced  functionalities, such as support for clinical decision-making. Finally, post- acute care facilities with an EHR capable of receiving electronic health  information can encounter instances when information is not  automatically integrated into the receiver\u2019s EHR, which can require the  recipient to manually enter data into the EHR.", "Staffing: Thirteen of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed identified  staffing challenges at post-acute facilities as a factor affecting their ability  to use EHRs and electronically exchange health information. For  example, stakeholders stated that high staff turnover\u2014which can be from  50 to 100 percent every year\u2014results in a constant need to train new  staff to use the EHR systems. As an example, one stakeholder told us  that EHR vendors may provide a specified number of training hours to  facilities who purchase their EHRs, but this amount of training can be  insufficient due to high turnover.", "In addition to high turnover, stakeholders noted that post-acute care  settings may lack information technology (IT) staff to manage the EHR  software and train staff to use the technology. Stakeholders indicated that  many facilities do not have the resources to hire experienced IT  professionals, and therefore the facilities may have few or no qualified  staff to manage EHR software."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Measured the Effectiveness of Each of Its Efforts to Promote the Use of EHRs and Lacks a Comprehensive Plan to Meet Its Goal for Post-Acute Care", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HHS Has Four Key Efforts Designed to Promote the Use of EHRs and the Electronic Exchange of Health Information", "paragraphs": ["ONC and CMS officials identified four key efforts that promote the use of  EHRs in post-acute care settings, including the electronic exchange of  health information.

ONC has funded cooperative agreements with  state governments and other entities that in turn fund programs that  promote EHR use and health information exchange among post-acute  providers and others not eligible for meaningful use incentives. ONC  provides this funding through its Advance Interoperable  Health  Information Technology Services to Support Health Information Exchange  Program, and funding recipients offer training, education, and technical  assistance to providers, such as assistance with incorporating health  information exchange into their existing workflows. ONC funded 12  awards totaling over $29 million, each covering 2 years of activities from  2015 through 2017. For example, a health information organization in  Nebraska received funding to help nursing homes, home health agencies,  and assisted living facilities adopt Direct messaging, which provides basic  exchange capabilities. Another awardee helps post-acute providers and  others, such as acute care hospitals, electronically exchange health  information by, for example, submitting health information documents to a  state HIE. In addition to their individual activities, awardees are expected  to communicate with each other and with ONC to identify best practices,  such as techniques for explaining to providers the potential benefits of  EHRs and electronic information exchange.", "Medicaid Matching Funds. States may also be eligible to receive federal  funding through the Medicaid program to help providers who are not  eligible for meaningful use incentives for HIEs and other related  technology. In February 2016, CMS issued a letter to state Medicaid  directors indicating that federal matching funds (with a 90 percent federal  and 10 percent state match) could be used for these activities. In other  words, states may claim a 90 percent match for Medicaid expenditures  related to electronically connecting eligible providers to other Medicaid  providers, including post-acute care facilities. For example, in order to  increase electronic health information exchange between post-acute care  providers and acute care providers, CMS indicated that states may use  the matching funds to connect post-acute care providers to state HIE  organizations. ONC officials told us that as of October 2016, five states  have received these matching funds, which are not exclusively for post- acute care providers. CMS\u2019s February 2016 letter also indicated that  states may use funds to build web-based provider directories, which  facilitate information exchange by allowing providers to identify relevant  electronic information and the providers who have the capability to send  or receive it. Cloud-based provider directories allow providers without  EHRs to import and export relevant information.", "ONC Certification of EHRs for Post-Acute Care. The 2015 Edition of  ONC\u2019s Health IT Certification Criteria supports the certification of health  IT, including EHRs, designed for post-acute settings, though as we have  reported, there is no regulatory requirement or incentive for post-acute  care settings to use certified EHRs. ONC officials told us that the  certification program could provide assurance to post-acute providers that  EHRs offer capabilities providers need, such as the ability to send and  receive key health information, and thereby encourage post-acute care  providers to electronically exchange health information with other  providers. ONC has added and updated the certification criteria to focus on transitions of care from one setting to another, such as from an acute- care hospital to a post-acute setting. For example, the new criteria are  used to assess whether an EHR has the capability to create and receive  C-CDA documents, which are intended to allow electronic transmission of  key health information. Since the ability to certify EHRs to the 2015  criteria began in 2016, ONC has not certified any EHRs that are marketed  for post-acute care settings. However, ONC officials told us that an  industry study of post-acute care vendors indicated that 22 out of 26  vendors have plans to pursue certification for their products.", "CMS Data Mapping and Data Element Library. As part of implementing  the IMPACT  Act, CMS has begun to standardize certain data elements,  or pieces of data, which could be used by EHR vendors and providers to  facilitate electronic health information exchange. CMS\u2019s efforts are  focused on the data elements for quality measures calculated using the  patient assessment instruments that post-acute care providers are  required to submit electronically to CMS. The standardization of such  patient assessment data is intended to serve as a centralized health IT  data element resource for providers and vendors, which would make it  easier for post-acute care providers to electronically exchange such data.  For example, CMS is standardizing the patient assessment data  indicating the extent to which patients experience pressure ulcers.  According to CMS officials, these data may then be used both to calculate  quality measures related to pressure ulcers across different post-acute  settings and to electronically exchange information on pressure ulcers  during transitions of care. According to CMS officials, standardized data  elements would allow comparisons of quality across all post-acute care  settings\u2014a goal in the IMPACT  Act. Further, data mapping\u2014which  identifies links between standardized data elements and health IT  standards\u2014could also improve health information exchange during  transitions of care and inform post-acute care discharge planning. CMS  officials told us that the Data Element Library was still in development as  of December 2016 and that they are on track to meet the 2019 deadline  set by the IMPACT Act.", "As CMS works toward standardizing post-acute care assessment data  elements, CMS officials said they are beginning to link the standardized  data elements to more widely used health IT standards that support electronic health information exchange. For example, standardized  patient assessment data elements on clinical concepts may be linked to  Logical Observation Identifier Name Codes, known as LOINC, a broader  health IT standard used for laboratory and clinical observations.  According to officials, the standardized data elements will do a better job  of facilitating electronic health information exchange if they help ensure  that post-acute providers send and receive the same data elements.  Additionally,  CMS is creating a Data Element Library to make the details  of the standardized data elements available to key stakeholders.  According to CMS officials, information from the Data Element Library  could support vendors as they develop EHR products for post-acute care  providers by using the standardized data elements linked to nationally  accepted health IT standards, and thereby increase the capacity to  electronically exchange health information. CMS officials envision that  software vendors could use the information to develop EHR products with  the capacity to inform care planning and sharing of long-term and post- acute care assessment summary documents, which in turn could facilitate  more coordinated care and improve beneficiary outcomes.", "CMS officials told us that they plan to make the Data Element Library  available to the public to support standardization efforts and  interoperability  of the post-acute care assessment data elements in the  near future. However, CMS officials told us that this is a long-term project  and CMS does not have a more specific timeframe for this effort. In  addition, there is no requirement that post-acute care providers or  vendors use the standards associated with data elements that are part of  this effort. Further, the standardized assessment data elements used for  IMPACT  Act reporting, or content from the Data Element Library, do not  include all clinical content found in an EHR, since those standardized  data elements focus only on post-acute care assessment data required  for reporting to CMS. For example, many EHRs collect information on  laboratory results. The Data Element Library would not currently contain  this information, since post-acute care assessments do not currently  include data elements for laboratory results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Measured the Effectiveness of Each of Its Key Efforts to Promote the Use of EHRs and the Electronic Exchange of Health Information in Post-Acute Settings", "paragraphs": ["HHS does not have information on the effectiveness of its four key efforts  to promote EHRs and the electronic exchange of health information in  post-acute settings. HHS has plans to evaluate two of its four key efforts,  one of which has several limitations, and it lacks any plan for two of the  key efforts, as described below.", "ONC Financial Awards:  HHS has a plan to evaluate ONC\u2019s financial  award program. Currently, ONC tracks each awardee\u2019s progress on  specific activities that the awardees agree to perform using a series of  milestones and metrics. Specifically, awardees must work with clinical  and non-clinical care providers and individuals to establish reporting  mechanisms, set goals, and track progress on required health information  exchange milestones, including tracking the rates at which providers or  others send, receive, find, and use available health information. They  must also determine whether this information improves health or health  care. In addition, awardees must submit quarterly progress reports to  ONC and participate in monthly phone calls to discuss their progress.  According to ONC officials, a more complete program evaluation will be  conducted once the program is finished. However, officials have not  specified what the evaluation will entail, and it is too early to know if this  evaluation will allow ONC to determine how the program may contribute  to HHS\u2019s goal of increasing EHR use and the electronic exchange of  health information among post-acute providers.", "ONC Certification of EHRs in Post-Acute Care: HHS has a plan for  evaluating the number of post-acute care settings that have an EHR;  have a certified EHR; can send, receive, find and use electronic health  information; and have information electronically available at the point of  care. However, the plan has limitations. ONC plans to evaluate the extent  to which post-acute care providers use certified EHR products by adding  a question about certification to its ongoing surveys of home health  agencies and skilled nursing facilities (discussed in more detail below). A  separate ongoing survey that includes long-term acute care hospitals and  inpatient rehabilitation facilities currently has a question that focuses on  whether providers are using EHRs that are certified as eligible for  meaningful use incentives. Because post-acute providers are not eligible  for these incentives, however, it is unclear how this question will  adequately assess whether providers are using EHR products that have  received certification under ONC\u2019s voluntary certification program for  post-acute care providers. ONC officials told us that the survey will not  collect data on how the voluntary certification program may or may not  affect post-acute care providers\u2019 decisions to adopt or use EHRs. Rather,  ONC hopes to use the data\u2014along with additional data, such as  programmatic data from ONC\u2019s certification effort \u2014to assess correlations  between the adoption of certified EHRs and the likelihood that post-acute  care providers send, receive, locate, or integrate electronic health  information.", "Medicaid Matching Funds and CMS Data Mapping: Finally, HHS does  not have any plans to evaluate its other two key efforts\u2014the use of  Medicaid matching funds or the data mapping and Data Element Library.  Once the Data Element Library is made publically available,  ONC officials  told us they expect to explore opportunities to evaluate its possible effects  on the Roadmap\u2019s goal related to interoperability  and health information  exchange in post-acute care settings. Without specific evaluation plans, it  is not clear how CMS will measure the success of either of these efforts.", "In addition to the limited evaluation plans geared specifically for HHS\u2019s  four key efforts, ONC officials told us that ONC is planning to survey  providers in all four post-acute settings to gather baseline information  about the rates of EHR adoption and the extent to which post-acute care  providers are engaging in activities that demonstrate interoperability\u2014 specifically, sending, receiving, finding, and integrating electronic health  information. Subsequent surveys could be used to identify progress  towards expanding EHR use and the electronic exchange of health  information. ONC officials told us that the agency plans to obtain survey  data from two sources. First, the agency plans to use an ongoing annual  survey of hospitals, conducted by the American Hospital Association, to  gather baseline data on long-term care hospitals and inpatient  rehabilitation facilities. This mail survey has collected data on these  facilities since 2012. Second, ONC officials told us the agency is  developing a similar phone survey for home health agencies and skilled  nursing facilities. The officials told us that the agency fielded both surveys  at a similar time in October 2016 and plans to analyze baseline data in  2017. ONC officials told us that the agency plans to fund data collection  regarding the long-term care hospital and inpatient rehabilitation survey  until at least 2018. They also said that the agency would like to conduct a  follow-up survey for the other settings in 2018; however, ONC officials are  uncertain as to whether they will have the funding for this effort.", "ONC officials expect the surveys to provide useful information on rates of  EHR adoption and activities that demonstrate interoperability, but officials  say that the surveys are not intended to assess the effectiveness of  specific HHS efforts designed to promote EHRs use in a post-acute care  setting. For example, because the survey of home health agencies and  skilled nursing facilities is being done by phone\u2014which officials  determined would be the most cost-effective method\u2014it does not include  detailed questions about factors that affect EHR adoption, use, and the  electronic exchange of health information in post-acute care settings. In  contrast, the ongoing annual survey of long-term care hospitals and  inpatient rehabilitation facilities uses a written format and includes some  questions that may provide greater detail. However, the differing formats  and content of these surveys limit comparisons of results across different  facility types.", "The lack of detailed plans to promote the use of EHRs and the electronic  exchange of health information in post-acute care settings is inconsistent  with leading principles on planning we have identified in prior work. These  principles state that detailed evaluation plans are an important way for  agencies to measure progress and to identify which efforts may or may  not be successful in achieving agency goals. Without an evaluation plan  for all of its four key efforts, HHS cannot determine whether or to what  extent its efforts are contributing to the department\u2019s overall goals, or if  these efforts need to be adjusted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Lacks a Comprehensive Plan with Specific Action Steps and Consideration of External Factors to Achieve Its Goal for Post-Acute Care", "paragraphs": ["HHS\u2019s ongoing activities to increase EHR use and the electronic  exchange of health information are intended to help achieve the goal of  ONC\u2019s Roadmap to increase the proportion of post-acute care providers  electronically exchanging health information by 2017. However, HHS  does not have a comprehensive plan to achieve this goal. While the  Roadmap serves as a general plan, neither it nor other planning  documents are comprehensive. First, these documents do not clearly  outline how these individual  key efforts will work together to meet the  Roadmap goal. Second, the documents lack certain other elements that  are desirable for a strategic plan so that HHS will be able to achieve its  goal within its specified timeframes. According to leading principles of  sound planning identified in our prior work, these elements include a plan  with specific action steps and the identification and consideration of  external factors. (See fig. 2.) The lack of a comprehensive plan with  specific action steps and the failure to consider external factors, such as  cost and high staff turnover, in the Roadmap may adversely affect the  implementation of HHS\u2019s key efforts and thus the ability of HHS to  achieve the Roadmap\u2019s goal for post-acute providers.", "A Plan with Specific Action Steps. HHS officials indicated that while  achieving the goal of the Roadmap depends in part on actions by post- acute care vendors and providers, the Roadmap does not address how to  facilitate or encourage vendor and provider actions. For example, CMS  officials told us they hope that by standardizing post-acute care  assessment data elements and linking these data elements to health IT  standards in its Data Element Library, post-acute care vendors will use  these data elements to create technological solutions for post-acute care  settings. CMS officials told us that the agency intends to notify the public,  including stakeholders and vendors, when the Data Element Library is  complete. Since the library is meant to serve as a resource, there are no  requirements for vendors to use the data elements to improve EHR  systems or for post-acute care providers to use the improved systems.  CMS, therefore, has no plans to ensure that vendors use these data  elements to improve EHR systems, or that post-acute providers use the  improved systems\u2014both of which would be key steps necessary to  achieve the Roadmap\u2019s goal. Furthermore, in its certification program,  HHS has not outlined specific action steps for post-acute care vendors or  providers to take. For its part, ONC has provided guidance on  functionality to vendors serving providers not eligible for the meaningful  use incentives. ONC sees its certification of EHR technology as a chance  to provide assurance to post-acute care providers that certain EHRs have  functionality and standards and can support exchange with other settings,  such as hospitals. ONC officials told us they hope there is an increase in  the use of certified products among post-acute care settings, and the  officials say they will continue outreach to and education for post-acute  providers regarding the program and relevant certification criteria.", "Identification and Consideration of External Factors. ONC officials  told us that the Roadmap is a high-level document describing the  department\u2019s vision of an interoperable health care system. The officials  added that this document therefore does not discuss in detail how  external factors, such as costs, high staff turnover, lack of technical  support, and workflow challenges may affect the extent to which post- acute care settings use EHRs and electronically exchange health  information. While HHS has key efforts that may help to achieve the  Roadmap\u2019s goal, these key efforts are unlikely to fully address these  external factors. For example, while ONC financial awards and Medicaid  matching funds may eventually  help to make health information exchange  more affordable for post-acute facilities, these funds are not intended to  address the full range of factors reported by the 20 stakeholders we  interviewed. Furthermore, some of the factors may be outside of HHS\u2019s  control and may require action by external stakeholders. By not planning  for how to address external factors that could significantly affect EHR use  and the electronic exchange of health information for post-acute care  settings, HHS runs the risk that these factors could impede progress  towards its goal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HHS has several key efforts to promote EHR use and the electronic  exchange of health information in post-acute care settings. However,  HHS lacks plans for fully evaluating the effectiveness of each of these  efforts.

Describing how efforts will work together is an important part of  comprehensive planning. Given that vendors and providers play an  important role in whether HHS achieves its goals, it is problematic that  HHS has not developed a comprehensive plan with specific action steps  that specifically address how to facilitate or encourage vendor or provider  actions. Additionally,  HHS\u2019s Roadmap does not specify the external  factors that affect post-acute provider\u2019s use of EHRs and the electronic  exchange of health information, such as the many providers who do not  see immediate financial benefits in adopting or using EHRs.
