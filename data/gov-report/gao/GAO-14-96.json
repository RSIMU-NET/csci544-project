For example, specific initiatives, such as the Commercialization Readiness Program, are used by each SBIR program and focus resources on enhancing technology transition opportunities. Transition facilitators are also used by each program to provide a network of personnel who manage SBIR activities that support technology transition. GAO also found some different practices and tools used to support technology transition efforts, such as the Navy Transition Assistance Program, which provides consulting services and helps showcase SBIR projects in an effort to improve small businesses' abilities to transition their projects. Transition facilitation efforts are supported by administrative funds provided through each program's SBIR budget and from other funds received from their respective military department. A recent increase in the amount of administrative funding that can come from SBIR budgets is expected to help the programs enhance their transition facilitation efforts.", "GAO was unable to assess the extent of technology transition associated with the military department SBIR programs because comprehensive and reliable technology transition data for SBIR projects are not collected. Transition data systems used by DOD provide some transition information but have significant gaps in coverage and data reliability concerns. The military departments have additional measures through which they have identified a number of successful technology transitions, but these efforts capture a limited amount of transition results. SBIR transition reporting requirements recently established by Congress have led DOD to evaluate its options for providing transition data. GAO identified several challenges to attaining complete and accurate technology transition data. For instance, the lack of a common definition for technology transition across SBIR programs could cause reporting inconsistencies. Additionally, tracking transition can be challenging because of the sometimes lengthy period between SBIR project completion and transition to a DOD user. DOD initially plans to use transition data from Company Commercialization Reports--viewed by DOD as the best available source--to meet the new transition reporting requirements. However, SBIR officials indicated that addressing transition reporting requirements is a longer-term effort, and there is no specific plan including a time line for when DOD will be able to support those requirements. Without a plan that establishes a time line, it is unclear how and when DOD will begin to provide the technology transition information expected by Congress. Although Congress did not specify when reporting was to begin, it expects DOD to report new transition-related information to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to meet the new reporting requirements.

Within DOD, the Office of Small Business Programs  oversees the department\u2019s SBIR program activities, develops policy, and  manages program reporting. This office generally relies on the agencies,  such as the Army, Air Force, and Navy, to oversee and execute their own  SBIR program activities. Each agency has flexibility to tailor its SBIR  program to meet its needs, including determining what type of research to  pursue, which projects to fund, and how to monitor ongoing projects.", "To initiate the project award process, SBIR programs work with the  science and technology and acquisition communities to generate and  prioritize research and development topics. These topics describe  technical areas of interest and capability needs, which the programs use  in their solicitations for proposals from small businesses.

We identified  some common transition elements across the programs, but also found  some differences in how each program approaches its technology  transition efforts. The programs\u2019 technology transition efforts are  supported through use of administrative funds coming from their SBIR  budgets and other funds provided by their respective military department.  The transition facilitation practices, tools, and funds used to promote the  transition of SBIR technologies include the following:  Early focus on transition through topic generation and project  selection: Technology transition efforts begin with topic generation  and project selection processes that emphasize the pursuit of projects  for which there is a demonstrated military need and potential transition  opportunities. To do this, the military department programs formally  engage stakeholders from the science and technology and acquisition  communities in generating and endorsing topics for SBIR solicitations.  In proposing topics and selecting projects, programs have to balance  their desire for technological innovation with meeting pressing  warfighter needs. SBIR officials stated that projects that pursue  incremental improvements generally are more likely to deliver the  technical capability expected for technology transition to occur. In  contrast, they noted that projects that focus more on \u201cleap-forward\u201d  technology innovations that can support future warfighting needs tend  to require more long-term development and have greater technical  and transition risks. DOD policy requires that at least 50 percent of  military department topics are endorsed by the acquisition community,  such as program executive offices. This helps ensure that the  acquisition community is engaged with the SBIR programs and that a  significant portion of projects are dedicated to addressing specific  needs identified by military users.", "Phase II transition initiatives: Transition-focused activities increase  as Phase II projects progress, commensurate with an increasing  technology maturity and understanding of a project\u2019s potential  opportunities for use. In particular, the military department SBIR  programs target transition opportunities through their  Commercialization Readiness Programs and other initiatives that  provide additional support to select Phase II projects. In some cases,  the SBIR programs require formal technology transition agreements  or matching funding as a condition to receiving additional Phase II  funding. Technology transition agreements, which Air Force and Navy  officials reported using, help manage project expectations and  formalize stakeholder commitments by outlining cost, schedule, and  performance expectations for transition to occur. Matching funds from  intended users, which are required by the Navy for some projects, can  help create greater buy-in for transition because the intended users  have a monetary stake in the project.", "Transition facilitators: Each military department SBIR program has  a network of transition facilitators who manage the Commercialization  Readiness Program and other enhancement efforts, as well as  broader SBIR activities that support technology transition. The  facilitators are located at military labs, acquisition centers, and  program executive offices to work directly with government  stakeholders and help ensure projects are responsive to warfighter  needs. They also help small businesses identify and position  themselves for opportunities to transition their SBIR technologies.  Although the roles and responsibilities vary somewhat across the  programs, in general, transition facilitators assist with topic generation  and prioritization; foster communication among small businesses,  research laboratories, and the acquisition community in support of  transition opportunities; and monitor project progress, including  outcomes.", "Navy Transition Assistance Program: The Navy established an  additional program over a decade ago to prepare its SBIR participants  for technology transition opportunities. The Transition Assistance  Program is a voluntary 11-month program with, on average, about  two-thirds of Phase II recipients participating each year. It provides  consulting services focused on improving the small businesses\u2019  abilities to transition their SBIR products, including assistance in  transition planning and developing marketing tools. Under the  program, profiles are used to describe the expected capability, level of  technology maturity, and potential technology transition opportunities  for each project. These profiles are available in electronic form  through a web-based portal called the Navy Virtual Acquisition  Showcase, and support the annual Navy Opportunity Forum  conference. The conference provides Transition Assistance Program  participants with direct exposure and one-on-one opportunities to  interact with prospective transition partners in the government and  industry.", "Other transition facilitation tools: SBIR programs also use  technology roadmaps and formal relationship-building activities, such  as conferences and workshops, to support transition efforts.  Technology roadmaps are schedule-based planning documents used  to identify opportunities for SBIR technology insertion into acquisition  programs or direct use by the warfighter. Conferences and  workshops, such as the annual Beyond Phase II conference hosted  by the Office of Small Business Programs, are used by the programs  to provide opportunities for SBIR Phase II companies to interact  directly with prospective government and industry users and  showcase their projects.", "Administrative funds: The technology transition practices and tools  used by the programs are supported by administrative funds provided  through their SBIR budgets as well as non-SBIR sources from their  respective agencies. The Commercialization Readiness Program and  discretionary technical assistance provisions enable programs to use  portions of their SBIR budgets to fund administrative activities,  including transition support. For fiscal year 2012, this funding totaled  about $12 million across the three military departments. The fiscal  year 2012 SBIR reauthorization included a new provision\u2014which  DOD officials advocated\u2014that allows the programs to use up to 3  percent of their funds to support administrative activities, which is in  addition to funds available through the Commercialization Readiness  Program and discretionary technical assistance. SBIR officials stated  that although this additional funding allowance is in the initial stages of  being used, they believe these funds will help enhance transition  facilitation measures for their programs going forward. Additional  agency funding outside of the SBIR budget is also used to manage  programs and support transition activities, but the amount of such  funding is not readily identifiable because the military departments do  not all require that the amount of funding used to support associated  administrative efforts be documented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Comprehensive Data on SBIR Technology Transition Outcomes, but Some Transition Successes Have Been Identified", "paragraphs": ["We were unable to assess the extent of technology transition associated  with the military department SBIR programs because comprehensive and  reliable technology transition data are not collected.

Because the data help support  program management efforts, the Office of Small Business Programs and  the military departments, to varying degrees, take steps to verify the  quality of CCR and FPDS-NG data. For example, the Army assesses and  validates CCR data for its projects on an ongoing basis. This process  involves comparing recent updates to the database with FPDS-NG  contract data and internal Army tracking data to confirm the accuracy of  commercialization funding reported by the small businesses. The Navy  SBIR program uses FPDS-NG as its primary source of commercialization  data and employs similar validation techniques to improve the accuracy of  commercialization data tracked through this system. By comparing  contracts in FPDS-NG flagged as SBIR-related to DOD contract  management systems, the Navy is able to verify the accuracy of Phase III  awards data tied to government contracts. Both the Army and Navy  officials acknowledged, however, that even with their data validation  efforts, problems persist because of the limitations of the Company  Commercialization Reports and FPDS-NG.", "The military department programs have developed some internal  capabilities to track certain projects and provide insight into the types of  capabilities enabled by them. Like Company Commercialization Reports  and FPDS-NG, these capabilities do not provide comprehensive transition  information, but may help the departments to gain more insight into  transition outcomes for some technologies developed within SBIR  programs and to respond to DOD and congressional inquiries about  program results. In particular, the programs identify transition success  stories for a limited number of projects, ranging from Phase III awards for  additional research and development to transition to major acquisition  programs or fielded systems. Information on these success stories can  come from SBIR program officials, acquisition program officials, prime  contractors, or directly from the small businesses. The Air Force\u2019s  database of identified transition successes includes 95 transition stories  dating back to 2004. The Army\u2019s program produces an annual report  describing transition outcomes for 20-30 successful projects. The Navy\u2019s  program maintains a searchable database of SBIR projects that includes  profiles on select transitioned projects as well. Table 4 provides examples  of transition outcomes for projects identified through our review of these  reporting mechanisms.", "SBIR program officials within the military departments emphasized that, in  addition to their broader program efforts to identify transition outcomes,  some acquisition organizations have implemented their own practices to  track transition. For example, the Navy Program Executive Office for  Submarines tracks the transition of SBIR technologies to its acquisition  programs by managing a list of companies, the value of contract awards,  the specific program office associated with each contract award, and the  SBIR technology associated with the award. The office indicated that 20  active Phase III awards associated with its acquisition program efforts are  being tracked."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is in the Early Stages of Developing a Plan to Improve Technology Transition Tracking and Reporting", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 mandated  that DOD report new transition-related information to the Administrator of  the Small Business Administration who will report this information  annually to designated congressional committees.

One such challenge we found was variation  across the military departments in their definitions of technology  transition. Specifically, transition definitions ranged from any  commercialization dollars applied to a project, to only when a technology  is actually incorporated into a weapon system or in direct use by the  warfighter. The Office of Small Business Programs acknowledged that a  standard DOD SBIR definition of technology transition must be ensured  before the congressionally-required reporting begins. Standards for  internal control state that management should establish procedures to  ensure that it is able to achieve its objectives, such as being able to  compile and report consistent, complete, and accurate data.according to SBIR officials, tracking transition outcomes can be   Additionally,  challenging because the sometimes lengthy period between SBIR project  completion and transition to a DOD user can obscure a project\u2019s SBIR  linkages. Time lags can occur because of delays in transition funding  availability, additional development or testing needs before transition, or  schedule delays encountered by intended users. During the time between  project completion and transition, personnel associated with projects may  change and technologies may evolve. This increases the likelihood that  transitions associated with SBIR technologies go unacknowledged. SBIR  officials within the military departments also stated that limited resources  for administrative activities constrain their ability to effectively follow up on  the transition outcomes for completed projects.", "Although the Office of Small Business Programs acknowledges the  limitations of CCR data, the initial plan is to use this data source\u2014viewed  by DOD as the best available\u2014as the primary means for beginning to  address the new transition reporting requirements. Additionally, in an  effort to improve DOD\u2019s future technology transition reporting and its  understanding of transition results in general, the Office of Small  Business Programs has initiated an assessment of different options for  enhancing transition data. For example, as part of this assessment, DOD  is examining whether CCR could be modified to improve reporting.  Additionally, existing DOD reporting mechanisms, such as Selected  Acquisition Reports\u2014annually required for major defense acquisition  programs\u2014are being considered as potential vehicles for supporting  SBIR technology transition reporting. Opportunities to build more SBIR  awareness directly into acquisition activities are being considered as well,  such as including provisions in acquisition strategy documents or formal  program reviews. According to the Office of Small Business Programs,  DOD intends to issue a policy directive in fiscal year 2014 that will provide  guidance for implementing overall SBIR program requirements. However,  SBIR officials indicated that addressing technology transition reporting  requirements is viewed as a longer-term effort because of the challenges  we have discussed, and no specific plan including a time line has been  established for when DOD will be able to support those requirements.  Without a plan that establishes a time line, it is unclear how and when  DOD will begin to provide the technology transition information expected  by Congress. Although Congress did not specify when reporting was to  begin, it expects DOD to report new transition-related information to the  Administrator of the Small Business Administration to meet the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requirement.
