In December 1991, the Navy awarded a contract to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for the advanced design and an option for full-scale development of the engine. Their engine development team includes Rolls-Royce Public Limited Company (United Kingdom), AlliedSignal Aerospace Incorporated, and CAE Electronics.", "The engine is essentially an advanced gas turbine engine, similar to the one used on a large commercial aircraft. It is being adapted for marine use by adding a recuperator, an intercooler, and other major components. Housed in a special enclosure, the engine also has a lube oil module, an off-engine intercooling module, and a digital control system specifically built for shipboard application. A critical component of the engine is the recuperator. The recuperator uses engine exhaust to preheat compressed air before fuel combustion, allowing the engine to use less fuel. For example, the Navy expects the ICR engine to achieve a weighted average improvement of 30 percent in fuel efficiency for a mechanical drive destroyer. Figure 1.1 shows a cut-away drawing of the ICR gas turbine engine in its planned enclosure.", "Portions of the ICR program are a collaborative effort among the United States, British, and French navies. Memorandums of understanding, signed between the United States and the two other countries, relate to the development of an advanced, fuel efficient ship propulsion system to satisfy common operational requirements and meet emerging environmental emission standards. The memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom calls for the joint development and qualification testing of the ICR engine. Specifically, the United Kingdom is responsible for providing an ICR test facility along with fuel, utilities, and manpower to support up to 2 years, or 1,500 hours, of developmental testing. The memorandum was signed on June 21, 1994, for a 5-year period. The 10-year memorandum signed by France, in August 1995, calls for the joint adaptation and testing of an ICR engine upgrade for reducing exhaust emissions.", "The U.S. Navy estimates the ICR program\u2019s developmental total cost to be $415 million, with $223.6 million having been spent through fiscal year 1995. These amounts include foreign financial contributions of $15.8 million from the United Kingdom and $15 million from France. Although the Navy has classified the engine as a preplanned product improvement program for the DDG-51 destroyer, it will not decide on whether it will install the ICR engine on the destroyer until January 1997. The British and French navies are completing the design of a multinational frigate, known as the Horizon, and are considering the engine as its propulsion system. The only operational ICR test facility established, to date, is at Pyestock, United Kingdom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Value of and Need for This Program Are Being Questioned", "paragraphs": ["In a September 1995 letter to the Navy\u2019s Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Resources, Warfare Requirements and Assessments), the Navy\u2019s Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, recommended that the ICR engine not be funded in the future, noting that \u201cin this year\u2019s . . . budget process, the ICR Gas Turbine Engine Program stands out as a major cost without a realistic prognosis for long-term benefit.\u201d He stated that the engine\u2019s long-term cost-benefit projections are speculative at best and that its technology will most likely become obsolete before a return on its investment is realized. He also stated that the engine is not a viable candidate for existing ships due to its large size, weight, and cost. In an October 1995 reply, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations stated that the Navy may decide the fate of the engine program as it finalizes its budget submission for fiscal year 1998.", "In November 1995, a high level Navy official informed us that the Navy\u2019s need for the engine was marginal compared to other current priorities and that he believed the Center for Naval Analyses\u2019 ICR report does not make a compelling economic case for the continued development of the engine.

The report, which was prepared prior to the initial test of the engine and recuperator, states that \u201c(t)he economic payoff for a fuel-efficient engine is so long-term that it might not be an attractive investment in the private sector, but the eventual benefits of either improved engine are not in doubt, only the near-term affordability.\u201d The analysis stated that the Navy\u2019s 1993 ship building plans for gas turbine surface ships are less then half what they were expected to be in 1987 and that such a large reduction could call into question the idea of a costly ICR engine development paid for by fuel savings. Further, the remaining development costs for the engine were significant. It would take until at least 2026 for the cost savings from the engine to equal the Navy\u2019s investment, and the Navy needed to determine what priority it should give to the engine\u2019s development. The analysis concluded that while existing contractual and political obligations would make cancellation of the engine an unpleasant choice, the high cost to develop the engine\u2014estimated to be an average of $40 million per year through fiscal year 1999\u2014means that program cancellation must be considered an option. In a December 1994 letter to the Chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, the Secretary of the Navy stated that the report\u2019s analysis supported the continued development of the ICR engine because of potential future fuel savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Engine\u2019s Use in Navy Destroyer Is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["According to the Navy, the ICR engine is expected to provide military advantages, such as increased range and time on station for the DDG-51, which the Navy considers desirable and which formed the basis for DOD\u2019s approving the engine as a preplanned product improvement for the DDG-51. However, Navy officials have raised concerns about the viability of placing the engine on the DDG-51. Officials from the DDG-51 program office stated that the destroyer is currently equipped with a reliable gas turbine engine and that equipping it with the unproven ICR engine is a questionable decision. They noted that the Navy\u2019s next generation surface combatant, planned for 2003, appeared to be a better candidate for the engine because it could be designed from the start to accept the engine. An ICR program official also called the ICR engine\u2019s use on the DDG-51 questionable but noted that this decision gives the Navy an immediate need for the engine. He agreed that the Navy\u2019s next generation surface combatant would be a better candidate since it could be designed to accept a new propulsion system.", "In 1992, we reported that the ICR program lacked adequate management controls, such as milestone reviews and comprehensive, independent cost estimates. In February 1994, the Under Secretary of Defense designated the ICR engine program as a preplanned product improvement for the DDG-51 destroyer in an effort to improve its management and ensure that it was subject to the approval of the Defense Acquisition Board and an independent cost estimate. The decision, however, on whether to actually use the ICR engine on the DDG-51 will not take place until January 1997. In addition, the first production engines would not be installed in a DDG-51 until over 7 years later, in 2004. The initial engine is expected to be ordered in 2001. If the engine is used on the DDG-51, the Navy now plans to put it on only the last nine destroyers to be built.", "The Center for Naval Analyses cost-benefit analysis of the ICR engine concluded that the engine should not be used on the DDG-51 due to the high cost to fit the engines on ships that were not designed for them and the small number of destroyers (14 at that time) remaining to be built. The analysis also noted that the projected break-even point between the cost savings generated by the engine and the Navy\u2019s investment, based on  79 possible candidate ships (including the DDG-51 destroyers), would not occur until about 2026. If the engine is not put on the DDG-51, as the analysis recommends, then the number of identified candidate ships would be reduced to 65. In either case, the analysis noted that the cost of replacing the DDG-51 engine is significant. The analysis estimates that the cost to equip a new DDG-51 with two ICR engines is $12.4 million (in fiscal year 1994 dollars) more than the current engines. This increase in cost includes design, shipbuilding, and engine costs. This cost compares with the $4.9 million cost increase estimate for the other gas turbine engine in this study (a more fuel-efficient version of the current engine). The analysis suggests that the Navy confirm this estimate before acting on its recommendation.", "The Westinghouse contract requires the development of an ICR engine that will occupy the same space as the existing engine in the DDG-51. Current plans call for each new destroyer to be equipped with two ICR engines and two existing gas turbine engines. These plans present design and integration problems for the DDG-51 because the ship\u2019s engine compartment will need to be redesigned to accommodate the larger ICR engine. Since the ICR engine module is expected to weigh two and one-half times more than the existing engine system, the engine compartment will require substantial modification to achieve the structural strength needed to support the added weight of the engine. In addition, with two different propulsion systems on each ship, the Navy will have to maintain individual logistics for each system.", "In March 1995, two shipyards building the DDG-51, Ingalls Shipbuilding Incorporated and Bath Iron Works Corporation, submitted reports to the Navy concerning the feasibility of installing an ICR engine in the DDG-51. Ingalls reported that while the installation was technically feasible, maintaining the ICR engine would be difficult because it has about 30 percent more preventive maintenance requirements than the current engine. Also, Ingalls reported \u201cunlike the (current engine), most in-place maintenance activities will not be convenient or expeditious due to the very limited access to the ICR engine components.\u201d Bath Iron Works concluded that replacing two of the present propulsion gas turbines with ICR gas turbines would have a significant negative impact on the ship and a clear potential for cost growth."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Serious Problems Experienced in Developing and Testing the Engine\u2019s Recuperator", "paragraphs": ["The ICR engine\u2019s recuperator, a critical component necessary for obtaining improved fuel economy, is experiencing serious developmental and testing problems.

In December 1994, when the Navy first tested the engine with a recuperator, the engine demonstrated its potential effectiveness by increasing engine power from 7,000 horse power to 11,500 horse power with no increase in fuel consumption. In January 1995, however, the original recuperator failed after only 17 of 500 hours of planned testing. Test operations were terminated when a significant rise in the turbine inlet temperature occurred. This rise in temperature was attributed to the failure of the heat exchanger, within the recuperator, due to numerous air leaks.", "Westinghouse, the primary contractor, identified 26 different recuperator failures, many of which were due to basic flaws in the unit\u2019s internal design and construction. In response, the Navy approved a contractor recovery plan to redesign the recuperator and requested an additional $11 million from Congress to fund this effort. As a result, the Navy extended the advanced development phase of the contract by 21 months, until September 1997. The plan allowed, however, key recuperator tests to be conducted concurrently with the redesign of the recuperator. One program official described the plan as aggressive while another told us that this was necessary to accomplish enough testing (such as a key 500-hour engine test) to support a planned late 1996 decision to order production engines for the Horizon frigate.", "Between March and November 1995, the Navy reduced projected program funding by $27.3 million between fiscal years 1996 and 2000. In November 1995, the Navy also ordered Westinghouse to stop work on designing and manufacturing later generation recuperators. The stop order was issued due to the decline in program funding and the inability of the contractor to meet the delivery date for the modified recuperator. This latter problem was due, in part, to continuing contractor quality control problems. According to the Navy, the stop work order reduced the amount of concurrency in the recuperator recovery program by allowing time to review and incorporate various test results into thermal computer models and evaluate test results from the modified recuperator. The Navy also requested that the contractor propose possible changes to current contract requirements, including revising the schedule, estimating cost by quarter, and eliminating test efforts related to integration of the ICR engine into the DDG-51.", "In response to the funding reduction and the stop work order, Westinghouse notified the Navy that while the technical problems associated with the recuperator were understood and solutions were in place, the engine\u2019s development would be delayed an additional  20 months, until May 1999. In addition, Westinghouse recommended, among other things, that the number of preproduction engines used for developmental testing be reduced from five to two. Westinghouse also stated that cost growth has occurred and identified potential future development and production cost risks. Westinghouse agreed to provide the Navy an overall recuperator recovery strategy by May 1996.", "In March 1996, an ICR program official told us that the impact of the initial recuperator failure on the ICR program has been catastrophic and that the Navy has yet to recover from it. The Navy expects that the developmental program\u2019s scope will be reduced, resulting in testing delays and cost growth.

In addition, to keep total program costs at $415 million, the Navy plans to reduce the scope of its developmental test efforts and use funds intended for other test purposes to offset the expected $25 million recuperator recovery program cost.", "Also, in May 1994, the ICR engine contract was modified by deleting special tooling and special test equipment costs since the contractor agreed to fund these costs, if Navy funds were not available.

A Navy program official acknowledged that meeting that date was part of the reason the Navy approved an aggressive recuperator recovery plan, which included redesign of the recuperator before receiving the results of key tests.", "During 1995, the House Committee on Appropriations recommended, in its report on the fiscal year 1996 DOD appropriations bill, that the program be terminated because of concerns about serious technical problems, high unit cost, and program cost-effectiveness. In a July 13, 1995, letter to the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the British Ambassador expressed his concern about funding for the ICR engine program. He stated that the United Kingdom plans to use the engine for its next generation of warships. He noted, however, that if U.S. funding for the ICR program was eliminated by Congress it would be incomprehensible to the British government and it could help encourage a movement toward a protectionist European defense market. In an August 28, 1995, letter to the same Chairman, the Secretary of Defense also expressed concern over the possibility that all ICR program funds would be deleted and that the program would be terminated in the House appropriations bill. Noting that the ICR engine is a candidate for all future nonnuclear Navy surface ships, he stated that the United Kingdom and France are committed to fielding the engine on their next generation of surface combatant ships and that termination of the program would be a potential embarrassment for the U.S. government.

The original recuperator recovery plan recommended that a test unit and three additional generations of recuperators be manufactured during the developmental effort. Each would be designed with a longer service life than the previous one and would provide different solutions to address the failures. However, much of the testing of one generation would be conducted concurrently with the redesign of the next generation recuperator, thus severely limiting the contractor\u2019s ability to improve the redesign based on test results. For example, a series of recuperator core component tests (there are eight of these heat exchanging cores in a recuperator) were scheduled simultaneously with the redesign of the next recuperator.", "To support the redesign efforts, a series of component tests are planned with a full-sized recuperator core. Such component testing had not been performed on the original recuperator due to the manufacturer\u2019s attempt to meet delivery schedules for developmental testing. The manufacturer was behind due to (1) delays in awarding the subcontract to AlliedSignal, (2) refurbishing of the brazing furnace to satisfy safety requirements, and (3) manufacturing additional core units to replace poorly manufactured component units. The recovery plan concluded that these component tests \u201care crucial to support the design evolution of the core configuration and are more effective and provide earlier test data.\u201d Due to delays in receiving these core component test results, which are necessary to validate model predictions, the Navy directed the contractor to stop testing the modified recuperator in January 1996. This action was necessary since the contractor had failed to provide substantiating data from the core tests to allow certain engine test maneuvers. Furthermore, in later correspondence, the Navy denied a particular test maneuver since the Navy believed the contractor\u2019s proposed approach was inconsistent with the long-range requirement of extending the modified recuperator\u2019s useful life for future testing. Within a week of being told to stop testing, the contractor resumed engine testing with the modified recuperator.", "A blue ribbon panel that reviewed the recovery plan determined that available test results were inadequate to predict future problem areas and the recuperator\u2019s operational life and to validate performance models. Since the recuperator\u2019s failure, the engine manufacturer has been testing the engine without a recuperator, further limiting the amount of available test data and the contractor\u2019s ability to validate performance models and engine performance.", "According to Navy officials and documents, the need to have a propulsion system available for ships in development, especially the new multinational frigate, drove an aggressive recuperator recovery plan to redesign recuperators without the benefit of results from tests of individual cores and the environmental test data from a special test unit. Examination of the failed recuperator and additional materials test results, however, contributed to the design effort. The special test unit, which was created using six cores from the failed recuperator and two unused cores that had been set aside due to questionable manufacturing quality, replaced the failed recuperator. The test objectives of the special unit included the provision of data for refining, developing, and validating analytical computer models. Modeling new design concepts is a key factor in any developmental effort. The special unit operated for about 6 hours and demonstrated that the recuperator could be operated safely by gradually increasing engine power to obtain idle speed and having the recuperator partially active. The unit was extensively instrumented to gain detailed information about the operational environment.", "One of the recuperator recovery plan\u2019s objectives was to deliver a redesigned recuperator to the Pyestock test facility by October 31, 1995, but an additional schedule slippage delayed delivery until December 1995. The slippage, however, enabled the Navy to obtain some additional preliminary core component test results that were used to establish boundaries as to what test operations will be performed.

Prior to the recuperator failure, the Navy had hoped to advance significantly the development of the ICR engine by conducting joint testing in the United Kingdom and the United States. The second decision is whether it will test the ICR engine at sea in a pilot ship. Because of recuperator technical problems, funding reductions, and schedule delays, the Navy will not be able to accelerate engine development via planned joint land-based testing.

In addition, the Navy has not provided adequate funding for the operation of the Philadelphia facility in support of desired joint developmental and qualification engine testing.

Moreover, representatives from the DDG-51 program office, and even the ICR program office, have said that this is an inappropriate ship for the ICR engine.", "DOD commented that studies done by Ingalls Shipbuilding demonstrate that putting the ICR engine on the destroyer is technically feasible. However, DOD\u2019s comments fail to note that Bath Iron Works concluded that the engine would have a significant negative impact on the ship and a clear potential for cost growth. Further, weight is clearly an issue when DOD tells us, in its technical comments, that the Navy will, if necessary, reduce the amount of fuel carried on the destroyer to counter the increased weight of the engine.", "Concerning our recommendation to determine total program costs for developing and acquiring the engine, DOD stated that total program costs have been estimated and the ICR engine should break even around about 2020. However, when we attempted to follow up on this statement, we learned that, as of April 1996, the Navy had yet to restructure and rebaseline the program. The Navy is in the process of restructuring the program to absorb the estimated $25 million cost to implement the recuperator recovery plan and expected reductions in out-year program funding. To accomplish this, the Navy is considering, among other things, reducing the number of preproduction engines, under the contract, from five to two. In addition, the Navy has not fully funded all of the test activities, including the U.S. land-based test facility and a pilot ship to test the engine at sea. It may even eliminate the planned DDG-51 integration testing. Thus, total program costs are not fully known and we are concerned about what test activities the Navy plans to reduce or eliminate to keep total program costs down.", "In addition, the Center for Naval Analyses actually predicts the break-even point, when savings would equal the development cost, as being in 2026, not 2020 (based on the first engines being installed in a fiscal year 1999 DDG-51). Under current Navy plans, however, ICR engines would not be installed until 2004, meaning that the break-even point is likely to occur even later then 2026.", "Concerning our recommendation to prepare a test plan and schedule that provides sufficient assurance that the engine can transition from development to production and be realistically available for future use, DOD stated that if the decision was made to use the ICR engine on a particular ship, test planning and scheduling would be incorporated into that ship\u2019s test and evaluation master plan. However, with the decision to put the engine on the DDG-51 at least a half year away and a stop work order still in effect, we are more concerned about the current test plan and schedule for the engine\u2019s development. Until the Navy restructures and rebaselines the program we will be unable to determine if test concurrency has been eliminated and if adequate time has been provided for developmental testing and the evaluation of test results. DOD also pointed out that the United States has no cognizance over the Horizon program and that the United Kingdom, France, and Italy would develop their own test plans. We have revised our recommendation to specify that it only applies to U.S. ship development.", "After carefully reviewing all of DOD\u2019s comments, we continue to believe that the Secretary of Defense needs to reassess the ICR engine program and the Navy needs to resolve problems with the ICR engine\u2019s recuperator and sufficiently test the engine prior to committing to its production, particularly since there appears to be no pressing U.S. requirement. We are also concerned about the growing cost of the program and, in particular, the cost to acquire and install the engine in the DDG-51. While the U.S. Navy has entered into cooperative agreements with the United Kingdom and France, it is still funding about 93 percent of the engine\u2019s estimated $415 million development cost. Program restructuring, schedule slippage, and expected cost increases will add to that amount. The decision of the program office to advance the engine\u2019s schedule by concurrently conducting advanced development along with full-scale development  1-1/2 years prior to testing the engine and recuperator together and then, after the recuperator failure, to initiate an aggressive recuperator recovery plan heightens our concern about program management. We also are concerned that the Navy may significantly reduce the testing of the ICR engine in an attempt to offset program cost growth and the additional cost caused by the recuperator failure. We also continue to question the Navy\u2019s proposal to put the engine on the DDG-51 and its decision to manage the program as a DDG-51 preplanned product improvement.", "DOD\u2019s comments are presented in appendix I.
