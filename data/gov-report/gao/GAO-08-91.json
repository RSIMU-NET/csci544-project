These may be at risk of exploitation when exported, stolen, or lost during combat or routine missions. In an effort to minimize this risk, DOD developed an anti-tamper policy in 1999, calling for DOD components to implement anti-tamper techniques for critical technologies. In March 2004, GAO reported that program managers had difficulties implementing this policy, including identifying critical technologies. This follow-up report (1) describes recent actions DOD has taken to implement its anti-tamper policy and (2) identifies challenges facing program managers.

These actions include developing a Web site with anti-tamper information and events, establishing an online learning module on anti-tamper protection, and sponsoring research on generic anti-tamper techniques. However, DOD lacks departmentwide direction for implementation of its anti-tamper policy. Without such direction, individual DOD components are left on their own to develop initiatives. For example, the Navy is developing a database that is intended to provide a horizontal view of what DOD components have identified as critical program information. While many officials we spoke with pointed to this database as a potential tool for identifying critical technologies that may need anti-tamper protection, the database is currently incomplete. Specifically, the Missile Defense Agency is not providing information because its information is classified at a level above what the database can support. Also, the Air Force is not currently providing information because not all commands have provided consent to participate. At the same time, program managers face challenges implementing DOD's anti-tamper policy--due largely to a lack of information or tools needed to make informed assessments at key decision points. First, program managers have limited information for defining what is critical or insight into what technologies other programs have deemed critical to ensure similar protection across programs. Determining whether technologies are critical is largely left to the discretion of the individual program manager, resulting in an uncoordinated and stove piped process. Therefore, the same technology can be identified as critical in one program office but not another. Second, program managers have not always had sufficient or consistent information from the intelligence community to identify threats and vulnerabilities to technologies that have been identified as critical. The potential impact of inconsistent threat assessments is twofold: If the threat is deemed to be low but is actually high, the technology is susceptible to tampering; conversely, if the threat is deemed to be high and is actually low, an anti-tamper solution is more robust than needed. Finally, program managers have had difficulty selecting sufficient anti-tamper solutions--in part because they lack information and tools, such as risk and cost-estimating models, to determine how much anti-tamper protection is needed. As a result, program managers may select a suboptimal solution. Given these combined challenges, there is an increased risk that some technologies that need protection may not be identified or may not have sufficient protection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the Department of Defense (DOD) invests billions of dollars to  develop and produce sophisticated weapon systems and technologies to  maintain military superiority.

In March 2004, we reported on several  difficulties program managers faced in implementing this policy, including  determining which technologies were critical\u2014the basis for considering  the need for anti-tamper protection.

We conducted structured interviews with officials from  a cross-section of programs that the Anti-Tamper Executive Agent\u2019s Office  and DOD components identified as considering and/or implementing anti- tamper protection. We discussed with these program officials their  procedures for implementing anti-tamper protection and any challenges  they faced. We also interviewed officials from program offices not  identified by the Anti-Tamper Executive Agent and DOD components to  obtain their perspective about the anti-tamper policy. We did not evaluate  whether programs had implemented sufficient anti-tamper protection. We  conducted this performance audit (from January 2007 to January 2008) in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

These measures include information  assurance to protect information and information systems, software  protection to prevent the unauthorized distribution and exploitation of  critical software, and anti-tamper techniques to help delay exploitation of  technologies through means such as reverse engineering when U.S.  weapons are exported or lost on the battlefield. Examples of anti-tamper  techniques include software encryption, which scrambles software  instructions to make them unintelligible without first being reprocessed  through a deciphering technique, and hardware protective coatings  designed to make it difficult to extract or dissect components without  damaging them.", "In 1999, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics (AT&L) issued a policy memorandum for implementing anti- tamper protection in acquisition programs. In the following year, AT&L  issued a policy memorandum stating that technologies should be routinely  assessed during the acquisition process to determine if they are critical  and if anti-tamper techniques are needed to protect these technologies. In  2001, an AT&L policy memorandum designated the Air Force as the Anti- Tamper Executive Agent. The executive agent\u2019s office, which currently has  four staff, is responsible for implementing DOD\u2019s anti-tamper policy and  managing anti-tamper technology development through the Air Force  Research Laboratory. The executive agent also holds periodic information  sessions to educate the acquisition community about anti-tamper policy,  initiatives, and technology developments. To coordinate activities, military  services and defense agencies, such as the Missile Defense Agency, have  an anti-tamper point of contact. Program managers are responsible for  ensuring anti-tamper protection is incorporated on any weapon system  with critical technologies that need protection. Since it is not feasible to  protect every technology, program managers are to conduct an assessment  to determine if anti-tamper protection is needed.", "When assessing if anti-tamper protection is needed, program managers  make several key decisions regarding the identification of critical  technologies, assessment of threats and vulnerabilities, and determination  of anti-tamper techniques or solutions. The process begins with  determining whether or not their system\u2019s critical program information  includes any critical technologies. If it is determined that the system has  no critical technologies, program managers are to document the decision  and request concurrence from either the office within their component  that is designated with anti-tamper responsibilities or the Anti-Tamper  Executive Agent. For systems that are determined to have critical  technologies, the next key steps are to identify potential threats and  vulnerabilities and select anti-tamper techniques to protect those  technologies. Techniques are ultimately verified and validated by a team  composed of representatives from the DOD components. The program  manager documents decisions in an annex of the program protection  plan.", "In 2004, we reported that program managers had difficulty in carrying out  DOD\u2019s anti-tamper policy on individual weapons, such as identifying  critical technologies and experiencing cost increases or schedule delays  when applying anti-tamper techniques\u2014particularly when the techniques  are not fully developed or when the systems are already in design or  production. We made several recommendations, including increasing  oversight over the identification of critical technologies across programs,  improving tools and resources for program managers in identifying critical  technologies, ensuring early identification of anti-tamper costs and  solutions, monitoring the development of generic anti-tamper solutions  and evaluating their effectiveness, and developing a business case to  determine whether the current organizational structure and resources are  adequate. DOD concurred or partially concurred with these  recommendations. DOD has taken some steps to implement our  recommendations including identifying available anti-tamper technical  resources and developing a searchable spreadsheet of critical  technologies, incorporating information in the Defense Acquisition  Guidebook on the need for early identification of anti-tamper solutions in a  weapon system, and sponsoring a study on anti-tamper techniques and  their general effectiveness.
