The Program Manager's Office issued an implementation plan in November 2006 to guide the design of the ISE, has carried out a number of steps in that plan, and has leveraged existing efforts and resources agencies independently pursued for improving information sharing. However, this plan lacks important elements essential to effectively implement the ISE. Gaps exist in (1) defining the ISE's scope, such as determining all the terrorism-related information that should be part of the ISE; (2) clearly communicating and distinguishing the role of the Program Manager and other stakeholders; and (3) determining the results to be achieved by the ISE (that is, how information sharing is improved) along with associated milestones, performance measures, and the individual projects. Two annual reports on progress have been issued. Each identifies annual goals and individual ISE efforts, but neither reports on the extent to which the ISE has improved information sharing. GAO reported in October 2007 that fusion centers, established by states and localities to collaborate with federal agencies to improve information sharing, vary widely but face similar challenges--especially related to funding and sustaining operations--that the federal government is helping to address but are not yet resolved. While the centers varied in their level of maturity, capability, and characteristics, most fusion centers focused on processing information on crimes and hazards, as well as terrorism-related information. Fusion center officials reported facing challenges such as obtaining specific, clear guidance and training; obtaining and retaining qualified personnel; and securing funding for center operations over the long term. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were helping to address these challenges by, for example, providing technical assistance and training, personnel, and grant funding. Also, legislation has been proposed to clarify how funding may be used to hire and retain intelligence analysts. Although the myriad of sensitive but unclassified designations has been a long-standing problem, progress has been made in establishing processes for designating, marking, safeguarding, and disseminating this information. In March 2006, GAO reported that each federal agency determined sometimes inconsistent designations to apply to its sensitive but unclassified information and this could lead to challenges in information sharing, such as confusion on how to protect the information. Thus, GAO recommended that the Directors of National Intelligence and the Office of Management and Budget issue a policy that consolidates sensitive but unclassified designations. In a May 2008 memorandum, the President adopted \"controlled unclassified information\" (CUI) to be the single categorical designation for sensitive but unclassified information throughout the executive branch and provided a framework for designating, marking, safeguarding, and disseminating CUI."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to summarize the results of our recent  reviews of the government\u2019s efforts to better share information about  possible terrorist threats to protect the homeland. As you know, in 2005,  GAO placed the issue of information sharing for homeland security on its  high-risk list of federal programs or functions needing broad-based  transformation and since then has conducted work to monitor the  government\u2019s progress in resolving barriers to sharing. What we found is  that in the wake of 9/11 and the passage of the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Intelligence Reform Act) and  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11  Commission Act), agencies at the federal, state, and local levels are taking  steps to better share information about possible terrorist threats. New  organizations whose mission is information sharing and fusion have been  created. New processes, information systems, and networks have evolved  to handle the sharing and to encourage communication among the  partners who must analyze and act on this information. And Congress and  the administration have enacted new laws and issued new policies,  guidance, and standards to promote better sharing. But there is still  important and critical work left to do. This includes better integrating all  of these changes and initiatives into a set of functioning policies,  processes, and procedures for sharing; continuing to break down agency  stovepipes and cultures that promoted protection over sharing; monitoring  and measuring progress; and maintaining momentum.", "Among the many efforts begun to improve information sharing is the  creation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), a governmentwide  \u201capproach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security  information, which may include any method determined necessary and  appropriate.\u201d In implementing this initiative, the Program Manager for the  ISE\u2014appointed by the President and responsible for planning, overseeing,  and managing this new approach with participation of other federal  departments and agencies, such as the Departments of Defense, Justice,  and Homeland Security\u2014envisions an ISE that will be comprised of  policies, procedures, and technologies that link people, systems, and  information among all critical stakeholders. In addition, most states and  some local areas have created fusion centers to address gaps in homeland  security and law enforcement information sharing by the federal  government and to provide a conduit for this information within each  state. While they vary\u2014reflecting differences in state and local needs\u2014a  fusion center is generally a \u201ccollaborative effort of two or more federal,  state, local, or tribal government agencies that combines resources,  expertise, or information with the goal of maximizing the ability of such  agencies to detect, prevent, investigate, apprehend, and respond to  criminal or terrorist activity.\u201d One of the barriers to information sharing  with these entities was the many different and sometimes confusing and  contradictory ways that agencies were identifying and protecting sensitive  but unclassified information. This information encompasses a large but  unquantifiable amount of information\u2014for example, sensitive law  enforcement information, information about a narcotics-smuggling ring,  and terrorism financing information\u2014that does not meet the standards  established by executive order for classified national security information,  but that an agency nonetheless considers sufficiently sensitive to warrant  restricted dissemination.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings of our work on the following  three information sharing initiatives: (1) the actions that have been taken  to guide the design and implementation of the ISE and to report on its  progress, (2) the characteristics of state and local fusion centers and the  extent to which federal efforts are helping to address some of the  challenges centers reported, and (3) the progress made in developing  streamlined policies and procedures for designating, marking,  safeguarding, and disseminating sensitive but unclassified information.  The information in this testimony is based on GAO reports and testimonies  issued from March 2006 through June 2008 addressing these three  terrorism-related information sharing issues. We also conducted selected  updates in July 2008 by obtaining and reviewing the Annual Report to the  Congress on the Information Sharing Environment, dated June 30, 2008,  released after our report on the ISE was issued, and the May 2008  Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:  Designation and Sharing Controlled Unclassified Information, released  since our work on that issue. We conducted this work according to  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Are Taking Steps to Improve Terrorism- Related Information Sharing, but Existing Gaps Present Challenges for Implementing the ISE and Measuring Its Progress", "paragraphs": ["ISE stakeholders are taking steps to improve terrorism-related information  sharing, but work remains to define the scope of the ISE, roles and  responsibilities, the desired results to be achieved\u2014that is, how  information sharing should be improved\u2014and measures for assessing  progress, all elements in establishing a road map for meeting information  sharing needs and implementing the ISE. For example, because these  gaps, such as the need to better define roles and responsibilities, have not  been fully addressed, additional effort has been spent reinforcing that all  stakeholders are accountable for defining the ISE, not just the Program  Manager. For example, in response to the Intelligence Reform Act, the  President appointed a Program Manager for the ISE and on December 16,  2005, issued a memorandum to implement guiding principles\u2014the  presidential guidelines\u2014consistent with establishing and supporting the  ISE. In addition, an Information Sharing Council (ISC), chaired by the  Program Manager and currently composed of 16 other members\u2014 including designees of the Departments of State, Justice, and Homeland  Security\u2014has been established to provide interagency support and advice  to the Program Manager on the development of the ISE. A step in planning  for the ISE and putting it into operation included the issuance of the  Information Sharing Environment Implementation Plan in November  2006. This plan provides an initial structure and approach for designing  and implementing the ISE and addresses ways to meet the ISE  requirements set forth in the Intelligence Reform Act as well as the  presidential guidelines. For example:    The plan includes steps toward standardizing procedures for protecting  information privacy. One such activity identified in the plan includes  having the Program Manager and key stakeholders establish a process  for ensuring that nonfederal organizations participating in the ISE  implement appropriate policies and procedures for providing  protections.", "The plan maps out a timeline for further defining what information,  processes, and technologies are to be included in the ISE and exploring  approaches for implementing these processes and technologies. The  plan consists of a two-phased approach for implementing the ISE by  June 2009. Phase 1, originally scheduled to be completed by June 2007,  generally covers setup activities such as investigating existing or  emerging search technologies for use in the ISE, and relationship  building among stakeholders through participation on the ISC. Phase 2,  that was to commence in July 2007, covers design as well as  implementation of the ISE. The two phases are comprised of 89 total  action items organized by priority areas, such as improved terrorism  information handling. While 48 action items were to be completed by  June 2007, by the end of Phase 1, only 18 were completed. Completed  activities include development of proposed common terrorism  information sharing standards\u2014a set of standard operating procedures  intended to govern how information is to be acquired, accessed,  shared, and used within the ISE\u2014and implementation of electronic  directory services pages to help identify sources where terrorism  information may be located within the federal government and whom  to contact to access it.", "Design and implementation also incorporate independent initiatives  that federal, state, and local agencies had under way to enhance  information sharing across the government. This is in accordance with  the Intelligence Reform Act\u2019s call to build upon existing systems  capabilities in use across the government. These initiatives include the  fusion centers state and local governments created and plans to  develop a national network of these centers to improve sharing among  federal, state, and local entities. They also include the FBI\u2019s Terrorist  Screening Center, which consolidates information on known or  suspected terrorists who operate within the United States for  dissemination to federal agencies that use the information to screen  individuals for possible terrorist links.", "The plan also includes several gaps, however, which have tempered  progress in implementing the ISE. Components needed to remediate these  gaps include more fully defining the scope of the ISE, clarifying  stakeholder roles and responsibilities (i.e., that of the Program Manager as  distinguished from those of the departments and agencies that own and  must share terrorism-related information), and defining the results to be  achieved by the ISE as well as the associated milestones, performance  measures, and projects needed for effective program planning and  performance measurement. These are all important elements for  establishing a road map for and ensuring stakeholders are held  accountable in meeting information sharing needs, implementing the ISE,  and measuring progress.", "To expand on each of these three points, first, the Program Manager and  the federal agencies that are key to making the ISE work\u2014such as the  Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State\u2014still have  work to do to define the scope of the ISE, or what is and is not to be  included in it. For instance, the Program Manager and stakeholders are  still addressing fundamental questions, such as what information should  be shared, where the information resides, how the information will be  shared yet protected, how to provide access to information yet respect  privacy, and what systems and networks will be used as part of the ISE.  We recognize that the ISE will evolve over time and that these questions  will need to be revisited and the answers updated and incorporated into  the ISE. Answering these questions, at least for the near term, is important  and necessary because it helps determine the elements critical for  conveying what the ISE is to include and identifying available stakeholder  resources\u2014all components needed to establish a clear road map to  successfully implement the ISE.", "Second, the implementation plan did not clearly communicate and  distinguish the role and responsibilities of the Program Manager from  those of the key agencies in implementing the ISE and improving  information sharing. This has ultimately led to confusion over what each  stakeholder will be held accountable for in implementing and operating  the ISE. In describing the role of the Program Manager, officials at the  Office of the Program Manager noted that his role is primarily as a  facilitator and, for example, one who focuses on improving existing  business processes or remaining barriers that affect information sharing  among two or more of the five ISE communities that make up the ISE.  However, the Program Manager does not focus on processes that are  internal to ISE members unless they directly impact the wider ISE.  Agencies, on the other hand, are accountable for identifying and sharing  the terrorism information they own if the ISE is to succeed. However, at  the time of our review agencies reported that they were unclear about the  Program Manager\u2019s role or what their agencies were to provide in support  of the ISE. Meanwhile, program officials reported that agencies were not  participating consistently and effectively. As a result, this conflict has  slowed progress in implementing the ISE, as evidenced by the fact that 30  of 48 Phase 1 implementing action items remained incomplete at the end  of the phase in June 2007. To address these concerns, the President in  October 2007 released the National Strategy for Information Sharing  that reaffirmed that stakeholders at all levels of government, the private  sector, and foreign allies play a role in the ISE and further defined the role  of the Program Manager as also assisting in the development of ISE  standards and practices. However, the strategy did not further clarify the  parameters of the Program Manager\u2019s role and what is within the scope of  his responsibilities in \u201cmanaging\u201d the ISE versus other ISE stakeholders. In  November 2007, the Program Manager held a first-time, off-site meeting  with ISC members to focus on ISE priorities, clarify responsibilities, and  emphasize the importance of everyone\u2019s active participation and  leadership\u2014with the intent of rectifying any misperceptions and  reinforcing that all ISE stakeholders are responsible for the ISE. Further  delineating clear roles and responsibilities will minimize confusion over  what each stakeholder is accountable for in implementing and operating  the ISE and help minimize unnecessary delays that result.", "Finally, work also remains in further defining the results to be achieved by  the ISE, the projects needed for implementing the ISE, and the milestones  to be attained\u2014all important elements for effective program planning and  performance measurement. Existing federal guidance as well as our work  and the work of others indicates that programs should have overarching  strategic goals that state the program\u2019s aim or purpose, that define how it  will be carried out over a period of time, are outcome oriented, and that  are expressed so that progress in achieving the goals can be tracked and  measured. Moreover, these longer-term strategic goals should be  supported by interim performance goals (e.g., annual performance goals)  that are also measurable, define the results to be achieved within specified  time frames, and provide for a way to track annual and overall progress  (e.g., through measures and metrics). Following these practices can help  the Program Manager and stakeholders track progress and hold  stakeholders accountable for meeting their responsibilities and  contributions in ensuring the ISE\u2019s success.  The Program Manager and  stakeholders have taken action in accordance with these program  management principles, but gaps remain. For example, the  implementation plan identifies six longer-term strategic ISE goals. For  example, one of these goals is that to the maximum extent possible, the  ISE is to function in a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated manner.  However, the plan does not define what this goal means or set up interim  or annual goals and associated time-sensitive milestones to be built upon  to achieve the overall goal. Furthermore, the plan does not define how  agencies will measure and ensure progress in meeting the strategic goal in  the interim or overall. Instead, the plan notes that performance measures  will be developed at a later date. Moreover, with regard to identifying the  steps to be taken in implementing the ISE, the plan does not present the  projects and the sequence in which they need to be implemented to  achieve this strategic goal in the near term or in the future, or the specific  resources needed and stakeholder responsibilities. Therefore, work  remains in developing the road map for achieving this strategic goal.", "Since the issuance of the implementation plan, the Program Manager and  participating agencies have taken steps to assess progress and improve the  ISE\u2019s road map by issuing two annual reports and defining annual goals  and performance measures, in part consistent with federal guidance for  program planning and performance measurement. But taken together,  these efforts do not yet provide methods to hold agencies accountable for  ensuring that the necessary sharing of terrorism information is under way  and effective. More specifically, the first annual report issued by the  Program Manager in September 2007 describes overall progress by citing  advancements in implementing individual initiatives that contribute to the  ISE. Some of these were accomplished under the implementation plan\u2014 such as the formation of the electronic directory services\u2014and others  were achieved prior to or separate from efforts to create the ISE\u2014such as  the establishment of the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center. However, the  report does not show how much measurable progress has been made  toward implementing the ISE, how much remains to be done, or a road  map for completion. For example, the only means to track progress that  was set up in the implementation plan was the two-phased approach and  the 89 action items. But the progress report did not provide an accounting  of the status of these action items or identify how much of the  implementation had been completed. Moreover, while the 2007 annual  report identifies four performance goals for 2008, information necessary  for assessing progress in meeting these goals\u2014such as a defined starting  point or baseline against which to assess progress, targets to be reached,  or supporting performance measures and interim milestones to be  achieved in implementing the ISE\u2014is not identified.", "In the fall of 2007 the Program Manger, with input from ISE participating  agencies, developed performance measures in support of the four  performance goals identified in the annual report. These measures are  intended to improve reporting on progress in implementing the ISE and  represent an important first step in providing quantitative data for  assessing progress made in information sharing and in helping to inform  Congress and other stakeholders of specific information sharing  improvements. However, there are several gaps in these measures. For  instance, they focus on counting activities accomplished rather than  results achieved to show the extent to which ISE strategic goals and  implementation have been attained. The performance measures include,  for example, the number of ISE organizations with a procedure in place  for acquiring and processing reports on suspicious activities potentially  related to terrorism, but not how the reports are used and what difference  they are making in sharing to help prevent terrorist attacks. Similarly, the  measures attempt to assess the creation of a culture of sharing by  tabulating the percentage of relevant ISE organizations that have an  information sharing governance body or process in place, but not by  measuring the outcome\u2014such as how and to what extent cultural change  is being achieved. Taking the next step\u2014from counting activities to  measuring results or outcomes\u2014will be difficult, particularly since the  program is still being designed, but critical for accurately providing  Congress and policymakers with the information they need to assess the  amount and rate of progress, remaining gaps, and the need for any  intervening strategies.", "Though issued after we completed our June 2008 report, we subsequently  reviewed the second ISE annual report dated June 30, 2008 and  determined that the Program Manager has taken steps to improve  assessments of progress in the ISE as program officials noted they would  during our review. However, gaps still remain in defining key aspects of a  road map\u2014such as its scope, roles and responsibilities, and results to be  achieved. One improvement, for instance, is that the Program Manager  tried to better align agency activities according to the five guidelines and  two requirements presented by the President in his 2005 memorandum  rather than listing them independently. For example, toward addressing  guideline 2\u2014\u201dDevelop common standards for the sharing of information  between and among executive departments and agencies and state, local,  and tribal governments, law enforcement agencies, and the private  sector\u201d\u2014the 2008 annual report identifies the status of efforts to generate,  disseminate, and receive terrorism-related alerts, warnings, and  notifications between the federal government and state, local, and tribal  stakeholders. Also, the Program Manager laid out annual performance  goals that list specific and measurable activities to be accomplished in  2009, such as completing initial efforts to implement the new suspicious  activity reporting process\u2014an initiative for streamlining the process for  sharing information on suspicious activities or incident information with a  potential terrorism nexus between federal, state, local, and tribal partners.  Nevertheless, while the performance goals incorporate some quantitative  data for assessing progress, they continue to focus on counting activities  rather than measuring outcomes. For example, one performance goal  states that agencies will increase fusion centers\u2019 access to terrorism- related information and ISE capabilities but does not define what this goal  means and provide information on how it will be measured. Such  information might include identifying the level of access centers currently  have to information for use as a baseline from which to measure progress,  the target increase agencies are expected to achieve, and how much  achieving this goal is expected to improve sharing. While the activities  identified in the performance goals and the information provided through  the performance measures will likely enhance the fabric of what will  ultimately be the ISE, they do not yet identify the overall road map for the  ISE and provide answers to key questions regarding what the ISE will  include and will not include and how the ISE will function in, for example,  the next 3 years.", "We appreciate that the ISE and information sharing for protecting the  homeland against terrorism is a complex and ever-evolving challenge,  making development of a road map for the ISE with which to assess  progress, hold stakeholders accountable, and provide Congress and the  public with assurance that efforts are being taken to strengthen  information sharing ever more important. Therefore, to help ensure that  the ISE is on a measurable track to success, we recommended that the  Program Manager, with full participation of relevant stakeholders (e.g.,  agencies and departments on the ISE), (1) more fully define the scope and  specific results to be achieved by the ISE along with the key milestones  and individual projects or initiatives needed to achieve these results; and  (2) develop a set of performance measures that show the extent to which  the ISE has been implemented and sharing improved\u2014including, at a  minimum, what has been and remains to be accomplished\u2014so as to more  effectively account for and communicate progress and results. The  Program Manager generally agreed with these recommendations. In an  effort to address these concerns, the Program Manager recently noted in  the 2008 annual report that as the ISE matures, he expects the  performance management approach will itself mature to move from  measuring individual agency progress to measuring the overall  performance of the ISE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fusion Centers Vary in Their Characteristics, and Federal Efforts Are Under Way That Address Many of the Challenges That Centers Reported Encountering", "paragraphs": ["After September 2001, state and local governments began to establish  fusion centers to improve information sharing across levels of government  and varying disciplines and to prevent terrorism or other threats. By  September 2007, almost all states and several local governments had  established, or were in the process of establishing, fusion centers. As we  reported in October 2007, these centers varied in their level of maturity,  capability, and characteristics. For example, while some centers were just  starting out, officials in many (43 of the 58) fusion centers we contacted  described their centers as operational. Of these operational centers, 9  opened in the couple of years after September 2001, while 34 opened since  January 2004. In terms of capability, we reported that these centers ranged  from a center with analysts and access to networks and systems from  DHS, FBI, and state and local entities operating at a Top Secret level to a  center that had just appointed an officer in charge and lacked access to  any of these federal networks and systems. However, our work showed  that most of the operational fusion centers we contacted had adopted  scopes of operations and missions that included more than just  counterterrorism-related activities. For instance, officials in just over half  of the operational centers we contacted said that their scopes of  operations included all-crimes or all-crimes and terrorism, and several  noted the link between crimes and terrorism as a rationale for adopting a  broader scope of operations. Officials in about half of the operational  centers said that their centers included all-hazards information, such as  that related to public health and safety or emergency response. Overall,  center officials we contacted during our review told us that adopting a  broader focus than counterterrorism helped provide information about all  threats, and including additional stakeholders that could provide staff and  support could help increase the centers\u2019 sustainability. In terms of  organization and partnerships, law enforcement entities, such as state  police, were the lead or managing agencies in the majority of the centers  we contacted. While the centers varied in their staff sizes and partnerships  with other agencies, the majority of the operational fusion centers we  contacted had federal personnel, including staff from DHS\u2019s Office of  Intelligence and Analysis or the FBI, assigned to them as of September  2007.", "In our October 2007 report, we identified a variety of challenges\u2014many of  which were related to information sharing\u2014that fusion center officials  reported encountering in establishing and operating their centers. Among  these challenges were managing the high volume of information and the  multiple systems and networks, obtaining specific and clear guidance and  training on operational issues, obtaining and retaining qualified personnel,  and securing federal grant or state and local funding for center operations  over the long term. We also reported that to help address these challenges,  the Program Manager for the ISE, DHS, and the Department of Justice  (DOJ) had several efforts under way, and as we reported in April 2008,  many of these efforts were ongoing.", "The Program Manager for the ISE along with DHS and DOJ have efforts  under way to streamline systems, including reviewing the most  commonly used sensitive but unclassified systems to examine users\u2019  needs to identify potential areas in which to streamline system access.  In addition, these agencies are taking steps to improve the quality and  flow of information through the establishment of the Interagency  Threat Assessment and Coordination Group, which became a  statutorily mandated body by the 9/11 Commission Act. The group is  to include state, local, and tribal representative detailees who are to  provide a nonfederal perspective to the intelligence community to  produce clear, relevant, federally coordinated terrorism-related  information products intended for dissemination to state, local, and  tribal officials and to the private sector. In April 2008, we reported that  four state and local law enforcement representatives had been detailed  to this group. Further, the group\u2019s advisory council has been focusing  on recruitment for next year\u2019s detailees and determining a concept of  operations for a detailee fellowship program, according to the ISE 2008  annual report.", "The Program Manager, DHS, and DOJ have taken steps to develop  specific, clear guidance and provide technical assistance and training.  For example, they have outlined federal and fusion center roles and  responsibilities in the National Strategy for Information Sharing:  Success and Challenges in Improving Terrorism-Related  Information, which the administration issued in October 2007. They  have also disseminated specific guidance in the form of baseline  capabilities that outline minimum operational standards for centers to  ensure that they have the necessary structures, procedures, and tools  in place to support gathering, processing, analysis, and dissemination  of terrorism-related information. In addition, DHS and DOJ\u2019s technical  assistance program for fusion centers offers training and guidance on,  among other things, operational issues such as establishing a privacy  and civil liberties policy. These agencies along with the Program  Manager for the ISE and others have also sponsored regional and  national conferences designed to support fusion centers and provide  information about ongoing federal efforts.", "To facilitate information sharing and support fusion centers, DHS and  the FBI have deployed personnel, including intelligence officers and  special agents. We reported in April 2008 that according to these  agencies, DHS had deployed 23 officers to fusion centers and had plans  to place officers in as many as 35 centers by the end of fiscal year 2008,  and the FBI had assigned about 200 personnel to 44 fusion centers.", "In terms of funding, DHS reported that from fiscal years 2004 through  2007, about $257 million in DHS grant funds supported information  sharing and intelligence activities, including 415 projects designated  by states and territories for intelligence and fusion center initiatives.", "Despite DHS and FBI efforts to deploy personnel to fusion centers and  DHS\u2019s grant funding, fusion center officials were concerned about long- term sustainability\u2014both the extent of federal support they could expect  as well as the roles of their state or local jurisdictions. For example, we  reported in October 2007 that challenges for fusion centers included  uncertain or declining federal funding, finding adequate funding for  specific components of their centers\u2019 operations, and obtaining state or  local funding. One of the specific funding challenges fusion center officials  cited was time limits on the use of grant funds for personnel. Some  officials expressed concerns about maintaining their personnel levels,  such as the 2-year limit on the use of fiscal year 2007 DHS grant funds for  personnel. This limit made retaining personnel challenging because state  and local agencies may lack the resources to continue funding the  position, which could affect the centers\u2019 ability to continue to operate. In  our October 2007 report, we recommended that the federal government  determine and articulate its long-term fusion center role and whether it  expects to provide resources to help ensure their sustainability. The  National Strategy for Information Sharing stated that the federal  government will support the establishment of fusion centers and help  sustain them through grant funding, technical assistance, and training to  achieve a baseline level of capability. Similarly, the 9/11 Commission Act  includes provisions for allowing grant funding through the State Homeland  Security and Urban Areas Security Initiative grant programs to be used for  a variety of fusion-related activities, including paying salaries for  personnel. However, we reported in April 2008 that there was still  uncertainty among fusion center officials about how specifically the  federal government was planning to assist state and local governments in  sustaining their fusion centers, in particular with respect to grant funding  for intelligence analysts. Specifically, under the fiscal year 2008 Homeland  Security Grant Program guidance, costs associated with hiring intelligence  analysts were allowable for 2 years but were limited to the hiring of new  analysts. After 2 years, states and urban areas are responsible for  supporting the sustainment costs of those intelligence analysts. Legislation  introduced in May 2008, and reported by the House Committee on  Homeland Security July 10, 2008, seeks to clarify what constitutes  allowable costs under these grants. The committee found that the federal  government has placed restrictions on the use of these funds that make  long-term planning for fusion centers unmanageable. The proposed  legislation would, among other things, permit states and localities  receiving funds under either the State Homeland Security Program or the  Urban Areas Security Initiative program to use grant funds toward salaries  for analysts regardless of whether the analysts are current or new full-time  employees or contract employees and without limitations on the period of  time that these analysts can serve under the awarded grants. In addition,  to support the establishment and sustainment of a national integrated  network of fusion centers, among the federal government\u2019s planned  activities, the ISE 2008 annual report includes the development of a  national investment strategy to sustain fusion center operations, including  a delineation of current and recommended future federal and nonfederal  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A New Policy Is Intended to Streamline Processes for Sharing Sensitive but Unclassified Information", "paragraphs": ["In March 2006, we reported on a survey of 26 federal agencies that  showed they were using more than 50 different designations to protect  information that they deem critical to their missions\u2014such as law  enforcement sensitive, for official use only, and unclassified controlled  nuclear information. At that time, there were no governmentwide policies  or procedures that described the basis on which agencies should  designate, mark, and handle this information. In this absence, each agency  determined what designations to apply. We reported that such  inconsistency can lead to challenges in information sharing. In fact, more  than half of the agencies reported encountering challenges in sharing  sensitive but unclassified information. For example, 11 of the 26 agencies  reported concerns about the ability of other parties to protect sensitive but  unclassified information, while another 6 of these agencies said that the  lack of standardized criteria for defining what constitutes sensitive but  unclassified information was a challenge in their sharing efforts. In  addition, we found that the prevalence of designations can confuse those  receiving the information, such as local and state law enforcement  agencies, which in turn must understand and safeguard the information  according to each federal agency\u2019s rules. This is problematic because, as  we found, most agencies did not determine who and how many employees  could make sensitive but unclassified designations, provide them training  on how to do so, or perform periodic reviews of how well their practices  are working. Moreover there were no governmentwide policies that  required such internal control practices. We reported that if guidance and  monitoring is not provided, there is a probability that the designation will  be misapplied, potentially restricting material unnecessarily or resulting in  dissemination of information that should be restricted. Therefore, we  recommended the issuance of a policy that consolidates sensitive but  unclassified designations where possible and addresses their consistent  application across agencies, as well as a directive requiring that agencies  have in place internal controls that meet our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government\u2014including implementing guidance,  training, and review processes.", "Consistent with our recommendations and the President\u2019s December 2005  mandates calling for standardization of sensitive but unclassified  information designations, on May 9, 2008, the President issued a  memorandum that adopted CUI as the single categorical designation used  for sensitive but unclassified information throughout the executive  branch. Specifically, CUI refers to information that is outside the  standard National Security Classification system (e.g., Secret, Top Secret,  etc.) but that is (1) pertinent to the national interests of the United States  or to the important interests of entities outside the federal government and  (2) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure,  special handling safeguards, or set limits on exchange or dissemination.  Furthermore, the memo outlined a framework for designating, marking,  safeguarding, and disseminating information identified as CUI. In doing so,  the memo outlines the following three markings:    Controlled with standard dissemination, meaning the information  requires standard safeguarding measures that reduce the risks of  unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure. Dissemination is permitted to  the extent that it is reasonably believed that it would further the  execution of a lawful or official purpose.", "Controlled with specific dissemination, meaning the information  requires safeguarding measures that reduce the risks of unauthorized  or inadvertent disclosure. Material contains additional instructions on  what dissemination is permitted.", "Controlled enhanced with specified dissemination, meaning the  information requires safeguarding measures more stringent than those  normally required since the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure  would create the risk of substantial harm. Material contains additional  instructions on what dissemination is permitted.", "The memo made NARA responsible for overseeing and managing the  implementation of the CUI framework. In response, NARA established the  CUI Office to accomplish the new tasks associated with implementing the  CUI policy. The new office is to undertake nine steps for the  implementation and standardization governing CUI policy. Chief among  these are (1) establishing new safeguards and dissemination controls,   (2) publishing standards in a new official CUI Registry, (3) monitoring  department and agency compliance with CUI policy and standards,   (4) establishing required training and an associated training program for  departments and agencies, and (5) providing appropriate documentation  regarding the CUI framework to Congress; state, local, tribal, and private  entities; and foreign partners. Issuing the new policy and laying out  responsibilities is a good first step. Our work has demonstrated that  monitoring agencies\u2019 compliance with CUI policies and standards to  ensure that they implement guidelines, training, and internal controls will  help ensure that the policy is employed consistently across the federal  government and facilitate the sharing of terrorism-related information.", "Our November 2007 review of TSA\u2019s program on managing sensitive  security information showed that in response to our prior  recommendations on establishing guidance and procedures for using TSA  regulations to determine what constitutes sensitive security information,  TSA\u2019s program had instituted key components critical for the sharing of  unclassified sensitive information and could serve as a model to guide  other agencies\u2019 implementation of CUI. TSA has also shared its criteria and  examples used to help employees determine what is sensitive security  information with other DHS components. Representatives we interviewed  from these other DHS components have recognized opportunities to adapt  TSA\u2019s criteria to their offices\u2019 unique needs. Furthermore, TSA has  appointed sensitive security information coordinators at all program  offices, such as the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal  Service, among other things, to implement sensitive security information  determination policies. TSA\u2019s Office for Sensitive Security Information is  in the process of providing training to all TSA employees and contractors  on how to handle sensitive security information in accordance with its  newly adopted policies and procedures. The office has a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d  program that instructs sensitive security information program managers  and coordinators who are then expected to train appropriate staff in their  respective agencies and programs. Several aspects of the sensitive security  information training program that we evaluated are consistent with GAO- identified components of a strategic training program. Within this effort,  TSA also has processes for responding to requests for sensitive security  information from federal, state, local, and tribal government entities.  Furthermore, TSA\u2019s sensitive security information program has internal  controls in place that are consistent with governmentwide requirements  and respond to our recommendation. For example, TSA is in the process  of conducting an audit to identify existing sensitive security information  and its use, as well as evaluating a portion of records marked as  containing such information.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
