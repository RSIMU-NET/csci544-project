To ensure that the privacy rights of individuals are respected, this information must be properly protected in accordance with current law, particularly the Privacy Act and the E-Government Act of 2002. These laws prescribe specific activities that agencies must perform to protect privacy, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has developed guidance on how and in what circumstances agencies are to carry out these activities. Many agencies designate officials as focal points for privacy-related matters, and increasingly, many have created senior positions, such as chief privacy officer, to assume primary responsibility for privacy policy, as well as dedicated privacy offices. GAO was asked to testify on key challenges facing agency privacy officers. To address this issue, GAO identified and summarized issues raised in its previous reports on privacy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies and their privacy officers face growing demands in addressing privacy challenges. For example, as GAO reported in 2003, agency compliance with Privacy Act requirements was uneven, owing to ambiguities in guidance, lack of awareness, and lack of priority. While agencies generally did well with certain aspects of the Privacy Act's requirements--such as issuing notices concerning certain systems containing collections of personal information--they did less well at others, such as ensuring that information is complete, accurate, relevant, and timely before it is disclosed to a nonfederal organization. In addition, the E-Gov Act requires that agencies perform privacy impact assessments (PIA) on such information collections. Such assessments are important to ensure, among other things, that information is handled in a way that conforms to privacy requirements. However, in work on commercial data resellers, GAO determined in 2006 that many agencies did not perform PIAs on systems that used reseller information, believing that these were not required. In addition, in public notices on these systems, agencies did not always reveal that information resellers were among the sources to be used. To address such challenges, chief privacy officers can work with officials from OMB and other agencies to identify ambiguities and provide clarifications about the applicability of privacy provisions, such as in situations involving the use of reseller information. In addition, as senior officials, they can increase agency awareness and raise the priority of privacy issues. Agencies and privacy officers will also face the challenge of ensuring that privacy protections are not compromised by advances in technology. For example, federal agency use of data mining--the analysis of large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns and relationships--was initially aimed at detecting financial fraud and abuse. Increasingly, however, the use of this tool has expanded to include purposes such as detecting terrorist threats. GAO found in 2005 that agencies employing data mining took many steps needed to protect privacy (such as issuing public notices), but none followed all key procedures (such as including in these notices the intended uses of personal information). Another new technology development presenting privacy challenges is radio frequency identification (RFID), which uses wireless communication to transmit data and thus electronically identify, track, and store information on tags attached to or embedded in objects. GAO reported in 2005 that federal agencies use or propose to use the technology for physical access controls and tracking assets, documents, or materials. For example, the Department of Defense was using RFID to track shipments. Although such applications are not likely to generate privacy concerns, others could, such as the use of RFIDs by the federal government to track the movement of individuals traveling within the United States. Agency privacy offices can serve as a key mechanism for ensuring that privacy is fully addressed in agency approaches to new technologies such as data mining and RFID."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss key  challenges facing federal agency privacy officers. As the federal  government obtains and processes personal information about  citizens and residents in increasingly diverse ways and for  increasingly sophisticated purposes, it remains critically important  that this information be properly protected and the privacy rights of  individuals respected. Advances in information technology make it  easier than ever for agencies to acquire data on individuals, analyze  it for a variety of purposes, and share it with other governmental  and nongovernmental entities. Further, the demands of the war on  terror put additional pressure on agencies to extract as much value  as possible from the information available to them, adding to the  potential for compromising privacy. It is in this context that agency  privacy officers must continually strive to ensure that the privacy  rights of individuals remain adequately respected.", "As requested, my statement will focus on key privacy challenges  facing agency privacy officers, including those at the Departments  of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice.

The major requirements for th protection of personal privacy by federal agencies come from two  laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002.  The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISM A)  also addresses the protection of personal information in the context  of securing federal agency information and information systems.", "The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection,  disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in s ystems  of records. The act describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or  grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by a agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier.  It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of records under the  control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the  n  name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy A requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system  of records, they must notify the public by a \u201csystem-of-records  notice\u201d: that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, amo other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals  about whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d use data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct  personal information. Among other provisions, the act also requires  agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined  purposes. For example, the act requires that to the greatest ext ent  practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s rights or  benefits under a federal program.", "The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of  principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal  information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which w first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee;  these principles were intended to address what the committee  termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under  contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Pra ctices  have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating  the adequacy of privacy protections. Attachment 2 contains a  summary of the widely used version of the Fair Information  Practices adopted by the Organization for Economic Coopera and Development in 1980.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for  personal information in government information systems or  information collections by requiring that agencies conduct pr impact assessments (PIA). A PIA is an analysis of how personal  information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federa l  system. More specifically, according to Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) guidance, a PIA is an analysis of how information ishandled. Specifically, a PIA is to (1) ensure that handling conforms  to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding  privacy; (2) determine the risks and effects of collecting,  maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable an electronic information system; and (3) examine and evaluate  protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.", "Agencies must conduct PIAs (1) before developing or procuring  information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in a personally identifiable form; or (2) before  initiating any new data collections involving personal information  that will be collected, maintained, or disseminated using  information technology if the same questions are asked of 10 or  more people. To the extent that PIAs are made publicly available they provide explanations to the public about such things as the  information that will be collected, why it is being collected, how  to be used, and how the system and data will be maintained and  protected.", "FISMA also addresses the protection of personal information.  FISMA defines federal requirements for securing information a information systems that support federal agency operations and  assets; it requires agencies to develop agencywide information  security programs that extend to contractors and other provider federal data and systems. Under FISMA, information security  means protecting information and information systems from  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification destruction, including controls necessary to preserve authorized  , or  restrictions on access and disclosure to protect personal privacy,  among other things.", "OMB is tasked with providing guidance to agencies on how to  implement the provisions of the Privacy Act and the E-Government  Act and has done so, beginning with guidance on the Privacy Act,  issued in 1975. The guidance provides explanations for the various  provisions of the law as well as detailed instructions for how to  comply. OMB\u2019s guidance on implementing the privacy provisions of  the E-Government Act of 2002 identifies circumstances under which  agencies must conduct PIAs and explains how to conduct them.  OMB has also issued guidance on implementing the provisions of  FISMA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Privacy Officers Have Gained Prominence at Several Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["While many agencies have had officials designated as focal points  for privacy-related matters for some time, these positions have  recently gained greater prominence at a number of agencies. A long- standing requirement has been in place for agency chief information  officers to be responsible for implementing and enforcing privacy  policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines, and for compliance  with the Privacy Act. In 2004, we reported that of the 27 major  agency chief information officers, 17 were responsible for privacy  and 10 were not. In those 10 agencies, privacy was most often the  responsibility of the Office of General Counsel and/or various  offices focusing on compliance with the Freedom of Information Act  and the Privacy Act.", "Steps have been taken recently to highlight the importance of  privacy officers in federal agencies. For example, the  Transportation, Treasury, Independent Agencies, and General  Government Appropriations Act of 2005 required each agency  covered by the act to have a chief privacy officer responsible for,  among other things, \u201cassuring that the use of technologies sustain,  and do not erode, privacy protections relating to the use, collection,  and disclosure of information in identifiable form.\u201d Subsequently, in  February 2005, OMB issued a memorandum to federal agencies  requiring them to designate a senior official with overall agencywide  responsibility for information privacy issues. This senior official was  to have overall responsibility and accountability for ensuring the  agency\u2019s implementation of information privacy protections and  play a central policy-making role in the agency\u2019s development and  evaluation of policy proposals relating to the agency\u2019s collection,  use, sharing, and disclosure of personal information.", "Prior to the OMB guidance, several agencies had already designated  privacy officials at higher levels. The Internal Revenue Service had  been one of the first, establishing its privacy advocate in 1993. In  2001, the Postal Service established a Chief Privacy Officer. More  recently, as you know, Section 222 of the Homeland Security Act of  2002 had created the first statutorily required senior privacy official  at any federal agency. This law mandated the appointment of a  senior official at DHS to assume primary responsibility for privacy  policy, including, among other things, assuring that the use of  technologies sustains, and does not erode, privacy protections  relating to the use, collection, and disclosure of personal  information. Since being established, the DHS Privacy Office  created a Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee, made up  of experts from the private and non-profit sectors and the academic  community, to advise it on issues within DHS that affect individual  privacy, as well as data integrity, interoperability, and other privacy- related issues.", "Through the Intelligence Reform Act in 2004, Congress expressed  more broadly the sense that agencies with law enforcement or anti- terrorism functions should have a privacy and civil liberties officer.  In keeping with that, Justice recently announced the appointment of  a Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer responsible for reviewing  and overseeing the department\u2019s privacy operations and complying  with privacy laws. Justice has also announced plans to establish an  internal Privacy and Civil Liberties Board made up of senior Justice  officials to assist in ensuring that the department\u2019s activities are  carried out in a way that fully protects the privacy and civil liberties  of Americans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Privacy Officers Face a Number of Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The elevation of privacy officers at federal agencies reflects the  growing demands that these individuals face in addressing privacy  challenges on a day-to-day basis. Among these challenges, several  that are prominent include (1) complying with the Privacy Act and  the E-Government Act of 2002, (2) ensuring that data mining efforts  do not compromise privacy protections, (3) controlling the  collection and use of personal information obtained from  commercial sources, and (4) addressing concerns about radio  frequency identification technology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Complying with the Privacy Act and the E-Government Act of 2002", "paragraphs": ["Although it has been on the books for more than 30 years, the  Privacy Act of 1974 continues to pose challenges for federal  agencies. In 2003, we reported that agencies generally did well with  certain aspects of the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements\u2014such as issuing  system-of-records notices when required\u2014but did less well at other  requirements, such as ensuring that information is complete,  accurate, relevant, and timely before it is disclosed to a nonfederal  organization. In discussing this uneven compliance, agency officials  reported the need for additional OMB leadership and guidance to  assist in difficult implementation issues in a rapidly changing  environment. For example, officials had questions about the act\u2019s  applicability to electronic records. Additional issues included the  low agency priority given to implementing the act and insufficient  employee training on the act.", "These are all issues that chief privacy officers could be in a position  to address. For example, working in concert with officials from  OMB and other agencies, they are in a position to identify  ambiguities in guidance and provide clarifications about the  applicability of the Privacy Act. Further, the establishment of a chief  privacy officer position and its relative seniority within an agency\u2019s  organizational structure could indicate that an agency places  priority on implementing the act. Finally, a chief privacy officer  could also serve as a champion for privacy awareness and education  across an agency.", "The E-Government Act\u2019s requirement that agencies conduct PIAs is  relatively recent, and we have not yet made a comprehensive  assessment of agencies\u2019 implementation of this important provision.  However, our previous work has highlighted challenges with respect  to conduct of these assessments for certain applications. For  example, in our work on federal agency use of information  resellers, we found that few agency components reported  developing PIAs for their systems or programs that make use of  information reseller data. These agencies often did not conduct PIAs  because officials did not believe they were required. Current OMB  guidance on conducting PIAs is not always clear about when they  should be conducted. We concluded that until PIAs are conducted  more thoroughly and consistently, the public is likely to remain  incompletely informed about the purposes and uses for the  information agencies obtain from resellers. We recommended that  OMB revise its guidance to clarify the applicability of the E-Gov  Act\u2019s PIA requirement (as well as Privacy Act requirements) to the  use of personal information from resellers.", "Compliance with OMB\u2019s PIA guidance was also an issue in our  review of selected data mining efforts at federal agencies. In that  review, although three of the five data mining efforts we assessed  had conducted PIAs, none of these assessments fully complied with  OMB guidance. Complete assessments are an important tool for  agencies to identify areas of noncompliance with federal privacy  laws, evaluate risks arising from electronic collection and  maintenance of information about individuals, and evaluate  protections or alternative processes needed to mitigate the risks  identified. Agencies that do not take all the steps required to protect  the privacy of personal information limit the ability of individuals to  participate in decisions that affect them, as required by law, and risk  the improper exposure or alteration of personal information. We  recommended that the agencies responsible for the data mining  efforts complete or revise PIAs as needed and make them available  to the public.", "The DHS Privacy Office recently issued detailed guidance on  conducting PIAs that may be helpful to departmental components  as they develop and implement systems that involved personal  information. The guidance notes that PIAs can be one of the most  important instruments in establishing trust between the department  and the public. As agencies develop or make changes to existing  systems that collect personally identifiable information, it will  continue to be critical for privacy officers to monitor agency  activities and help ensure that PIAs are properly conducted so that  their benefits can be realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring that Data Mining Efforts Do Not Compromise Privacy Protections", "paragraphs": ["Many concerns have been raised about the potential for data mining  programs at federal agencies to compromise personal privacy. In  our May 2004 report on federal data mining efforts, we defined data  mining as the application of database technology and techniques\u2014 such as statistical analysis and modeling\u2014to uncover hidden  patterns and subtle relationships in data and to infer rules that allow  for the prediction of future results. We based this definition on the  most commonly used terms found in a survey of the technical  literature. As we noted in our report, mining government and private  databases containing personal information raises a range of privacy  concerns.", "In the government, data mining was initially used to detect financial  fraud and abuse. However, its use has greatly expanded. Among  other purposes, data mining has been used increasingly as a tool to  help detect terrorist threats through the collection and analysis of  public and private sector data. Through data mining, agencies can  quickly and efficiently obtain information on individuals or groups  by exploiting large databases containing personal information  aggregated from public and private records. Information can be  developed about a specific individual or a group of individuals  whose behavior or characteristics fit a specific pattern. The ease  with which organizations can use automated systems to gather and  analyze large amounts of previously isolated information raises  concerns about the impact on personal privacy. Before data  aggregation and data mining came into use, personal information  contained in paper records stored at widely dispersed locations,  such as courthouses or other government offices, was relatively  difficult to gather and analyze.", "In August 2005, we reported on five different data mining efforts at  selected federal agencies, noting that although the agencies  responsible for these data mining efforts took many of the steps  needed to protect the privacy and security of personal information  used in the efforts, none followed all key procedures. Most of the  agencies provided a general public notice about the collection and  use of the personal information used in their data mining efforts.  However, fewer followed other required steps, such as notifying  individuals about the intended uses of their personal information  when it was collected or ensuring the security and accuracy of the  information used in their data mining efforts. In addition, as I  previously mentioned, although three of the five agencies completed  privacy impact assessments of their data mining efforts, none fully  complied with OMB guidance. We made recommendations to the  agencies responsible for the five data mining efforts to ensure that  their efforts included adequate privacy and security protections.", "In March 2004, an advisory committee chartered by the Department  of Defense issued a comprehensive report on privacy concerns  regarding data mining in the fight against terrorism. The report  made numerous recommendations to better ensure that privacy  requirements are clear and stressed that proper oversight be in  place when agencies engage in data mining that could include  personal information. Agency privacy offices can provide a degree  of internal oversight to help ensure that privacy is fully addressed in  agency data mining activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controlling the Collection and Use of Personal Information Obtained from Commercial Sources", "paragraphs": ["Recent security breaches at large information resellers, such as  ChoicePoint and LexisNexis, have highlighted the extent to which  such companies collect and disseminate personal information.  Information resellers are companies that collect information,  including personal information about consumers, from a wide  variety of sources for the purpose of reselling such information to  their customers, which include both private-sector businesses and  government agencies. Before advanced computerized techniques  made aggregating and disseminating such information relatively  easy, much personal information was less accessible, being stored in  paper-based public records at courthouses and other government  offices or in the files of nonpublic businesses. However, information  resellers have now amassed extensive amounts of personal  information about large numbers of Americans, and federal agencies  access this information for a variety of reasons.", "A major task confronting federal agencies, especially those engaged  in antiterrorism tasks, has been to ensure that information obtained  from resellers is being appropriately used and protected. To this  end, in September 2005, the DHS Privacy Office held a public  workshop to examine the policy, legal, and technology issues  associated with the government\u2019s use of reseller data for homeland  security. Participants provided suggestions on how the government  can ensure that privacy is protected while enabling the agencies to  analyze reseller data.", "We recently testified before this subcommittee on critical issues  surrounding the federal government\u2019s acquisition and use of  personal information from information resellers. In our review of  the acquisition of personal information from resellers by DHS,  Justice, the Department of State, and the Social Security  Administration, agency practices for handling this information did  not always reflect the Fair Information Practices. For example,  although agencies issued public notices on information collections,  these did not always notify the public that information resellers  were among the sources to be used, a practice inconsistent with the  principle that individuals should be informed about privacy policies  and the collection of information. And again, a contributing factor  was ambiguities in guidance from OMB regarding the applicability of  privacy requirements in this situation. As I mentioned previously, we  recommended that OMB revise its guidance to clarify the  applicability of governing laws\u2014both the Privacy Act and the E-Gov  Act\u2014to the use of personal information from resellers.", "In July 2005, we reported on shortcomings at DHS\u2019s Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) in connection with its test of the use  of reseller data for the Secure Flight airline passenger screening  program. TSA did not fully disclose to the public its use of personal  information in its fall 2004 privacy notices, as required by the  Privacy Act. In particular, the public was not made fully aware of,  nor had the opportunity to comment on, TSA\u2019s use of personal  information drawn from commercial sources to test aspects of the  Secure Flight program. In September 2004 and November 2004, TSA  issued privacy notices in the Federal Register that included  descriptions of how such information would be used. However,  these notices did not fully inform the public before testing began  about the procedures that TSA and its contractors would follow for  collecting, using, and storing commercial data. In addition, the  scope of the data used during commercial data testing was not fully  disclosed in the notices. Specifically, a TSA contractor, acting on  behalf of the agency, collected more than 100 million commercial  data records containing personal information such as name, date of  birth, and telephone number without informing the public. As a  result of TSA\u2019s actions, the public did not receive the full  protections of the Privacy Act. In its comments on our findings, DHS  stated that it recognized the merits of the issues we raised, and that  TSA acted immediately to address them.", "In our report on information resellers, we recommended that the  Director, OMB, revise privacy guidance to clarify the applicability of  requirements for public notices and privacy impact assessments to  agency use of personal information from resellers and direct  agencies to review their uses of such information to ensure it is  explicitly referenced in privacy notices and assessments. Further,  we recommended that agencies develop specific policies for the use  of personal information from resellers. Until privacy requirements  are better defined and broadly understood, agency privacy officers  are likely to continue to face challenges in helping ensure that their  agencies are providing appropriate privacy protections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Concerns about Radio Frequency Identification Technology", "paragraphs": ["Specific issues about the design and content of identity cards also  raise broader privacy concerns associated with the adoption of new  technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID). RFID is  an automated data-capture technology that can be used to  electronically identify, track, and store information contained on a  tag. The tag can be attached to or embedded in the object to be  identified, such as a product, case, or pallet. RFID technology  provides identification and tracking capabilities by using wireless  communication to transmit data. In May 2005, we reported that  major initiatives at federal agencies that use or propose to use the  technology included physical access controls and tracking assets,  documents, or materials. For example, DHS was using RFID to  track and identify assets, weapons, and baggage on flights. The  Department of Defense was also using it to track shipments.", "In our May 2005 report we identified several privacy issues related  to both commercial and federal use of RFID technology. Among  these privacy issues are notifying individuals of the existence or use  of the technology; tracking an individual\u2019s movements; profiling an  individual\u2019s habits, tastes, or predilections; and allowing for  secondary uses of information. The extent and nature of the  privacy issues depends on the specific proposed use. For example,  using the technology for generic inventory control would not likely  generate substantial privacy concerns. However, the use of RFIDs  by the federal government to track the movement of individuals  traveling within the United States could generate concern by the  affected parties.", "A number of specific privacy issues can arise from RFID use. For  example, individuals may not be aware that the technology is being  used and that it could be embedded in items they are carrying and  thus used to track them. Three agencies indicated to us that  employing the technology would allow for the tracking of  employees\u2019 movements. Tracking is real-time or near-real-time  surveillance in which a person\u2019s movements are followed through  RFID scanning. Media reports have described concerns about ways  in which anonymity is likely to be undermined by surveillance.  Further, public surveys have identified a distinct unease with the  potential ability of the federal government to monitor individuals\u2019  movements and transactions. Like tracking, profiling\u2014the  reconstruction of a person\u2019s movements or transactions over a  specific period of time, usually to ascertain something about the  individual\u2019s habits, tastes, or predilections\u2014could also be  undertaken through the use of RFID technology. Because tags can  contain unique identifiers, once a tagged item is associated with a  particular individual, personally identifiable information can be  obtained and then aggregated to develop a profile of the individual.  Both tracking and profiling can compromise an individual\u2019s privacy  and anonymity.", "Concerns also have been raised that organizations could develop  secondary uses for the information gleaned through RFID  technology; this has been referred to as \u201cmission-\u201d or \u201cfunction- creep.\u201d The history of the Social Security number, for example, gives  ample evidence of how an identifier developed for one specific use  has become a mainstay of identification for many other purposes,  governmental and nongovernmental. Secondary uses of the Social  Security number have been a matter not of technical controls but  rather of changing policy and administrative priorities.", "As agencies take advantage of the benefits of RFID technology and  implement it more widely, it will be critical for privacy officers to  help ensure that a full consideration is made of potential privacy  issues, both short-term and long-term, as the technology is  implemented.", "In summary, privacy officers at federal agencies face a range of  challenges in working to ensure that individual privacy is protected,  and today I have discussed several of them. It is clear that advances  in technology can present both opportunities for greater agency  efficiency and effectiveness as well as the danger, if unaddressed, of  eroding important privacy protections. Technological advances also  mean there is a need to keep governmentwide privacy guidance up- to-date, and agency privacy officers will depend on OMB for  leadership in this area. Even without a consideration of  technological evolution, privacy officers need to be vigilant to  ensure that agency officials are continually mindful of their privacy  responsibilities. Fortunately, tools are available\u2014including the  requirements for PIAs and Privacy Act public notices\u2014that can help  ensure that the right operational decisions are made about the  acquisition, use, and storage of personal information.
