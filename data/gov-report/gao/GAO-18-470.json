For example:", "DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started the acquisition process for a Border Wall System Program and issued task orders to design and construct barrier prototypes. In November 2017, CBP awarded a contract worth up to $297 million to help with hiring 5,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents, 2,000 CBP officers, and 500 Air and Marine Operations agents.", "DOJ issued memoranda providing guidance for federal prosecutors on prioritizing certain immigration-related criminal offenses. Additionally, from March through October 2017, DOJ detailed approximately 40 immigration judge positions to detention centers and to the southern border to conduct removal and other related proceedings, according to DOJ officials.", "State participated in an interagency working group to develop uniform standards related to the adjudication of visa applications, interviews, and system security checks. State also implemented visa and refugee entry restrictions in accordance with the Supreme Court's June 26, 2017, ruling.", "Agency officials anticipate that implementing the executive orders will be a multi-year endeavor comprising additional reporting, planning, and other actions.", "DHS, DOJ, and State used existing fiscal year 2017 resources to support initial executive order actions that fit within their established mission areas. GAO found that it was not always possible to disaggregate which fiscal year 2017 funds were used for implementation of the orders versus other agency activities. All three agencies indicated that they used existing personnel to implement the orders and, in some cases, these efforts took substantial time. For example, according to ICE data, personnel spent about 14,000 regular hours (the equivalent of 1,750 8-hour days) and 2,400 overtime hours planning for the ICE hiring surge from January 2017 through January 2018.", "In March 2017, the President submitted a budget amendment along with a request for $3 billion in supplemental appropriations for DHS to implement the orders. In May 2017, DHS received an appropriation of just over $1.1 billion, some of which DHS used to fund actions to implement the orders. For example, CBP received $65 million for hiring and, according to CBP officials, used these funds to plan and prepare for the surge in U.S. Border Patrol agents. As of January 2018, CBP had obligated $18.8 million of the $65 million.", "Agencies plan to continue to use their base budgets and request additional funds as needed to carry out their missions and implement the orders. For example, for fiscal year 2018, CBP requested approximately $1.6 billion and received (in March 2018) approximately $1.3 billion to build new and replace existing sections of physical barriers along the southern border. For fiscal year 2019, ICE requested $571 million to hire 2,000 immigration officers and DOJ requested approximately $40 million to hire new immigration judges and supporting staff."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2017, the President issued a series of executive orders related to  border security and immigration. The orders direct federal agencies to  take a broad range of actions with potential resource implications.  Specifically, Executive Order 13767, Border Security and Immigration  Enforcement Improvements, instructs the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) to immediately plan, design, and construct a wall or other  physical barriers along the U.S. southern border and to hire an additional  5,000 U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) agents, among other border  security initiatives. Executive Order 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in  the Interior of the United States, instructs federal agencies, including DHS  and the Department of Justice (DOJ), to ensure that U.S immigration law  is enforced against all removable individuals; establishes the  administration\u2019s enforcement priorities; and directs U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hire an additional 10,000 immigration  officers, among other things. Finally, Executive Order 13780, Protecting  the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, among  other things, states that it is U.S. policy to improve the screening and  vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance  process and U.S. Refugee Admissions Program; imposed visa entry  restrictions on foreign nationals from certain listed countries for a 90-day  period; and suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days.", "In light of the number of policy and programmatic requirements in the  executive orders, you asked us to review federal agency actions and  budgetary costs associated with implementation. This report examines (1)  actions DHS, DOJ, and the Department of State (State) have taken, or  plan to take, to implement provisions of the executive orders; and (2)  resources to implement provisions of the executive orders, particularly  funds DHS, DOJ, and State have obligated, expended, or shifted.", "For the purposes of this review, we focused our audit work on DHS, DOJ,  and State because they are responsible for implementing the majority of  the provisions in the three executive orders. To address the first  objective, we identified actions planned, completed, or underway at DHS,  DOJ, and State as of March 2018 by reviewing and cataloguing specific  provisions included in the executive orders and by reviewing available  agency-wide planning and tracking documents, such as a DHS inventory  of tasks related to the executive orders and their implementation status.  We also obtained and reviewed executive order-related memoranda  issued by agency leadership to identify actions they directed within their  respective departments. We conducted semi-structured interviews with  officials at key components, program offices, and bureaus at the three  agencies, and utilized a data collection instrument in which we asked  agencies to identify actions either planned, completed, or underway to  implement the executive orders. We corroborated actions identified with  documentation, such as recruiting and hiring plans and statements of  work. Additionally, we reviewed strategic and operational policies,  guidance, and memoranda that agencies developed or revised in  response to executive order provisions.", "To address the second objective, we worked to identify any funds DHS,  DOJ, and State obligated, expended, or shifted within or between  appropriation accounts to implement tangible, measurable, and  quantifiable executive order provisions. Specifically, we reviewed the  executive orders and placed each provision into one of three categories:  (1) analyses and reports, (2) policies, and (3) programs. We defined the  analyses and reports category as executive order provisions that direct  agencies to review and analyze data, policies, processes, and operational  mission areas and produce reports. We defined the policies category as  executive order provisions that establish new or modify existing policies,  guidance, or processes related to border security or immigration. We  defined the programs category as tangible, measurable, and quantifiable  executive order provisions that implement policies. We confirmed our  categorization with each agency, particularly for the programs category,  since the extent to which a provision is tangible, measurable, and  quantifiable was not always clearly discernable. To confirm the programs  category for DHS, we conducted a crosswalk between our internal  categorization, actions in the DHS inventory of tasks, and provisions that  the DHS Office of Budget identified as requiring resources. To confirm the  programs category for DOJ and State, we corroborated our categorization  by asking officials from each agency if actions taken or planned to  implement the provisions required resources. In some cases, we moved  policy provisions to the program category if agency efforts underway to  implement the policy were programmatic in nature.", "For each agency, we collected available budgetary information\u2014 specifically, any funds requested, appropriated, obligated, and  expended\u2014from January 2017 through March 2018 for the  implementation of executive order provisions that we categorized as  programs. We reviewed publicly available budget requests, congressional  budget justifications, appropriations acts, and budgetary data from  agencies\u2019 internal data systems. While we were able to identify certain  funds requested, provided, or designated for executive order  implementation from these documents, it was not always possible to  extract funds specifically meant for implementing the executive orders  from budget requests, appropriations, or expenditures for more general  purposes. To specifically identify funds used for executive order  implementation, we reviewed agency documentation, interviewed agency  budget and program officials, and submitted written questions as  necessary. In instances where there was no explicit distinction between  funds for executive order implementation and funds for regular  operations, we identified, and made note of, the larger account used for  executive order implementation. In addition, where agencies identified  that they used personnel resources to implement the executive orders,  we collected related data as available. We analyzed agency  documentation on the policies, procedures, and processes for maintaining  internal data and interviewed agency officials about their data collection  practices to assess the reliability of these data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To further address our second objective, we identified official  reprogramming or transfer requests and approvals specifically for  implementation of executive order provisions that we categorized as  programs. We also interviewed DHS, DOJ, and State budget officials to  identify any funds that were re-classified, reallocated, or otherwise shifted  for different programs, activities, or purposes at lower thresholds not  subject to time and condition limitations for official reprogramming or  transfer requests. Additionally, we collected and reviewed documentation  related to funds moved from existing programs to implement the  executive orders from January 2017 through March 2018. We  corroborated this information by interviewing agency budget and program  officials to determine resource prioritization and what funds, if any,  agencies reprogrammed or transferred\u2014or planned to reprogram or  transfer\u2014from other existing programs to implement the executive orders.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to June 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Specifically, the  order directed agencies to conduct a worldwide review to identify any  additional information needed from each foreign country to adjudicate  visas and other immigration benefits to ensure that individuals applying  for such benefits are not a security or public-safety threat. The order  also instituted visa entry restrictions for nationals from certain listed  countries for a 90-day period; directed agencies to develop a uniform  baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures; and  suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days in order  to review refugee application and adjudication procedures. The order  further directed DHS to expedite the completion and implementation of a  biometric entry-exit tracking system for travelers to the United States.  Implementation of Executive Order 13780 entry restrictions for visa  travelers and refugees commenced on June 29, 2017, subject to a June  26 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court prohibiting enforcement of such  restrictions against foreign nationals with a credible claim of a bona fide  relationship to a person or entity in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Budget Process and Status Since Executive Order Issuance", "paragraphs": ["The federal budget process provides the means for the President and  Congress to make informed decisions between competing national needs  and policies, allocate resources among federal agencies, and ensure  laws are executed according to established priorities. The President  generally submits the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year to  Congress no later than the first Monday of February (e.g. the fiscal year  2019 budget request was submitted in February 2018). To ensure there is  not a lapse in appropriations for one or more federal departments or  agencies, regular appropriations bills must be enacted to fund the  government before the expiration of the prior appropriations, which would  typically be in effect through September 30 in a regular appropriations  cycle. If these regular full-year appropriations bills are not enacted by the  deadline, Congress must pass a continuing appropriation (or resolution)  to temporarily fund government operations into the next fiscal year. For  fiscal year 2017, multiple continuing appropriations were enacted to  extend funding until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, was  enacted in May 2017.", "At the time the President issued the executive orders in January and  March of 2017, agencies were operating under a continuing appropriation  which did not incorporate any funding explicitly for the administration\u2019s  immigration and border security priorities, such as hiring 5,000 additional  Border Patrol agents. The administration sought additional funds to  implement the executive orders through an out-of-cycle March 2017  budget amendment and supplemental appropriations request for the  remainder of fiscal year 2017. In May 2017, Congress provided funding  for selected priorities through the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2017.

Each agency took a distinct approach to implementing  the orders based on its organizational structure and the scope of its  responsibilities. Each executive order established near-term reporting  requirements for agencies, including updates on the status of their efforts,  studies to inform planning and implementation, and reports for the public.  According to officials, agencies focused part of their initial implementation  efforts on meeting these reporting requirements. In addition, agencies  developed and revised policies, initiated planning efforts, and made initial  program changes (such as expanding or expediting programs) to reflect  the administration\u2019s priorities.", "DHS: DHS established an Executive Order Task Force (EOTF), which  was responsible for coordinating and tracking initial component actions to  implement the executive orders. The EOTF assembled an operational  planning team with representatives from key DHS components, such as  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE. The EOTF and the  planning team inventoried tasks in the orders, assigned component  responsibilities for tasks, and monitored the status of the tasks through an  online tracking mechanism and weekly coordination meetings.  Additionally, the EOTF coordinated and moved reports required by the  orders through DHS. For example, Section 4 of Executive Order 13767  directed DHS to produce a comprehensive study of the security of the  southern border. DHS completed and submitted this report to the White  House on November 22, 2017, according to EOTF officials. DHS also  publicly issued three Declined Detainer Outcome Reports pursuant to  Section 9 of Executive Order 13768. Additionally, EOTF officials stated  that, in 2017, DHS produced and submitted to the White House 90-day  and 180-day reports on the progress of implementing Executive Orders  13767 and 13768.", "The Secretary of Homeland Security issued two memoranda establishing  policy and providing guidance related to Executive Orders 13767 and  13768 in February 2017. One memorandum implemented Executive  Order 13767 by outlining new policies designed to stem illegal entry into  the United States and to facilitate the detection, apprehension, detention,  and removal of foreign nationals seeking to unlawfully enter or remain in  the United States. For example, the memorandum directed U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), CBP, and ICE to ensure  that appropriate guidance and training is provided to agency officials to  ensure proper exercise of parole in accordance with existing statue. The  other memorandum implemented Executive Order 13768 and provided  additional guidance with respect to the enforcement of immigration laws.  For example, it terminated the Priority Enforcement Program, under which  ICE prioritized the apprehension, detention, and removal of foreign  nationals who posed threats to national security, public safety, or border  security, including convicted felons; and restored the Secure  Communities Program, pursuant to which ICE may also target for removal  those charged, but not yet convicted, of criminal offenses, among others.  Additionally, the memorandum reiterated DHS\u2019s general enforcement  priorities. ICE, CBP, and USCIS may allocate resources to prioritize  enforcement activities as they deem appropriate, such as by prioritizing  enforcement against convicted felons or gang members.", "DHS components subsequently issued additional guidance further  directing efforts to implement the executive orders and apply the  guidance from the memoranda. For example, ICE issued guidance to its  legal program to review all cases previously administratively closed based  on prosecutorial discretion. ICE\u2019s new guidance requested its attorneys  to determine whether the basis for closure remains appropriate under  DHS\u2019s new enforcement priorities. USCIS also reviewed its guidance for  credible and reasonable fear determinations\u2014the initial step for certain  removable individuals to demonstrate they are eligible to be considered  for particular forms of relief or protection from removal in immigration  court. As a result, USCIS made select modifications pursuant to  Executive Order 13767, including adding language related to evaluating  an applicant\u2019s credibility based on prior statements made to other DHS  officials, such as CBP and ICE officers.", "DHS also initiated a number of planning and programmatic actions to  implement the executive orders. In some cases DHS components  expanded or enhanced existing regular, ongoing agency activities and  programs in response to the orders. For example, in response to  Executive Order 13768, ICE officials reported that they expanded the use  of the existing Criminal Alien Program. In other instances, DHS  components altered their activities consistent with the administration\u2019s  immigration priorities. For instance, in response to Executive Order 13768, the Secretary of Homeland Security directed ICE to terminate  outreach or advocacy services to potentially removable foreign nationals,  and reallocate all resources currently used for such purposes to a new  office to assist victims of crimes allegedly perpetrated by removable  foreign nationals (the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or  VOICE, office, established in April 2017). Additional examples of planning  and programmatic actions that DHS took, or officials reported taking, in  response to the executive orders are described in table 2.", "DOJ: Within DOJ, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General coordinated  and oversaw DOJ\u2019s initial implementation of key provisions in the  executive orders, according to DOJ officials. Specifically, DOJ officials  said that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General coordinated and  collected information for executive order reporting requirements and  participated in an interagency working group related to Executive Order  13780, and interagency meetings related to Executive Order 13767.  However, DOJ components were responsible for implementing the  provisions and ensuring that they met executive order requirements. In  addition, DOJ assisted in the creation and issuance of various reports.  For example, officials told us that DOJ provided data to State for a report  on foreign assistance to the Mexican government, as required by Section  9 of Executive Order 13767. DOJ also jointly issued three reports with  DHS in response to Executive Order 13768 Section 16, which included  information regarding the immigration status of foreign-born individuals  incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and  in pre-trial detention in U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) custody.", "The Attorney General issued two memoranda providing policy and  guidance related to Executive Orders 13767 and 13768 in April and May  of 2017. The April 2017 memorandum contains guidance for federal  prosecutors on prioritizing certain immigration-related criminal offenses.  For example, the memorandum requires that federal prosecutors consider  prosecution of foreign nationals who illegally re-enter the United States  after prior removal, and prioritize defendants with criminal histories. The  May 2017 memorandum addresses Executive Order 13768\u2019s provision  directing DOJ and DHS to ensure that jurisdictions willfully prohibiting  immigration status-related communication with the federal government  (referred to as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d) are not eligible for federal grants.  It requires jurisdictions to certify their compliance with 8 U.S.C \u00a71373,  under which a federal, state, or local government entity or official may not  prohibit, or in any way restrict the exchange of citizenship or immigration  status information with DHS.", "Additionally, DOJ took a number of initial planning and programmatic  steps to implement the executive orders. DOJ officials stated that some  provisions outlined in the executive orders represent regular, ongoing  agency activities and did not require any major changes to be  implemented. For example, DOJ detailed Assistant United States  Attorneys (AUSAs) and immigration judges to southern border districts  and detention centers to assist in prosecutions and to conduct removal  proceedings in response to the executive orders. However, while they  expanded their efforts, DOJ officials said that detailing immigration judges  and AUSAs to the border districts is a regular practice, and not a new  function created by the executive orders. Examples of actions that DOJ  took, or officials reported taking, in response to the executive orders are  described in table 3.", "State: State\u2019s Bureaus of Population, Refugees, and Migration and  Consular Affairs led efforts to implement key provisions in Executive  Order 13780. Several legal challenges and resulting federal court  injunctions affected State\u2019s implementation of Executive Order 13780 and  at times curtailed specific provisions. Initial State actions included  conducting reviews and contributing to reports required by the order. For  instance, while State generally suspended refugee travel for 120 days,  the department, in conjunction with DHS and the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence, conducted a review to determine what, if any,  additional procedures should be implemented in the U.S. Refugee  Admissions Program. According to State officials, the agencies provided  a joint memorandum to the President in October 2017 that contained  recommendations regarding resumption of the program, specific changes  to refugee processing, and further reviews and steps that the interagency  group should take. Additionally, State worked with DHS and the Office of  the Director of National Intelligence to conduct a worldwide review. This  review identified any additional information that the United States may  need from each foreign country to adjudicate visas and other immigration  benefit applications and ensure that individuals seeking to enter the  United States do not pose a threat to public safety or national security. In  July 2017, upon completion of this review, DHS, in consultation with State  and other interagency partners, issued a report to the President  cataloguing information needed from each country and listing countries  not providing adequate information.", "State also issued a number of policies and guidance in response to the  executive orders; however, guidance on how to implement certain  provisions often changed due to legal challenges. For example, the  Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration issued 23 iterations of  refugee travel restrictions guidance to overseas refugee processing  centers in response to federal litigation and budgetary uncertainties.  Similarly, the Secretary of State issued a number of cables to visa-issuing  foreign posts on implementing travel restrictions for nationals of selected  countries following court orders limiting the implementation of such  restrictions.", "Executive Order 13780 contained several time-sensitive provisions  directed to the Secretary of State. State focused on first addressing these  provisions while working towards longer-term priorities outlined in the  order. For instance, Executive Order 13780 Sections 2 and 6 established  visa and refugee entry restrictions, which contained near-term timelines.  State implemented these provisions, consistent with judicial decisions.  Examples of planning and programmatic actions that State took, or  officials reported taking, to implement Executive Order 13780 are  described in table 4.", "For more information on specific planning or programmatic actions DHS,  DOJ, and State have taken to implement the executive orders, see  appendix I.", "The examples we provided for DHS, DOJ, and State represent initial  actions and do not constitute an exhaustive list of actions that agencies  have taken, or may take in the future, to fully implement the executive  orders. Agency officials anticipate that implementation of the executive  orders will be a multi-year endeavor comprising present and future  reporting, planning, and other actions. For example, DOJ officials noted  that many of the actions that they took to implement the orders will be  ongoing and responsive to additional DHS actions. Specifically, DOJ  bases the number of immigration judges and AUSAs detailed to the  southern border districts on court caseloads driven by ICE. If ICE hires  additional officers and attorneys and arrests and files charges of  removability against more foreign nationals, then DOJ may need to staff  additional judges and AUSAs to meet caseload needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS, DOJ, and State Used Existing Fiscal Year 2017 Resources to Support Initial Executive Order Actions; DHS also Received and Expended Supplemental Funds", "paragraphs": ["Existing Fiscal Year 2017 Resources: Many of the initial actions  agencies and components took in response to the executive orders fit  within their existing fiscal year 2017 budget framework and aligned with  their established missions. At the time the executive orders were issued  in January and March of 2017, federal agencies were operating under  existing continuing appropriations pending enactment of fiscal year 2017  appropriations; therefore the new administration\u2019s border security and  immigration priorities and policies had not yet been incorporated into the  budget process. As a result, it is not always possible to disaggregate  which fiscal year 2017 funds were used for implementation of the  executive orders versus other agency activities. For example, while the  orders call for a surge in hiring at CBP and ICE, these agencies regularly  hire additional personnel to offset attrition or to meet budget hiring targets  as part of their normal operations.", "We asked agencies to identify budgetary resources they used specifically  to address the executive orders. In some cases agencies were able to  quantify their expenditures; however in other cases they could not. For  example, according to DOJ officials, the Executive Office for Immigration  Review, which conducts immigration court proceedings, spent close to  $2.4 million in existing funds to surge approximately 40 immigration judge  positions to detention centers and the southwest border from March  through October 2017 in response to Executive Order 13768. DHS\u2019s  USCIS reported expending approximately $4.2 million detailing asylum  officers to immigration detention facilities along the southern border from  February 2017 through February 2018. Additionally, as a result of the  120-day suspension of refugee admissions, State cancelled airline tickets  for previously approved refugee applicants, which resulted in a cost of  nearly $2.4 million in cancellation and unused ticket fees. State officials  noted that, aside from the ticket costs, other budgetary costs associated  with implementing the order are difficult to disaggregate from other  processing activities. For example, any budgetary costs associated with  refugees who were admitted on a case-by-case basis were absorbed into  overseas processing budgets. In some cases, agencies also identified  cost savings or avoidances. For example, State reported a total cost  avoidance of over $160 million in fiscal year 2017, partially as a result of  admitting fewer refugees than originally planned under the prior  administration.", "While the costs above were part of agencies\u2019 normal operations, we  identified one case where Congress approved a DHS request to  reprogram $20 million from existing programs to fund the planning and  design of new physical barriers along the border, including prototype  design and construction. Specifically, CBP reprogrammed $15 million  from funds originally requested for Mobile Video Surveillance System  deployments and $5 million from a border fence replacement project in  Naco, Arizona. Additionally, we identified another case where DHS  shifted funds and notified Congress, but determined Congressional  approval for reprogramming was not required. Specifically, in response to  Executive Order 13768, the Secretary of Homeland Security directed ICE to reallocate any and all resources used to advocate on behalf of  potentially removable foreign nationals (except as necessary to comply  with a judicial order) to the new VOICE office. As part of this effort, ICE\u2019s  Office of the Principal Legal Advisor determined that the creation of the  VOICE office fell within ICE\u2019s authority to carry out routine or small  reallocations of personnel or functions. According to officials at DHS,  DOJ, and State, there were no additional requests to reprogram or  transfer funds to implement the executive orders. DHS budget officials  stated that any future requests from DHS components to reprogram or  transfer funds would typically be considered at the midway point in the  budget cycle.", "All three agencies indicated that they used existing personnel to  implement the executive orders and, in some cases, a substantial amount  of time was spent preparing reports, planning to implement provisions,  and responding to changes or new developments in the executive orders.  For example, USCIS officials noted that the agency devoted a significant  number of manpower hours to aligning USCIS priorities to the executive  orders. ICE\u2019s Office of Human Capital established a dedicated executive  order hiring team to plan for the hiring surge directed by Executive Order  13768. Additionally, officials at State told us that personnel were diverted  from normal operations in order to implement executive order policy  actions and that there were overtime costs associated with some  provisions. In most cases, agencies did not specifically track or quantify  the amount of time spent on these efforts; however, ICE\u2019s Office of  Human Capital tracked the amount of time spent on planning for the  potential surge in ICE hiring in its human resource data system.  According to ICE information, ICE personnel charged approximately  14,000 regular hours (the equivalent of 1,750 8-hour days) and 2,400  overtime hours to this effort from January 2017 through January 2018.", "Fiscal Year 2017 Request for Supplemental Appropriations: In March  2017, the President submitted a budget amendment along with a request  for $3 billion in supplemental appropriations for DHS to implement the  executive orders and address border protection activities. In May 2017,  an additional appropriation of approximately $1.1 billion was provided in  response to this request, some of which DHS used to fund actions to  implement the orders. For example, CBP received $65.4 million for  hiring and, according to CBP officials, used these funds to plan and  prepare for the surge in Border Patrol agents directed by Executive Order  13767. As of January 2018, CBP had obligated $18.8 million and  expended $14.1 million of the $65.4 million it received. Additionally, ICE  received $147.9 million for custody operations. At the end of fiscal year  2017, ICE had obligated and expended nearly all\u2014over 99.9 percent\u2014of  the funds it received.", "Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 Budget Requests and Fiscal Year 2018  Appropriations: Agency officials anticipate additional costs to further  implement the executive orders and expect that certain provisions will  require a multi-year effort. According to DHS officials, the agency expects  to incorporate executive order implementation into its annual strategic  and budgetary planning processes. DHS officials also noted that  additional future planning and funds will be needed to fully implement  actions in the orders. Agencies plan to continue to use their base budgets  as well as request additional funds as needed to carry out their mission.  Examples of DHS and DOJ fiscal year 2018 budget requests and  appropriations to implement executive order provisions are listed below.", "CBP requested $1.6 billion and in the Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2018, received approximately $1.3 billion to build new and  replace existing sections of physical barriers along the southern  border. CBP also projected out-year funding for construction along  certain segments of the border through 2024.", "ICE requested $185.9 million for approximately 1,000 new  immigration officers and 606 support staff.

According to DOJ officials, DOJ received  sufficient funds in the fiscal year 2018 budget to meet the hiring goal  for attorneys.", "DHS and DOJ also requested funds for fiscal year 2019 to implement  executive order provisions, examples of which are listed below.", "ICE requested $571 million to hire 2,000 immigration officers  (including 1,700 deportation officers and 300 criminal investigators)  and 1,312 support staff (including attorneys).", "DOJ requested $1.1 million for 17 paralegal support positions to  support the additional attorneys requested in the fiscal year 2018  request. DOJ also requested approximately $40 million to hire new  immigration judges and their supporting staff, citing an over 25  percent increase in new cases brought forward by DHS over the  course of fiscal year 2017.", "DHS and DOJ components that were not directly tasked with  responsibilities in the executive orders have also begun to plan for  potential effects as agencies implement the orders. For example, as CBP  and ICE work to meet the hiring surge in the orders, USMS anticipates a  likely increase in the number of individuals who are charged with criminal  immigration offenses and detained pending trial, resulting in a  corresponding increase in its workload. USMS developed a multi-year  impact statement which projected possible effects on USMS prisoner  operations, judicial security, and investigative operations. According to  DOJ officials, these efforts may inform USMS\u2019s budget requests and  future year planning. For example, for fiscal year 2018 USMS requested  approximately $9 million to hire 40 USMS deputies to support the  executive orders. For fiscal year 2019, USMS projected that the  administration\u2019s policies to increase immigration enforcement and  immigration-related prosecutions could result in an increase of nearly  19,000 prisoners between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2019 and a  corresponding budget increase of approximately $105 million for  immigration expenses. In addition, officials at the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers stated that they coordinated with Border  Patrol and ICE to assess future training needs and project future resource  requirements based on the hiring assumptions in the executive orders.  For example, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers requested  an increase of $29 million in fiscal year 2018 and $25.7 million in fiscal  year 2019 for tuition and training requirements to implement the executive  orders, among other funding requested.", "Appendix I includes additional information on funds DHS, DOJ, and State  have obligated, expended, or shifted, to implement provisions of the  executive orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, DOJ, and State for review and  comment.
