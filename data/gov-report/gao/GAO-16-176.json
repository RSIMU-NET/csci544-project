GAO's recommendations generally directed TSA to develop a plan; conduct an analysis; or implement a program, policy, or procedure. For example, in March 2014, GAO recommended that TSA establish protocols to capture operational data on secondary screening of passengers at the checkpoint, to help ensure screening officers' performance.", "TSA has not implemented 7 of the 58 recommendations. GAO closed 4 of the 7 recommendations because TSA stated that it would not take action or GAO determined that it was unlikely that TSA would take action. These recommendations were related to establishing the effectiveness of canine screening, conducting technical assessments to strengthen airport perimeter security and Advanced Imaging Technology. The remaining 3 open recommendations are focused on improving Advanced Imaging Technology operations.

Established by the Aviation and Transportation Security  Act (ATSA), TSA is the federal agency with primary responsibility for  securing the nation\u2019s transportation systems, and to fulfill this mission,  acquires and uses comprehensive, effective, and efficient security-related  technologies. Initially established as an agency within the Department of  Transportation (DOT), TSA transferred to the newly created DHS in  March 2003 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002.. From  October 2011 through June 2015, TSA obligated approximately $4.6  billion to develop, purchase, and maintain security-related technologies,  with most of this amount supporting aviation-related acquisitions. For  example, two major TSA aviation security\u2013related technology acquisitions  programs are the Passenger Screening Program (PSP) and the  Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP). From fiscal year 2002  through August 2015, TSA reported obligating approximately $2.5 billion  and $10.9 billion respectively on planning, acquisitions, and maintenance  for these two programs. As TSA has obligated billions of dollars on  security-related technology acquisitions, it has also faced several  acquisitions challenges. For example, in 2009, we found that TSA lacked  assurances that its investment of $795 million in screening technologies  addressed the highest priority security needs at airport passenger  checkpoints. Also, in 2011, we found that TSA\u2019s explosives detection  systems were not configured to meet the most current detection  requirements. GAO made numerous recommendations to discuss these  challenges. These recommendations are discussed in more detail later in  this report.", "Section 4 of TSARA included a provision for GAO to submit a report to  Congress containing an assessment of TSA\u2019s implementation of  recommendations GAO made on or before December 18, 2014\u2014 TSARA\u2019s date of enactment\u2014regarding TSA\u2019s acquisition of security- related technology. Specifically, this report addresses the following  questions:  1.  What is the status of TSA\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s  recommendations relating to the acquisition of security-related  technology since 2003 and what are the characteristics of those  recommendations?  2.  What benefits have been realized by TSA implementing GAO\u2019s  recommendations relating to the acquisition of security-related  technology?", "To determine the status of TSA\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s  recommendations relating to security-related technology acquisitions, we  reviewed our body of work on TSA and, as appropriate, DHS, in order to  identify recommendations related to the acquisition of any technology that  assists TSA in the prevention of, or defense against, threats to the U.S.  transportation systems, including threats to people, property, and  information. For the purpose of this review, the acquisition of security- related technology encompasses acquisitions that support TSA activities  to screen passengers, checked baggage, and other property (including  cargo), including, but not limited to, Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT);  explosives detection systems (EDS); explosives trace detection (ETD)  machines and canines; the vetting and prescreening of passengers; and  services to maintain, modify, or improve such security-related  technologies. The acquisition of security-related technologies, for  purposes of this review, does not encompass acquisitions that relate  primarily to training on the use of security-related technologies; the  provision of screening services at an airport, such as the Screening  Partnership Program; or identification and access media, such as the  Transportation Worker Identification Credential.", "To determine the number and status of the recommendations we made to  TSA from October 1, 2003, through July 31, 2015, we reviewed  information in our internal database that maintains information on the  status of recommendations we have made to all agencies. We selected  October 1, 2003, as the starting point for our review so we could include  all recommendations made to TSA after TSA transferred from the  Department of Transportation to the newly formed DHS in March 2003.  We relied on this database for the information contained in this report on  financial and non-financial benefits. Once TSA advised GAO that it had  taken action on a recommendation and we verified that action, we used a  multi-step process involving several non-GAO information sources, such  as agency program documentation, to estimate the related financial  benefits. The financial benefits that we report are net benefits\u2014that is,  estimates of financial benefits that have been reduced by the estimated  costs associated with taking the action that we recommended. We  convert all estimates involving past and future years to their net present  value and use actual dollars to represent estimates involving the current  year. Financial benefit amounts vary depending on the nature of the  benefit.", "To ensure the reliability of the recommendations data, we reviewed  documentation about the database used to produce the data and  interviewed GAO staff members responsible for maintaining and updating  the database. TSA officials also reviewed and concurred with our list of  recommendations. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 through February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Many of our reports and testimonies include recommendations that, if  acted upon, may result in tangible benefits for the U.S. taxpayer by  improving the federal government\u2019s efficiency, effectiveness, and  accountability. Implemented recommendations can result in financial or  nonfinancial benefits for the federal government. An estimated financial  benefit is based on actions taken in response to our recommendations,  such as reducing government expenditures, increasing revenues, or  reallocating funds to other areas. For example, in fiscal year 2015, our  work resulted in $74.4 billion in financial benefits across the federal  government. Other benefits that result from our work cannot be measured  in dollar terms, and we refer to them as nonfinancial or other benefits.  These benefits are linked to specific recommendations or other work that  we completed over several years and could include improvements to  agency programs, processes, and policies. During fiscal year 2015, we  recorded a total of 1,286 other benefits government-wide that resulted  from our work, including improved services to the public and government  business operations.", "As part of our responsibilities under generally accepted government  auditing standards, we follow up on recommendations we have made and  report their status to Congress. Agencies also have a responsibility to  monitor and maintain accurate records on the status of our  recommendations. After issuing a report, we follow up with reviewed  agencies at least once a year to determine the extent to which our  recommendations have been implemented and the benefits that have  been realized. During this follow-up, we identify what additional actions, if  any, would be needed to address our recommendations. A  recommendation is considered implemented when actions have been  taken that, consistent with our recommendation, address the issue or  deficiency we identified and upon which the recommendation is based.  Experience has shown that it takes time for some recommendations to be  implemented. For this reason, we actively track each unaddressed (i.e.,  open) recommendation for 4 years and review them to determine whether  implementation can be reasonably expected. The review includes  consideration of alternative strategies the agency may have for  implementing the recommendations. We will close the recommendation  as not implemented if TSA has indicated that it was not taking action or  we determined that it was unlikely that TSA would take action to close  these recommendations.", "We maintain a publicly available database with information on the current  status of most open recommendations. The database allows searches  by agency, congressional committee, or key words and is available at  http://www.gao.gov/openrecs.html."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Implemented 51 of 58 Recommendations Relating to the Acquisition of Security-Related Technology Aimed at Improving Agency Planning and Analysis", "paragraphs": ["TSA has implemented 51 of the 58 recommendations we made from  October 1, 2003, through July 31, 2015, intended to improve TSA\u2019s  acquisition of security-related technology, and has not implemented the  remaining 7 recommendations (see fig. 1).", "The 58 recommendations relating to the acquisition of security-related  technology fall into three general categories: actions requiring the agency  to (1) develop a plan, process, protocol, or strategy; (2) implement a plan,  program, policy, procedure, or best practice; and (3) conduct a test,  study, or analysis. For example, in 2011 we recommended that TSA  develop a process to communicate information to EDS vendors in a  timely manner regarding EDS acquisition and to ensure that TSA takes a  comprehensive and cost-effective approach to procuring and deploying  EDS that meet the 2010 explosives detection requirements and any  subsequent revisions. Separately, in 2008 we recommended that TSA  fully incorporate best practices into developing Secure Flight life-cycle  cost and schedule estimates and develop a plan for mitigating cost and  schedule risks, among other things. In 2009, we recommended that  TSA conduct a cost-benefit analysis to assist in prioritizing investments in  new checkpoint screening technologies to help TSA take a  comprehensive, risk-informed approach to procuring and deploying  airport passenger screening technologies. As shown in figure 2, we  identified 31 recommendations for the first category, 7 recommendations  for the second category, and 20 recommendations for the third category.", "TSA has not implemented 7 recommendations we made from fiscal year  2003 through July 31, 2015. Four of the 7 recommendations have been  closed, while 3 remain open. The 3 open recommendations are focused  on improving AIT operations, while the 4 closed recommendations were  related to establishing the effectiveness of canine screening, conducting  technical assessments to strengthen airport perimeter security, and AIT  operations. For example:  In 2014, we recommended that TSA establish protocols to facilitate  capturing operational data on secondary passenger screening at the  checkpoint to determine the extent to which rates of false alarms for  various AIT systems affect operational costs once Advanced Imaging  Technology-Automated Target Recognition (AIT-ATR) systems are  networked. TSA concurred with this recommendation. In its  comments on our report, TSA stated that it would monitor, update,  and report the results of its efforts to capture operational data and  evaluate its associated impacts on operational costs. When contacted  in November 2015 for an update on this recommendation, TSA  officials stated that they have taken steps toward implementing this  recommendation by evaluating the impact of false alarm rates on  operational costs (such as staffing) during testing for new AIT  systems. This recommendation remains open pending additional  actions by TSA to collect secondary screening data on an ongoing  basis, which could be used to obtain valuable insights on false alarm  rates and the resulting operational costs. By fully implementing the  recommendation, TSA could improve the overall performance of the  AIT system and make more informed decisions about checkpoint  screening.", "In 2013, we recommended that TSA expand and complete testing, in  conjunction with the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, to  assess the effectiveness of passenger screening canines (PSC) and  conventional canines in all areas of an airport deemed appropriate by  TSA before deploying more passenger screening canine teams to  help (a) determine whether PSCs are effective at screening  passengers, and expenditures for PSC training are warranted and (b)  inform decisions about the type of canine teams to deploy and their  optimal locations in airports. TSA concurred with the  recommendation and took some action, but did not fully address the  recommendation. Specifically, in June 2014, TSA reported that it had  assessed PSC teams deployed to 27 airports, cumulating in a total of  1,048 tests. On the basis of these tests, TSA determined that PSC  teams are effective and should be deployed at the checkpoint queue.  However, when contacted in December 2014, officials reported that  they did not plan to expand or complete testing to compare the  effectiveness PSCs with the effectiveness of conventional canine  teams as we recommended, citing concerns about potential liability in  using conventional canines that have not been evaluated for their  suitability for screening passengers in an unfamiliar passenger  screening environment and the related risks to the program. We  disagreed and pointed out that conventional canines paired with  handlers already work in proximity with passengers since they patrol  airport terminals, including ticket counters and curbside areas. Given  that TSA does not plan on taking further action on this program, we  closed the recommendation as not implemented. However, we  continue to believe that the recommendation has merit and should be  fully implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Implementation of GAO Recommendations Has Resulted in Financial Benefits and Other Programmatic and Process Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2003, we have identified approximately $1.7 billion in  financial benefits, largely representing funds that TSA used to support  other programs and activities, based on implementation of our  recommendations as well as findings from our related reports and  testimonies on security-related technology acquisitions.

We found  that TSA had not fulfilled statutory requirements concerning the  development and operations of CAPPS II. For example, TSA had not  determined the accuracy of the databases that would be used to  prescreen passengers, and had not conducted tests that would stress  the program and ensure system functionality. We made several  recommendations relating to developing project plans, including  schedules and estimated costs, conducting system testing; and  developing a process by which passengers can get erroneous  information corrected, among others. In part because of our initial  and subsequent evaluations, and congressional oversight hearings,  TSA reprogramed approximately $46 million in funding for CAPPS II  to other TSA activities in fiscal years 2003 through 2005. TSA  canceled CAPPS II development in August 2004 and, shortly after  that, announced plans to develop a successor passenger  prescreening program called Secure Flight.

We recommended that in order to strengthen the  credibility, comprehensiveness, and reliability of TSA\u2019s cost estimates  and related savings estimates for EBSP, TSA should follow cost- estimating best practices. In response, TSA implemented a  management directive that applies DHS guidance and best practices  from the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and updated  its cost estimating best practices to include four characteristics of a  high quality and reliable cost estimate\u2014comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible. By implementing this  recommendation, TSA improved its ability to determine the cost of the  program and plan for the resources required to develop and manage  the EBSP.", "In October 2009, we found that TSA had completed a strategic plan to  guide research, development, and deployment of passenger  checkpoint screening technologies; however, the plan was not risk- based. We recommended that TSA take a comprehensive, risk- informed approach to procuring and deploying technologies for airport  passenger checkpoint screening. Specifically, we recommended that,  to the extent feasible, TSA should complete operational tests and  evaluations before deploying screening technologies to airport  checkpoints. In response to our recommendation, in March 2010,  TSA updated its Aviation Modal Risk Assessment, which included a  comprehensive risk assessment of the potential for a terrorist attack  and implemented a test and evaluation process for all of its  technology procurements in accordance with DHS policy.

In April 2012, TSA provided  information on a number of actions it had taken to improve  communication with EDS vendors, such as issuing 16 public  notifications that contained projected schedules and program updates.  In October 2012, TSA finalized its Explosives Detection System  Competitive Procurement Qualification Program Communications  Plan, which established a process for more timely communication with  vendors competing for EDS procurements. In addition, TSA used a  qualified products list in its EBSP acquisition plan that awarded  contracts only to precertified vendors. By establishing a process to  communicate with vendors in a timely manner, TSA was better  positioned to avoid delays and procurement cost overruns.", "In May 2004, we found that TSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition was at an  organizational level too low to effectively oversee the acquisition  process, coordinate acquisition activities, and enforce acquisition  policies effectively. The position of the office hindered its ability to help  ensure that TSA follows acquisition processes that enable the agency  to get the best value on goods and services. We recommended that  TSA elevate the Office of Acquisition to an appropriate level within  TSA to enable it to identify, analyze, prioritize, and coordinate agency- wide acquisition needs. In October 2004, TSA elevated its Office of  Acquisition to report directly to the Deputy Administrator of TSA. The  Office of Acquisition instituted an outreach program to provide  acquisition expertise to program offices on each area of the  acquisition life cycle. TSA also issued an Investment Review Process  guide in January 2005 that outlines acquisition personnel roles,  responsibilities, and procedures for conducting acquisition program  reviews at each key decision point.
