The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducts investigations for most of the federal government. Adjudicators from agencies, such as the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security, that request background investigations use the investigative report and consider federal adjudicative guidelines when making clearance determinations. Reform efforts to enhance the personnel security process throughout the executive branch are principally driven and overseen by the Performance Accountability Council, which is chaired by the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "Executive branch agencies rely on a multi-phased personnel security clearance process that includes requirements determination, application, investigation, adjudication, appeals (if applicable, where a clearance has been denied), and reinvestigation (for renewal or upgrade of an existing clearance). In the requirements determination phase, agency officials must determine whether positions require access to classified information. After an individual has been selected for a position that requires a personnel security clearance and the individual submits an application for a clearance, investigators--often contractors--from OPM conduct background investigations for most executive branch agencies. Adjudicators from requesting agencies use the information from these investigations and consider federal adjudicative guidelines to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a clearance. If a clearance is denied or revoked by an agency, appeals of the adjudication decision are possible. Individuals granted clearances are subject to reinvestigations at intervals that are dependent on the level of security clearance.", "Executive branch agencies do not consistently assess quality throughout the security clearance process, in part because they have not fully developed and implemented metrics to measure quality in key aspects of the process. For example, GAO reported in May 2009 that, with respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in July 2008 for DOD, documentation was incomplete for most of OPM's investigative reports. GAO also estimated that 12 percent of the 3,500 reports did not contain the required personal subject interview. To improve the quality of investigative documentation, GAO recommended that OPM measure the frequency with which its reports met federal investigative standards. OPM did not agree or disagree with this recommendation, and as of August 2013 had not implemented it. Further, GAO reported in 2010 that agencies do not consistently and comprehensively track the reciprocity of personnel security clearances, which is an agency's acceptance of a background investigation or clearance determination completed by any authorized investigative or adjudicative agency. OPM created a metric in early 2009 to track reciprocity, but this metric does not track how often an existing security clearance was successfully honored. GAO recommended that OMB develop comprehensive metrics to track reciprocity.

Figure 1 illustrates the steps in the personnel security  clearance process, which is representative of the general process  followed by most executive branch agencies and includes procedures for  appeals and renewals. While different departments and agencies may  have slightly different personnel security clearance processes, the phases  that follow are illustrative of a typical process. Since 1997, federal  agencies have followed a common set of personnel security investigative  standards and adjudicative guidelines for determining whether federal  civilian workers, military personnel, and others, such as private industry  personnel contracted by the government, are eligible to hold a security  clearance.", "Executive branch agencies first determine which of their positions\u2014 military, civilian, or private-industry contractors\u2014require access to  classified information and, therefore, which people must apply for and  undergo a personnel security clearance investigation. This involves  assessing the risk and sensitivity level associated with that position, to  determine whether it requires access to classified information and, if  required, the level of access. Security clearances are generally  categorized into three levels: top secret, secret, and confidential. The  level of classification denotes the degree of protection required for  information and the amount of damage that unauthorized disclosure could  reasonably be expected to cause to national defense.", "A sound requirements process is important because requests for  clearances for positions that do not need a clearance or need a lower  level of clearance increase investigative workloads and costs. A high  volume of clearances continue to be processed and a sound  requirements determination process is needed to effectively manage  costs, since agencies spend significant amounts annually on national  security and other background investigations.

Part  732 establishes three sensitivity levels\u2014special-sensitive, critical- sensitive, and noncritical-sensitive\u2014which are described in figure 2.  According to OPM, positions that an agency designates as special- sensitive and critical-sensitive require a background investigation that  typically results in a top secret clearance. Noncritical-sensitive positions  typically require an investigation that supports a secret or confidential  clearance. OPM also defines non-sensitive positions that do not have a  national security element, and thus do not require a security clearance,  but still require a designation of risk for suitability purposes. That risk level  informs the type of investigation required for those positions.

In  following up on our 2009 recommendations, as of August 2013, OPM had  not provided enough details on its tool for us to determine if the tool had  met the intent of our 2009 recommendation, and included the attributes of  successful performance measures identified in best practices, nor could  we determine the extent to which the tool was being used.", "GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-11-278 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 2011). not reflect the quality of OPM\u2019s total investigation workload. We are  beginning work to further review OPM\u2019s actions to improve the quality of  investigations.", "We have also reported that deficiencies in investigative reports affect the  quality and timeliness of the adjudicative process. Specifically, in  November 2010, we reported that agency officials who utilize OPM as  their investigative service provider cited challenges related to deficient  investigative reports as a factor that slows agencies\u2019 abilities to make  adjudicative decisions. The quality and completeness of investigative  reports directly affects adjudicator workloads, including whether additional  steps are required before adjudications can be made, as well as agency  costs. For example, some agency officials noted that OPM investigative  reports do not include complete copies of associated police reports and  criminal record checks. Several agency officials stated that in order to  avoid further costs or delays that would result from working with OPM,  they often choose to perform additional steps internally to obtain missing  information. According to ODNI and OPM officials, OPM investigators  provide a summary of police and criminal reports and assert that there is  no policy requiring inclusion of copies of the original records. However,  ODNI officials also stated that adjudicators may want or need entire  records as critical elements may be left out of the investigator\u2019s summary.  For example, according to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals  officials, in one case, an investigator\u2019s summary of a police report  incorrectly identified the subject as a thief when the subject was actually  the victim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Steps Taken to Determine Completeness of Adjudicative Files", "paragraphs": ["To address issues identified in our 2009 report regarding the quality of  DOD adjudications, DOD has taken some intermittent steps to implement  measures to determine the completeness of its adjudicative files. In 2009,  we reported that some clearances were granted by DOD adjudicators  even though some required data were missing from the OPM  investigative reports used to make such determinations. For example,  we estimated that 22 percent of the adjudicative files for about 3,500  initial top secret clearances that were adjudicated favorably did not  contain all the required documentation, even though DOD regulations  require that adjudicators maintain a record of each favorable and  unfavorable adjudication decision and document the rationale for granting  clearance eligibility to applicants with security concerns revealed during  the investigation. Documentation most frequently missing from  adjudicative files was the rationale for granting security clearances to  applicants with security concerns related to foreign influence, financial  considerations, and criminal conduct. At the time of our 2009 review,  DOD did not measure the completeness of its adjudicative files, which  limited the agency\u2019s ability to explain the extent or the reasons why some  files are incomplete.", "In 2009, we made two recommendations to improve the quality of  adjudicative files. First, we recommended that DOD measure the  frequency with which adjudicative files meet requirements, so that the  executive branch can identify the factors leading to incomplete files and  include the results of such measurement in annual reports to Congress  on clearances. In November 2009, DOD subsequently issued a  memorandum that established a tool to measure the frequency with which  adjudicative files meet the requirements of DOD regulation. Specifically,  the DOD memorandum stated that it would use a tool called the Review  of Adjudication Documentation Accuracy and Rationales, or RADAR, to  gather specific information about adjudication processes at the  adjudication facilities and assess the quality of adjudicative  documentation. In following up on our 2009 recommendations, as of  2012, a DOD official stated that RADAR had been used in fiscal year  2010 to evaluate some adjudications, but was not used in fiscal year 2011  due to funding shortfalls. DOD stated that it restarted the use of RADAR  in fiscal year 2012.", "Second, we recommended that DOD issue guidance to clarify when  adjudicators may use incomplete investigative reports as the basis for  granting clearances. In response to our recommendation, DOD\u2019s  November 2009 guidance that established RADAR also outlines the  minimum documentation requirements adjudicators must adhere to when  documenting personnel security clearance determinations for cases with  potentially damaging information. In addition, DOD issued guidance in  March 2010 that clarifies when adjudicators may use incomplete  investigative reports as the basis for granting clearances. This guidance  provides standards that can be used for the sufficient explanation of  incomplete investigative reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Clearance Reciprocity Not Measured", "paragraphs": ["Executive branch agencies have not yet developed and implemented  metrics to track the reciprocity of personnel security clearances, which is  an agency\u2019s acceptance of a background investigation or clearance  determination completed by any authorized investigative or adjudicative  agency, although some efforts have been made to develop quality  metrics. Executive branch agency officials have stated that reciprocity is  regularly granted, as it is an opportunity to save time as well as reduce  costs and investigative workloads; however, we reported in 2010 that  agencies do not consistently and comprehensively track the extent to  which reciprocity is granted government-wide. ODNI guidance requires,  except in limited circumstances, that all Intelligence Community elements  \u201caccept all in-scope security clearance or access determinations.\u201d  Additionally, OMB guidance requires agencies to honor a clearance  when (1) the prior clearance was not granted on an interim or temporary  basis; (2) the prior clearance investigation is current and in-scope; (3)  there is no new adverse information already in the possession of the  gaining agency; and (4) there are no conditions, deviations, waivers, or  unsatisfied additional requirements (such as polygraphs) if the individual  is being considered for access to highly sensitive programs.", "While the Performance Accountability Council has identified reciprocity as  a government-wide strategic goal, we have found that agencies do not  consistently and comprehensively track when reciprocity is granted, and  lack a standard metric for tracking reciprocity. Further, while OPM and  the Performance Accountability Council have developed quality metrics  for reciprocity, the metrics do not measure the extent to which reciprocity  is being granted. For example, OPM created a metric in early 2009 to  track reciprocity, but this metric only measures the number of  investigations requested from OPM that are rejected based on the  existence of a previous investigation and does not track the number of  cases in which an existing security clearance was or was not successfully  honored by the agency. Without comprehensive, standardized metrics to  track reciprocity and consistent documentation of the findings, decision  makers will not have a complete picture of the extent to which reciprocity  is granted or the challenges that agencies face when attempting to honor  previously granted security clearances.", "In 2010, we reported that executive branch officials routinely honor other  agencies\u2019 security clearances, and personnel security clearance  information is shared between OPM, DOD, and, to some extent,  Intelligence Community databases. agencies find it necessary to take additional steps to address limitations  with available information on prior investigations, such as insufficient  information in the databases or variances in the scope of investigations,  before granting reciprocity. For instance, OPM has taken steps to ensure  certain clearance data necessary for reciprocity are available to  adjudicators, such as holding interagency meetings to determine new  data fields to include in shared data. However, we also found that the  shared information available to adjudicators contains summary-level  detail that may not be complete. As a result, agencies may take steps to  obtain additional information, which creates challenges to immediately  granting reciprocity.", "GAO-11-65. adjudicators, according to agency officials, a subject\u2019s prior clearance  investigation and adjudication may not meet the standards of the inquiring  agency. Although OPM has developed some training, security clearance  investigators and adjudicators are not required to complete a certain type  or number of classes. As a result, the extent to which investigators and  adjudicators receive training varies by agency. Consequently, as we have  previously reported, agencies are reluctant to be accountable for  investigations and/or adjudications conducted by other agencies or  organizations. To achieve fuller reciprocity, clearance-granting agencies  seek to have confidence in the quality of prior investigations and  adjudications.", "Consequently, we recommended in 2010 that the Deputy Director of  Management, OMB, in the capacity as Chair of the Performance  Accountability Council, should develop comprehensive metrics to track  reciprocity and then report the findings from the expanded tracking to  Congress. Although OMB agreed with our recommendation, a 2011 ODNI  report found that Intelligence Community agencies experienced difficulty  reporting on reciprocity. The agencies are required to report on a  quarterly basis the number of security clearance determinations granted  based on a prior existing clearance as well as the number not granted  when a clearance existed. The numbers of reciprocal determinations  made and denied are categorized by the individual\u2019s originating and  receiving organizational type: (1) government to government, (2)  government to contractor, (3) contractor to government, and (4)  contractor to contractor. The report stated that data fields necessary to  collect the information described above do not currently reside in any of  the datasets available and the process was completed in an agency  specific, semi-manual method. Further, the Deputy Assistant Director for  Special Security of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence noted  in testimony in June 2012 that measuring reciprocity is difficult, and  despite an abundance of anecdotes, real data is hard to come by. To  address this problem, ODNI is developing a web-based form for  individuals to submit their experience with reciprocity issues to the ODNI.  According to ODNI, this will allow them to collect empirical data, perform  systemic trend analysis, and assist agencies with achieving workable  solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Efforts and Sustained Leadership Could Facilitate Progress in Assessing Quality", "paragraphs": ["Several efforts are underway to review the security clearance process,  and those efforts, combined with sustained leadership attention, could  help facilitate progress in assessing and improving the quality of the  security clearance process. After the September 16, 2013 shooting at the  Washington Navy Yard, the President directed the Office of Management  and Budget, in coordination with ODNI and OPM, to conduct a  government-wide review into the oversight, nature, and implementation of  security and suitability standards for federal employees and contractors.  In addition, in September 2013, the Secretary of Defense directed an  independent review to identify and recommend actions that address gaps  or deficiencies in DOD programs, policies, and procedures regarding  security at DOD installations and the granting and renewal of security  clearances for DOD employees and contractor personnel. The primary  objective of this review is to determine whether there are weaknesses in  DOD programs, policies, or procedures regarding physical security at  DOD installations and the security clearance and reinvestigation process  that can be strengthened to prevent a similar tragedy.", "As previously discussed, DOD and DHS account for the majority of  security clearances within the federal government. We initially placed  DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance program on our high-risk list in 2005  because of delays in completing clearances. It remained on our list until  2011 because of ongoing concerns about delays in processing  clearances and problems with the quality of investigations and  adjudications. In February 2011, we removed DOD\u2019s personnel security  clearance program from our high-risk list largely because of the  department\u2019s demonstrated progress in expediting the amount of time   We also noted DOD\u2019s efforts to develop and  processing clearances.implement tools to evaluate the quality of investigations and  adjudications.", "Even with the significant progress leading to removal of DOD\u2019s program  from our high-risk list, the Comptroller General noted in June 2012 that  sustained leadership would be necessary to continue to implement,  monitor, and update outcome-focused performance measures.initial development of some tools and metrics to monitor and track quality  not only for DOD but government-wide were positive steps; however, full  implementation of these tools and measures government-wide have not  yet been realized. While progress in DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance  program resulted in the removal of this area from our high-risk list,  significant government-wide challenges remain in ensuring that personnel  security clearance investigations and adjudications are high-quality.  However, if the oversight and leadership that helped address the  timeliness issues focuses now on the current problems associated with  quality, we believe that progress in helping executive branch agencies to  assess the quality of the security clearance process could be made.", "In conclusion, to avoid the risk of damaging, unauthorized disclosures of  classified information, oversight of the reform efforts to measure and  improve the quality of the security clearance process are imperative next  steps. The progress that was made with respect to expediting the amount  of time processing clearances would not have been possible without  committed and sustained congressional oversight and the leadership of  the Performance Accountability Council. Further actions are needed now  to fully develop and implement metrics to oversee quality at every step in  the process. We will continue to monitor the outcome of the agency  actions discussed above to address our outstanding recommendations.", "Chairman King, Ranking Member Higgins, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
