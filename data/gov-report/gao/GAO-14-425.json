This approach is consistent with the approach mandated in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 and recommended in a May 2012 GAO report, and should allow decision makers to see a more precise view of cost and schedule changes. Furthermore, the Air Force plans to use individual contractual agreements for each modernization effort, a contracting approach that should support informed management and oversight of each increment by increasing visibility into funds obligated to individual efforts.", "In contrast to modernization, the larger of the Air Force's two primary F-22 improvement efforts\u2014the Reliability and Maintainability Maturation Program (RAMMP)\u2014is not managed with its own cost and schedule baseline. This approach limits transparency of cost and schedule progress. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 directed the Air Force to submit an annual report to the congressional defense committees on RAMMP and on F-22 structural repair efforts, to include baseline cost and schedule estimates. While the first report submitted under this requirement in April 2013 provided some cost and schedule information on the structural repair efforts, which could be used as a baseline estimate going forward, it did not include such information for RAMMP. Without a comprehensive baseline cost and schedule estimate for reliability efforts that encompasses the life of the aircraft across all types of funding, it is difficult to consistently track cost and schedule progress on projects that, to date, have cost almost $1 billion.", "The Air Force faces schedule and performance challenges in its management of F-22 modernization and improvement efforts as a result of continuing maintenance issues. Delays in completing depot-level maintenance have translated into delays in fielding modernization increments, which could also affect future increments. Further, the F-22 fleet will not achieve its availability requirement as scheduled, despite substantial investment in RAMMP projects. RAMMP is intended to increase the availability of the F-22 to perform its missions, primarily through improving reliability\u2014the likelihood that the aircraft will operate without failure\u2014and reducing the time required to maintain the aircraft. Air Combat Command officials stated that the current requirement is based on assumptions that may no longer be applicable, and that they expect to revisit this requirement at some future point, although they did not specify when that reassessment would occur.

The other effort, known as the  Reliability and Maintainability Maturation Program (RAMMP), started in  2005, and consists of a large number of individual projects primarily  intended to increase the amount of time the aircraft are available for  operational use. According to program officials, as of January 2014 there  were over 100 RAMMP projects of varying scope and cost under way,  and over 200 projects had been completed.

Under this contract,  work on individual projects can be split across multiple line items, making  it difficult to manage and oversee cost and schedule performance of  individual projects.

A contractor-run depot in Palmdale, California performing F-22  maintenance has returned multiple aircraft back to the fleet months later  than planned. For example, in 2013 this depot returned one aircraft back  to the fleet more than 10 months later than originally scheduled. Fielding  of modernization increments can take place at a depot, and program  officials noted that the delays at the Palmdale depot have affected the  schedule for fielding Increment 3.1.

Increment 3.2A is a software upgrade that requires Increment 3.1  hardware, and delays in the Increment 3.1 schedule have caused the  expected fielding of Increment 3.2A to move from fiscal year 2016 to  fiscal year 2018. Similarly, any further delays in fielding these earlier  increments could affect fielding of Increment 3.2B.", "According to an Air Force analysis of F-22 maintenance issues, work  related to maintaining the stealth features of the F-22 accounts for almost  half of the time that the aircraft are unavailable due to maintenance.  Program officials noted that after repairs or modifications that involve  removing a panel with stealth coatings, those coatings must be restored,  which can take several days. As a result, minor repairs or modifications  that would take a few hours on a non-stealth aircraft can require days of  maintenance on an F-22. Therefore, when an aircraft is scheduled to  enter a depot to receive modifications that need to be performed at the  depot, the Air Force often plans to perform other major work that the  aircraft is intended to receive at the same time, since the stealth coatings  will need to be restored anyway. For example, when an F-22 aircraft  enters a depot for SRP modifications, the Air Force may also schedule  Increment 3.1 modifications during that time. However, officials noted that  modernization efforts can be completed outside of the depot if needed.", "One way the Air Force is attempting to address the depot maintenance  situation is by consolidating all F-22 depot maintenance at a government- operated facility in Ogden, Utah.

The Air Force analysis also found that consolidating all F- 22 depot maintenance at the Ogden facility should provide better  schedule performance while reducing costs for F-22 depot maintenance  by approximately $20 million per year.

DOD\u2019s  response stated that reliability and maintainability programs cannot be  baselined like major defense acquisition programs because of cost  fluctuations based on life cycle issues that arise as the weapon system  ages. We recognize that RAMMP is not a major defense acquisition  program and did not intend to imply that it was, although we believe that  DOD guidance for program cost and schedule baselines provides  elements of sound baseline estimates that could be used in relation to  RAMMP. We acknowledge in our report the challenges of accurately  estimating future RAMMP costs. Nevertheless, the 2013 NDAA required  comparison of costs and schedules to an appropriate baseline, and the  Air Force\u2019s April 2013 report did not identify a cost or schedule baseline  for RAMMP. Rather, it used the funding levels requested in the fiscal year  2013 President\u2019s Budget submission.

As noted in our report, program officials expect to  issue an updated cost estimate for F-22 modernization and improvement  efforts later in 2014.
