The current business environment is characterized by a globalized, highly competitive economy; explosive growth in the development and use of technology; expansion in the number of public companies; and the unprecedented growth and in some cases subsequent decline in the market value of those securities. Furthermore, growth in equity values has placed tremendous pressure on public companies\u2019 management to reach earnings or other performance targets and to meet or exceed the earnings expectations of the security analysts and investors. Missing these targets may cause a significant decline in a security\u2019s market value and reduce management\u2019s compensation in those cases when it is tied to achieving target earnings and/or stock market prices. Several major instances of misstated earnings have resulted in massive declines in the values of the affected companies. Recently, the SEC has become increasingly concerned with the inappropriate use of GAAP and the resulting effect on reported earnings and, in some cases, has required companies to restate their earnings.", "The SEC\u2019s DCF oversees the disclosure of information, which is required by federal securities laws, to the investing public. DCF\u2019s staff routinely reviews the disclosure documents filed by public companies with SEC and consults with OCA to resolve issues arising from the review of registrants\u2019 filings. OCA is the SEC\u2019s principal advisor on accounting and auditing matters. OCA also reviews registrants\u2019 specific accounting treatment of complex issues as a result of prefiling inquiries from the registrants themselves.

Soon after its creation, the SEC decided to rely on accounting standards established in the private sector as long as such standards had substantial authoritative support. Since 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been the designated organization in the private sector that establishes standards for financial accounting and reporting. The SEC officially recognizes GAAP standards established by FASB as authoritative. As such, the SEC requires compliance with GAAP in the presentation of financial statements. FASB\u2019s deliberations are open to the public, and its standards are subject to public exposure and comment prior to issuance. The SEC is involved in establishing accounting standards through the oversight of, and close working relationship with FASB, and other professional standard-setting bodies. The SEC is also involved in establishing accounting standards through the adoption of rules and publication of interpretive guidance. Rules and interpretive releases, such as in the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies and Regulation S-X of the SEC, have an authority similar to pronouncements by FASB for SEC registrants. The SEC staff issues Staff Accounting Bulletins that represent interpretive guidance and practices followed by DCF and OCA in administering the disclosure requirements of the SEC. The SEC has relied on generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) promulgated by the AICPA\u2019s Auditing Standards Board (ASB) as the standard for independent audits.

EITF was formed in 1984 to provide timely financial reporting guidance on emerging issues before divergent practices became widespread and entrenched. Task force members are drawn primarily from public accounting firms but also include representatives of industry. The Chief Accountant of the SEC or his designee attends EITF meetings regularly as an observer and participates in the discussions, but does not have a vote. If the group reaches a consensus on an issue, generally FASB takes this as an indication that no further board action is needed. If no EITF consensus is possible, it may be an indication that action by FASB is necessary. EITF proceedings are documented in EITF Abstracts. The SEC staff and FASB and EITF members work together in an ongoing effort to improve the standard-setting process and to respond to various regulatory, legal, and business changes promptly and appropriately.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, OCA works with the private sector accounting profession, including the AICPA SEC Practice Section and the AICPA SEC Regulations Committee.

The representatives said that large corporations and their auditors who are involved in frequent SEC registration filings have over time established effective working relationships with SEC staff and can often obtain information on SEC procedures through their frequent dealings with the SEC. The representatives also said that other registrants and auditors who have not developed ongoing working relationships with the SEC have greater difficulties working through the process, and additional information about OCA\u2019s process would be beneficial.", "Also, many registrants said they believe that because they do not understand OCA\u2019s process, they must rely too heavily on their external auditors, even though the application of accounting methods is ultimately the registrants\u2019 responsibility. There is the perception that only the major accounting firms are aware of OCA\u2019s process and that it is almost mandatory to have these accounting firms lead the effort for them. While registrants would want to consult with and have the support of external auditors, registrants said that if they better understood OCA\u2019s processes, they might be able to take the lead in the process without having to rely so heavily on their external auditors.

First, registrants have the impression that the SEC staff\u2019s supervisors have reviewed the matters prior to communicating with registrants and their auditors, and are in support of the staff\u2019s positions. Second, registrants have the perception that, in the appeal process, the SEC may open other accounting issues. Finally, the appeal process also adds to the registrants\u2019 time and cost.

The SEC staff often will request additional information from the registrant after receiving an initial written submission. However, registrants do not always respond to these requests for additional information promptly or the registrants\u2019 circumstances may change, thereby changing the scope of the issues.

The SEC did, however, state that often a sense of urgency or a specific deadline exists with regard to resolving an accounting issue, due to a pending transaction. In those cases, SEC officials said the SEC staff and the registrants work very closely and interactively to resolve the issue based on the timing needs of the registrants.", "Accounting issues are assigned to OCA professional staff members who work in teams in specialized areas. Under OCA procedures, assigned OCA staff generally calls the registrant within 3 days of receiving the issue with follow-up questions or to schedule a conference call involving the registrant and its auditors. Through this communication, the registrant also becomes aware of the specific SEC staff members assigned to its case, and OCA is able to determine whether the registrant has certain timing needs for resolving the issue. Also, the SEC provides a list of staff names by specialized work area at the annual conference sponsored by the AICPA SEC Regulations Committee. In researching a specific accounting issue, OCA staff members sometimes consult with standard-setting bodies and the other accounting firms. OCA staff members may prepare a \u201cwhite paper\u201d detailing the facts of the case. The paper generally summarizes the issue and basic facts that are specific to the registrant and poses the one, key accounting question relevant to the case. The paper does not identify the registrant. An OCA official responded that the registrants and their auditors might be concerned that the facts presented to the standard-setting bodies may be biased by the staff members.

The Chief Accountant may overturn the decision of the SEC staff if he becomes convinced that it is the best course of action. In reviewing registrants\u2019 filings, DCF sometimes requests assistance or consultation services from OCA to resolve difficult accounting issues. Some of DCF\u2019s inquiries of OCA are oral and, if the questions are easily resolved, do not involve further interaction with the registrant. According to SEC officials, in cases in which additional information is needed from the registrant, both the DCF staff member reviewing the filing and an OCA staff member are present when the registrant is called for additional information. This internal procedure helps to ensure continuity and prevents or minimizes any duplication of information requests between DCF and OCA.

The SEC asks the registrant to provide a letter documenting the registrant\u2019s understanding of OCA\u2019s position. This procedure is set forth in the SEC\u2019s protocols and is intended to ensure that the registrant clearly understands OCA\u2019s position and the basis for its decisions. However, registrants do not always respond to OCA\u2019s request, especially when they disagree with SEC decisions.

SEC staff, through speeches, describes new fact patterns appearing in industry and provides guidance for handling these new types of cases under existing GAAP. Also, the SEC published answers to FAQs as a guide to registrants and their auditors in submitting filings to the SEC. The Staff Accounting Bulletins and speeches can be tied back to existing accounting literature and are meant to be communicated to everyone.

Due to the common concerns expressed by representatives of registrants and the accounting profession and SEC\u2019s recognition that additional information would be beneficial, we recommend that the Chairman of the SEC direct the Chief Accountant to implement procedures to improve the availability of information to registrants regarding OCA\u2019s process for deciding on accounting issues. Such procedures would include expanding the protocols or issuing additional public information to explain the SEC\u2019s current policies and procedures for handling registrant\u2019s matters, including   general communications to registrants and auditors about the status of the   assignment of accounting issues to SEC staff members,   how the SEC conducts its consultations with other accounting firms and FASB, and how the results of such consultations are considered in its decisions, the SEC\u2019s approval process for determining when registrant restatements are necessary,   coordination between DCF and OCA, and   when decisions are considered to be final.", "We found differences in views between SEC officials and representatives of the registrants and accounting profession regarding the accessibility of the variety of SEC rules and interpretive guidance, and methods of communicating OCA\u2019s positions on accounting issues.
