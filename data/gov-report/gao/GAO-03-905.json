These concerns have been raised because less-than halftime adult students are unable to participate in the largest federal student loan programs, the Stafford Loan programs, and they are eligible to receive only one of the two federal higher education tax credits, the Lifetime Learning tax credit. To better understand the needs of these adult students, GAO was asked to identify (1) the extent to which adults enroll less than halftime, the characteristics and factors associated with less-than- halftime enrollment, and the rates of completion among these students; (2) the extent to which adult students enrolled less than halftime receive federal, state, and other assistance to help them meet the cost of postsecondary education; and (3) the implications, including the budgetary impact, of changing the Pell Grant Program to allow less-than-halftime students to count room and board costs and personal expenses in their application for federal financial aid, and changing the Stafford loan programs to permit participation by less-than-halftime students."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the 1999-2000 school year, 2.3 million adults enrolled in undergraduate education on a less-than-halftime basis, many seeking to balance school with other responsibilities. Compared with other adult students, the typical less-than-halftime adult student was more likely to work fulltime, be married, and have a household income over $30,000. Though 3 out of 4 less-than-halftime adult students expect to complete a degree or certificate program when they begin their education, most leave school without completing one. About 70 percent of less-than halftime adult students received some assistance--about 44 percent of their schooling costs--typically from sources other than federal or state student aid. The sources of assistance they received varied by household income: lower-income adult students enrolled less than halftime relied primarily upon student financial aid in meeting school costs, while higher-income households were assisted primarily by work-related sources such as the Lifetime Learning tax credit or employer assistance. We estimate that proposed changes to the Pell Grant programs would cost the federal government a minimum of $25 million for the 2003-2004 school year. Allowing less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford Loan programs would cost about $113 million per year. College administrators expressed reservations about expanding Stafford Loan eligibility due to concerns about increasing default rates.

Additional assistance in meeting the costs of postsecondary education was  available from work-related sources of support, such as the Lifetime  Learning tax credit and employer assistance. Despite these sources of  assistance, some suggest that nontraditional students\u2014particularly adult  students\u2014receive inadequate support to help them meet the costs of  undergraduate postsecondary education. There is particular concern  about low-income adult students, who may be enrolled with the hope of  improving their prospects for higher wages and career advancement.", "Advocates for adult students note that many adults enroll on a less-than- halftime basis and are consequently disadvantaged in obtaining financial  support. For example, less-than-halftime students, those taking one to five  credits, are not eligible to participate in the federal Stafford student loan  programs. Moreover, though they are eligible to participate in the largest  federal student grant program, the Pell Grant program, no allowances are  made for their room, board, and miscellaneous personal expenses in the  calculation of grant amounts, as is done for students enrolled halftime or more. Furthermore, less-than-halftime students who are tax filers may  reduce their federal income tax liability through the use of the Lifetime  Learning tax credit, but they are ineligible to claim the other federal higher  education tax credit, the HOPE credit. And, although less-than-halftime  students are eligible to participate in the federal campus-based aid  programs\u2014Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants, Perkins loans,  and federal work-study aid\u2014the institutions they most often attend  receive a small share of these funds. Finally, advocates suggest, the  Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 and the Temporary Assistance to  Needy Families (TANF) program authorized by the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of  1996 chiefly focus on immediate employment or short-term training and,  therefore, provide little assistance to adults who seek to obtain a  postsecondary credential.", "In preparation for the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education  Act of 1965, you asked us to examine issues concerning adult students,  which, for the purposes of this report, are those who are 24 years or older.

To receive federal  financial aid, students must meet several eligibility requirements, including  being enrolled in a degree or certificate program, and maintaining  satisfactory academic progress. Institutions are required to establish  qualitative and quantitative criteria of satisfactory progress, and to  monitor student progress. Taken together, these requirements help to  ensure that Title IV funds are used in ways that benefit both students and  the larger public, rather than purely recreational or leisure activities.  Postsecondary institutions must also meet eligibility requirements to  participate in Title IV programs, including legal authorization by the state  in which they offer postsecondary education, accreditation by a nationally  recognized accrediting agency, and limiting regular admission to  individuals with a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent.Institutional eligibility requirements help to ensure that participating  institutions provide students with quality education or training.", "Programs authorized under Title IV include Pell Grants for low-income  students and Stafford Loans. Stafford loans may be either subsidized or  unsubsidized. If the loan is subsidized, the federal government pays the  interest cost of the loan for the time a student is enrolled in school. If the  loan is unsubsidized, the borrower is responsible for paying interest during  the life of the loan. Title IV also authorizes programs funded by the federal  government and administered by participating higher education  institutions, commonly known as campus-based aid\u2014Supplemental  Educational Opportunity grants, Perkins loans, and federal work-study aid.", "Students who apply for Title IV aid must do so using the Free Application  for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Information from the FAFSA is used to  determine the amount of money that the adult student is expected to  contribute to his or her own education, called the expected family  contribution (EFC). Statutory definitions establish the criteria that  students must meet to be considered independent of their parents for  purposes of financial aid, and statutory formulas establish the share of  income and assets that are expected to be available for the student\u2019s  education. Once the EFC is established, it is compared to the cost of  attendance at the institution chosen by the student. As table 2 indicates,  the elements included in the student\u2019s cost of attendance for the purpose  of calculating the Pell Grant award vary according to the extent of their  enrollment.", "If the EFC is greater than the cost of attendance, the student is not  considered to have financial need for federal Title IV aid programs. If the  cost of attendance is greater than the EFC, then the student is considered  to have financial need. Pell Grant awards are calculated by subtracting the  student\u2019s EFC from the maximum Pell Grant award. Maximum Pell Grant  awards are prorated by the student\u2019s enrollment intensity: students  attending less than halftime are eligible to receive one-quarter of the  maximum Pell Grant award. In 1999-2000, the maximum Pell Grant award  was $3,125 for fulltime students, while the maximum award for a less-than- halftime student was $781.

Assistance  was also available to students through two federal higher education tax  credits, the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits. Tax filers on their  own behalf, or on behalf of a spouse or dependent may claim both credits,  and both are nonrefundable: if the filer has no tax liability, they cannot  receive the credit. Eligibility for the HOPE credit is limited to students  who are enrolled halftime or more in a degree or certificate program, and  in their first 2 years of postsecondary education.

This closely reflects the findings of studies that  examine postsecondary enrollment among adults. School administrators  explained that the balancing act required of many adult students, in which  they attempt simultaneously to meet family responsibilities and work  obligations, left many adults with too little time to be a fulltime student.  The routines of adult life\u2014from caring for sick children to meeting  unexpected job demands\u2014compete with class attendance and the  completion of course assignments, according to these administrators.

Virtually all administrators identified these as important, but  secondary, reasons. While many adult students receive some financial  support towards postsecondary costs, most students pay the majority of  school costs from their own resources. Because adult students may find it  difficult to economize on housing costs by searching for less expensive  accommodations or group housing, enrolling less than halftime can  provides them with a way to reduce out-of-pocket costs associated with  tuition and fees\u2014as well as transportation, childcare, and books.", "Scheduling conflicts also played a role, according to college  administrators, in influencing enrollment decisions. Officials noted that  adult students, especially working students, may be unable to enroll on a  halftime or fulltime basis due to the inflexibility of course and program  options made available by postsecondary institutions, or a lack of  flexibility in work schedules on the part of employers. While some  postsecondary institutions offered the majority of their classes during  nontraditional hours, such as evenings or weekends, others did not. For  example, administrators at one 4-year school estimated that only 10  percent of the undergraduate courses were offered during evening hours.  Adults may find it easier to plan and manage their schedules over 5 to 7  weeks than they do over longer time periods, such as a traditional 10 or 15- week semester. At another institution, administrators noted that 3,000  course sections were offered each semester, but only 10 were available to  adults in a shorter 5 to 7 week format, owing to reluctance of faculty to  teach in alternative times and formats. Administrators at one community  college pointed to a lack of flexibility in employer work schedules, noting  that adult students often withdraw from class when their employer  changes their work schedule, preventing them from attending class.", "School administrators explained that some adults might not be ready\u2014  academically or socially\u2014for postsecondary education, and that this may  contribute to their decision to enroll less than halftime. Adult students  often need to refresh or develop college-level skills, they noted,  particularly in mathematics. Adult students may also lack confidence in  themselves or their abilities, or feel out of place in a college setting. One  administrator noted that some adult students at her institution  experienced stress-related illnesses after they had begun their coursework  and needed to leave mid-semester.

In light of the low rates of  completion among less-than-halftime students, they reasoned, this  population might be at particular risk of defaulting on Stafford loans.  Institutional eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs is  linked to an institution's cohort default rate, and permitting borrowing by  less-than-halftime students could result in some institutions losing Title IV  eligibility. In addition, changing Stafford eligibility to include borrowers  enrolled less than halftime would, they anticipate, result in a large  expansion in the number of students participating in the Stafford loan  programs, increasing the administrative burden faced by campus financial  aid offices.

Allowing less-than- halftime students to borrow in the Stafford loan programs, they noted,  may also increase the number of students who reach their overall  borrowing limits before the completion of a degree. Finally, they indicated,  changing program eligibility may encourage protracted less-than-halftime  enrollment as a means by which to postpone repayment. Students with  outstanding subsidized Stafford loans must now enter repayment if they  enroll for fewer than six credits.

Some sources  of funding available to adult learners, particularly work-related assistance  provided by employers or the Lifetime Learning tax credit, permit short- term study that does not lead to the completion of a degree or certificate.  Both employers and employees may benefit as skills, productivity, and  earnings increase. In contrast to these funding streams, the federal student  assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act  provide assistance for adult learning that takes place in eligible  postsecondary institutions, and is intended to result in the completion of a  postsecondary credential: a certificate, associate\u2019s degree, or  baccalaureate degree. The Higher Education Act\u2019s provisions concerning  institutional eligibility help to ensure billions of dollars in federal student  assistance is available only to those institutions that provide students with  quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money that  they\u2014and the nation\u2019s taxpayers\u2014invest. Requiring that students enroll  in\u2014and make progress toward\u2014a postsecondary credential ensures that  the federal investment in Title IV programs is used to support learning that  is broadly beneficial to the public, rather than students\u2019 recreational or  leisure activities.", "Some adults who begin postsecondary education on a less than halftime  basis do not intend to complete a degree, and many others expect to do so,  but are unable to continue to completion.

The  potential costs\u2014to the federal government, institutions, and students\u2014of  proposed changes to the Pell Grant and Stafford Loan programs,  particularly the latter, may outweigh their potential benefits for less-than- halftime adult students. Permitting less-than-halftime students to  participate in the Stafford student loan programs would provide a new  source of borrowing for these students, but it may be accompanied by  unintended and unwanted consequences, including increasing the volume  of loans at risk of default. Allowing less-than-halftime students to include  room, board, and personal expenses in calculating their Pell Grant cost of  attendance would most often assist less-than-halftime students who are  currently receiving a Pell grant, providing them with an estimated $100  annual increase in assistance, rather than providing a widely available  source of assistance to adults who are not currently receiving Pell Grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on our draft report, Education stated that it  appreciated our thorough review and examination of the financial, and  other, impediments that are often unique to adult learners as they pursue  postsecondary education and training opportunities and found useful the  concerns raised by postsecondary institutions.
