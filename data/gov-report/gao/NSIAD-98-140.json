To accomplish these objectives, FBCB2 will be composed of a computer that can display a variety of information, including a common picture of the battlefield overlaid with graphical depictions (known as icons) of friendly and enemy forces; software that automatically integrates Global Positioning System data, military intelligence data, combat identification data, and platform data (such as the status of fuel and ammunition); and interfaces to communications systems.", "Battlefield data will be communicated to and received from users of FBCB2 through a \u201cTactical Internet.\u201d This is a radio network comprising the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) and the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). By connecting platforms through this Tactical Internet, data needed for battlefield situational awareness and command and control decisions can be made available to commanders at all levels of the Army\u2019s Battle Command System.", "To explore the FBCB2 concept, the Army acquired and installed sufficient quantities of equipment to field a brigade-size experimental force in June 1996. This experimental force then used FBCB2 prototype equipment in an Advanced Warfighting Experiment, which culminated in March 1997 during a 2-week deployment against an opposing force at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California. Results from the Advanced Warfighting Experiment were considered sufficiently positive that the Army conducted an FBCB2 milestone I/II review in July 1997. FBCB2 was conditionally approved for entry into the engineering and manufacturing development acquisition phase (acquisition milestone II) pending completion of certain essential action items, including the final Operational Requirements Document and the Test and Evaluation Master Plan. The program is expected to incur life-cycle costs of about $3 billion (in then-year dollars) by fiscal year 2012.", "DOD Regulation 5000.2R offers a general model for management of the acquisition process for programs such as FBCB2. This regulation states that managers shall structure a program to ensure a logical progression through a series of phases designed to reduce risk, ensure affordability, and provide adequate information for decision-making. At the start of a program, consideration is given to program size, complexity, and risk and a determination is made regarding acquisition category. More costly, complex, and risky systems are generally accorded more oversight. The determination made at program initiation is reexamined at each milestone in light of then-current program conditions.", "The regulation describes the differences among acquisition categories and places them in one of three categories: I, II, or III. In general, the milestone decision authority for category I programs is at a higher level than category II or III programs. In addition, category I programs generally require that more information\u2014such as an Analysis of Alternatives and a Cost Analysis Improvement Group review\u2014be available for decision-making. Category I programs are defined as programs estimated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology to require eventual expenditure for research, development, test, and evaluation of more than $355 million (fiscal year 1996 constant dollars) or procurement of more than $2.1 billion (fiscal year 1996 constant dollars). Category II programs have lower dollar classification thresholds than category I programs; for example, the research, development, test, and evaluation dollar threshold for an acquisition category II program is $140 million (fiscal year 1996 constant dollars).

The Training and Doctrine Command has identified 15 priority one systems. They primarily consist of command, control, and communications systems, including FBCB2. It is considered a critical element within the Army\u2019s digitization effort because of the contribution it makes to achieving the required capabilities for the digitized battlefield. Approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in January 1995, these capabilities are integrated battle command from platoon to corps, relevant common picture of the battle space at each level, smaller units that are more lethal and survivable, more responsive logistics within and between theaters, and joint interoperability at appropriate levels.", "It is unlikely that all of the required capabilities of the digitized battlefield can be achieved without FBCB2.

In November 1997, these actions had not been completed and the new expected approval date for these documents slipped to March 1998. Our discussions with Army officials now indicate that these documents are not expected to be complete and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council until July 1998.

We also analyzed early program cost experiences, particularly the reprogramming action requested for the fiscal year 1998 FBCB2 unfunded requirement.", "To evaluate the feasibility of the Army\u2019s fielding schedule, we analyzed the events within the FBCB2 schedule; discussed the events with appropriate officials, including representatives of the Abrams and Bradley program offices; and obtained assessments of the risks associated with fielding an FBCB2 capability to an Army division by the end of fiscal year 2000.", "In reviewing experimental performance results of the FBCB2 prototype at the Task Force XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment, we considered the Army\u2019s Operational Test and Evaluation Command\u2019s Live Experiment Assessment Report and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, briefing on early operational insights. In addition, in March 1997, prior to the request for this work, we attended the Force XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment at Fort Irwin and accompanied representatives of the Operational Test and Evaluation Command to observe and obtain first hand knowledge of the performance of FBCB2 and other initiatives being tested. We also attended after action sessions in which activities carried out during the exercise were evaluated by top commanders.", "In the course of our work, we also interviewed program officials and examined program management and budget documents, draft system requirements, draft test plans, acquisition plans, and other program documentation. We performed work primarily at the Army Digitization Office, Arlington, Virginia, and the Army Communications and Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. We also gathered data from the Army Tank Automotive and Armaments Command, Warren, Michigan; Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Arlington, Virginia; Director, Test, Systems Engineering, and Evaluation, Arlington, Virginia; Army Operational Test and Evaluation Command, Alexandria, Virginia; and the Division XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment, Fort Hood, Texas.

DOD commented that through Integrated Product Team meetings the issues such as program significance, cost, and schedule risk\u2014discussed in our report\u2014are being addressed. Although DOD did not elaborate on how the teams were addressing the issues of significance or schedule risk, it did acknowledge that the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group is currently working with the Army\u2019s Cost and Economic Analysis Center to validate the Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) program costs. This effort is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998. In our opinion, the results of this analysis, as well as the information we have presented on program significance and schedule risk, should be considered in developing the actions taken in response to our recommendation. 2. DOD commented that the spiral software development, the series of tests that have started or are scheduled to be conducted prior to the October 1999 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, and guidance from the Overarching Integrated Product Team all provide some degree of risk management. We continue to believe these actions do not constitute an adequate risk mitigation strategy for the reasons discussed in the body of our report and summarized as follows", "Even with the guidance of the Overarching Integration Product Team, the fact that so many system development tests are being compressed to meet a 18-month schedule because of the mandated fiscal year 2000 deadline is, in our view, a high risk approach to successful system development.", "The spiral software development model discussed by DOD will not guarantee success. Even with users involved during the frequent tests, it is unlikely that there is enough time between tests for DOD to adequately correct discovered deficiencies and implement other desired changes. Further, DOD states that a working group is planned to evolve this spiral development concept for software in the spirit of acquisition streamlining. We believe that the time for evolving this concept, as it relates to FBCB2, is past, and concentrated effort must be focused on successfully completing the scheduled tests and containing escalating costs.", "DOD is proceeding with FBCB2 development on the basis of an Operational Requirements Document and a Test and Evaluation Master Plan, which are still in the process of being reviewed for approval by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. This, in our opinion, is another impediment to adequate risk mitigation because DOD is attempting to develop a system that may or may not be addressing appropriate requirements.", "We still believe that the discussion in our report on these issues supports the need for DOD and the Army to follow the more formal approach to risk mitigation planning as required by DOD Regulation 5000.2R for acquisition I programs.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
