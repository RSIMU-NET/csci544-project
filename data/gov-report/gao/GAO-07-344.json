Poverty imposes costs on the nation in terms of both programmatic outlays and productivity losses that can affect the economy as a whole. To better understand the potential range of effects of poverty, GAO was asked to examine (1) what the economic research tells us about the relationship between poverty and adverse social conditions, such as poor health outcomes, crime, and labor force attachment, and (2) what links economic research has found between poverty and economic growth. To answer these questions, GAO reviewed the economic literature by academic experts, think tanks, and government agencies, and reviewed additional literature by searching various databases for peer- reviewed economic journals, specialty journals, and books.

While the mechanisms by which poverty affects health are complex, some research suggests that adverse health outcomes can be due, in part, to limited access to health care as well as greater exposure to environmental hazards and engaging in risky behaviors. For example, some research has shown that increased availability of health insurance such as Medicaid for low-income mothers led to a decrease in infant mortality. Additionally, exposure to higher levels of air pollution from living in urban areas close to highways can lead to acute health conditions. Data suggest that engaging in risky behaviors, such as tobacco and alcohol use, a sedentary life-style, and a low consumption of nutritional foods, can account for some health disparities between lower and upper income groups. The economic research we reviewed also points to links between poverty and crime. For example, one study indicated that higher levels of unemployment are associated with higher levels of property crime. The relationship between poverty and adverse outcomes for individuals is complex, in part because most variables, like health status, can be both a cause and a result of poverty. These adverse outcomes affect individuals in many ways, including limiting their development of the skills, abilities, knowledge, and habits necessary to fully participate in the labor force. Research shows that poverty can negatively affect economic growth by affecting the accumulation of human capital and rates of crime and social unrest. Economic theory has long suggested that human capital--that is, the education, work experience, training, and health of the workforce--is considered one of the fundamental drivers of economic growth. The conditions associated with poverty can work against this human capital development by limiting individuals' ability to remain healthy and develop skills, in turn decreasing the potential to contribute talents, ideas, and even labor to the economy. An educated labor force, for example, is better at learning, creating and implementing new technologies. Economic theory suggests that when poverty affects a significant portion of the population, these effects can extend to the society at large and produce slower rates of growth. Although historically research has focused mainly on the extent to which economic growth alleviates poverty, some recent empirical studies have begun to demonstrate that higher rates of poverty are associated with lower rates of growth in the economy as a whole. For example, areas with higher poverty rates experience, on average, slower per capita income growth rates than low-poverty areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Census Bureau, approximately 37 million people in the  United States\u2014nearly 13 percent of the total population\u2014lived below the  poverty line in 2005.

The  threshold reflects estimates of the amount of money individuals and  families of various sizes need to purchase goods and services deemed  minimally adequate based on 1960s living standards, and is adjusted each  year using the consumer price index. The poverty rate is the percentage of  individuals in total or as part of various subgroups in the United States  who are living on income below the threshold amounts.", "Over the years, experts have debated whether or not the way in which the  poverty threshold is calculated should be changed. Currently the  calculation only accounts for pretax income and does not include noncash  benefits and tax transfers, which, especially in recent years, have  comprised larger portions of the assistance package to those who are low- income. For example, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit  could provide a combined amount of assistance worth an estimated $5,000  for working adults with children who earn approximately $12,000 a year.If noncash benefits were included in a calculation of the poverty  threshold, the number and percentage of individuals at or below the  poverty line could change. In 1995, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS)  panel recommended that changes be made to the threshold to count  noncash benefits, tax credits, and taxes; deduct certain expenses from  income such as child care and transportation; and adjust income levels  according to an area\u2019s cost of living.

For example, in the1960s federal programs  focused on increasing the education and training of those living in poverty.  In the 1970s, policy reflected a more income-oriented approach with the  introduction of several comprehensive federal assistance plans. More  recently, welfare reform efforts have emphasized the role of individual  responsibility and behaviors in areas such as family formation and work to  assist people in becoming self-sufficient.

The relationship  between poverty and outcomes for individuals is complex, in part because  most variables, like health status, can be both a cause and a result of  poverty.

Lower-income individuals experience higher  rates of chronic illness, disease, and disabilities, and also die younger than  those who have higher incomes. As reported by the National Center on  Health Statistics, individuals living in poverty are more likely than their  affluent counterparts to experience fair or poor health, or suffer from  conditions that limit their everyday activities (fig.1). They also report  higher rates of chronic conditions such as hypertension, high blood  pressure, and elevated serum cholesterol, which can be predictors of more  acute conditions in the future. Life expectancies for individuals in poor  families as compared to nonpoor families also differ significantly. One  study showed that individuals with low incomes had life expectancies 25  percent lower than those with higher incomes. Other research suggests  that an individual\u2019s household wealth predicts the amount of functionality  of that individual in retirement.", "Research suggests that part of the reason that those in poverty have poor  health outcomes is that they have less access to health insurance and thus  less access to health care, particularly preventive care, than others who  are nonpoor. Very low-income individuals were three times as likely not to  have health insurance than those with higher incomes, which may lead to  reduced access to and utilization of health care (fig. 2).", "Data show that those who are poor with no health insurance access the  health system less often than those who are either insured or wealthier  when measured by one indicator of health care access: visits to the doctor.  For example, data from the National Center on Health Statistics show that  children in families with income below the poverty line who were  continuously without health insurance were three to four times more  likely to have not visited a doctor in the last 12 months than children in  similar economic circumstances who were insured (fig. 3). Research also  suggests that a link between income and health exists independent of  health insurance coverage. Figure 3 also shows that while children who  are uninsured but in wealthier families visit the doctor fewer times than  those who are insured, they still go more often than children who are  uninsured but living in poverty.", "Some research examining government health insurance suggests that  increased health insurance availability improves health outcomes.  Economists have studied the expansion of Medicaid, which provides  health insurance to those with low income. They found that Medicaid\u2019s  expansion of coverage, which occurred between 1979 and 1992, increased  the availability of insurance and improved children\u2019s health outcomes. For  example, one study found that a 30 percentage point increase in eligibility  for mothers aged 15-44 translated into a decrease in infant mortality of 8.5  percent. Another study looked at the impact of health insurance coverage  through Medicare and its effects on the health of the elderly and also  found a statistically significant though modest impact. There is some  evidence that variations in health insurance coverage do not explain all the  differences in health outcomes. A study done in Canada found  improvements in children\u2019s health with increases in income, even though  Canada offers universal health insurance coverage for hospital services,  indicating that health insurance is only part of the story.", "Although there is a connection among poverty, having health insurance,  and health outcomes, having health insurance is often associated with  other attributes of an individual, thus making it difficult to isolate the  direct effect of health insurance alone. Most individuals in the United  States are either self-insured or insured through their employer. If those  who are uninsured have lower levels of education, as do individuals with  low income, differences in health between the insured and uninsured  might be due to level or quality of education, and not necessarily  insurance.", "Another reason that individuals living in poverty may have more negative  health outcomes is because they live and work in areas that expose them  to environmental hazards such as pollution or substandard housing. Some  researchers have found that because poorer neighborhoods may be  located closer to industrial areas or highways than more affluent  neighborhoods, there tend to be higher levels of pollution in lower-income  neighborhoods. The Institute of Medicine concluded that minority and  low-income communities had disproportionately higher exposure to  environmental hazards than the general population, and because of their  impoverished conditions were less able to effectively change these  conditions.", "The link between poverty and health outcomes may also be explained by  lifestyle issues associated with poverty. Sedentary life-style: the use of  alcohol and drugs; as well as lower consumption of fiber, fresh fruits, and  vegetables are some of the behaviors that have been associated with lower  socioeconomic status. Cigarette smoking is also more common among  adults who live below the poverty line than among those above it, about 30  percent compared to 21 percent. Similarly, problems with being  overweight and obese are common among those with low family incomes,  although most prevalent in women: Women with incomes below 130  percent of the poverty line were 50 percent more likely to be obese than  those with incomes above this amount. Figure 4 shows that people living  in poverty are less likely to engage in regular, leisure-time physical activity  than others and are somewhat more likely to be obese, and children in  poverty are somewhat more likely to be overweight than children living  above the poverty line. In addition, there is also evidence to suggest a link  among poverty, stress, and adverse health outcomes, such as  compromised immune systems.", "While evidence shows how poverty could result in poor health, the  opposite could also be true. For example, a health condition could result,  over time, in restricting an individual\u2019s employment, resulting in lower  income. Additionally, the relationship between poverty and health  outcomes could also vary by demographic group. Failing health, for  example, can be more directly associated with household income for  middle-aged and older individuals than with children, since adults are  typically the ones who work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Research Shows an Association Between Poverty and Crime", "paragraphs": ["Just as research has established a link between poverty and adverse health  outcomes, evidence suggests a link between poverty and crime. Economic  theory predicts that low wages or unemployment makes crime more  attractive, even with the risks of arrest and incarceration, because of  lower returns to an individual through legal activities. While more mixed,  empirical research provides support for this. For example, one study  shows that higher levels of unemployment are associated with higher  levels of property crime, but is less conclusive in predicting violent crime.Another study has shown that both wages and unemployment affect crime,  but that wages play a larger role.", "Research has found that peer influence and neighborhood effects may also  lead to increased criminal behavior by residents. Having many peers that  engage in negative behavior may reduce social stigma surrounding that  behavior. In addition, increased crime in an area may decrease the  chances that any particular criminal activity will result in an arrest. Other  research suggests that the neighborhood itself, independent of the  characteristics of the individuals who live in it, affects criminal behavior.One study found that arrest rates were lower among young people from  low-income families who were given a voucher to live in a low-poverty  neighborhood, as opposed to their peers who stayed in high-poverty  neighborhoods.

Some of the reasons for these outcomes include  educational attainment and health status.", "Poverty is associated with lower educational quality and attainment, both  of which can affect labor market outcomes. Research has consistently  demonstrated that the quality and level of education attained by lower- income children is substantially below those for children from middle- or  upper-income families. Moreover, high school dropout rates in 2004 were  four times higher for students from low-income families than those in  high-income families. Those with less than a high school degree have  unemployment rates almost three times greater than those with a college  degree, 7.6 percent compared to 2.6 percent in 2005. And the percentage of  low-income students who attend college immediately after high school is  significantly lower than for their wealthier counterparts: 49 percent  compared to 78 percent.", "A significant body of economic research directly links adverse health  outcomes, which are also associated with low incomes, with the quality  and quantity of labor that the individual is able to offer to the workforce.  Many studies that have examined the relationship among individual adult  health and wages, labor force participation, and job choice have  documented positive empirical relationships among health and wages,  earnings, and hours of work. Although there is no consensus about the  exact magnitude of the effects, the empirical literature suggests that poor  health reduces the capacity to work and has substantive effects on wages,  labor force participation, and job choice, meaning that poor health is  associated with low income.", "Research also demonstrates that poor childhood health has substantial  effects on children\u2019s future outcomes as adults. Some research, for  example, shows that low birth weight is correlated with a low health  status later in life. Research also suggests that poor childhood health is  associated with reduced educational attainment and reduced cognitive  development. Reduced educational attainment may in turn have a causal  effect not only on future wages as discussed above but also on adult health  if the more educated are better able to process health information or make  more informed choices about their health care or if education makes  people more \u201cfuture oriented\u201d by helping them think about the  consequences of their choices.

In the United States, poverty can impact economic growth by  affecting the accumulation of human capital and rates of crime and social  unrest.

Human capital consists of the  skills, abilities, talents, and knowledge of individuals as used in  employment. The accumulation of human capital is generally held to be a  function of the education level, work experience, training, and healthiness  of the workforce. Therefore, schooling at the secondary and higher levels  is a key component for building an educated labor force that is better at  learning, creating, and implementing new technologies. Health is also an  important component of human capital, as it can enhance workers\u2019  productivity by increasing their physical capacities, such as strength and  endurance, as well as mental capacities, such as cognitive functioning and  reasoning ability. Improved health increases workforce productivity by  reducing incapacity, disability, and the number of days lost to sick leave,  and increasing the opportunities to accumulate work experience. Further,  good health helps improve education by increasing levels of schooling and  scholastic performance.", "The accumulation of human capital can be diminished when significant  portions of the population have experienced long periods of poverty, or  were living in poverty at a critical developmental juncture. For example,  recent research has found that the distinct slowdown in some measures of  human capital development is most heavily concentrated among youth  from impoverished backgrounds. When individuals who have experienced  poverty enter the workforce, their contributions may be restricted or  minimal, while others may not enter the workforce in a significant way.  Not only is the productive capability of some citizens lost, but their  purchasing power and savings, which could be channeled into productive  investments, is forgone as well.", "In addition to the effects of poverty on human capital, some economic  literature suggests that poverty can affect economic growth to the extent  that it is associated with crime, violence, and social unrest. According to  some theories, when citizens engage in unproductive criminal activities  they deter others from making productive investments or their actions  force others to divert resources toward defensive activities and  expenditures. The increased risk due to insecurity can unfavorably affect  investment decisions\u2014and hence economic growth\u2014in areas afflicted by  concentrated poverty. Although such theories link poverty to human  capital deficiencies and criminal activity, the magnitude of their impact on  economic growth for an economy such as the United States is unclear at  this time. In addition, people living in impoverished conditions generate  budgetary costs for the federal government, which spends billions of  dollars on programs to assist low-income individuals and families.  Alleviating these conditions would allow the federal government to  redirect these resources toward other purposes.", "While economic theory provides a guide to understanding how poverty  might compromise economic growth, empirical researchers have not as  extensively studied poverty as a determinant of growth in the United  States.
