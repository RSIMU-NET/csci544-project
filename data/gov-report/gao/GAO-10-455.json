USPS's business model is to fulfill its mission through self-supporting, businesslike operations; however, USPS has experienced increasing difficulties. Due to volume declines, losses, a cash shortage, and rising debt, GAO added USPS's financial condition to its high-risk list in July 2009. GAO's objectives were to assess (1) the viability of USPS's business model, (2) strategies and options to address challenges to its business model, and (3) actions Congress and USPS need to take to facilitate progress toward financial viability.

Mail volume declined 36 billion pieces (17 percent) over the last 3 fiscal years (2007 through 2009) with the recession accelerating shifts to electronic communications and payments. USPS lost nearly $12 billion over this period, despite achieving billions in cost savings by reducing its career workforce by over 84,000 employees, reducing capital investments, and raising rates. However, USPS had difficulty in eliminating costly excess capacity, and its revenue initiatives have had limited results. USPS also is nearing its $15 billion borrowing limit with the U.S. Treasury and has unfunded pension and retiree health obligations and other liabilities of about $90 billion. In 2009, Congress reduced USPS's retiree health benefit payment by $4 billion to address a looming cash shortfall, but USPS still recorded a loss of $3.8 billion. Given its financial problems and outlook, USPS cannot support its current level of service and operations. USPS projects that volume will decline by about 27 billion pieces over the next decade, while revenues will stagnate; costs will rise; and, without major changes, cumulative losses could exceed $238 billion. This report groups strategies and options that can be taken to address challenges in USPS's business model by better aligning costs with revenues (see table on next page). USPS may be able to improve its financial viability if it takes more aggressive action to reduce costs, particularly compensation and benefit costs that comprise 80 percent of its total costs, as well as increasing revenues within its current authority. However, it is unlikely that such changes would fully resolve USPS's financial problems, unless Congress also takes actions to address constraints and legal restrictions. Action by Congress and USPS is urgently needed to (1) reach agreement on actions to achieve USPS's financial viability, (2) provide financial relief through deferral of costs by revising USPS retiree health benefit funding while continuing to fund these benefits over time to the extent that USPS's finances permit, and (3) require that any binding arbitration resulting from collective bargaining would take USPS's financial condition into account. Congress may also want assurance that any financial relief it provides is met with aggressive actions by USPS to reduce its costs and increase revenues, and that USPS is making progress toward addressing its financial problems. USPS's new business plan recognizes immediate actions are needed, but USPS has made limited progress on some options, such as closing facilities. If no action is taken, risks of larger USPS losses, rate increases, and taxpayer subsidies will increase. To facilitate progress in these difficult areas, Congress could set up a mechanism, such as one similar to the military Base Realignment and Closure Commission, where independent experts could recommend a package of actions with time frames. Key issues also need to be addressed related to what changes, if any, should be made to delivery or retail services; to allow USPS to provide new products or services in nonpostal areas; and to realign USPS operations, networks, and workforce."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 required  GAO to evaluate strategies and options for the long-term structural and  operational reform of the United States Postal Service (USPS). At that  time, USPS was given additional pricing flexibility and required to develop  service standards, while PAEA reconfigured certain financial obligations.  These changes provided additional tools to improve its effectiveness and  accountability in an increasingly competitive delivery and communications  marketplace. Recent developments have highlighted deficiencies in  USPS\u2019s business model, which is to fulfill its mission through self- supporting, businesslike operations. As mail volume declined in fiscal  years 2007 through 2009, USPS financial viability deteriorated, and it was  not able to cut costs fast enough to offset the accelerated decline in mail  volume and revenue. These volume declines have been brought on by  customers\u2019 changing use of the mail and have been accelerated by the  recession and continuing difficulties in the economy. In fiscal year 2009,  total mail volume declined by a record 26 billion pieces, while revenue  dropped nearly $7 billion. USPS has incurred close to $12 billion in losses  in fiscal years 2007 through 2009 and is rapidly approaching its statutory  debt limit. Furthermore, a looming cash shortfall at the end of fiscal year  2009 necessitated last-minute congressional action that deferred costs by  reducing USPS\u2019s mandated retiree health benefit payments. On the basis of  these challenges, in July 2009, we testified that a restructuring of USPS  was needed to enhance its current and long-term financial viability and  placed USPS\u2019s financial condition on our high-risk list.", "USPS\u2019s financial outlook is poor. In fiscal year 2010, USPS expects a  record loss of over $7 billion, its outstanding debt to increase to $13.2  billion, and limited cash flow that will continue to constrain capital  investment. USPS projections show losses growing over the next decade  as mail volume declines further and costs rise. USPS remains the largest  civilian federal agency (employing about 712,000 employees at the end of  fiscal year 2009), has a nationwide network of about 38,000 facilities, and  provides 6-day-per-week mail delivery to most of the nation\u2019s 150 million  addresses.", "PAEA required that GAO complete this report by December 2011. Because  of USPS\u2019s financial crisis and our assessment that restructuring is urgently  needed, our work has been accelerated at the request of Members of  Congress and is presented in this report. Our objectives were to assess   (1) the viability of USPS\u2019s business model, (2) strategies and options to  address the challenges to USPS\u2019s current business model, and (3) actions  Congress and USPS need to take to facilitate progress toward USPS\u2019s  financial viability.", "In conducting our work related to assessing the viability of USPS\u2019s  business model and strategies and options to solve its challenges, we  relied on our past work and USPS financial and operating data. We  interviewed various USPS officials, including the Postmaster General, the  Deputy Postmaster General, the former and current Chairmen of the  Board of Governors, and headquarters and field staff. We reviewed USPS\u2019s  Action Plan released March 2010 and its financial and volume  projections. We did not assess the validity of USPS\u2019s financial and mail  volume projections due to time and resource constraints. We reviewed  USPS\u2019s current legal and regulatory framework and relevant congressional  testimonies and hearings. We also reviewed the results of retiree health  valuations provided to us by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  in March 2010, which were based on USPS employee population  projections. We did not assess the reasonableness of these projections or  OPM\u2019s actuarial assumptions and methodology. We utilized OPM\u2019s  valuation results to analyze the financial impacts of selected options for  funding USPS\u2019s retiree health benefit obligations.", "We also examined studies performed by other postal stakeholders,  including the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), USPS Office of  Inspector General (OIG), the 2003 President\u2019s Commission on the United  States Postal Service, and other mailing industry experts. We met with  PRC commissioners and staff, representatives of the four major employee  unions and three major management associations, USPS OIG, members of  the mailing industry, economists, and other stakeholders. We distributed a  list of questions to over 60 organizations to collect additional information  on actions that could be taken to improve USPS\u2019s business model and the  potential impacts of these actions. The organizations represented various  sections of the postal community, such as postal unions and management  associations; small and large mailers; and mailers across various segments  (e.g., First-Class Mail, Standard Mail, Periodicals, parcels, newspapers, and  nonprofit mail); and other companies in the mailing industry. They were  selected on the basis of several factors, including testifying before  Congress on postal issues; submitting comments to the 2003 President\u2019s  Commission; submitting comments to PRC on universal service, the postal  monopoly, and the new regulatory structure for ratemaking; and  submitting comments to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on  differences in the legal status between USPS and its competitors.", "We gathered and evaluated relevant strategies and options on the basis of  a variety of criteria, including their potential to reduce USPS costs, realign  its operations, and increase revenues, in light of USPS\u2019s current and  projected financial condition. In this report, we present selected options  that could be considered to address USPS\u2019s financial viability on the basis  of these criteria. Some options are consistent with actions we have  discussed in our past work, while others have been discussed in  congressional hearings, regulatory proceedings, and major studies. We  analyzed the options on the basis of the criteria that we have previously  listed, including available cost and revenue data. Furthermore, assessing  certain options related to a comprehensive restructuring of USPS\u2019s legal  and regulatory framework was limited because it is still too soon to see  the full impact of the changes from PAEA. We also plan to address the  experiences of foreign postal administrations in a separate report.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to April 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Until 1970, the federal government provided postal services via  the U.S. Post Office Department, a government agency that received  annual appropriations from Congress. Congress was involved in many  aspects of the department\u2019s operations, including the selection of  managers (e.g., postmasters), and in setting postal rates and wages. A  presidential commission (The Kappel Commission) reported to the  President in 1968 on the crisis facing the department, which included  financial losses, management problems, service breakdowns, low  productivity, and low employee morale. The Kappel Commission\u2019s basic  finding was that \u201cthe procedures for administering the ordinary executive  departments of Government are inappropriate for the Post Office.\u201d  Furthermore, it concluded that  \u201ca transfer of the postal system to the private sector is not feasible,  largely for reasons of financing\u2026but the possibility remains of private  ownership at some future time, if such a transfer were then considered  to be feasible and in the public interest\u2026. We recommend, therefore,  that Congress charter a Government-owned Corporation to operate the  postal service. The corporate form would permit much more  successful operation of what has become a major business activity  than is possible under present circumstances.\u201d", "The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) of 1970 replaced the department  with the current USPS model\u2014an independent establishment of the  executive branch designed to be self-sustaining by covering its operating  costs with revenues generated through the sales of postage and postal- related products and services. USPS receives no appropriations for  purposes other than revenue forgone on free and reduced rate mail.", "In 1996, Congress again began considering the merits of postal reform and  ultimately enacted PAEA in 2006. A number of factors encouraged reform,  including financial challenges, such as growing cash-flow problems and  debt. A second presidential commission examined USPS\u2019s future and  issued a report in 2003 that recommended a number of actions to ensure  the viability of postal services. Additionally, the Postal Civil Service  Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 was enacted after OPM  determined that USPS was overfunding its employees\u2019 pensions. This law  required the amounts achieved by reducing the previous pension  contributions to be used toward USPS\u2019s debt to the U.S. Treasury and set  aside any remaining amounts in an escrow account. Congress addressed  how the escrowed funds should be used\u2014along with many of USPS\u2019s  other financial and operational challenges\u2014in PAEA. Key requirements  and flexibilities provided in PAEA are detailed in table 1.", "PAEA also made changes to USPS\u2019s regulatory and oversight structure. In  addition to responsibilities for reviewing pricing and nonpostal services  described in table 1, the newly created PRC gained additional oversight  responsibilities, including responsibility for making annual determinations  of USPS compliance with applicable laws, developing accounting practices  and procedures for USPS, reviewing the universal service obligation, and  providing transparency through periodic reports. The USPS Board of  Governors, which has responsibilities similar to a board of directors of a  publicly held corporation, directs the exercise of the powers of USPS,  directs and controls its expenditures, reviews its practices, conducts long- range planning, and sets policies on all postal matters.

Changes in these areas would need to be negotiated with  employee unions and would involve tradeoffs between reducing costs and  addressing union concerns that reducing workforce size and  compensation and benefits would erode the number of well-paying jobs.", "About 85 percent of USPS employees are covered by collective bargaining  agreements, which correspond with major crafts (see table 3). USPS and  its employee unions will begin negotiations for new agreements in 2010  and 2011. If USPS and its unions are unable to agree, binding arbitration by  a third-party panel will ultimately be used to establish agreement. USPS is  also required to consult with its management associations that represent  postmasters and supervisors. About 78 percent of USPS employees are full  time and receive salary increases and cost-of-living adjustments based on  predetermined levels. These employees are generally scheduled in 8-hour  shifts and can earn overtime pay, except for rural mail carriers, who are  generally paid a salary without overtime. Managers are not covered by  collective bargaining agreements and are compensated under a pay-for- performance program. About 90 percent of city carriers are full time, while  about 55 percent of rural carriers are full time.", "USPS has not achieved significant reductions in compensation and  benefits, in part due to the following challenges:    USPS is required by law to maintain compensation and benefits  comparable to the private sector. The application of the comparability  standard to postal employees\u2014that is, whether a compensation premium  exists between postal employees and private-sector employees who do  comparable work\u2014has been a source of disagreement between  management and postal unions in negotiations and interest arbitration.", "Career USPS employees participate in federal pension and benefits  programs, including health care and life insurance.

Nevertheless, USPS covers a higher proportion of employee  premiums for health care and life insurance than most other federal  agencies. The law requires USPS\u2019s fringe benefits to be at least as  favorable as those in effect when the PRA of 1970 was enacted.", "USPS is also required by law to participate in the federal workers\u2019  compensation program and ensure coverage for injured employees.  Some benefits provided under the federal program exceed those provided  in the private sector. For example, injured USPS employees with  dependents receive 75 percent of their salary compared with the 66  percent of pay private employers covered under state workers\u2019  compensation laws typically provide.  Furthermore, USPS employees  receiving this benefit often do not opt to retire when eligible, staying  permanently on the more generous workers\u2019 compensation rolls.", "Current collective bargaining agreements include provisions related to  compensation, leave, workforce composition, and work rules. They also  include some provisions that allow USPS to make changes, such as  relocating employees, but other provisions limit USPS\u2019s flexibility to  manage work efficiently and rightsize its workforce. For example, current  collective bargaining agreements  limit the percentage of part-time and contract workers who help USPS  match its workforce to changing workload;  limit managers from assigning work to employees outside of their  crafts, such as having a retail clerk deliver mail;  limit outsourcing for city delivery routes; and    contain \u201cno-layoff\u201d provisions for about 500,000 employees and require  USPS to release lower-cost part-time and temporary employees before  it can layoff any full-time workers without layoff protection.", "Currently, if the collective bargaining process reaches binding arbitration,  there is no statutory requirement for USPS\u2019s financial condition to be  considered.

At that time, the dedicated Postal Service Retiree Health  Benefits Fund (the RHB Fund) had a balance of $35.5 billion, and,  therefore, unfunded obligations of $52.0 billion remained. These unfunded  obligations developed largely because, prior to the enactment of PAEA in  2006, USPS financed its share of the health insurance premiums for its  retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than on the annual accrued cost of  future benefits attributable to the service of current employees. PAEA  required USPS to begin prefunding its retiree health benefit obligations  with annual payments to the RHB Fund, while continuing to pay its share  of the retiree health premiums of current retirees to the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Fund (the FEHB Fund).", "Since PAEA was enacted, mail volume has declined, USPS\u2019s financial  condition has deteriorated, and it has had difficulty in making its required  payments to prefund its retiree health benefit obligations.

At the end of fiscal year 2009, USPS had about  463,000 annuitants and survivors participating in the Federal Employees  Health Benefits Program. Furthermore, 162,000 USPS career employees  are eligible for regular retirement this fiscal year, and this number is  projected to increase to about 300,000 career employees over the next  decade. For fiscal year 2010, USPS has reported that it is \u201chighly  uncertain\u201d whether it will have sufficient cash to cover its required  prefunding payment of $5.5 billion that is due by September 30, 2010.  According to USPS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget, by making the required  prefunding payment, it will end the fiscal year with a cash balance of only  $200 million. However, USPS officials have said that this cash balance  would likely be inadequate to finance operations in October 2010, when it  must make three payroll payments of close to $2 billion each, as well as a  payment for workers\u2019 compensation costs expected to exceed $1 billion.  In response to these likely conditions, USPS has requested that Congress  revise the required schedule for retiree health benefits payments as part of  a package to improve its financial viability.", "There are multiple options for funding USPS\u2019s retiree health benefit  obligations. In addition to the current prefunding approach, where the  obligations are paid prior to when USPS\u2019s share of retiree health premiums  are due, there are two broad approaches\u2014(1) a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d funding  approach, where USPS\u2019s share of retiree health premiums are paid as they  are billed for current retirees, and (2) an actuarial funding approach,  where payments include amounts for \u201cnormal costs\u201d to finance the future  retiree health benefits attributed to the service of current employees and  amortization amounts to liquidate unfunded obligations over a 40-year  period. The impact of these various approaches on USPS\u2019s payments  would depend on whether its share of retiree health premiums would be  paid directly by USPS to the FEHB Fund or whether the premiums would  be paid from the RHB Fund. Depending on which option is selected,  changes could also impact the federal budget deficit. PAEA\u2019s approach to  funding USPS\u2019s retiree health benefit obligations is a combination of the  prefunding and pay-as-you-go approaches that we have previously  described. Specifically, PAEA requires USPS to make two payments  annually over fiscal years 2010 through 2016:    a payment to the FEHB Fund to cover its share of the premiums for    a statutorily determined payment to the RHB Fund to prefund obligations  for future retirees.", "Starting in fiscal year 2017\u2014after the last statutorily scheduled prefunding  payment\u2014PAEA requires that USPS\u2019s share of retiree health premiums be  paid from the RHB Fund and requires OPM to determine future payments  to the RHB Fund. Each annual payment to the RHB Fund starting in fiscal  year 2017 will be the sum of the two amounts that finance the following:  the annual accrued cost of future benefits attributable to the service of  current USPS employees, which OPM refers to as \u201cnormal costs,\u201d and    amortization payments over 40 years to liquidate any unfunded obligations.", "Table 4 shows USPS payments from fiscal years 2010 through 2020, based  on updated estimates that OPM provided to us for this report. Total USPS  payments are estimated to increase from $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2010 to  $10.3 billion in fiscal year 2016. The payments are estimated to decline to  $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 and increase to $7.3 billion in fiscal year  2020. Based on GAO analysis, assuming that USPS made these payments  through 2020, estimated unfunded obligations of about $33 billion would  remain.", "In 2009, proposed legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress  that would have revised the payment schedule for postal retiree health  benefits. The House legislation (H.R. 22) would have shifted  responsibility for payments for current retiree health premiums from  USPS to the RHB Fund for fiscal years 2009 through 2011. Such action  would result in USPS needing to pay additional amounts to the RHB Fund  in the future due to the use of those RHB funds for current retiree health  premiums. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that  enacting the House legislation would have a net cost to the federal budget  of $2.5 billion over fiscal years 2010 through 2019. The Senate legislation  (S. 1507) would have extended and revised prefunding payments to the  RHB Fund, with the payment amounts increasing from $1.7 billion in fiscal  years 2009 and 2010 to $5.3 billion in fiscal year 2019. CBO estimated that  enacting S. 1507 would have a net cost to the federal budget of $2.8 billion  over both fiscal years 2010 through 2019 and fiscal years 2009 through  2014. Ultimately, Congress acted at the end of September 2009 to reduce  costs by deferring USPS\u2019s prefunding payment for retiree health benefits in  fiscal year 2009 by $4 billion.", "We strongly support the principle that USPS should continue to fund its  retiree health benefit obligations to the maximum extent that its finances  permit. Deferrals of funding such benefits would serve as financial relief.  Such deferrals, however, increase the risk that in the future USPS will not  be able to pay these obligations as its core business continues to decline  and if sufficient actions are not taken to restructure operations and reduce  costs. With these considerations, the current statutory approach for  funding USPS\u2019s retiree health benefit obligations can be revised along the  lines of the two broad approaches to funding retiree health obligations\u2014 pay-as-you-go and actuarial. The approaches vary in the amount of annual  payments, which, in turn, impact the unfunded obligation, lower annual  payments, and result in higher unfunded obligation balances. For  comparison purposes, we present the estimated unfunded balance for  USPS\u2019s retiree health obligations in fiscal year 2020. These approaches to  revising the current statutory approach are presented in the following text  to illustrate the wide range of possible options.", "Approach #1: Pay-as-you-go approach to funding retiree health benefit  obligations  In March 2010, USPS proposed \u201cto shift to a \u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019 system [for its  retiree health benefits], paying premiums as they are billed\u201d for current  retirees. Estimated annual USPS payments under one possible pay-as-you- go approach are shown in table 5. Under this approach, USPS would make  payments to the FEHB Fund for its share of retiree health premiums. The  RHB Fund would not make or receive payments, but would continue to  earn interest. Based on GAO analysis, USPS\u2019s unfunded obligations would  be an estimated $99 billion in fiscal year 2020, or about $66 billion more  than they would be under current law. This level of unfunded obligations  would increase the risk that, absent future events that could reduce  USPS\u2019s retiree health premiums, USPS\u2019s operations in the future may not  be able to support the future payments that are expected. However, in  such a circumstance, a mechanism could be created to pay a portion of  premium payments from the assets that have accumulated in the RHB  Fund once a threshold was reached, such as when the pay-as-you-go  premium payments reach a particular percentage of postal revenues. Using  the RHB Fund to pay a portion of retiree health premiums would reduce  USPS\u2019s payments to the FEHB Fund and increase USPS\u2019s unfunded  obligations by a corresponding amount. Such a mechanism could, if  implemented carefully, provide some assistance to USPS in meeting its  obligation to pay retiree health premiums.", "Different variations on a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d approach are also possible, such  as using the RHB Fund to pay USPS\u2019s share of retiree health premiums for  current retirees until the RHB Fund is exhausted and then reverting to  USPS funding future premiums from its operations by paying the FEHB  Fund directly. Under this alternative, USPS\u2019s payments would be  suspended until the RHB Fund is exhausted, which would be  approximately fiscal year 2025.", "Approach #2: Actuarial approach to funding retiree health benefit  obligations  An actuarial funding approach for USPS retiree health benefit obligations  could provide a financing mechanism that allows the RHB Fund to remain  self-sustaining in the long term. Under one such approach, unfunded  retiree health benefit obligations would be reamortized starting in fiscal  year 2010, instead of fiscal year 2017, as required under current law.", "Specifically, starting in fiscal year 2010, USPS would make payments to  the RHB Fund that finance the following:  the annual accrued cost of future benefits attributable to the service of  current USPS employees, which OPM refers to as \u201cnormal costs,\u201d and    amortization payments over 40 years to liquidate any unfunded  obligations.", "Under this actuarial funding approach, USPS would make annual  estimated payments that total about $80 billion from fiscal years 2010  through 2020 (see table 6). Based on GAO analysis, in fiscal year 2020, the  estimated unfunded obligations under this method would be about $48  billion, or about $15 billion more than they would be under current law.", "PAEA\u2019s funding requirements represent a significant financial commitment  for USPS, especially in light of the current economic environment and the  major challenges it faces. As we have testified, we continue to be  concerned about those options that would greatly reduce payments in the  short term, only to defer payments into the future. Specifically, we are  concerned that deferring these payments or some portion into the future  increases the risk that USPS may have difficulty in making the future  payments, particularly if mail volumes continue to decline. Because its  retirees are eligible to receive the same health benefits as other federal  retirees, if USPS cannot make its required payments, the U.S. Treasury,  and hence the taxpayer, would still have to meet the federal government\u2019s  obligations.", "USPS employees participate in the federal government\u2019s two civilian  pension plans\u2014the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the  Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS)\u2014that are administered by  OPM. As of the end of fiscal year 2009, approximately 80 percent of USPS\u2019s  employees were enrolled in FERS, while 20 percent were enrolled in CSRS  or the Dual Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security (Dual  CSRS). As an agency employer, USPS is required by law to make certain  payments to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) to  fund its share of CSRS and FERS pension costs. In addition to providing  an annuity at retirement based on years of service and \u201chigh-3\u201d average  pay, FERS also consists of Social Security and the government\u2019s Thrift  Savings Plan (TSP). As such, USPS contributes the employer\u2019s share of  Social Security taxes and the required contributions to its employees\u2019 TSP  accounts.", "Because USPS\u2019s pension, Social Security, and TSP contributions are in  part a function of employee wages as defined for these programs, changes  in total employee wages will have a corresponding effect on USPS\u2019s costs  for these items. USPS\u2019s retirement expenses were $5.9 billion in fiscal year  2009. As we have previously mentioned, most USPS employees are full  time, can receive overtime pay, and receive pay increases and cost-of- living adjustments as set forth in collective bargaining agreements with  various unions. Other USPS employees, typically managers and  postmasters, are compensated under pay-for-performance programs.  USPS\u2019s ability to reduce the size of its workforce and the number of  workhours, the strategies and options for which are described elsewhere  in this report, will affect the pension, Social Security, and TSP benefit  costs it incurs for most of its employees.", "Furthermore, the methods and rates at which USPS funds pension benefit  costs are set forth in law. In 2002, OPM estimated that, under statutory  pension funding requirements applicable to USPS at the time, USPS was  on course to overfund its CSRS pension obligations. Congress responded  by enacting the Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform  Act of 2003, which changed the prior method of estimating and funding  the USPS CSRS pension obligations. The act required USPS to contribute  the employer\u2019s share of \u201cdynamic normal cost\u201d to the CSRDF, plus an  amount to liquidate any underfunding, or \u201cpostal supplemental liability,\u201d  both as determined by OPM. In July 2003, OPM submitted to Congress its  plan enumerating the actuarial methods and assumptions by which OPM  would make its determinations. In 2004, OPM and the Board of Actuaries  for the CSRDF reconsidered OPM\u2019s methodology at the request of USPS  and concluded that OPM\u2019s methodology was in accordance with  congressional intent. OPM also rejected an alternative methodology  offered by USPS.", "In January 2010, the USPS OIG issued a report on funding the USPS\u2019s  CSRS pension responsibility. This report asserted that, despite the  changes brought about in the 2003 Act, the current method of allocating  the pension costs for post-1971 pay increases results in the inequitable  allocation of pension obligations to USPS. The USPS OIG proposed an  alternative allocation methodology that its actuaries estimated would, if  implemented, change the funded status of USPS\u2019s CSRS pension  obligations from a current $10 billion underfunding to a $65 billion  overfunding. This alternative allocation methodology is the same  methodology that OPM rejected in 2004. Application of the USPS OIG\u2019s  proposed methodology would result in a shift of pension funding costs  from USPS to the U.S. Treasury.", "Health and life insurance: Health insurance premiums for current  employees comprise a growing share of USPS expenses, rising from $2.2  billion (3.5 percent of total expenses) in fiscal year 2000 to $5.3 billion (7.4  percent) in fiscal year 2009. Collective bargaining agreements require  USPS to pay a more generous share of employees\u2019 health and life  insurance premiums than most other agencies. For example, USPS paid,  on average, 81 percent of health benefit premiums in fiscal year 2009  compared with 72 percent by other federal agencies. It also paid 100  percent of employee life insurance premiums, while other federal agencies  pay about 33 percent. One option would be to increase employee premium  payments for health and life insurance premiums. USPS\u2019s share of the  health and life insurance premium payments could be reduced to levels  paid by most federal agencies, which would increase the employees\u2019  annual premium payments and, according to USPS estimates, would have  saved about $615 million in fiscal year 2009.", "Workers\u2019 compensation: The 2003 President\u2019s Commission recommended  making USPS\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program more comparable to  programs in the private sector to control costs, still provide adequate  benefits, and address USPS\u2019s unfunded liability in this area. The  commission recommended that USPS be allowed to (1) transition  employees receiving workers\u2019 compensation to its pension plan on the  basis of when the employee (if not injured) would be retirement eligible  and (2) limit benefits from the current 75 percent for employees with  dependents to two-thirds of the maximum weekly rate\u2014the rate that  applies to employees without dependents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Postal Workforce Mix and Work Rules", "paragraphs": ["Limitations on the workforce mix of full-time and part-time postal  employees and workforce flexibility rules contained in contracts with  USPS\u2019s unions are key determinants of how postal work is organized and,  thus, of its cost.

These  part-time employees would have flexible schedules and responsibilities  and lower pay than full-time career employees. A key issue is how USPS  can obtain greater flexibility through the collective bargaining process so  that it can adjust its workforce more quickly to adapt to changing volume  and revenue. Some options for postal workforce mix and work rules  include the following:    Part-time workers: Increase the percentage of part-time employees, who  could work more flexible schedules, including less than an 8-hour shift.  Such flexibility could help match USPS\u2019s workforce to the changing  workload, which varies greatly depending on the day of the week and the  time of the year.", "Job Flexibility: Increase the flexibility to use employees in different  assignments. Changes in the skill requirements of some jobs and the needs  of operations have made it more feasible and necessary for employees to  be trained in different tasks and work in different areas, depending on  daily needs.

USPS  explained that post offices are often less convenient for customers in  terms of hours and accessibility, and cost two to three times more than  alternatives. USPS also noted that it has more retail locations than  McDonalds, Starbucks, Walgreens, and Walmart combined, but the  average post office provides service to about 600 customers weekly\u2014or  about 1/10th in comparison to Walgreens.

More than 320,000 carriers account for close to one-half of  USPS salary and benefit expenses.

According to USPS studies, its savings would be primarily  achieved by eliminating work performed by city and rural letter carriers.  Additional savings would be realized from reducing the use of delivery  vehicles as well as reducing the scope of mail processing activities that  support Saturday delivery. However, concerns have been raised about the  impact on customers, who may need to wait longer to receive time- sensitive mail or go to USPS retail facilities to pick up mail; senders, who  may have to change when they send mail; and USPS, which may lose the  competitive advantage of delivering on Saturdays. According to USPS,  eliminating Saturday delivery is estimated to result in annual savings of  about $3 billion. PRC reported in 2009 that eliminating Saturday delivery  would result in estimated annual savings of about $2.2 billion, on the basis  of somewhat different assumptions regarding the likely effects on mail  volume and costs. For this option to be implemented, Congress would  need to exclude statutory restrictions that mandate 6-day delivery from  USPS annual appropriations. USPS filed a request on March 30, 2010, for a  PRC advisory opinion on its proposal to eliminate Saturday delivery,  which would lead to a public proceeding that would include input by  interested parties.", "Allow USPS to determine delivery frequency on the basis of local mail  volume: A related option would be to change delivery frequency to match  mail volumes to demand, which could change by season as well as by local  area. For example, USPS could have less frequent delivery in low-volume  summer months than the high-volume holiday season. Some residents  already do not receive 6-day delivery, particularly those located in remote  or seasonal vacation areas. A consequence of this option could be more  frequent delivery to areas with higher mail volume, which could be in  higher-income areas, which tend to receive much more mail.

Historically, some  types of mail were designed to channel broad public goals, such as  furthering the dissemination of information, the distribution of  merchandise, and the advancement of nonprofit organizations. For  example, Periodicals (mainly, mailed magazines and newspapers) have  historically been given favorable rates, consistent with the view that they  help bind the nation together, but this class has not covered its costs for  the past 13 fiscal years. Losses from Periodicals increased from $74 million  in fiscal year 1997 to $438 million in fiscal year 2008 and to $642 million in  fiscal year 2009. These escalating losses have provoked growing concern  and controversy. Postal stakeholders are currently debating what  corrective actions, if any, are warranted, and their possible impact on  Periodicals.", "Other money-losing types of mail with social benefits include the  following:    Single-piece Parcel Post was introduced in 1913 to provide affordable  parcel delivery; this opened up the mail order merchandise market,  especially in rural areas.", "Media Mail, or \u201cbook rate,\u201d as it was formerly known, was initially  designed in 1938 to provide lower rates for mailed books and encourage  the mailing of educational materials.", "Library Mail was introduced in 1928 as a preferential rate for books sent  by or to libraries and was later expanded to schools, colleges, and  universities in 1953.", "According to a Congressional Research Service report, when Congress put  USPS on a self-sustaining basis in 1971, it continued to subsidize the  mailing costs of such groups as the blind, nonprofit organizations, local  newspapers, and publishers of educational material, by providing an  appropriation to cover the revenues that were given up, or \u201cforgone,\u201d in  charging below-cost rates to these groups. Appropriations for these  subsidies mounted as postage rates and the number of nonprofits grew,  approaching $1 billion annually in the mid-1980s.

Questions continue about how  these money-losing types of mail should be funded.", "All money-losing market-dominant products lost $1.7 billion collectively in  fiscal year 2009, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2008 (see table 10). In  addition to the $642 million lost from Periodicals in fiscal year 2009, the  largest money-losing product was Standard Mail Flats ($616 million).  Losses from Standard Mail Flats have nearly tripled over the past fiscal  year. In its Annual Compliance Determination report for fiscal year 2009,  PRC discussed actions that could be taken to deal with these and other  money-losing products. Some of the losses from Standard Mail are due to  unprofitable mail sent by nonprofit organizations. By law, rates for  nonprofit Standard Mail are 60 percent of the rates for the most closely  corresponding type of for-profit Standard Mail. However, nonprofit rates  benefit charitable and religious organizations, and Congress has long  required preferential rates for nonprofit mail.", "If Congress were to decide that all market-dominant products should  cover their costs, it could also revisit other legal requirements that  constrain USPS\u2019s pricing flexibility for these products. First, the price cap  requirement may need to be revisited to enable some types of mail to be  increased over the cap without resorting to the exigent rate increase  process. For example, the average rate increase for the Periodicals class is  limited to inflation under the price cap. Similarly, single-piece Parcel Post,  Media Mail, and Library Mail are a significant part of the Package Services  class that is also covered by the price cap. In addition, USPS could  continue to gradually implement a rate structure for Periodicals that is  based more on costs, which could involve rate increases for mail that is  more costly to handle (e.g., mail provided to USPS in sacks, rather than on  pallets). However, such a rate structure could disproportionately affect  some small-circulation magazines.", "Issues regarding which entity should consider and decide on changes to  universal service\u2014including Congress, PRC, or USPS\u2014have long been  debated. Because many aspects of universal service are required by law,  Congress would have to make any changes in these areas. For example,  Congress would have to redefine certain aspects of universal postal  service that are required under current law, such as 6-day delivery, revised  statutory preferences for nonprofit mail, and restrictions on closing small  post offices. For some aspects of universal service, such as related pricing  issues, PRC has the authority to act by establishing regulations that govern  postal pricing and overseeing USPS compliance with legal requirements.

A possible  rationale for sharing this responsibility would be to allow private  companies to provide postal services, with the idea that competition could  give some customers more choices that better meet their needs, through  lower cost products and expanded services. A related consideration is that  some aspects of postal service, particularly mail delivery, are considered  to have economies of scale, meaning that, in theory, one provider might  fulfill this function more economically than multiple providers. In practice,  multiple providers\u2014including USPS and numerous companies\u2014already  deliver mail (e.g., contractors who provide long-distance mail  transportation and deliver mail to households located along sparsely  populated highway routes).", "Another question is whether USPS should continue to fulfill other roles, or  whether these roles should be discharged by other agencies.

A rationale for the mail monopoly is to  prevent private competitors from engaging in an activity known as cream- skimming, that is, offering service on low-cost routes at prices below those  of USPS, while leaving USPS with high-cost routes. Furthermore, allowing  private companies to compete for mail now covered by the monopoly  could lead to additional declines in mail volume and revenue, thereby  increasing excess capacity and reducing USPS\u2019s net income.", "According to PRC, the most frequent argument against the mail monopoly  is that, assuming a legal framework continues to exist to protect public  interest and the provision of universal service, competitive markets might  produce more efficient, innovative, flexible, and fairer services to buyers  and producers. Narrowing or eliminating the monopoly could increase  consumer choice and provide incentives for USPS to become more  effective and efficient.

USPS filed a request on  March 30, 2010, for a PRC advisory opinion on its proposal to eliminate  Saturday delivery.", "Generating revenue through new or enhanced product and services: On  the revenue side, a key issue is whether USPS can make sufficient  progress using the pricing and product flexibility provided in PAEA or  whether changes may be needed. The Action Plan stated that USPS needs  additional authority to adjust its pricing to better reflect market dynamics  and proposed some changes. These proposals have not been fully  analyzed, nor have PRC and stakeholders had an opportunity to provide  input. Thus, it is unclear what statutory or regulatory changes should be  made at this time. Another key issue is whether USPS should be allowed  to engage in new nonpostal areas that may compete with private firms.  Congress considered many of the public policy issues in this area related  to fair competition prior to PAEA\u2019s enactment in 2006 and decided at that  time not to let USPS engage in new nonpostal areas. It is not clear what  specific actions USPS would like to take, their expected profitability, or  how they might affect other businesses. USPS\u2019s current financial condition  may limit its expansion into other areas in the short term, but ultimately its  plans in this area could affect its operations.", "Realigning operations, networks, and workforce: Once Congress and  USPS have determined what, if any, changes should be made in the  products and services that it provides, corresponding changes will be  needed in postal operations, networks, and workforce. This area involves  some public policy issues that Congress may want to address. USPS will  need to address detailed operational issues related to increasing cost- efficiency. Some of the difficult tradeoffs in this area include USPS\u2019s need  to significantly reduce its size to remain self-financing and keep prices  affordable, versus concerns about whether such reductions could harm  the value of its brand, its network of physical assets, and the social  benefits that it provides as well as the effects of these actions on its  workforce.", "USPS has made limited progress in optimizing its networks over the last  decade, particularly in facilities that include public access to retail  operations. For example, in July 2009, USPS initiated a PRC review of over  3,600 retail stations and branches located primarily in urban and suburban  areas for possible consolidation or discontinuance, but fewer than 200  facilities remain under consideration for such actions. PRC issued its  advisory opinion on USPS\u2019s proposed retail consolidations in early March,  which affirmed USPS\u2019s authority to adjust its retail network while  recommending several process improvements. Considering the  numerous statutory and regulatory requirements in this area, it could be  difficult to make rapid changes to rightsize its network of 36,500 retail  facilities. USPS\u2019s Action Plan says that it plans to expand access to retail  service and, as customers shift to these new services, that it will reduce  redundant retail facilities. However, it is unclear what specific changes  would be made, how long it would take to make these changes, and how  much annual cost savings could be achieved. USPS\u2019s Action Plan also  does not address possible closures of large mail processing facilities to  reduce the excess capacity in its mail processing network.", "A new approach is urgently needed to make the necessary progress in  realigning postal operations and networks as USPS\u2019s core business  continues to decline. Conducting business as usual is unlikely to produce  significant results, particularly in the rapid time frame that would be  required to avert massive losses. Thus, it will be important for Congress,  USPS, and other stakeholders to reach agreement on the package of  actions that should be taken, the desired operational and financial results,  and the time frames for implementation. Key questions that need to be  addressed include the following:    Universal service issues: What, if any, changes are needed\u2014that is,  should delivery services be changed (e.g., frequency or standards), and  should USPS continue moving retail services out of post offices to  alternative locations?", "New products and services: What opportunities are there to introduce  profitable new postal products and enhancements to existing ones?  Should USPS engage in nonpostal areas where there are private-sector  providers? If so, under what terms?", "Realigning operations, networks, and workforce: How should USPS  optimize its operations, networks, and workforce to support changes in  services; how quickly can this happen; and how can it work with its  employees and customers to minimize potential disruption?", "This is an area where Congress may want to consider an approach similar  to that used by the Department of Defense\u2019s Base Realignment and  Closure (BRAC) Commission, which was established to realign military  installations within the United States. Under the Defense Base Closure and  Realignment Act of 1990, the President can either accept or reject BRAC  recommendations in their entirety. If rejected, the BRAC Commission  could give the President a revised list of recommendations. If the  President accepts the list of recommendations, it is forwarded to Congress  and the list becomes final, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution. Our  report on the 2005 BRAC round noted that the Department of Defense  viewed this BRAC as a unique opportunity to reshape its installations and  realign its forces to meet its needs for the next 20 years.", "Congress has previously turned to panels of independent experts to assist  in restructuring organizations that are facing key financial challenges.  These panels have gained consensus and developed proposed legislative  or other changes to address difficult public policy issues. For example, the  District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance  Authority was established to, among other things, (1) eliminate budget  deficits and cash shortages of the District through financial planning,  sound budgeting, accurate revenue forecasts, and careful spending;   (2) ensure the most efficient and effective delivery of services, including  public safety services, by the District during a period of fiscal emergency;  and (3) conduct necessary investigations and studies. This organization  was suspended in 2001 once relevant legal provisions were met, including  achieving a balanced budget for a 4th consecutive year.", "Establishing a similar commission or control board of independent experts  could provide a mechanism to assist Congress in making timely decisions  and comprehensive changes to USPS\u2019s business model and operations. A  commission of experts may be more appropriate to facilitate the changes  needed to achieve financial viability while also considering stakeholder  interests. The following questions could assist Congress in developing  such a commission:    What criteria should be used to select commission members, for example,  logistics experience, business restructuring, or labor management  expertise?", "How could the commission best ensure that diverse stakeholder interests  are appropriately considered?", "What would be the time frame of the commission?", "What goals or objectives should guide the commission\u2014for example,  ensuring USPS\u2019s financial viability, and recommending policy and  management changes?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USPS faces daunting financial losses that it projects could total over $238  billion through fiscal year 2020, unless it can substantially reduce its costs,  including the size of its operations, networks, and workforce to reflect  declining mail volume, and to generate new revenues.

Therefore, Congress, USPS, and other stakeholders need  to reach agreement on a package of actions to take so that USPS can  become financially viable. This agreement will need to address difficult  constraints and legal restrictions that continue to hamper progress. Such  an agreement is urgently needed so that Congress and stakeholders have  confidence that the actions USPS takes will be fair to all stakeholders.

Another action that Congress could  take in the near term, which would have a longer-term impact, would be to  modify the collective bargaining process to ensure that any binding  arbitration would take USPS\u2019s financial condition into account.  Furthermore, Congress may want assurance through regular reports that  any financial relief it provides is met with aggressive actions to reduce  costs and increase revenues, and that progress is being made toward  addressing its financial problems.", "Ultimately, Congress may want to consider changing USPS\u2019s ownership  structure, but the resolution of these more pressing issues might afford a  better understanding of whether the ownership structure should be  modified. As communications and the use of the mail evolve, Congress will  need to revisit policy issues related to USPS, the services it provides, and  how to best position the organization for the future.

At the same time, to facilitate making progress in difficult areas, Congress  should consider establishing (1) a panel of independent experts, similar to  a BRAC-like commission, to coordinate with USPS and stakeholders to  develop a package of proposed legislative and operational changes needed  to reduce costs and address challenges to USPS\u2019s business model and   (2) procedures for the review and approval of these proposals by the  President and Congress.

Second, USPS agreed that Congress should  consider revising the statutory framework for USPS collective bargaining  to ensure that binding arbitration takes its financial condition into  account. Third, USPS agreed that Congress should consider requiring  USPS to provide regular reports to ensure that it is making progress to  improve its financial condition.

Because of  USPS\u2019s financial crisis and our assessment that restructuring is urgently  needed, our work has been accelerated at the request of Members of  Congress and is presented in this report. The objectives of this report are  to assess (1) the viability of USPS\u2019s business model, (2) strategies and  options to address challenges to USPS\u2019s current business model, and   (3) actions Congress and USPS need to take to facilitate progress toward  USPS\u2019s financial viability.", "To assess the viability of USPS\u2019s business model, we relied on our past work,  including putting USPS\u2019s financial condition on GAO\u2019s high-risk list in July  2009, and on our testimonies regarding its deteriorating financial condition.  We interviewed multiple USPS officials, including the Postmaster General, the  Deputy Postmaster General, the former and current Chairman of the Board of  Governors, and headquarters and field staff during visits to post offices, mail  processing facilities, and other facilities that serve urban and rural areas.

We then supplemented this information  by distributing a list of questions to over 60 organizations to gather their  opinions on actions that could be taken to improve USPS\u2019s business model  and the potential impacts of these actions. Organizations were selected on  the basis of a variety of factors, including those who have testified before  Congress on postal issues; submitted comments (1) during the public  comment solicitations as part of the work of the 2003 President\u2019s  Commission on the United States Postal Service, (2) to PRC on universal  service, the postal monopoly, and the new regulatory structure for  ratemaking, and (3) to the Federal Trade Commission on differences in the  legal status between USPS and its competitors; and have been active  participants in various USPS-related activities, including participation in  the Mailers\u2019 Technical Advisory Committee (a joint USPS-industry  workgroup). We also considered the nature of the organization and  selected organizations that represented various sections of the postal  community, including unions, management associations, private printing  and mailing companies, and mailers across various mail segments (e.g.,  large and smaller mailers, First-Class Mail, Standard Mail, Periodicals,  parcels, newspapers, and nonprofit mail).
