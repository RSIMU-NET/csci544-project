The Department of State regulates U.S. defense exports and the Department of Commerce regulates dual-use exports that have commercial and military applications. Each agency uses a separate control list of items that may require a license to export. Agencies use compliance activities to prevent the diversion or misuse of exported items against U.S. interests or allies. Misuse can occur through illicit transshipment, the diversion of items from their origin through an intermediary country to an unauthorized destination.

Compliance activities include (1) vetting transactions prior to export, (2) analyzing shipping data and monitoring the end use of items, and (3) educating companies and foreign governments about illicit transshipment risks. To vet transactions, agencies review license applications for the export of controlled items, consult multiple lists of entities known or suspected of violating export control laws or regulations, and screen foreign end users to determine their eligibility to receive items without a license. Agencies also review shipping records to identify patterns of abuse and to plan end-use checks\u0097visiting foreign companies to verify the approved use and location of exported items on both licensed items and those eligible for export without a license. From 2008 to 2010, Commerce conducted 56 percent of its end-use checks on unlicensed exports. In the 13 transshipment countries, unlicensed exports accounted for about 94 percent of unfavorable end-use check determinations, which indicates that the end use or end user of an export were not appropriate. For example, some unlicensed items transshipped illicitly to Iran through Hong Kong were used to build improvised explosive devices used against Coalition troops in Iraq. When an unfavorable determination is made, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) or Department of State (State) may take further action, such as denying a license or referring involved entities to enforcement agencies for investigation and possible penalties. To educate U.S. companies and foreign governments about illicit transshipment risks, Commerce and State review the internal controls of companies\u0092 compliance programs; conduct outreach to U.S. companies to inform exporters of their responsibilities to comply with export control laws and regulations; and provide training to foreign governments.", "Agencies have not fully assessed the potential impact that control list reforms may pose for the resource needs of their compliance activities. Agencies estimate that Commerce will receive between 16,000 and 30,000 additional license applications as a result of proposed reforms to move less sensitive items from State to Commerce. Agency documents state that this step would allow them to focus resources on items most critical to national security and may make compliance easier for exporters because Commerce imposes fewer requirements than State\u0092s controls. However, Commerce has not assessed the impact this added responsibility would have on its end-use check resource needs. Also, under the reforms, fewer items may require export licenses, thereby reducing uncertainty as to whether export sales will be approved. Some agency officials suggested potential risks, such as an increased need for more end-use checks and the loss of information from reviewing exports through the licensing process prior to export.

The export control system is governed by a complex set of laws,  regulations, and processes and multiple federal agencies administer its  regulatory framework and ensure compliance. State and Commerce each  have a role in U.S. export licensing. Generally, exporters may submit a  license application to State if their items are controlled on the U.S.  Munitions List (USML) or to Commerce if their items are controlled on the  Commerce Control List (CCL) to receive export approval. Exemptions are  permitted under various circumstances, such as allowing for the export of  certain items to Canada without a license. Even though many dual-use  items do not require a license for export to most destinations, they are still  subject to U.S. export control laws. All items subject to the Export  Administration Regulations (EAR), whether or not on the CCL, require  exporters to comply with the EAR. As part of the application review  process, State and Commerce consult with other agencies, including  DOD. Exporters require a license for most arms exports. In 2010,  Commerce processed 21,660 export licenses, and State processed  82,937 export licenses.

Third, agencies screen applicants to identify  trusted end users for the Validated End-User (VEU) program.", "When deciding to approve or deny an export license application,  Commerce and State evaluate it against several factors, including an  assessment of all parties to the transaction and how the recipient plans to  use the item. Commerce factors the risk of illicit transshipment into the  license application review process through a risk assessment tool that  assigns a weighted score to an application, based on the level of concern  associated with the listed party, country, product, and exporter. A high  score may prompt further investigation and an end-use check by  Commerce or embassy officials. In technical comments on a draft of this  report, Commerce stated that the risk assessment tool would affect the  license review process only when Commerce determined that a  prelicense check would be necessary. In those cases, Commerce  incorporates transshipment risk in the license application review process  by dividing countries into three categories of risk, with the third category  including countries identified as transshipment points. Commerce\u2019s list of  highest risk countries includes 7 of the 13 transshipment countries in our  review.

The diversion was part of the efforts of a  larger procurement network that arranged for the transshipment of  radio frequency modules from Singapore to Iran for use in improvised  explosive devices found in Iraq. Placement of an individual\u2019s name on  the Entity List notifies exporters of a potential licensing requirement or  a ban on exports. In August 2008, Commerce expanded criteria for  addition to the Entity List to allow an entity to be placed on the list if  there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable  facts, that the entity has been involved, is involved, or poses a  significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to  the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.

In addition, end-use monitoring programs are to provide  assurances that defense articles and services are used for the purposes  for which they are provided. Accordingly, under State\u2019s monitoring effort  known as the Blue Lantern program, State conducts end-use monitoring  of direct commercial sales of defense articles and services and related  technology.

In addition, this information would enable BIS to target  its end use checks of exports more effectively because it could select  items of the greatest significance without extensive follow-up information  from the exporter.

Commerce stated that its new Munitions Control Division will include  24 personnel; eight of these 24 will be compliance specialists who will  work within the organization to monitor items shipped. These  compliance specialists will work with enforcement analysts to identify  entities to conduct both end-use checks overseas and U.S. company  onsite audits. However, the rationale for these eight compliance  specialists is unclear. Commerce\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget request  listed only 24 licensing officers and Commerce did not provide us with  any analysis to show that these would include specifically 8  compliance specialists. In addition, while the administration intends to  move up to 30,000 license applications from State to Commerce\u2019s  jurisdiction, Commerce is targeting only 850 end-use checks for each  fiscal year 2013 and 2014, which is the same number as for fiscal  year 2012. 2.  Commerce stated that, to the extent that information is available, BIS  has used licensing data, public comments, and interagency expertise  to address both benefits and risks of moving items from the USML to  CCL. It stated that the benefits include moving less sensitive  munitions items, mostly parts and components, to a more flexible  licensing regime. However, Commerce provided no evidence that it  completed an assessment of benefits and risks, nor that it assessed  the benefits and risks of control list reform changes on the range of  other compliance activities this report discussed. Nonetheless, the  availability of such information shows that such an assessment can be  done. 3.  Commerce stated that our report makes several references to the  USML as \u201cmore stringent\u201d and that the CCL \u201cimposes fewer  requirements than State\u2019s controls.\u201d Commerce said it would be more  accurate to say that the CCL\u2019s flexibility provides more options in  protecting national security interests. However, State reported in its  August 2011 Final Plan for Retrospective Analysis of Existing Rules  that defense articles that do not require the stringent controls of the  Arms Export Control Act will be moved to Commerce\u2019s jurisdiction,  where the licensing burden on exports can be dramatically reduced. In  addition, we reported in 2008 that, in most cases, Commerce\u2019s  controls over dual-use items are less restrictive than State\u2019s controls  over arms. Many items that Commerce controls do not require  licenses for export to most destinations, while State-controlled items  generally require licenses for most destinations. Also, some sanctions  and embargoes only apply to items on State\u2019s USML and not to those  on the CCL."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Thomas Melito, (202) 512-9601 or melitot@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, key contributors to this report  were Joseph A.
