First, imported food makes up a growing share of the food supply. Second, consumers are increasingly eating foods that are raw or have had minimal processing and that are often associated with foodborne illness. Third, changing demographic patterns mean that more of the U.S. population is, and increasingly will be, susceptible to foodborne illness. In 2005, GAO reported on the approaches and challenges seven countries faced in reorganizing and consolidating food safety functions. Since then, the European Union (EU) has taken on a larger role in overseeing food safety within its 27 member states. GAO was asked to describe how Canada, the EU, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (UK) (1) ensure the safety of imported food, (2) respond to outbreaks of foodborne illness, and (3) measure the effectiveness of their reorganized food safety systems. GAO also asked experts in these countries and the EU to identify emerging food safety challenges that they expect to face over the next decade. In doing this work, GAO did not evaluate the countries' management of their food safety systems or explicitly compare their efforts with those of the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The countries GAO examined have a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safety of imported food. Specifically, they focus on the entire food supply chain, from \"farm to table;\" place primary responsibility for food safety on producers; separate risk assessment and risk management; use a risk-based inspection system; and take steps to ensure that certain food imports meet equivalent safety standards. Under the farm-to-table approach, for example, food safety laws cover every stage of the food production process, starting with how animals are raised and ending when food reaches the consumer. All countries GAO reviewed focus import inspections on the foods likeliest to pose the greatest risk. The EU, for example, requires that all imports of live animals and products of animal origin--which are considered high risk--enter the EU through approved border inspection posts. Several of the selected countries reported that three elements of their food safety systems are critical in helping them respond to outbreaks of foodborne illness. These elements are traceback procedures, cooperative arrangements between government veterinarians and public health officials, and mandatory recall authority. In EU member states, all food must be traceable \"one step forward and one step back\" so industry and government can quickly track any food products to minimize harm to public health and reduce the economic impact on industry. Food and feed business operators must be able to document the names and addresses of the supplier and customer, as well as the nature of the product and date of delivery. Officials in several countries told GAO that mandatory recall authority--the legal authority to remove, or require another party to remove, a product from the market--is rarely used but is an important part of the food safety system because it is the last stop in the supply chain. None of the selected countries had comprehensively evaluated its reorganized food safety system, although several track certain indicators, such as the number of inspections, enforcement actions, and foodborne illness. However, some countries' national audit offices (GAO's counterparts) have evaluated specific aspects of their countries' systems. For example, the UK audit office found that the country's Food Standards Agency had improved public confidence, a stated objective. The EU's Food and Veterinary Office has conducted numerous reviews of aspects of all EU countries' food safety systems and identified areas needing improvement. Most of the selected countries use proxy measures, such as public opinion surveys, to assess their effectiveness. Public opinion in several countries has improved in recent years. Countries' industry and consumer stakeholders also generally had positive views of the reorganized food safety systems. Experts identified food safety challenges that they expect to face over the next decade. These include climate change; demographic change, with increases in elderly people and immigration; and new types of foods, such as ready-to-eat salads, that may result in more incidents of foodborne illness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Like other nations, the United States faces growing food safety challenges  resulting from at least three major trends.  First, imported food makes up a  growing share of the food supply.  According to an analysis by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), the dollar value of agricultural imports  to the United States for consumption increased by about 53 percent in just  4 years, from $46 billion in fiscal year 2003 to $70 billion in fiscal year  2007.  The United States also trades with more than 150 countries and  territories, with food products coming into more than 300 U.S. ports.   USDA estimates that approximately 60 percent of the fresh fruits and  vegetables consumed in the United States is imported, as is 75 percent of  the seafood.  Second, we are increasingly eating foods that are consumed  raw or with minimal processing and that are often associated with  foodborne illness.  For example, according to USDA, leafy greens such as  spinach are the category of produce most likely to be associated with an  outbreak, and the average consumer ate 2.4 pounds of fresh spinach in  2005\u2014a 180 percent increase over 1992.  Third, changing demographic  patterns mean that more of the U.S. population is, and increasingly will be,  susceptible to foodborne illness.  The U.S. population is aging, and older  people tend to be more vulnerable to foodborne illness than younger ones.   The risk of severe and life-threatening symptoms from infections caused  by foodborne pathogens is also higher for young children, pregnant  women, and immune-compromised individuals.  According to the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA), these groups make up about 20 to 25  percent of the U.S. population.", "Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have focused public attention on  the increasing potential for widespread dissemination of contaminated  products.  For example, beginning in September 2006, the United States  experienced an outbreak of E. coli associated with the consumption of  tainted spinach grown in California; this outbreak resulted in confirmed  illnesses and deaths.  Widespread outbreaks of other foodborne illnesses,  such as Salmonella, have also occurred from contaminated peanut butter  and tomatoes.  In addition, there have been problems with certain meat  products, resulting in recalls (which in the United States are  nonmandatory).  Although the number of recalls has declined in recent  years, the quantity of meat and poultry recalled has increased sharply.   Meat and poultry product recalls declined from 125 in 2002 to 58 in 2007.   However, 2 of the 6 biggest meat recalls in U.S. history occurred in a 6- month period, between October 2007 and February 2008.", "In the United States, 15 different federal agencies are responsible for food  safety.  Two agencies, USDA and FDA, have primary responsibility.  USDA  is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry, and certain egg products,  while FDA is responsible for the safety of virtually all other foods,  including milk, seafood, and fruits and vegetables.  Food safety  responsibility is further divided among the 50 states, which may have their  own statutes, regulations, and agencies for regulating and inspecting the  safety and quality of food products.  Over the past 30 years, we have  detailed problems with the current fragmented federal food safety system  and reported that the system has caused inconsistent oversight, ineffective  coordination, and inefficient use of resources.  This fragmentation calls  into question whether the government can plan more strategically to  inspect food production processes, identify and react more quickly to  outbreaks of foodborne illness, and focus on promoting the safety and  integrity of the nation\u2019s food supply.  This fragmentation is the key reason  that we added federal oversight of food safety to our High-Risk Series in  January 2007 and called for a governmentwide examination of the food  safety system.  We recommended, among other things, that Congress  enact comprehensive, uniform, and risk-based food safety legislation and  commission the National Academy of Sciences or a blue ribbon panel to  conduct a detailed analysis of alternative organizational structures for  food safety.", "In 2005, we reported on the approaches and challenges seven countries  faced in consolidating food safety functions.  These countries were  Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and  the United Kingdom (UK).  Some of these countries reorganized their food  safety systems in response to public concern about the safety of the food  supply during outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also  known as mad cow disease) and, in the case of the European countries,  widespread dioxin contamination in chicken products during the 1990s.   Some countries\u2014notably Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand\u2014 reorganized to improve the overall effectiveness of their systems.  Since  our 2005 report, the food safety system of the European Union (EU) has  been fully integrated and is regulated by legislation that applies to all 27  member states.  Japan also reorganized part of its food safety system in  2003, creating a new agency, the Food Safety Commission, to assess the  health risks associated with food.  Even with updated measures in place,  however, it is not possible to totally eliminate all foodborne pathogens  from the food supply.  For example, incidents of E. coli  have increased  slightly in the EU over the past 10 years, and in early 2008, a number of  Japanese citizens became seriously ill after eating frozen dumplings  imported from China that contained a dangerous level of pesticides.", "In this context, you asked us to describe (1) how 6 countries (Canada,  Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, and the UK) that have  reorganized their food safety systems and the EU ensure the safety of  imported food, (2) what these countries and the EU consider to be the  most critical elements in helping them respond to recent outbreaks of  foodborne illness, and (3) how they measure the effectiveness of their  reorganized food safety systems, as well as how effective the reorganized  systems have been in minimizing harm to public health from outbreaks of  foodborne illness.  In addition, we asked experts in these 6 countries and  the EU to identify what they consider to be some of the most important  emerging food safety challenges they expect to face over the next decade.", "To address these questions, we collected and reviewed laws and  directives, and analyzed agencies\u2019 annual reports, performance reports,  strategic plans, official brochures, and guidance documents on policies  and procedures from these 6 countries and the EU.  We also met with food  safety officials, industry experts, and consumer advocacy representatives  in Belgium (for the EU), Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the  Netherlands, and the UK.  Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and  the UK were selected because we had reviewed those countries in our  2005 report.  They were selected then because they had reorganized their  food safety systems within the past 10 years and, like the United States,  had high per capita income, and their consumers had high expectations for  food safety.  We added Japan because it also has a high per capita income  and recently reorganized part of its food safety system.  We added the EU  because of its major role in coordinating member countries\u2019 food safety  activities.  In this report, we refer to the changes to their food safety  systems that the selected countries have made as reorganization.  In  describing the changes to systems of Canada, Germany, Ireland, the  Netherlands, and the UK, however, we use the countries' term, which is  consolidation.", "After we collected the information, we prepared appendixes that  described each country\u2019s and the EU\u2019s food safety system.  We then sent  the draft appendixes to officials in those countries for review and  comment.  We received comments from at least one agency (food safety or  public health) in 6 of the selected countries.  Japan did not provide  comments.  After receiving their feedback and making revisions, where  appropriate, we sent the appendixes to representatives of the various  countries\u2019 national audit offices.  We also sent copies of the report to the  Department of Agriculture, the Department of State, the Food and Drug  Administration, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for their  review; we incorporated their comments as appropriate.", "The information on countries\u2019 food safety systems in this report, including  descriptions of laws, is based largely on interviews with and  documentation provided by food safety officials as well as food industry or  consumer stakeholders from the countries we examined.  Most of the  information obtained was qualitative.  We did not compare any elements  of these countries\u2019 systems to the United States\u2019 system\u2014although in some  cases, country officials told us that aspects of their food safety systems  were similar to aspects of the U.S. system\u2014and we did not independently  evaluate the effectiveness of any of the programs or systems described.   We also did not independently verify the foreign laws and directives  discussed. Instead, we relied on our discussions with foreign officials and  the documents we collected.  We recognize that the selected countries  have much smaller populations and also differ from the United States in  climate and agricultural production as well as in organizational structure.   However, these countries and the United States have at least one  important similarity:  All are high-income countries where consumers have  high expectations for food safety.  We conducted our work from July 2007  to June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the work to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our objectives.  We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our objectives.  Detailed information on each  country\u2019s and the EU\u2019s food safety systems can be found in appendix I.  In  this report, when we refer to selected countries, we mean the 6 countries  named above and the EU.  Of the 6 countries, 4\u2014Germany, Ireland, the  Netherlands, and the UK\u2014are EU member states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, USDA and FDA have primary responsibility for  ensuring the safety of domestic and imported foods.  USDA is responsible  for the safety of meat, poultry, and certain egg products and for  performing certain food quality inspections and certifications that include  food safety elements.  FDA is responsible for the safety of all other foods,  including milk, seafood, and fruits and vegetables.  In addition, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of  pesticide residues that are allowed in food, and the National Marine  Fisheries Service (NMFS) within the Department of Commerce provides  fee-for-service inspections of seafood safety and quality.  The Department  of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating agencies\u2019 food  security activities, including at U.S. borders.  The U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention is responsible for monitoring, identifying, and  investigating foodborne disease problems and for working with FDA,  NMFS, USDA, state and local public health departments, universities, and  industry to develop control methods.", "In January 2007, we added the federal oversight of food safety to our High- Risk Series, which is intended to raise the priority and visibility of  government programs that are in need of broad-based transformation to  achieve greater economy, efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, and  sustainability.  Over the past 30 years, we have detailed problems with the  current fragmented federal food safety system and reported that the  system has caused inconsistent oversight, ineffective coordination, and  inefficient use of resources, all of which suggest that the federal oversight  of food safety should be designated as a high-risk area.  The fragmented  nature of the federal food oversight system raises the question of whether  the government can plan more strategically to inspect food production  processes, identify and react more quickly to outbreaks of foodborne  illnesses, and focus on promoting the safety and integrity of the nation\u2019s  food supply.", "As in the United States, government agencies in other countries also share  responsibility for their nation's food safety.  In February 2005, we reported  on the experiences of several countries in reorganizing their food safety  systems.  Food safety officials in the countries we selected said they faced  similar divisions of responsibilities and that their countries\u2019  reorganizations were intended to address this problem.  The countries  streamlined and consolidated their food safety functions, establishing a  single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food  safety legislation.  Table 1 lists the reasons each country gave for  consolidating its food safety responsibilities.", "Although the countries whose food safety systems we reviewed are much  smaller in population than the United States, they, like the United States,  are high-income countries whose consumers have very high expectations  for food safety.", "Most of the countries we selected for this review are members of the EU  and, as such, are subject to applicable requirements of EU food safety  legislation.  The development and implementation of EU food safety  legislation is the responsibility of the Brussels-based Directorate General  for Health and Consumer Protection (referred to by its French acronym,  DG-SANCO).  In 2002 the EU also created a new independent food safety  institution, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is  responsible for providing independent scientific advice on all matters  related to food and animal feed safety.  In April 2004, the EU adopted  additional, comprehensive food safety legislation that became effective on  January 1, 2006.  Together with the earlier regulation establishing EFSA,  the legislation was intended to create a single, transparent set of EU food  safety rules applicable to both animal and nonanimal products.  Since that  time, individual EU countries have worked to bring their national food  safety laws in line with EU requirements\u2014a process referred to as  harmonization.", "These selected countries also face the challenge of foodborne illness  caused by known hazards as well as new threats.  To address these  challenges, the United States and other countries have undertaken certain  measures to protect human health.  These measures include the use of a  science-based safety system for certain food products, known as Hazard  Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), and the requirement that  exporting nations meet food safety standards similar to the importing  country\u2019s own standards.  A HACCP system is designed to improve the  safety of food by having industry identify and control biological, chemical,  and physical hazards in products before they enter the market.  In the  United States, USDA established HACCP requirements for meat and  poultry establishments in 1996.  FDA implemented similar HACCP  requirements for seafood in 1997 and for juice in 2002.  Under the HACCP  system, processing firms must identify hazards that are reasonably likely  to occur and must develop and implement plans to control those hazards.   HACCP systems, under USDA and FDA regulations, are not required for  other stages of production, such as on the farm.  In general, the federal  food safety regulation begins at the point of processing, rather than on the  farm itself.", "With regard to equivalent food safety standards between countries, the  Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\u2014 entered into force with the establishment of the World Trade Organization  (WTO) on January 1, 1995\u2014affirms that member countries are allowed to  adopt and enforce measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant  life or health, provided, among other things, the measures are based and  maintained on scientific principles and evidence, do not arbitrarily or  unjustifiably discriminate among WTO members, and are not applied in a  manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on international  trade.  In turn, member countries are expected to accept the sanitary or  phytosanitary measures of other member countries as equivalent if the  exporting member objectively demonstrates that its measures achieve the  importing member's appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary  protection.  Members are encouraged to use relevant international  standards and work toward harmonization\u2014that is, the adoption of  common sanitary or phytosanitary measures\u2014to facilitate trade.   Consistent with the principles of the sanitary and phytosanitary  agreement, many countries use equivalency agreements to certify that  their food safety systems are equivalent to those of the country importing  products.  All countries in our review are parties to the WTO and to the  Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.", "In response to these increasing challenges, FDA and other U.S. agencies  recently released plans that discuss the oversight of food safety. In  November 2007, FDA released its Food Protection Plan, which sets forth  FDA\u2019s framework for overseeing the safety of food. Concurrently, a 12- agency working group presented to the President its Action Plan for  Import Safety, which contains, among other things, recommendations for  improving the safety of food imports entering the United States.  Both  plans spell out numerous actions FDA plans or is requesting authority to  take to enhance food safety, including writing new food protection  guidelines for industry and helping foreign countries improve their  regulatory systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Countries Have a Comprehensive, Risk- Based Approach to Import Safety", "paragraphs": ["The selected countries have a comprehensive, risk-based approach to  ensuring the safety of imported food that focuses on the entire food supply  chain, from \u201cfarm to table.\u201d  The selected countries emphasize prevention,  placing primary responsibility for food safety on food producers, with  government bodies providing oversight.  Some of these countries separate  risk analysis and risk management, and some also separate food safety  from the promotion of agricultural trade.  Each country also employs a  risk-based inspection system so that foods with increased risk receive the  most attention.

Farm-to-table oversight in the selected countries applies  to both domestic and imported foods.  We were told that farm-to-table is a  comprehensive and integrated approach that focuses on prevention of  problems throughout the food chain.  In the EU, for example, according to  EU sources, food and feed laws under this approach (referred to in the EU  as \u201cfarm to fork\u201d) cover all stages of production (including farming),  processing, and distribution.  According to these sources, EU laws also  cover imported products from the primary production of a food, through  its storage, transport, sale, or supply to the final consumer and, where  relevant, the importation, production, manufacture, storage, transport,  distribution, sale, and supply of feed.  Individual EU member states,  through their bodies charged with food safety oversight (referred to as  competent authorities), ensure surveillance and control of food and feed  operators, and the European Commission (EC\u2014the administrative,  implementing, and enforcement body of the EU) tests the performance of  member states' control capacities through audits and inspections.  Farms  and food producers in non-EU countries that export to the EU must  observe the same safety standards that apply in the EU in order to export  their products.", "Canada also takes a farm-to-table approach to food safety to safeguard not  just the food supply but also the plants and animals upon which safe food  depends.  Products subject to inspection by the Canadian Food Inspection  Agency range from agricultural inputs, such as seeds, feeds, and fertilizers;  to fresh foods, including meat, fish, eggs, grains, dairy products, fruit and  vegetables; and prepared and packaged foods.  The government also  works with commodity sectors to develop and review food safety plans.   At the consumer end of the spectrum, the food safety agency educates  Canadians about safe food-handling practices and various food safety risks  through its Web site, food safety fact sheets, and the Canadian Partnership  for Consumer Food Safety Education, a group of industry, consumer, and  government organizations that jointly develop and implement a national  program to educate consumers on how to safely handle food.  Moreover,  in December 2007, Canada's Prime Minister announced the new Food and  Consumer Product Safety Action Plan aimed at strengthening and  modernizing Canada\u2019s safety system for health, consumer, and food  products.  The plan responds to changes in trade, industry supply chains,  and consumer buying patterns.  Under the plan, the government will  implement programs focused on prevention, targeting highest risks, and  promoting rapid response.  Among other things, the initiative will involve  working with industries, provinces, and territories to implement  preventive food safety control measures along the food chain.", "Like the EU and Canada, Japan takes a farm-to-table approach (referred to  there as a \u201cfood chain\u201d approach) to food safety.  According to the  Japanese Food Safety Commission, Japanese law stipulates that food  safety be ensured at each stage of the food production process and  apportions responsibility for food safety among the national government,  the local governments, food operators, and consumers.  (Consumers are  responsible for improving their knowledge and understanding of food  safety and expressing their opinions about policies to ensure food safety.   One of the ways they can educate themselves about food safety is by  paying close attention to food labels, and according to USDA\u2019s Foreign  Agricultural Service, the Japanese government has recently introduced  initiatives to strengthen food labeling requirements.)  At the national level,  the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries oversees primary  production processes, including animal health and the use of agricultural  chemicals, and the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare oversees the  processing and distribution stages.

We were told that like  the farm-to-table concept, producer accountability is a proactive approach  that focuses on prevention.", "According to EU sources, for example, food and feed operators have  primary responsibility for food safety, while member states provide  oversight over these operators at all stages of production.  Business  operators are responsible for the food and animal feed (such as cattle  fodder or pet food) that they produce, transport, store, or sell.  They must  (1) be able to rapidly identify any supplier or consignee, (2) immediately  inform the competent authorities if they have a reason to believe their  food or feed is not safe, (3) immediately withdraw a product from the  market if they have reason to believe the product is not safe, (4) apply  HACCP principles in their processes and ensure that controls are applied  at critical points, and (5) cooperate with the competent authorities in  actions taken to reduce risk.  The competent authority in each member  state is responsible for monitoring producers to ensure that they are  meeting these obligations.  The EU Food and Veterinary Office then  assesses the performance of the member states\u2019 competent authorities,  countries aspiring to join the EU, and non-EU countries intending to  export to the EU to verify the effectiveness of national control systems for  enforcing EU requirements in the areas of food safety, animal health and  welfare, and plant health.", "In Japan, business operators who produce, import, sell, or conduct other  business for fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, feed, feed additives,  veterinary medicines, and other agricultural products bear primary  responsibility for ensuring food safety when conducting their business  activities.  These operators are also responsible for providing accurate and  appropriate information on their products and for cooperating with  policies implemented by the national and local governments.  The national  government is responsible for formulating and implementing policies to  ensure food safety.  With regard to imports, the burden of compliance with  Japanese food safety regulation lies with importers, but the Japanese  government (specifically, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare)  further ensures compliance through a high level of import monitoring.  In  2006, for example, Japan reported that its inspectors examined 11 percent  of declared products coming into its ports.", "Some producers in selected countries have commented that placing  responsibility on them is generally positive.  One industry representative,  for example, told us that, \u201cfarmers and producers can no longer hide  behind meat inspectors.\u201d  An industry representative from another country  said that, because producers are concerned with protecting their name  brands, greater accountability makes them proactive.

In addition, certain plant  products, such as nuts, wheat, corn, beans, rice, and certain spices can  present high levels of risks because they may be contaminated by  aflatoxins\u2014toxins produced by mold that can damage the liver and may  lead to liver cancer.

A physical inspection may also  involve taking samples for laboratory tests.", "When all tests and checks are satisfactory, the consignment is issued a  Common Veterinary Entry Document and is placed on the EU market.", "If a consignment does not comply with EU requirements, it may be  rejected.  In these cases, EU officials negotiate with the owner of the  consignment and the country of dispatch, where appropriate, about  whether to destroy the product, to retreat it for uses other than the human  food chain, or to return it.  Food or feed business operators or their  representatives are responsible for the consignment and are liable for any  costs incurred by the competent authorities to destroy or redispatch it.", "When consignments are not in compliance, all other border inspection  posts are notified through the EU\u2019s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed  (rapid alert system), an electronic notification system managed by DG- SANCO in Brussels.  The system alerts all EU member countries of a  potential food problem, including either a direct or an indirect risk to  human health from food or feed.  The rapid alert network involves all  member states, the European Community, and the European Food Safety  Authority, as well as the non-EU countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, and  Norway.  Each participating country has a rapid alert system contact point  to collect information on national notifications and enter them into the  database.  The exchange of information allows participating states to  immediately ascertain whether they are also affected by a problem and  take appropriate measures.  Since all EU border posts are connected  electronically, problems at any one border can quickly be announced to all  other border posts via the rapid alert system.  Future imports from the  same exporting country are then scrutinized more closely.", "The EU also maintains a list of food products of nonanimal origin that may  represent a human health risk.  Cereals and nuts, for example, may appear  on the high risk list.  Such products undergo control measures, such as  health certificates and testing, similar to those required for food products  of animal origin.  For example, all consignments of pistachios from Iran  are sampled and checked.  The safeguard measures are lifted once the  problem has been addressed.", "Food products of nonanimal origin\u2014including fruits, vegetables, cereals,  tubers, nondairy drinks, food of mineral origin (such as salt), spices, and  condiments\u2014represent less of a risk and as such, do not need to come  from approved countries or establishments.  These products can come  into any EU port of entry.  However, they are still subject to certain EU  requirements in order to verify that that they comply with EU food  standards.  Among other things, food business operators in non-EU  countries must monitor the safety of products and processes under their  responsibility, follow general hygiene provisions for primary production,  develop HACCP principles, and register establishments with the  appropriate competent authorities.  The EU member states\u2019 competent  authorities are responsible for carrying out regular controls of goods  imported into EU territory.", "The EU requires that member states ensure that adequate financial  resources are available for organizing official controls on imports.   Member states may therefore collect fees to cover costs occasioned by  these controls.  However, they must collect fees for certain activities,  including controls for products of animal origin, such as meat inspection,  and controls of dairy establishments.  Fees are also levied for certain  import controls on these commodities.  EU officials stated that the fees  may not be higher than the costs borne by the competent authorities.", "Japan takes a similarly risk-based approach to inspections.  Each year, the  Ministry of Heath, Labor, and Welfare produces an imported foods  monitoring and guidance plan that, among other things, spells out the  quantity and category of inspections to be conducted each year.  In fiscal  year 2007, for example, the goal was approximately 79,000 random  inspections for 124 food groups.  If an imported food belongs to a food  group that is known to be at an increased risk for contamination from a  pathogen, pesticide residue, or animal drug, the ministry issues an order  requiring that products with a high violation probability are inspected  every time they are imported (lot by lot).  According to the imported foods  monitoring and guidance plan, moreover, if the number of imported foods  from a specific country, area, or business entity violating the law is above  5 percent of the overall number of foods inspected, and if it is likely that  the importation of violating goods will continue, given conditions in the  exporting country, the ministry may ban the importation of such goods  altogether.", "While there is no cost to importers for random inspections at Japanese  quarantine stations, if products are required to undergo more intensive  inspections as a result of past problems, the importer pays for additional  inspections.  Japan also imposes financial penalties for importers found to  be in noncompliance.  According to an expert on the Japanese import  system, many Japanese importers therefore require testing certificates  from exporters to reduce the potential for violation.

The competent authority of the exporting country  must issue an official meat inspection certificate for every shipment of  meat products exported to Canada.  The competent authority is also  expected to take appropriate actions if the Canadian Food Inspection  Agency notifies it about meat products found to violate Canadian  requirements and is to communicate any actions to the agency.  The  Canadian Food Inspection Agency may require additional examination of  subsequent shipments to Canada, with additional certification, for a  predetermined number of shipments and/or weight of the certified  shipment.

Under some agreements, the Canadian Food  Inspection Agency agrees that products from specified processing  facilities meet certain standards and therefore are subject to fewer  inspections at the border.  The agency normally assesses these plants  before it adds them to a list.  Other agreements represent recognition by  the agency that the inspection system in another country is equivalent to  the system in Canada.  Under these agreements, the competent authority  in the other country will inspect and maintain the list of establishments  eligible for reduced inspection frequency upon export to Canada.", "Canada has an equivalency agreement in place with the EU for meat  products and is working toward bringing an equivalency agreement for  fishery products into force.

These levels allow work toward  equivalency in products to be tracked over time.  The agreement is aimed  at recognizing the equivalence of Canadian and EU inspection and  certification requirements for trade between the EU and Canada in live  animals and animal products.", "Japan also requires importers to meet its food safety standards.  For  example, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and  Welfare or the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries engage in  bilateral talks with their counterparts in the exporting country to explain  Japanese food safety regulations.  If a country has no prior record of  exporting food to Japan, ministry officials may conduct field surveys to  determine whether a country\u2019s food safety system can comply with  Japanese food sanitary regulations and whether the exporting country\u2019s  food safety regulations are comparable with Japan\u2019s.  If Japan has already  approved an exporting country and a new facility in that country seeks to  export, ministry officials may conduct a pre-export inspection of that  facility; if the review is satisfactory, the ministry will issue a certificate to  the exporter, copies of which must accompany every shipment of goods to  Japan.", "Japan also has arrangements with some governments to certify exports of  certain high-risk products.  According to Japanese officials, under a  Japanese-Chinese agreement, for example, the Chinese government  certifies Chinese spinach processors, who in turn oversee the practices of  local farmers and test the product at three stages of production.

In 2007,  the public\u2019s confidence in the agency\u2019s ability to protect against foodborne  illnesses was an estimated 60 percent, compared with about 44 percent in  2001.", "Similarly, in 2005, the EU surveyed consumers to understand how they  view risk, particularly food safety risks, in order to inform policy and  communicate with the public on risk issues.  It found that the public in all  25 EU member states was divided on whether food safety had improved in  the past 10 years, with an estimated 38 percent believing it had, 29 percent  believing it had stayed about the same, and 28 percent believing it had  gotten worse.  In some countries, however, views were more favorable.   For example, the EU reported that an estimated 67 percent of people in  Ireland believed that, overall, food safety had improved over the past 10  years.", "Surveys can also be used to understand where the food safety system  needs to be improved.  For example, according to an official with Japan\u2019s  Food Safety Commission, part of the commission\u2019s risk communication  strategy is to survey consumers in order to find out how effectively the  government communicates risk\u2014how clearly, accurately, and  convincingly.  From these surveys, the commission learned that the public  generally does not understand the concept of assessing risk.   Consequently, one of the commission\u2019s current goals is to better  communicate its role to the public and in general improve the clarity of its  risk communications.", "Germany has taken another approach to gauging public opinion.   According to officials with the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and  Food Safety, this agency convened stakeholders in November 2007 to  discuss the effectiveness the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and  Food Safety and the German food safety system in general.  About 80  people from federal and state governments and trade associations  attended.  Comments on the agency\u2019s performance were generally  positive.  In particular, participants approved of the efforts of the national  contact point for the EU\u2019s rapid alert system.  However, they suggested  some improvements in the system, and also suggested that the agency  provide training to help prepare for Food and Veterinary Office audits.   Participants also liked the Journal of Consumer Protection and Food  Safety  that the agency launched in 2006 to provide information, in both  German and English, on basic and applied research and on official  oversight of current developments in the areas of food and feed, veterinary  medicine, and genetic technology.

We spoke with representatives of  stakeholder groups in each of the countries we visited and were told that,  in most of the selected countries, the reorganization of the food safety  system has been beneficial.  In particular, stakeholders said reorganization  has improved transparency.  For example, one industry stakeholder in  Canada said that consolidation greatly sped up the government\u2019s decision- making process and provided increased transparency, clarity, and  accountability.  In Japan, representatives of two consumer groups told us  that the creation of the Food Safety Commission as an independent body  responsible for risk assessments was a positive step, especially for  increasing government transparency.  A representative of an industry  group in the UK also said that consolidation improved the functioning of  the Food Standards Agency.  This person believes the agency is now more  transparent to industry, and it is easier to consult with agency staff on  issues of concern.", "Industry stakeholders told us that another benefit of reorganization was  having a single point of contact.  In the UK, for example, according to a  representative of an industry group, the group provides its views to the  Food Standards Agency through one-on-one or committee meetings, and  has seen changes as a result of these contacts.  Because of industry  concerns about the way the Food Standards Agency managed a product  recall, the agency agreed to notify industry before publishing a mandatory  recall and changed preparation instructions for this product.  Similarly,  Canadian industry representatives told us that the reorganized and  consolidated food safety system has had benefits.  For example,  representatives from two industry groups generally agreed that, with the  consolidation, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency now has staff  dedicated to food safety issues, a fact that has allowed a working  relationship between industry and government to evolve.

Feed suppliers, for example, must apply HACCP  principles, register with their national competent authorities to help  ensure traceability, and comply with specific microbiological criteria, such  as for levels of Salmonella, molds, and yeast.  The competent authorities  in each country approve certain feed operators (i.e., those manufacturing  and/or selling certain feed additives) by visiting the facility before they  start up any activity to ensure that the operators meet EU standards, and  once the operator is approved, the competent authority provides oversight  and imposes penalties for noncompliance.  In turn, FVO inspects the  competent authorities\u2019 oversight and provides recommendations when  there are shortcomings.  It also inspects countries aspiring to join the EU,  and non-EU countries intending to export to the EU, to verify the  effectiveness of national control systems to implement EU standards in  the areas of food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health.  As  for imported feed, importers must ensure that the feed meets EU  standards.", "According to EU sources, the primary law laying out the regulatory  framework for food safety in the EU is the General Food Law of 2002.   Subsequent legislation merged, harmonized, and simplified detailed and  complex hygiene requirements previously contained in 17 directives  covering the hygiene of foodstuffs and the production and marketing of  products of animal origin.  According to these sources, the EU\u2019s food  legislation framework includes the major regulations and directives  described in table 4.", "DG-SANCO provides training to member states to harmonize their food  safety regimes and to ensure uniform application.  The implementation of  EU legislation in member states is reviewed by other EU members and by  FVO.  EU legislation is mostly in the form of regulations or decisions that  are directly applicable in the member states.  In other cases, the EU  legislation takes the form of directives, which the member states must  translate into national law.  Directives establish the target objective(s) and  allow member states to decide on the most appropriate measures and  adapt them to their situations in order to reach the defined objective(s).", "EU member states may also institute their own country-specific food  safety regulations, as appropriate for their particular situations, provided  that the level of protection defined at the EU level is not jeopardized and  that the additional measures proposed do not impede the free circulation  of goods among the member states.", "The EU also emphasizes the importance of being able to trace food \u201cone  step forward and one step back\u201d to quickly track any questionable food  products.  Each food and feed business operator must be able to identify  its suppliers and which businesses it supplied.  Specifically, the operator  must be able to document the names and addresses of the suppliers and  customers, as well as the nature of the product and date of delivery.  The  operators are also encouraged to keep information on the volume and  quantity of a product; the batch number, if there is one; and a more  detailed description of the product, such as whether it is raw or processed.   Food and feed business operators must also have systems and procedures  that allow them to provide this information to the competent authorities  on demand.  (Exporters in trading partner countries are not required to  fulfill the EU\u2019s traceability requirement, except in circumstances where  there are special bilateral agreements for certain sensitive sectors or  where there are specific EU requirements, such as in the veterinary sector.   However, these traceability requirements pertain to EU importers, who  should be able to identify their direct supplier in the non-EU country.)", "According to EU sources, the EU\u2019s traceability system proved useful  during an incident that took place in 2004. During standard random  monitoring of dioxin levels in milk at a Dutch farm, the national competent  authorities found a high level of dioxin.  EU sources noted that the  competent authorities immediately barred the farm from trade and began  tracing the product through the food chain.  They found that the source of  contamination was clay, used in food processing to separate higher-quality  potatoes from lower-quality ones.  The dioxin-tainted clay had  contaminated potato peels used for feeding dairy animals.  The EU\u2019s  electronic Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed was used to trigger an  exchange of information among national authorities about the problem.   According to EU sources, the authorities quickly established that the clay  had also been supplied to several food-processing companies located in  Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.  The authorities rapidly  identified these businesses and barred from trade over 200 farms that had  received the potentially contaminated potato peels.  EU sources noted that  because of the traceability system, the contaminated products never  reached consumers.", "EU producers must also tag livestock with details of their origin, and when  the animals are taken for slaughter, stamp them with the traceability code  of the slaughterhouse.  The tools used (ear tags, \u201cpassports,\u201d or bar codes)  may vary from country to country but must carry the same information.  In  addition, to ensure the traceability of animals across the EU, the EU  established the Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES), a central  database for tracking the movement of animals both within the EU and  from third countries.

The EU\u2019s guiding principle is that all food products in  the EU should be safe, regardless of origin.  However, imported products  require specific controls, owing to different animal, public, and plant  health situations in countries of origin.  Animal products such as meat,  milk, fish, and honey, as well as live animals, present the highest level of  risks because they can transmit serious human and animal diseases.   Certain plant products, such as cereals and nuts, also present higher levels  of risks because they may be contaminated by aflatoxins.  \u201cShelf-stable\u201d  products, such as canned, processed, and dried foods present lesser risks;  control requirements are thus tailored accordingly.", "Equivalency agreement/certification programs.  One of the key features  of EU regulations is that products of animal origin imported from non-EU  countries (referred to as third countries) must meet safety standards at  least equivalent to those of the EU.  If such food is found not to be as safe  as that of the EU, the overseas firm is not allowed to export to the EU.   For example, the EU maintains a list of third countries in which the  capacity of the competent authority has been recognized, along with the  country\u2019s animal and public health system and status, but the EU does not  maintain such a list for food of nonanimal origin.  On the basis of this  recognition, third countries' competent authorities propose establishments  to be approved for export of products of animal origin to the EU.  Among  the requirements for approving the export of products of animal origin are  the following:   formal submission of a written application to export to the EU;    verification of the exporting country\u2019s animal and public health system,  such as legislation, control systems, disease surveillance measures, and  laboratory facilities;      submission and approval of a monitoring plan for residues of banned or  restricted substances in the EU, including veterinary medicines and  growth-promoting hormones; and     provision of sanitary certification that the products to be exported to the  EU meet import requirements.", "FVO normally visits countries to verify compliance with these conditions.   If compliance is satisfactory, the EC may formally decide to approve  countries and establishments for export to the EU.  In addition, third  countries must certify and approve business establishments wishing to  export products of animal origin to the EU, noting that they meet the  relevant EU standards.  Lists of these establishments are maintained  online by the European Community for all the main categories of animal  products (e.g., beef, poultry, fish, or dairy), and compliance is verified  during follow-up FVO missions.  To help reduce problematic imports, DG- SANCO provides technical assistance to developing countries.  In  particular, DG-SANCO trains people overseas on hygiene and HACCP.", "Inspections.  The EU bases its inspections of imports on the degree of risk  presented by particular food types.  According to the EU, it has shifted its  focus from regular, but random, sampling to paying attention to the  sources of greatest risk.  Risk may be high because a particular product is  traded in large quantities, or because a product or the area it comes from  is known to be susceptible to a particular plant or animal disease. If the  risk of a given food product is not known or quantified, the EU applies  what it refers to as the \u201cprecautionary principle:\u201d  If there are reasonable  grounds for suspecting a problem, the commission acts to limit the risk.   The EU asserts it does not necessarily need to wait for proof that there  really is a risk.", "Because of countries\u2019 differing risk profiles, the EU has different  inspection methods for food products of (1) animal origin, (2) nonanimal  origin, and (3) high-risk foods of nonanimal origin.", "First, all imports of live animals and animal products must enter the EU  through its roughly 300 approved border inspection posts, which include  airports, rail stations, and deepwater ports.  The posts are under the  authority of each member state\u2019s official veterinary services.  A member  state\u2019s customs service cannot release consignments unless they have  passed through veterinary controls.  The system thus requires the  cooperation of veterinary authorities and customs officials.  The border  inspection posts must be notified in advance of the presentation of such  consignments, which must undergo an official veterinary check at the  inspection post.  When a consignment arrives at a post, three types of  checks are carried out:     Documentary:  A documentary check is carried out on all consignments.", "Identity:  An identity check is carried out on all consignments to verify  that the identity of the goods corresponds fully with the veterinary  documents supplied.", "Physical:  A physical check is carried out on a percentage of consignments  on the basis of the type of animal or animal product and the country of  origin to ensure it does not pose a threat to public and animal health.   According to EU officials, EU legislation also specifies a minimum number  of physical checks to be carried out for each product group (e.g., meat,  fish, or dairy) by each member state.  A physical inspection may also  involve taking samples for laboratory tests.", "When all tests and checks are satisfactory, the consignment is issued a  Common Veterinary Entry Document and is placed on the EU market.  In cases where testing is carried out because of unfavorable results of  previous tests on the animal product or when a problem is suspected, the  consignment will not be cleared or allowed to leave the border inspection  post until the border authorities receive the results of the new tests.", "If a consignment does not comply with EU requirements, it may be  rejected.  In these cases, EU officials negotiate with the owner of the  consignment and the country of dispatch, where appropriate, about  whether to destroy the product, to retreat it for uses other than the human  food chain, or to redispatch it.  Food or feed business operators or their  representatives are responsible for the consignment and are liable for any  costs incurred by the competent authorities to destroy or redispatch it.  In  addition, if consignments are not in compliance, all other border  inspection posts are notified through the Rapid Alert System for Food and  Feed.  This electronic notification system, managed by DG-SANCO, alerts  all EU member countries to a potential food problem, including either a  direct or an indirect risk to human health from food or feed.  The rapid  alert system involves all member states, the EC, and EFSA, as well as  Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (non-EU countries).  Each  participating country has a rapid alert contact point to collect information  on national notifications and enter them into the database.  The exchange  of information allows participating states to immediately ascertain  whether they are also affected by a problem and take appropriate  measures.  Since all EU border posts are connected electronically,  problems at any one border can quickly be announced via the rapid alert  system to all other border posts.  Future imports from the same exporting  country are then scrutinized more closely.", "Second, food products of nonanimal origin\u2014including fruits, vegetables,  cereals, tubers, nondairy drinks, food of mineral origin (such as salt),  spices, and condiments\u2014do not need to come from approved countries or  establishments and can come into any EU port of entry.  However, they  are still subject to certain EU control requirements in order to verify that  they comply with EU food safety standards.  Among other things, food  business operators in third countries must monitor the safety of products  and processes under their responsibility, follow general hygiene provisions  for primary production, develop HACCP principles, and register  establishments with the appropriate competent authorities. In the EU, the  competent authorities of the member states are responsible for carrying  out regular controls of the goods imported into EU territory.  Controls are  determined based on potential risks.", "Finally, the EU maintains a list of food products of nonanimal origin that  may represent a health risk to humans.  As noted above, cereals and nuts,  for example, may appear on the high-risk list.  Such products undergo  control measures, such as health certificates and testing, similar to those  required for food products of animal origin.  For example, all  consignments of pistachios from Iran are sampled and checked.  The  safeguard measures are lifted once the problem has been addressed.", "Problems with imports are normally brought to light by inspections  carried out by the FVO, checks at border inspection posts, checks carried  out during the course of \"market surveillance\" by member states, business  or consumer groups, or media reports.  The following actions are available  to address these problems:    circulate information through the rapid alert system to all member states,  especially their border inspection posts, to enable a higher level of  surveillance;  request that the exporting country take corrective action, such as deleting  the exporting establishment from the authorized list for export to the EU;  introduce additional requirements, such as a higher level of testing at  border inspection posts, retention of consignments awaiting laboratory  confirmation of noncontamination, and additional certification  requirements through \u201csafeguard decisions\u201d; and     ban exports to the EU outright.", "These measures are normally introduced in full consultation with the  member states.  In recent years, safeguard decisions have been taken in  relation to products from a wide range of third countries, including China  (all animal products banned in 2002) and Brazil (100 percent testing of  poultry and meat products for veterinary residues).  In urgent cases, the  EU can also take safeguard measures on its own initiative, pending  confirmation by the member states.", "With respect to actions that can be taken domestically in response to an  import problem, the EU distinguishes between withdrawals and recalls  under the rapid alert system and has authority for both.  Withdrawals  occur when the product is still under the control of the producer and  consist of measures aimed at preventing the distribution or display of a  product that is dangerous to the consumer.  Recalls occur when the  product is already available to consumers and consist of measures aimed  at achieving the return of an unsafe product.  All member states must  notify the EU when there is a serious risk to human health.", "The EU requires that member states ensure that adequate financial  resources are available for organizing official controls on imports.  For  that purpose, member states may collect fees or charges to cover the costs  of these controls.  However, they must collect fees for certain activities,  including controls of products of animal origin, such as meat inspection,  and controls of dairy establishments.

The Robert Koch Institute is the competent German body  providing scientific advice to European Centre for Disease Control.  A  scientific officer from the Robert Koch Institute is member of the Center\u2019s  Advisory Forum, where information on health threats is exchanged.", "Recent incidents.  According to a report by the Robert Koch Institute, on  August 15, 2007, the institute detected an outbreak of Salmonella Panama  in several German states during its routine computerized analysis of state- reported monitoring data.  In all, 10 states reported Salmonella Panama  cases.  On the same day that they identified the outbreak, Robert Koch  Institute officials asked the states to investigate the issue at the local level,  including having the local health officials ask the victims\u2019 parents to  participate in a telephone interview so the institute could learn more about  the child\u2019s illness and the food the family had eaten.  Laboratories were  asked to send Salmonella Panama samples to the national Salmonella  reference laboratory in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.", "A month earlier, the Robert Koch Institute had learned that during the  course of semi-annual monitoring, a worker at a meat-processing plant had  been diagnosed with asymptomatic Salmonella Panama.  The plant  produced, among other things, minisalami sticks, a snack popular with  children.  The institute then included consumption of minisalami sticks in  questions about what had been eaten by the children who became ill.  In  several instances, parents separately told interviewers that their children  had eaten minisalami sticks.  To confirm the connection between the  minisalami and the Salmonella Panama infection, institute staff conducted  a case-control study, using 22 victims of the July outbreak as the \u201ccases\u201d  and people from 20 affected communities as the controls.  To identify the  control cases, the institute asked certain local offices in the affected  regions to select from their databases up to 30 families with children in  three different age groups.  Local officials used a statistical procedure  called frequency matching to select 62 control cases.  As part of a  telephone survey, officials asked the parents of both the \u201ccase\u201d (i.e.,  victim) and control subjects about their shopping and eating activities in  the week prior to the outbreak.  The institute then included consumption  of minisalami sticks in questions about what the sick children had eaten.   The experts found that in the 7 days before the outbreak, there was a high  statistical correlation in the cases between consumption of minisalami and  Salmonella Panama infection.", "While the Robert Koch Institute was conducting the surveys, the reference  laboratory identified the specific strain of Salmonella involved in the  outbreak and confirmed that all 11 samples from the cases belonged to the  same strain, as did the sample from the asymptomatic worker at the  salami plant and a coworker\u2019s 10-month-old grandchild, who had become  ill.  BVL also queried the EU\u2019s rapid alert system to see if there had been  any case of Salmonella Panama between January 1, 2006 and August 2007,  and found none.  The local competent authorities also examined  minisalami samples from the processing plant thought responsible for the  outbreak for Salmonella but found none and did not find any in minisalami  products taken from shops in two states where the firm\u2019s products were  sold.", "In early September, staff from the local food safety authority and the  Federal Institute for Risk Assessment again inspected the salami  manufacturer.  The competent authorities also conducted a thorough  review of the firm\u2019s records.  No shortcomings were found in hygiene  procedures.  Officials nonetheless concluded that the minisalami sticks  were the most likely cause of the outbreak, even though the pathogen was  not found in tests of the product.", "In summarizing the incident, the Robert Koch Institute pointed out that  this outbreak was discovered only through the nationwide aggregation of  institute-collected data and computerized analysis, because the number of  victims in any one state was too low to signal an outbreak.  Furthermore,  the case-control telephone survey enabled officials to conduct an almost  real-time epidemiological analysis.  In addition, according to the institute,  close cooperation among the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, BVL,  the Robert Koch Institute, the national reference laboratory, and local  authorities contributed to rapid investigation and management of the  outbreak."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Measure the Effectiveness of Food Safety Systems", "paragraphs": ["Although Germany had not conducted a formal review of its reorganized  food safety system at the time of our review, BVL met with relevant  stakeholders in November 2007 to discuss how the German food safety  system and BVL are working.

It found that import controls were generally  applied correctly in the border inspection posts visited, with only minor  shortcomings.  However, it also found that supervision of imports that do  not comply with EU regulations was inadequate, traceability was not  reliable, and the exit of these noncompliant products from the EU was not  ensured.

The views of stakeholders who interact  frequently with BVL can also provide insight, albeit anecdotal, on the  effectiveness of a country\u2019s food safety system.    In Germany, a  representative of an industry group told us that overall the consolidated  food safety system represented an improvement over the previous system.   This person also said that the EU\u2019s rapid warning system was working  well, although there was room for improvement in some areas.   Furthermore, one of the positive outcomes of the consolidation, in this  person\u2019s view, was the establishment of a working group of  representatives from the 16 states who meet to discuss problems of food  law interpretation.  According to this person, one of the challenges of the  German food safety system was the different interpretations of law at the  state and local levels.  For example, public warnings and information can  vary among the state governments during food crises, and some states  took different views on whether a product should be recalled.

Japan maintains this information  in a national database.  Additionally, Japan has specific concerns related  to certain contaminants, such as aflatoxin and agro-chemicals.  If an  imported food belongs to a food group that is known to be at a higher risk  for contamination (e.g., from a pathogen, pesticide residue, or animal  drug), MHLW issues a Ministerial Inspection Order, which, according to  Japanese sources, requires that products with a high violation probability  be inspected at every time of importation (lot by lot).  Japan prohibits the  importation and distribution of products that fail to pass inspection;  importers bear the cost of that inspection, and future inspections from that  country are strengthened.  In 2006, for example, Japan required  compulsory testing of 100 percent of Vietnamese shrimp imports after  inspectors repeatedly found chloramphenicol, a banned antibiotic, in  shipments of Vietnamese shrimp.  Moreover, according to the Imported  Foods Monitoring and Guidance Plan for fiscal year 2007, if the number of  imported foods from a specific country, area, or business entity violating  the law is above 5 percent of the overall number of those inspected, and if  it is likely that the importation of violating goods will continue, given  conditions in the exporting country, MHLW may ban the importation of  such goods altogether.", "Testing under the Ministerial Inspection Order includes laboratory testing  for pathogens, which the importing company pays for.

Before sending  the first shipment to Japan, these exporters send samples of their products  to private Japanese companies approved by MHLW for testing and  analysis.  On the basis of the outcome of these preliminary tests, the  exporter is either rejected or approved to proceed with the first shipment.   If an exporter is approved and subsequently exports to Japan, the first  shipment will be subject to routine random monitoring; if the exporter did  not go through with voluntary inspection, the first shipment would be  subject to a Ministerial Inspection Order.", "Japan has also created a \u201cPositive List\u201d of substances that must be  controlled in all imported foods stuffs.  If an importer violates the  positive list, MHLW will subsequently test 30 percent of all products  coming to Japan from the violating country for 1 year.

Chinese government authorities then conduct  preshipment tests on the spinach before exporting, confirming that the  exporter has observed the proper procedures on pesticide management.   The spinach may be randomly inspected again once it arrives in Japanese  ports.  Chinese exporters of 19 other products, including tea leaves and  frozen vegetables, are likewise required to register with the Chinese  government, and blowfish and meat from China also require certification  of processing.

In 2006, there was a major outbreak of Salmonella in  chocolate products produced by Cadbury Schweppes, a large British  candy manufacturer.  Although no one died from the outbreak, over 130  people\u2014mainly children\u2014became ill.  According to HPA officials, the  incident came to light when, during routine surveillance, HPA discovered  an increase in exceedances of the baseline level of Salmonella and  determined that it was witnessing a major outbreak of Salmonella  Montevideo, a rare strain of the Salmonella bacterium.  A private food  laboratory sent the HPA some Salmonella samples for identification.   According to HPA sources, HPA scientists used a range of analytical  techniques to trace the bacteria to Cadbury\u2019s chocolate products.  They  then notified FSA, and an outbreak control team was assembled,  consisting of representatives from HPA, FSA, other government  departments, and local authorities.  To determine whether the outbreak  had extended beyond the UK, HPA electronically transmitted a molecular  profile of the outbreak strain to over 50 countries 2 days after recognition  of the outbreak.  (This electronic transmission was done through the EU- funded Enter-net network for the surveillance of Salmonella,  Verocytotoxin-producing E. coli, and Campylobacter.)  For its part, FSA  used the EU\u2019s rapid alert system to communicate the distribution  information of affected products outside the UK.  HPA scientists also  communicated with their Veterinary Laboratories Agency counterparts,  who found the same Salmonella strains in poultry.  Local authorities  determined that a leaking pipe had dripped Salmonella-contaminated  water into the candy manufacturer\u2019s products.  No direct connection to  poultry was found, but the laboratory findings strongly suggested that the  animal source of the contaminating strain was poultry.  Following  identification of the outbreak in children, the time between the initiation  of laboratory studies and withdrawal of the product was 8 or 9 days.  In all,  the bacteria had contaminated 30 different Cadbury products; over 1  million chocolate bars were removed from the market at a cost of over \u00a330  million (about $60 million).", "According to HPA officials, the established interactions between the HPA  and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, including standardized methods  of strain typing and rapid communication of epidemiological findings  (such as those described above) facilitated investigations to determine the  animal source of the contaminating strain.  HPA officials told us that such  communications have been useful in several other outbreaks, including,  for example, the investigation and containment of a 2004 outbreak of  multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Paratyphi B variant Java among  cattle on an English farm.  Rapid communication of typing results and  epidemiological information between the HPA and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency resulted in containment of the outbreak before it  could spread to humans.  According to HPA, there are numerous examples  of similar collaborative activities between the HPA and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency involving both Salmonella and Verocytotoxin- producing E. coli, with typing and epidemiological data being exchanged  on an almost daily basis.  The reporting of outbreaks to the HPA is done  on a voluntary basis.  There is no lower size limit on the number of cases  affected for a report to be generated; HPA would follow up on single cases  of severe diseases, such as botulism or listeriosis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Measure the Effectiveness of the Food Safety System", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, the UK had not conducted a review of its  reorganized food safety system.  However, FSA, the UK\u2019s National Audit  Office (the UK equivalent of GAO), and the EU\u2019s Food and Veterinary  Office have reviewed individual aspects of the system.", "Performance measures.  Performance measures for FSA include the  number of illness reported and consumer surveys on food safety issues.   For example, FSA reported in 2006 that incidents of foodborne illness  declined by 19.2 percent between 2001 and 2006.  According to FSA  statistics, this reduction equates to 1.5 million fewer people suffering from  foodborne illness, 10,000 fewer in the hospital as a result of this illness,  and an estimated total cost savings of more than \u00a3750 million (nearly U.S.  $1.5 billion).  FSA staff attributed this decline to, among other things, (1)  an ongoing decline in Salmonella incidences as a result of efforts in the  farming industry to reduce contamination of eggs, including improved  biosecurity measures and vaccination of laying hens, and (2) measures  undertaken to keep slaughterhouses clean and reduce cross- contamination.  For example, HACCP measures were introduced in  slaughterhouses, and new, clean henhouses were being used on many  farms; and (3) FSA made efforts to educate the public on preventing  Campylobacter contamination.", "Evaluations and audits.  The UK\u2019s National Audit Office, GAO\u2019s  counterpart in the UK, conducted an audit of FSA in 2003 and found that  the agency had made progress in its stated objective of improving public  confidence in food safety and standards.  For example, according to the  office, in 2001 and 2002 the FSA investigated about 500 incidents with the  potential to affect food safety.  FSA issued 47 Food Hazard Warnings to  local authorities, alerting them to potential health dangers or requiring  them to recall food from sale.  The audit office also made some  recommendations for further progress.", "More recently, the National Audit Office assessed the extent to which FSA  implemented a set of principles, referred to as the Hampton principles,  that include the following:    Regulators, and the regulatory system as a whole, should use  comprehensive risk assessment to concentrate resources on the areas that  need them most.", "No inspection should take place without a reason.", "Regulators should provide authoritative, accessible advice easily and  cheaply.", "All regulations should be written so that they are easily understood, easily  implemented, and easily enforced, and all interested parties should be  consulted when they are being drafted.", "The National Audit Office review team concluded that, in many respects,  FSA regulated in accordance with the Hampton principles.  The office  rated FSA highly on adopting innovative alternatives to classic regulation  and on having an evidence-based culture.  Many positive initiatives were  being undertaken by FSA in its risk assessment system.  Areas to develop  further included developing more of a strategic partnership with local  authorities and providing better advice and guidance to small businesses.   Overall, the National Audit Office found that FSA was continuing to  improve its performance from an already strong base.", "After the 2005 Sudan Red 1 incident in which illegal dye was found in food,  FSA conducted an internal review of the lessons learned.  In January 2007  the FSA Board established an independent panel to review the lessons  learned following the incident, what changes had been introduced as a  result, and how well different parts of the food chain, including  manufacturers, retailers, enforcement authorities, and FSA, are able to  identify emerging issues and prevent them from developing into food  incidents in future.  The board made recommendations to both FSA and  industry.  Among other things, it recommended that FSA take a central  role in ensuring more coordinated attention to intelligence gathering and  implementing early warning systems, as well as proactively sharing this  information with the food industry.", "In addition to reviews conducted by UK agencies, the EU\u2019s Food and  Veterinary Office conducted 71 audits in the UK between 2001 and 2007  and provided recommendations for corrective measures in certain areas.", "For example, a 2006 report on import controls and border inspections  found a largely functioning import control system in place, but also found  that there were some weaknesses, such as in implementing a training  program for contract/part-time officials.  In addition, it found some general  shortcomings related to implementation of the border control system,  such as not all live animals arriving at the border inspection posts were  checked as required, and veterinary checks on some species were being  carried out by technical staff instead of by official veterinarians.  Other  Food and Veterinary Office audits have included reviews of import  controls on food of animal origin, animal welfare on farms, and foot-and- mouth disease.", "Public opinion surveys.  FSA annual consumer surveys between 2001 and  2007 show a marked decline in the public\u2019s concerns about foodborne  illness, from 71 percent to 57 percent.  FSA surveys also indicated that  public trust in FSA was an estimated 60 percent in 2007, compared with 44  percent in 2001.  The survey likewise found that FSA was seen as a reliable  source of information for both food safety and healthy eating by the  majority of those who use it, although it was used and considered reliable  more for food safety than for healthy eating.", "According to a 2005 Eurobarometer survey published in 2006, an estimated  47 percent of people in the UK stated that overall, food safety had  improved over the past decade, 30 percent that it had stayed about the  same, 17 percent that it had worsened, and 6 percent did not know.  In  addition, an estimated 50 percent stated that usually public authorities\u2019  actions in the EU with regard to food safety risks were appropriate, 24  percent stated that the actions were insufficient, 12 percent stated that the  actions went beyond what is needed, and 13 percent did not know.   Finally, an estimated 47 percent agreed that food produced in the EU is  safer than food imported from elsewhere, 32 percent disagreed, and 21  percent did not know.", "Stakeholder perspectives.  The views of industry and consumer groups can  serve as an informal indicator of the effectiveness of a country\u2019s food  safety system.  In the UK, we spoke to representatives of two industry  organizations.  A representative of one such organization stated that he  thought consolidation of the UK\u2019s food safety system had resulted in  improvements; a representative from another organization said that FSA  listens more to industry concerns now.  According to one representative,  FSA is now more transparent to industry, and it is easier to consult with  the agency on issues of concern.  Nevertheless, this person believed that  FSA could do a better job of sharing information.  Another industry  stakeholder noted that FSA acted \u201cdisproportionately\u201d to a recent recall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Relevant Issues", "paragraphs": ["Emerging trends and challenges.

Although only a very small proportion of such foods is  contaminated with an organism capable of causing disease, the scale of  food importation, particularly from countries where standards are not as  stringent as in the UK, has resulted in an increasing number of  international outbreaks.  Such outbreaks have been regularly identified by  the Enter-net network, and international intervention measures have been  introduced on numerous occasions.", "Incidences of foodborne illness caused by E.coli or Campylobacter have  continued to increase at a steady rate in 2006.  Scientists\u2019 understanding of  Campylobacter is still limited because it generally occurs in isolated  incidents (i.e., it is not an \u201coutbreak\u201d bacterium) and is therefore more  difficult to study.", "Listeriosis, especially in older people, seems to be increasing, not just in  the UK but around the world.
