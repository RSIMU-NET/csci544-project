For example, in 2015, 22 states voluntarily participated in a program to identify criminal history records that prohibit individuals from obtaining firearms, which can include domestic violence records. FBI data also show that 47 states identified domestic violence protection orders that prohibit firearm purchases. Since not all domestic violence records that states submit to the FBI meet federal prohibiting criteria, flagging prohibiting records can help expedite NICS checks. The total number of prohibiting domestic violence records that states submit to the FBI is generally unknown because states are not required to flag prohibiting records and there is no automated process to disaggregate such records from other records checked by NICS.", "For fiscal years 2006 to 2015, FBI data show that most NICS checks involving domestic violence records that resulted in denials were completed before firearm transfers took place (see table). However, about 6,700 firearms were transferred to individuals with prohibiting domestic violence records, which resulted in the FBI referring these cases to DOJ's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for firearm retrieval. Under federal law, firearm dealers may (but are not required to) transfer a firearm to an individual if the dealer has not received a response (proceed or denial) from the FBI after 3 business days.", "FBI data also show that during fiscal year 2015, the FBI completed 90 percent of denials that involved MCDV convictions within 7 business days, which was longer than for any other prohibiting category (e.g., felony convictions). The FBI completed 90 percent of denials that involved domestic violence protection orders in fewer than 3 business days. According to federal and selected state officials GAO contacted, the information needed to determine whether domestic violence records\u2014and in particular MCDV convictions\u2014meet the criteria to prohibit a firearm transfer is not always readily available in NICS databases and can require additional outreach to state agencies to obtain information. DOJ has taken steps to help states make prohibiting information more readily available to NICS\u2014such as through training and grant programs\u2014but does not monitor the timeliness of checks that result in denials by prohibiting category.

In addition, we interviewed officials  from eight states (Connecticut, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New  York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington) to gain an understanding of  their processes for submitting domestic violence records to the FBI and  the extent to which they have encountered challenges, if any, in  submitting records. We selected this non-generalizable sample of states  to reflect a range of factors, including the number of domestic violence  records they made available to the FBI and whether they have received  grant funding to improve their record submissions.

Specifically, we obtained FBI  data on each NICS check denial\u2014798,401 records from fiscal years 2006  through 2015\u2014and analyzed these data to identify trends in NICS check  denials. We did not analyze data on NICS checks that are allowed to  proceed because the FBI is required to purge all identifying information  related to the NICS transaction within 24 hours of the transaction being  completed.

Under the Brady Act,  before a firearm dealer can transfer a firearm to an unlicensed individual,  the dealer must initiate a background check through NICS to determine  whether the prospective firearm transfer would violate federal or state  law. Under federal law, generally there are 10 categories of individuals  who are prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm, including  individuals convicted of a MCDV and those subject to a qualifying  domestic violence protection order. States can also establish their own  prohibitions in addition to the federal prohibitions. During a NICS check,  descriptive data provided by an individual, such as name and date of  birth, are used to search three national databases\u2014managed by the  FBI\u2014containing criminal history and other relevant records to determine  whether or not the person is disqualified by law from receiving or  possessing firearms.

The flagged criminal history  records and protection orders, as well as records submitted to the NICS  Index, have been pre-validated by the submitting agency as prohibiting an  individual from receiving or possessing a firearm, thereby expediting the  NICS check process. For criminal records in the III, agencies can use the  Identification for Firearms Sales (IFFS) flag to indicate a prohibiting  record for both persons who have been convicted in any court of a crime  punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year or a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

The FBI has a  goal of completing 90 percent of all NICS checks immediately, and  completes the vast majority of checks before firearms are transferred.  FBI officials noted that the NICS Section has achieved this goal every  year since 2003, and had a 90.4 percent immediate determination rate in  2015.

Officials from four of the eight  states we contacted said their state has laws that allow law enforcement  officials to issue a citation to individuals for misdemeanor crimes,  including crimes that are domestic-violence related, instead of a formal,  fingerprinted arrest. Officials from the remaining four states said their  state has laws that require a fingerprinted arrest for misdemeanor crimes  that could be related to domestic violence. Officials from two states said  they are using federal grant funds, such as NCHIP or NARIP, to enter  non-fingerprinted MCDV records into the NICS Index. For example,  Nebraska officials are using NARIP funds to develop a court process that  will automatically identify MCDV records that qualify for the federal  firearm prohibition and enter these records into the NICS Index. DOJ also  provides grant funds to states to purchase mobile live scan devices that  digitally record and electronically transmit fingerprint images or to place  live scan devices in courtrooms to help ensure that all arrests have a  fingerprinted arrest record in the III.

Officials from  seven of the eight states we contacted said providing complete criminal  records to the III, which include felony and misdemeanor records, was a  challenge. As we previously reported, DOJ has engaged in various efforts  to address state challenges in providing complete criminal history  records. For example, states have used NCHIP grant funds to improve  the completeness of domestic violence records available to NICS by  updating records that only contain arrests to include disposition  information and upgrading and automating criminal history record  systems to capture data on dispositions from courts and prosecutors.  According to senior BJS officials, from fiscal years 2006 through 2015,  DOJ provided approximately $11 million of the $137 million in NCHIP  grants to states and territories specifically for protection order and MCDV  projects.
