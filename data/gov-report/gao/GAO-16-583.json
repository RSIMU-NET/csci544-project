The Army established the Triad of Care model at a time when WTU soldiers' diagnoses were primarily for physical conditions. Since then, the composition of diagnoses has changed significantly. Specifically, in 2008, about 36 percent of the 12,228 soldiers who entered the WTUs had a behavioral health diagnosis. In 2015, however, over half of the 2,628 soldiers who entered the WTUs, about 52 percent, had such a diagnosis. Despite the change in the composition of diagnoses, the Army has not assessed its approach for managing soldiers' care. Officials from the five WTUs that GAO visited stated that they have added social workers to the Triad as an ad-hoc measure to provide better case management and certain types of behavioral health services. These local adaptations represent efforts to meet an immediate medical need and support the need for analysis of whether the Triad model should change. Assessing the Triad in light of the changes in WTU soldiers' diagnoses would position the Army to better determine how to meet WTU soldiers' medical needs.", "The Army faces challenges in its oversight of the selection of squad leaders and platoon sergeants to staff WTUs, in the evaluation of staff training, and in the ability to adjust future staff levels if needed. Specifically, the Army has established selection processes and updated its selection criteria for these WTU personnel, but it is not exercising oversight responsibility to track full adherence to these policies, specifically the Army's requirement to interview candidates for these positions. Candidates for these positions are drawn from a mix of Army occupations, and the selection process, including interviews, is intended to ensure the suitability of the staff selected for these sensitive positions. While the Army has taken steps to improve its training program for squad leaders and platoon sergeants, the program does not incorporate a post-training assessment of the application of training to the work environment. Without information that could be obtained from such assessments, the Army may miss an opportunity to incorporate information concerning the practical application of training. In addition, the Army has not developed plans for how it would increase WTU staff levels, if needed, to support any potential future increase in demand. The ability to reverse the decision to inactivate 11 WTUs by August 2016 was a key planning consideration for the Army. However, without a plan to address staff level changes, the Army lacks assurance that it can select, train, and assign staff to its WTUs in a timely manner.", "While the Army has implemented a process for reviewing the eligibility of soldiers to be admitted to WTUs, it does not track instances in which Commanders have made exceptions to these criteria. By not tracking this information, the Army does not know how frequently such exceptions are made and cannot ensure the best use of resources. In addition, the Army is planning to expand a WTU-alternative program to the Army Reserve, but has not examined the costs and benefits of such an expansion. Without comparing the costs and benefits of program expansion with the current system, the Army could incur significant costs without clearly articulated benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's recommendations include that the Army assess the Triad of Care model's effectiveness; track adherence to selection processes for WTU staff; assess the application of their training; develop plans to ensure the ability to adjust staff levels, if needed; track exceptions to WTU admittance criteria; and compare the costs and benefits of expanding a WTU-alternative program for Army Reserve soldiers.

The Army  created this program to manage recovering soldiers\u2019 complex medical  needs using a uniform, Army-wide structure and approach to facilitate the  soldiers\u2019 transition either back to the force or to separation from the Army.  The central structure of the WTU program is the Triad of Care staffing  model for managing soldiers\u2019 care, which comprises a primary care  manager, a nurse case manager, and a squad leader or platoon sergeant  who work together to develop a plan of care for supporting each soldier\u2019s  transition. According to Army data, the number of soldiers entering the  WTU program has declined from a peak of 12,228 in 2008 to 2,628 in  2015, and consequently the Army has reduced the number of WTUs,  from a high of 45 units in 2008 to the planned 14 units by August 2016.", "WTUs are an asset of the local military treatment facility and, by  extension, under the command and control of the senior mission  Commander on the relevant installation.

The Warrior Transition Command is a subcommand of the Army  Medical Command, and reports to the Army Surgeon General. Starting  June 2016, the Warrior Transition Command will be reorganized as a  directorate within the Army Medical Command. The Army Surgeon  General, as Commanding General of the Army Medical Command, is  ultimately responsible for oversight of the Warrior Transition Command  and the WTU program.", "Given the changes that are occurring in the Army\u2019s WTU program, the  House Report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for us to  review various aspects of the program.

To identify  changes in the WTU population over time, we analyzed data from the  Warrior Transition Command on WTU soldiers\u2019 medical diagnoses. We  found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our use based on interviews  with Warrior Transition Command officials about how the data were  captured, stored, and checked for accuracy. We spoke with Warrior  Transition Command officials about the Triad of Care model, changes  with the WTU soldier population, and their WTU inspections. We also  interviewed officials at each of the five WTUs we visited about the Triad of  Care model and the management of their soldiers\u2019 care.", "For our second objective, we compared current Army policies with  previous Army policies regarding selecting and training WTU staff. We  reviewed federal internal control standards, which state that  management should demonstrate a commitment to recruit, develop, and  retain competent individuals, and we reviewed our work identifying the  attributes of effective training. We obtained information on current  practices for selecting and training WTU staff and obtained the  perspectives of Army and WTU officials to provide context and clarity. We  focused on the selection and training of squad leaders and platoon  sergeants based on these discussions. We also reviewed policies  concerning the Army\u2019s ability to adjust staff levels and federal internal  control standards, which emphasize the need to demonstrate a  commitment to competence through succession and contingency  planning, and the need for control activities such as the management of  human capital to maintain a continuity of needed skills and abilities. We  also interviewed Warrior Transition Command and WTU officials to  provide context and clarity.", "For our third objective, we examined the Army\u2019s policies and process for  admitting soldiers into the WTUs, including any proposed changes to  admittance criteria. We compared the Army\u2019s application of these policies  with federal internal control standards which require that management  design control activities, such as establishment and review of  performance measures and indicators, to achieve objectives and respond  to risks. In addition, we compared plans for the introduction of a WTU- alternative program for the Army Reserve with our prior work, which  calls for a performance-based analysis of benefits and costs for each  alternative when considering program changes.", "For our fourth objective, we obtained and analyzed information on the  Army\u2019s approach for handling complaints by WTU soldiers. We  compared the Army\u2019s approach for handling complaints with federal  internal control standards, which state that information should be  communicated to management and others who need it in such a way that  they can carry out their responsibilities.

Prior to the establishment of WTUs, the Army  provided care for soldiers recovering from serious medical conditions  through Medical Hold and Holdover Units. According to Army  documents, the previous system did not have a uniform structure and  exhibited varying levels of resources. For example, some units fell under  the command of the local military treatment facility, while others fell under  the command of the local installation. In addition, the Army did not have a  uniform system of staffing, as the relevant command had to resource the  units by reassigning personnel from other missions and functions.  Further, the increased workload associated with care for these soldiers at  the local military treatment facility was not reflected in increased staffing  levels or resources.", "In response to congressional interest and media coverage regarding  inadequate and substandard care for Army soldiers recovering from  serious medical conditions at the former Walter Reed Army Medical  Center, the Army in 2007 developed its Army Medical Action Plan. This  plan laid out a series of steps to address the problems highlighted at  Walter Reed and other facilities, including the establishment of the WTU  program. According to Army documents, the primary differences between  the previous system of Medical Hold and Holdover Units and the WTU  program was the establishment of (1) a uniform structure and ratios of  staff to WTU soldiers by specialty and (2) a program (the Comprehensive  Transition Plan) to facilitate the soldiers\u2019 transition to either a return to the  force or separation from the Army.", "The central structure of the WTU program is the Triad of Care model,  which includes a primary care manager, a nurse case manager, and a  squad leader or platoon sergeant, who direct and supervise the WTU  soldiers\u2019 healing process. Along with these Triad of Care key staff, there  are other medical and nonmedical providers\u2014such as social workers and  occupational therapists\u2014who work together to develop a plan of care  specific to each soldier. The plan of care is intended to address the  soldiers\u2019 medical needs and support their transition either back to duty or  to separation from the Army. This staffing model formalized the  relationship between some of the same positions that had existed in the  prior Medical Hold and Holdover Units\u2019 and established ratios for the  number of WTU soldiers that were to be under the care of each of the  Triad of Care\u2019s key staff.

At  that point, the Army will have 14 WTUs remaining.", "The Army uses an annual process known as a Strategic Posture Review  to determine the required capability and capacity for each WTU location  and for WTUs across the Army enterprise, such as determinations for the  number of WTUs. This process includes estimating the future population  of WTU soldiers using a model validated by the Army and then applying  the estimated population to the current capacity of WTUs based on  established ratios of the numbers of WTU soldiers to the numbers of  primary care managers, nurse case managers, and squad leaders. If  excess capacity is identified, the Warrior Transition Command reviews a  series of criteria to determine which WTUs should remain open. For  example, as part of the most recent review that recommended the  inactivation of 11 sites, Army officials stated that they had selected sites  to remain open that were co-located with force projection platforms and  the best Army medical facilities. These recommendations are ultimately  approved by senior Army officials.", "The ability to reverse these inactivations if demand for WTUs were to rise  in the future was a key planning consideration in the decision to inactivate  11 WTUs by August 2016. As a result, the Army has issued policy to  maintain control and oversight of former WTU facilities at inactivating  locations. For example, the policy requires that the Installation  Management Command conduct annual inspections of inactivated WTU  facilities to ensure that compliance with Army standards for WTU  facilities.

Army Medical Department Center and School officials also  stated that the training is designed to provide a foundation for squad  leaders and platoon sergeants to be able to perform their duties, and is  not intended to provide them with expert-level proficiency.", "While the WTU training program is extensive, WTU squad leaders and  platoon sergeants at three of the five sites we visited stated that they  were not sufficiently prepared for their positions after taking the required  training. Specifically, squad leaders and platoon sergeants stated that  their training did not address the actual requirements of their positions,  such as the use of data systems and other day-to-day responsibilities.  Squad leaders and platoon sergeants expressed frustration with their  training, noting that there is no military occupational specialty similar to  their positions, and that their roles and responsibilities were unfamiliar  and dissimilar to anything in their prior Army experience. Candidates for  these positions are drawn from a mix of Army occupations, such as  infantry or transportation corps, and new squad leaders and platoon  sergeants may have no background working with soldiers with issues  typical of the WTU population, such as behavioral health issues. Other  WTU staff at these sites, such as nurse case managers, social workers,  and a WTU Commander stated that they also believe that current training  does not sufficiently prepare squad leaders and platoon sergeants for  their duties. For example, they noted that in some instances squad  leaders and platoon sergeants did not have a sufficient understanding of  behavioral health issues to be charged with responsibility for individuals  having these issues.", "Our prior work on assessing strategic training efforts summarizes  attributes of effective training and development programs, including those  related to the evaluation of agency training and development efforts.  Such attributes include how the agency incorporates evaluation feedback  into the planning, design, and implementation of its training and  development efforts. According to school officials, the Army Medical  Department Center and School currently uses end-of-course surveys and  feedback from focus groups, WTU leadership, and staff to collect  information on the effectiveness of the courses offered and make  changes to course curricula. In addition, Army Medical Department  Center and Schools officials stated that the Warrior Transition Command  provides feedback from its Organizational Inspection Program regarding  training. Warrior Transition Command officials stated that they send  questionnaires prior to their Organizational Inspection Program and ask  questions during informal feedback sessions regarding the effectiveness  of squad leader and platoon sergeant training. These officials stated that  they believe their current approach provides sufficient feedback to  improve the training program.", "While these efforts represent attempts to improve training through  feedback, they do not assess the application of training to the work  environment. Our prior work emphasizes that agencies should use  analytical approaches appropriate for assessing training and development  programs, such as assessing the application of training to the work  environment. Application of training to the work environment assesses  expected changes in behavior that trainees should exhibit on the job  because of the training. Army Medical Department Center and School  officials stated that the WTUs do not evaluate training of squad leaders  and platoon sergeant through assessments of how well they are able to  apply their training to the work environment. These officials noted that  they have previously proposed such an assessment to the Warrior  Transition Command as the Warrior Transition Command is responsible  for post-training assessments of staff. Army Medical Department Center  and School officials noted that 90 days post-training would be an  opportune time to collect information on the application of squad leaders  and platoon sergeants\u2019 training to the work environment. However, no  action has been taken to date.", "Without information that could be obtained from conducting post-training  assessments, the Army Medical Department Center and School may miss  a valuable opportunity to improve its programs by incorporating useful  information concerning the practical application of training. Similarly, the  Warrior Transition Command and WTUs may miss a valuable opportunity  to further assess the performance of the squad leaders and platoon  sergeants for the benefit of WTU soldiers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Not Developed Plans for Adjusting Staff Levels to Meet Any Potential Increases in Demand for WTUs", "paragraphs": ["The Army has not developed plans for increasing its WTU staff levels in  the event of increased demand for WTUs. A key planning consideration in  the decision to inactivate 11 WTUs by August 2016 was the Army\u2019s ability  to reverse these changes in the event that the demand for the Army\u2019s  WTU program was to increase. The Army\u2019s guidance highlights the  importance of reversibility, and establishes a number of relevant policies,  for example, to maintain control of inactive WTU facilities. According to  the Warrior Transition Command, the enduring 14 WTUs, if staffed by a  full complement of 1,475 staff, could manage up to 4,400 WTU soldiers.  With additional staff, the facilities at the enduring WTUs could support up  to 8,100 WTU soldiers. In line with this projection, the Army has outlined  plans for \u201cexpansion companies\u201d at its enduring locations, with the  exception of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Brooke  Army Medical Center, that could operate on a temporary basis for a  period of 2 years, with an assessment after the first 9 months to  determine whether the company should be added to the unit\u2019s permanent  staffing document. Each expansion company would require 55 WTU  personnel and could manage the care of up to 200 WTU soldiers.", "While these plans represent positive steps toward planning for a potential  increase in WTU numbers, the Army has not addressed how it would staff  the expansion companies at these enduring WTUs, or at any of the 11  inactivating WTUs, if the need arises. Warrior Transition Command  officials stated that any change in the need for staff would be gradual. In  addition, the Warrior Transition Command\u2019s population projection model  takes account of deployment cycles and could possibly anticipate a spike  in WTU admissions due to an increased operational tempo. However,  upswings in deployments and operational tempo could create spikes in  WTU soldier admissions, possibly resulting in the need to expand WTU  staff at a pace that is greater than the Army\u2019s current expectations.", "Regardless of the pace of any increase, the Army could face challenges  in its efforts to staff these units with appropriately selected and screened  personnel in a timely manner. As previously noted, the Warrior Transition  Command recently updated its selection requirements for squad leaders  and platoon sergeants. As the Warrior Transition Command implements  requirements for squad leaders and platoon sergeants to undergo  background checks and behavioral health records checks, effects from  these changes could result in an increase in the time required to select  WTU staff. The Warrior Transition Command has emphasized the  importance of the screening and selection process, noting that it is central  to the integrity of the WTU program and the duty to care for WTU  soldiers. In addition, WTUs are staffed by a number of other  professionals, including primary care managers, nurse case managers,  social workers, and transition coordination specialists, and hiring well- qualified candidates for these positions will also take time. For example,  after WTU nurse case managers attend a 3-week training course, they  must then complete a 4-week preceptorship at their assigned WTU  before they can manage a normal caseload of 20 WTU soldiers. Army  guidance notes the possibility of hiring term or temporary employees to  address any gaps. However, such an approach could negatively impact  the continuity of care, a central principle of the Army\u2019s approach to WTU  care, because of turnover in key WTU staff.", "To handle any sudden increase in demand, WTUs also could potentially  increase their ratios of squad leaders, nurse case managers, or primary  care managers to WTU soldiers to accommodate the additional demand,  but this too could have negative effects due to the heavier case  workloads that would result for these individuals. Warrior Transition  Command officials stated that they regularly monitor the ratios of these  team members to WTU soldiers, and the regulation underscores the  relationship between adhering to these ratios and the quality of care  provided. Further, officials such as squad leaders, platoon sergeants,  social workers, and nurse case managers at the five WTUs we visited  stated that the current ratios may be too high. At one site we visited,  officials have changed local policy to lower the ratio of squad leaders to  WTU soldiers.", "Federal internal control standards emphasize the need for control  activities, such as the management of human capital, to maintain a  continuity of needed skills and abilities. While the Army\u2019s recently issued  policy does not require the Warrior Transition Command to develop a  plan for increasing its staff levels in response to future demand, the policy  states that the Warrior Transition Command should \u201cbe prepared to  reactivate previously inactivated WTUs.\u201d Senior Warrior Transition  Command officials told us that this is an implied requirement for a plan  related to staffing. However, they stated that they have not yet taken  steps to address this issue.

The Army\u2019s structured  process for reviewing the eligibility of soldiers to enter WTUs comprises  the requirement that the WTU Commander, local hospital Commander,  and senior mission Commander compare potential WTU soldiers\u2019 medical  case history with the WTU admittance criteria and decide whether  soldiers are eligible. Warrior Transition Command officials stated that  senior mission Commanders are able to approve exceptions to the criteria  under a variety of circumstances, such as the need for soldiers stationed  overseas to process disability status through DOD\u2019s Integrated Disability  Evaluation System.", "Officials at the Warrior Transition Command could not provide data of  how often exceptions to WTU admittance criteria were approved. Officials  noted that admitting soldiers who do not meet admittance criteria can be  appropriate in some situations. For example, the Department of Defense  and the Veterans Affairs system for assessing individuals\u2019 medical fitness  for service and level of service-related disability, known as the Integrated  Disability Evaluation System, is available only to soldiers in the  continental United States, and soldiers stationed overseas can be  transferred to a military treatment facility in the continental United States  with an associated WTU to complete this process. WTU soldiers who will  not be returning to duty normally go through this process while in the  WTU.", "Officials at our site visits expressed concern related to instances in which  soldiers were far into the Integrated Disability Evaluation System process,  near to the point of separation from the Army, and were assigned to a  WTU to stay for fewer than 6 months, sometimes for fewer than 30 days.  By virtue of the fact that a soldier is in the late stages of the Integrated  Disability Evaluation System process, the soldier is unlikely to be in the  Army for the standard admittance criteria period of 6 months or more of  care. At three of the five sites we visited, a variety of WTU officials, such  as nurse case managers, squad leaders, and social workers, among  others, expressed concern about this issue. Officials at these locations  noted that this was not the best use of WTU resources, and that such  soldiers did not have the necessary time to benefit from the medical and  career opportunities that the WTU program provides.", "According to Warrior Transition Command officials, they do not track  instances in which individual WTUs make exceptions to the Army\u2019s  admittance criteria because application of the eligibility criteria is the  responsibility of the senior mission Commander on the relevant  installation. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that management should design control activities to achieve  objectives. These control activities might include performing top-level  reviews, for example, to ensure that performance is consistent with the  WTU program\u2019s goals.

Specifically, the Army has not yet estimated the costs and  benefits of expanding the Reserve Component Managed Care program,  which currently treats only National Guard soldiers with low-acuity, low- risk, non-complex medical needs. In addition, the Army has not compared  the cost of expanding this program with maintaining the status quo for  soldiers with similar low-acuity, low-risk, non-complex medical needs.  Army Reserve officials have confirmed their intention to participate in the  program, but have not yet established a timeline for its introduction.", "Currently, active-duty soldiers must need care lasting 6 months or longer  to be admitted to a WTU. In contrast, reserve component soldiers must  need care lasting 30 days or longer. If reserve component soldiers meet  this threshold, they can be considered for admittance to a WTU  Community Care Unit if their medical needs are low-acuity, low-risk, and  non-complex. Warrior Transition Command and Army Reserve officials  stated that expansion of the Reserve Component Managed Care program  to the Army Reserve would be necessary if the Warrior Transition  Command were to change current WTU admittance policy, specifically by  applying the more stringent criteria for active-duty soldiers to members of  the reserve components. However, during the course of our review,  Warrior Transition Command officials stated that they came to an  agreement with the Army Reserve that admittance criteria will not change  until the Reserve Component Managed Care program is expanded to the  Army Reserve.", "A senior Army Reserve official stated that the lower threshold for  members of the reserve components stems from requirements under  law and DOD instructions for such soldiers to remain in active federal  service for the purposes of disability evaluation or medical treatment.  Senior officials at the Warrior Transition Command noted that active-duty  soldiers needing fewer than 6 months of care can, instead of being  assigned to a WTU, remain with their line unit and receive medical care in  that setting. Meanwhile, reserve component soldiers must demobilize as  their active-duty orders end and, while they can receive DOD-funded  medical care for a period of time, cannot continue to receive their active- duty pay and other benefits. The 30-day treatment threshold therefore  allows those soldiers to enter the WTU, whereas active-duty soldiers with  similar short-term care needs can remain with their unit. Table 2  summarizes the admittance criteria for the WTU program and for the  WTU-alternative program.", "Warrior Transition Command and Army Reserve officials told us that were  the more stringent active-duty criteria to be applied to members of the  reserve components, those Army Reserve soldiers needing fewer than 6  months of care would not be eligible for the WTU program, and would not  be able to receive their active duty pay while receiving short-term medical  treatment. According to Warrior Transition Command and Army Reserve  officials, access to active-duty pay is important because these soldiers  may not be medically able to return to civilian employment while receiving  medical care. Warrior Transition Command officials acknowledged that  this would put Army Reserve soldiers at a disadvantage compared with  active component soldiers. National Guard soldiers, meanwhile, could  potentially access the Reserve Component Managed Care Program,  which provides an alternative to WTUs for soldiers needing 179 days or  fewer of low-acuity, low-risk medical care while on active-duty orders,  entitling soldiers to active duty pay and benefits. Army Reserve or  National Guard soldiers with low-acuity, low-risk, non-complex conditions  can also be assigned to a WTU Community Care Unit, in which soldiers  are not physically located at a WTU, but receive remote medical case  management from their assigned WTU and receive medical care in their  local area, either in a military treatment facility or from a provider in the  TRICARE network. To be eligible, soldiers must not be in need of  complex medical case management, and must meet behavioral health- risk standards. According to Army data, as of February 2016, there were  155 Army Reserve soldiers in 11 Community Care Units across the  United States.", "Army Reserve officials told us that they are in the early planning stages of  considering Reserve Component Managed Care expansion, and that no  cost estimates of such an expansion have yet been developed. As in the  National Guard, the active duty Army would pay for active duty pay and  medical care costs for the reservists in this program. However, officials  told us that the Army Reserve would incur costs because of the need to  tender a contract for nurse case managers for the program. Unlike the  National Guard, the Army Reserve does not currently have a large  network of contracted nurse case managers charged with improving  medical readiness. While the National Guard is able to utilize its existing  nurse case manager contract to service the program, officials stated that  the Army Reserve would incur new costs in procuring these services.  Further, Army officials have not yet articulated why expansion of the  Reserve Component Managed Care is preferable to any alternatives,  such as the continued use of WTU Community Care Units, especially in  light of the alternative program\u2019s increased costs. One official told us that  this may stem from a desire to limit the time that reserve component  personnel spend in the WTU program.", "Our Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide states that  when considering program changes, officials should develop a  performance-based analysis of the benefits and costs for each  alternative, followed by a formal business case analysis making the case  for a change. In this case, such an analysis could assess the costs and  benefits of expanding the Reserve Component Managed Care program to  the Army Reserve with alternatives, such as the option of continuing the  current system of Community Care Units. As noted above, the Army  Reserve is in the early stages of considering Reserve Component  Managed Care expansion and no cost estimate has yet been conducted.  Senior officials from Warrior Transition Command and the Army Reserve  stated that expansion of the Reserve Component Managed Care program  requires fewer resources than WTUs and soldiers in this program, on  average, demonstrate shorter lengths of stay than soldiers in WTUs or  Community Care Units.

We reviewed the Army\u2019s policy in this area and the principle in  federal internal control standards that states that agencies need to  demonstrate a commitment to competence through succession and  contingency plans and to establish control activities, such as for the  management of human capital, to maintain a continuity of needed skills  and abilities.", "To determine the extent to which the Army has assessed adherence to  WTU program admittance criteria and the impact of any changes to these  criteria for the active-duty and reserve components, we reviewed policies  and procedures for admitting soldiers into the WTU program, including  any proposed changes to the admittance criteria and discussed the  application of these policies and procedures with officials at each of the  sites we visited and with officials from the Warrior Transition Command.  We compared these policies and procedures with federal internal control  standards which require that management design control activities, such  as establishing and reviewing performance measures and indicators, to  achieve objectives and respond to risks, and noted any differences. In  addition, we reviewed documentation concerning the Army\u2019s Reserve  Component Managed Care program, a WTU-alternative program, and its  proposed introduction to the Army Reserve, and discussed this  information, including estimated costs, with officials from the Army  Reserve and the Warrior Transition Command. We compared plans for  the introduction of the program to the Army Reserve with the requirement  in our Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide for a  performance-based analysis of benefits and costs for each alternative  when considering program changes, and noted any differences.", "To determine whether the Army had instituted methods to address the  complaints of WTU soldiers, we analyzed information on the Army\u2019s  approach to handling complaints by WTU soldiers. We interviewed  program staff and officials regarding the Army\u2019s approach and reviewed  related Army documentation, such as Army policies on its WTU and  chaplain corps programs. We compared the Army\u2019s approach for handling  complaints with federal internal control standards which state that  information should be communicated to management and others who  need it in such a way that they can carry out their responsibilities.", "We analyzed data regarding the number of soldiers in a WTU over time,  the date when they entered a WTU, and their average length of stay from  2007 to 2015. We found the data on the number of soldiers in a WTU  over time to be sufficiently reliable to present monthly changes in the  WTU soldiers\u2019 census. For the data on when a soldier entered a WTU  and their lengths of stay, we determined that the 2007 and 2008 data  were unreliable because of missing data. We also chose not to report  data on when a soldier entered a WTU and their lengths of stay for 2015  because of the large number of soldiers that were still in the WTU  program when the data were reported by Warrior Transition Command  officials. Other than these exceptions, we found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for showing WTU soldiers\u2019 lengths of stay from the  time of entry in the WTU program to the time of (1) exiting the WTU and  (2) until they had reached their medical retention decision point. For each  type of data, we made these determinations based on a data reliability  questionnaire filled out by Army officials, logic tests of the data, and our  conversations with Warrior Transition Command officials about how the  data were captured, stored, and checked for accuracy.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Trends in Warrior Transition Unit Soldiers\u2019 Separation from the Army and Lengths of Stay in the Warrior Transition Unit Program", "paragraphs": ["Of the Army soldiers who entered a Warrior Transition Unit (WTU)  between 2008 and the end of 2015, generally a higher percentage  separated from the Army than returned to the Army (see fig. 4).", "WTU soldiers\u2019 length of stay\u2014from entry in the WTU until separation\u2014 peaked for soldiers who entered in 2009 and has generally decreased  since then. For example, the average length of stay was 407 days for  those soldiers who entered a WTU in 2009, and that number decreased  to 308 for those who entered a WTU in 2014. In addition, WTU soldiers  in the active component generally had shorter lengths of stay than those  in the Army National Guard or Army Reserve (see fig. 5).", "Similarly, the average length of time between a WTU soldier\u2019s entrance  into the WTU program and the medical retention determination point has  significantly decreased. For example, the average length of time to reach  the medical retention determination point has decreased by about 45  percent for those soldiers who had entered a WTU in 2009 as compared  with those who entered a WTU in 2014 (see fig.6)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Lori Atkinson, Assistant Director;  Rebekah Boone; Nicole Collier; Mae Jones; Amie Lesser; Jeffrey  Mayhew; Michael Silver; Adam Smith; and Sabrina Streagle made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Military and Veteran Support: DOD and VA Programs That Address the  Effects of Combat and Transition to Civilian Life.
