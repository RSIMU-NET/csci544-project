Specifically, GAO estimates that 78 percent (from 73 to 83 percent) of local jurisdictions nationwide had no polling places with wait times officials considered to be too long and 22 percent (from 17 to 27 percent) had wait times that officials considered too long at a few or more polling places on Election Day 2012. Jurisdiction officials had varying views on the length of time that would be considered too long\u2014for example, some officials considered 10 minutes too long, while others considered 30 minutes too long. Because there is no comprehensive set of data on wait times across jurisdictions nationwide, GAO relied on election officials in the jurisdictions it surveyed to estimate wait times based on their perspectives and any data or information they collected on voter wait times.", "Multiple factors affected voter wait times on Election Day 2012, and their impacts varied across jurisdictions. Specifically, GAO's survey of local election jurisdictions, review of wait time literature, and interviews with election officials and researchers identified nine common factors that affected wait times.", "The specific impact of these nine factors depended on the unique circumstances in each of the 5 local jurisdictions GAO selected for interviews, leading to targeted approaches for reducing wait times where needed. For example, according to election officials in 2 jurisdictions, lengthy ballots were the primary cause of long wait times. In 1 of these jurisdictions, state constitutional amendments accounted for five of its eight ballot pages on average, and since the 2012 election, a state law was enacted that established additional word limits to such amendments, which officials said could help reduce wait times. Another jurisdiction that had ballots of similar length did not report long wait times.", "In comments on draft report excerpts, 1 jurisdiction stated that our description of its experiences was accurate.

Researchers and others have defined long wait times in different ways,  such as 30 minutes or more or 120 minutes or more.

Our  analysis of CCES data demonstrates that, as with the results from our  survey of local jurisdictions, long voter wait times were limited on Election  Day 2012. Specifically, our analysis of CCES data found that average  voter wait times on Election Day 2012 varied across the nation, but few  states had average voter wait times of more than 20 minutes. On the  basis of this analysis, we estimate that average voter wait times ranged  from 1.4 minutes (from 0.7 to 2.1 minutes) in Alaska to more than 34  minutes (from 25 to 43 minutes) in Florida.

As a result, the  presence of a factor that could contribute to wait times does not  necessarily mean wait times will occur. Further, some factors may be  present in one election but not another, such as new types of voting  equipment, and some factors may be outside the control of local  jurisdictions, such as state laws allowing or limiting early in-person voting.  It is useful to consider the causes of and solutions for long wait times  across jurisdictions to identify common factors; however, it is also  important to consider causes and solutions within the unique  circumstances of each jurisdiction.

Our survey results also show that most  jurisdictions tended to use general types of data, such as the number  of registered voters, to inform their resource allocation among polling  places, and typically did not use more specific measures, such as the  estimated average time needed to check in voters. For example, we  estimate that 89 percent (from 84 to 92 percent) of jurisdictions used  the number of registered voters in each polling place to inform their  resource allocation, and 31 percent (from 25 to 36 percent) used the  estimated average time needed to check in voters.", "Perspectives on Resource Availability and Allocation", "Of the 291 jurisdictions that responded to our open-ended survey question  regarding what policies and procedures were most important to minimizing wait  times, 168\u2014or over half\u2014indicated areas related to Election Day resources,  such as better allocation or increasing the number of poll workers or voting  machines.

Studies we reviewed and researchers we interviewed noted a relationship  between the allocation of resources and wait times. For example,  The Presidential Commission noted that it is usually the allocation of  resources between polling places, rather than the total resources available,  that causes long lines. The Presidential Commission and researchers with  whom we spoke suggested jurisdictions seeking to reduce voter wait times  use resource allocation methods that incorporate targeted inputs\u2014such as  estimated turnout by hour and estimated average service times for voter  check-in and ballot completion.

For example, officials stated  that additional voter education could help address some of the issues with  determining voter eligibility that were experienced on Election Day 2012,  such as voters arriving at the wrong polling place, but their jurisdiction  lacks the resources to provide this education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdiction 4", "paragraphs": ["Jurisdiction 4 reported in our survey that less than half, but more than a  few, of its polling places had wait times of greater than 60 minutes on  Election Day 2012. In addition, 26 percent of its precincts remained open  over 3 hours after the designated closing time, according to data provided  by jurisdiction election officials. These officials stated that the jurisdiction  did not have wait time issues in 2008 of which they were aware and that a  confluence of factors created the long wait times in 2012.", "According to jurisdiction officials, lengthy ballots\u2014an average of eight 17- inch pages\u2014were the primary cause of long voter wait times. Factors  contributing to the long ballots included (1) 12 state constitutional  amendments that spanned five pages; (2) state requirements to include  special district races, such as fire control, mosquito control, and  community development districts, on the ballots; and (3) the Voting  Rights Act requirement to include both English and Spanish on the  ballots. Officials said that voters took a significant amount of time to fill  out their ballots, which resulted in congestion at voting booths in some  polling places. In addition, these officials stated that the long ballots led to  paper jams when voters scanned their ballots, contributing to average  wait times of more than 30 minutes to turn in ballots after completing  them. According to jurisdiction officials, the length of the ballot for the  November 2012 election was not determined until mid-June because of  the timing for determining qualifying candidates and state amendments.  Officials said that they sent out sample ballots to help educate voters, but  did not have sufficient time to effectively plan or take additional actions to  help mitigate the effects.", "Jurisdiction officials said that the second key cause of long wait times on  Election Day was state-wide reductions in the number of days and limited  locations available for in-person early voting. State legislation changed  the number of allowable early voting days from 14 days in 2008 to 8 days   In addition, officials said that existing state law limited the sites  in 2012.that could be used for early voting to a few types of public buildings,  which created challenges with finding locations that could conveniently  and effectively serve voters. Election officials reported that while there  were about 5,500 fewer total voters in 2012 compared with the 2008  general election (a 2 percent decrease), approximately 14,500 fewer  people voted early (a 22 percent decrease). As a result, more voters than  expected came to the polls on Election Day and the jurisdiction did not  have enough resources to effectively accommodate them, according to  officials. For example, officials stated that there was an insufficient  number of voting booths and scanners in some polling locations because  of both the larger than expected turnout and the time needed to fill out  and scan long ballots.", "Jurisdiction officials said that other factors also contributed to wait times.  For example, they stated that redistricting and precinct consolidations  may have increased the number of voters who went to the wrong polling  location because their polling place had changed from the previous  election.number from 171 in 2008 to 125 in 2012\u2014in an effort to lower election  expenditures, but that this may have contributed to long lines by  increasing the number of voters in certain polling locations. Further,  officials said that heavy rain on Election Day led to line management  issues in some locations because poll workers were checking in more  voters than their polling place could accommodate to get voters out of the  rain. This contributed to the congestion at the voting booths and scanning  machines.", "Officials stated that they consolidated precincts\u2014reducing the  Jurisdiction officials said that a number of changes have been made since  the 2012 election to address long wait times. For example, state laws  established additional word limits to state constitutional amendments on  the ballot, restored the allowable number of early voting days to 2008  levels, and expanded the types of sites that can be used for early voting  locations. In addition, the jurisdiction has replaced the paper poll books  used in 2012 with electronic poll books, which officials anticipate will help  expedite the check-in process; better estimate voter turnout for resource  allocation; and allow them to post current wait times for each precinct  online, which would help voters identify times to go to the polls if they do  not want to wait. According to officials, the jurisdiction also purchased an  additional 100 optical scanners so that each precinct will have 2  scanners. In addition, officials said that they have launched voter  education efforts, such as public service announcements on radio,  television, and other forms of media, to encourage mail-in voting and  inform voters about how to access voter registration and polling place  information.

Officials noted that they need to ensure the jurisdiction has sufficient  polling places, poll workers, and voting equipment to support the  number of precincts required to meet this requirement.", "According to jurisdiction officials, mailing sample ballots to registered  voters helped to shorten the time it took to fill out ballots in the voting  booth. A polling place inspector\u2014who supervises polling place  operations and staff\u2014we interviewed said that the lengthy ballot did  not result in long wait times at her polling place on Election Day 2012  because many voters brought in their sample ballots and knew how  they would vote.
