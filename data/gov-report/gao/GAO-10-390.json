In 2003, GAO reviewed the public financing programs in Maine and Arizona and found the programs' goals were to (1) increase electoral competition; (2) increase voter choice; (3) curb increases in campaign costs; (4) reduce interest group influence; and (5) increase voter participation. GAO reported that while the number of candidates who participated in the programs increased from 2000 to 2002, it was too soon to determine the extent to which these five goals of the programs were being met. Senate Report 110-129 directed GAO to update its 2003 report. This report: (1) provides data on candidate participation and (2) describes changes in five goals of Maine's and Arizona's programs in the 2000 through 2008 elections and the extent to which changes could be attributed to the programs. To address its objectives, GAO analyzed available data about candidate participation, election outcomes, and campaign spending for the 1996 through 2008 legislative elections in both states, reviewed studies, and interviewed 22 candidates and 10 interest group officials selected to reflect a range of views. The interview results are not generalizable to all candidates or all interest groups. GAO is issuing an electronic supplement with this report--GAO-10-391SP--which provides data and summaries of statistical analyses conducted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In Maine and Arizona, legislative candidates' participation in the public financing programs, as measured by the percentage of candidates participating and the proportion of races with a participating candidate, increased from 2000 to 2008. Specifically, the participation rate of candidates in Maine's general elections increased from 33 percent in 2000 to over 80 percent in 2006 and 2008. Meanwhile, the participation rate of candidates in Arizona's general elections increased from 26 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2008. Also, the proportion of races with at least one candidate participating in the program generally increased from 2000 through 2008. While there was some evidence of statistically significant changes in one of the five goals of Maine's and Arizona's public financing programs, we could not directly attribute these changes to the programs, nor did we find significant changes in the remaining four goals after program implementation. Specifically, there were statistically significant decreases in one measure of electoral competition--the winner's margin of victory--in legislative races in both states. However, GAO could not directly attribute these decreases to the programs due to other factors, such as the popularity of candidates, which affect electoral outcomes. We found no change in two other measures of competition, and there were no observed changes in voter choice--the average number of legislative candidates per district race. In Maine, decreases in average candidate spending in House races were statistically significant, but a state official said this was likely due to reductions in the amounts given to participating candidates in 2008, while average spending in Maine Senate races did not change. In Arizona, average spending has increased in the five elections under the program. There is no indication the programs decreased perceived interest group influence, although some candidates and interest group officials GAO interviewed said campaign tactics changed, such as the timing of campaign spending. Data limitations, including a lack of comparable measures over time, hinder analysis of changes in voter participation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public financing of political campaigns is a controversial issue that is  viewed by supporters as a means of reducing the influence of money in  politics while increasing the involvement of citizens in the political  process and seen by opponents as a violation of free speech as well as a  misuse of public funds. While public financing of political campaigns at  the federal level applies only to presidential elections, some states have  taken actions to implement programs to offer public financing intended to  fund most campaign costs of candidates for certain state-level political  campaigns. The 2000 elections in Maine and Arizona were the first  instances in the nation\u2019s history where candidates seeking state legislative  seats and certain statewide offices had the option to fully fund their  campaigns with public moneys. Under the public financing programs in  Maine and Arizona, \u201cparticipating candidates\u201d qualified for public  financing and received a set amount of money for their primary and  general election campaigns if they agreed to forgo private fundraising and  obtained a minimum number of $5 donations from individual donors. In  addition to their initial distribution of funds, participating candidates  received matching funds from public moneys, based on spending by  opposing privately financed (\u201cnonparticipating\u201d) candidates, who engaged  in traditional means, such as conducting fundraisers, to raise money from  individuals, corporations, and political action committees. Participating  candidates also received matching funds based on an individual\u2019s or  group\u2019s reported independent expenditures, which are expenditures made  that benefit an opposing candidate, but without coordination with the  benefiting candidate.", "In 2003, we reviewed the public financing programs in Maine and Arizona  as mandated in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. In our 2003  report, we identified five overarching goals of Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public  financing programs based on our review of the history of the programs  and discussions with officials in each state. Generally, these goals were to  (1) increase electoral competition by, among other means, reducing the  number of uncontested races (i.e., races with only one candidate per seat  in contention); (2) increase voter choice by encouraging more candidates  to run for office; (3) curb increases in the cost of campaigns; (4) reduce  the influence of interest groups and, thereby, enhance citizens\u2019 confidence  in government; and (5) increase voter participation (e.g., increase voter  turnout for elections).", "In 2003, we reported that while the number of legislative candidates who  chose to use public financing for their campaigns increased from 2000 to  2002, it was too soon to determine the extent to which the five goals of  Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public financing programs were being met. We  concluded that with only two elections from which to observe legislative  races, limited data were available to draw causal linkages to changes, if  any, involving electoral competition, voter choice, campaign spending,  interest group influence and citizens\u2019 confidence in government, and voter  participation.", "Senate Report 110-129 directed GAO to revisit and update our 2003 report  to account for data and experiences of the past two election cycles. This  report    provides data related to candidate program participation, including the  number of legislative candidates who chose to use public funds to run  for seats in the 2000 through 2008 elections in Maine and Arizona and  the number of races in which at least one legislative candidate ran an  election campaign with public funds; and    describes statistically measurable changes and perceptions of changes  in the 2000 through 2008 state legislative elections in five goals of  Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public financing programs\u2014(1) increasing  electoral competition; (2) increasing voter choice; (3) curbing  increases in the cost of campaigns; (4) reducing the influence of  interest groups and enhance citizens\u2019 confidence in government; and  (5) increasing voter participation\u2014and the extent to which these  changes could be attributed to the programs.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed relevant studies and reports and  interviewed researchers regarding state elections and campaign finance  reform in the United States generally, as well as in Maine and Arizona  specifically. A listing of the research and reports we reviewed is included  in the bibliography. We reviewed pertinent statutes and documents, such  as candidate handbooks and annual reports describing the Maine and  Arizona public financing programs and interviewed state election officials  responsible for administering the two programs. Through our discussions  with Maine and Arizona state officials and our review of changes to the  public financing statutes in both states from 2002 through 2009, we  determined that the five goals of the public financing programs, as set out  in our 2003 report, have not changed. In addition, based on our review of  the literature and discussions with researchers, we concluded that there is  little agreement on a standardized methodology to measure these five  goals. Thus, we used many of the same measures as those in our 2003  report.", "We obtained data from Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s Offices of the Secretary of  State, the agencies responsible for supervising and administering state  elections and activities, such as certifying state candidates for the ballot  and tabulating official election results. We also obtained data from Maine\u2019s  Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices and Arizona\u2019s  Citizens Clean Elections Commission, the agencies responsible for  administering the respective state\u2019s public financing program. For both  states we analyzed, to the extent possible, available statistical data about  the 1996 through 2008 legislative elections, including data related to  candidate program participation, election outcomes, voter choice, and  reported campaign spending. To assess the reliability of both states\u2019 data,  we (1) performed electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness; (2) reviewed related documentation such as system flow  charts; and (3) worked closely with state officials to identify any data  problems. When we found discrepancies, such as nonpopulated fields, we  brought this to the states\u2019 attention and worked with state officials to  correct the discrepancies before conducting our analyses. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.  Although the public financing programs in Maine and Arizona cover both  legislative and certain statewide offices, we limited the scope of our  review to legislative candidates, since most of the elections for certain  statewide offices occurred every 4 years and sufficient data would not  have been available to conduct our analyses and draw conclusions.", "To assess changes in electoral competition in Maine and Arizona, we  examined changes in three measures of electoral competition in state  legislative races by comparing the two elections before public financing  became available (1996 and 1998) to the five elections after public  financing became available (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008). The three  measures we used were: (1) winner\u2019s margin of victory, which refers to the  difference between the percentage of the vote going to the winning  candidate and the first runner up; (2) percentages of contested races,  which refers to the percentage of all races with at least one more  candidate running than the number of positions available; and (3)  incumbent reelection rates, which refers to the percentage of incumbents  who were reelected in races that were contested.", "In addition to analyzing changes in electoral competition over time in  Maine and Arizona, we analyzed general election data from 1996 through  2008 from four comparison states that did not offer public financing  programs for legislative candidates to determine if changes identified in  Maine and Arizona were similar to or different from changes observed in  the four comparison states during the same time period. We selected these  four states (Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, and South Dakota) based on  a number of factors, including geographic proximity to Maine or Arizona;  structure of the state legislature, such as legislative districts with more  than one representative; demographic characteristics; the presence of  legislative term limits; and data availability. Specifically, we used two  types of multivariate statistical models, fixed effects regression and  hierarchical loglinear models, to evaluate how the competitiveness of  races in Maine and Arizona changed after the implementation of public  financing programs. Additional information about the two types of  models we used to evaluate electoral competition, as well as other data  and analyses related to the extent to which five goals of Maine\u2019s and  Arizona\u2019s public financing programs were met can be viewed in an  electronic supplement we are issuing concurrent with this report\u2014 GAO-10-391SP.", "With regard to the campaign spending goal, we obtained available  campaign spending and independent expenditure data from Maine and  Arizona. We found that Maine\u2019s campaign spending data for the 1996  through 2008 election cycles and independent expenditure data for the  2000 through 2008 election cycles were sufficiently reliable. Due, in part,  to several upgrades to Arizona\u2019s campaign finance data systems over the  time period reviewed, we found that Arizona\u2019s campaign spending data for  the 2000 through 2008 election cycles and independent expenditure data  for the 2008 election cycle were sufficiently reliable with limitations as  noted. For example, up to the 2008 election, Arizona\u2019s campaign spending  database did not include precise data to identify and link each candidate  to his or her campaign finance committee(s), the entities responsible for  reporting candidates\u2019 contributions and spending. Further, the  candidates\u2019 campaign finance committees can span several election cycles  and include spending reports for races for the same or different offices,  such as House or Senate. Thus, to the extent possible, we matched  candidates and candidate campaign finance committees through  electronic and manual means, identified and calculated relevant candidate  spending transactions, and sorted the data by election cycle dates.  Further, although the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office collected  independent expenditure data from 2000 through 2008, it did not collect  data on the intended beneficiaries of independent expenditures until the  2008 election cycle. Therefore, we limited our analysis of independent  expenditures to the 2008 elections. We worked with state officials  responsible for the public financing programs and campaign finance data  systems in Maine and Arizona to develop our methodology.", "To obtain perspectives on the effects of public financing on interest group  influence and citizens\u2019 confidence in government, we interviewed a  nonprobability sample of 22 candidates who ran in the 2008 state  legislative races in Maine and Arizona. We selected these candidates to  reflect a range of those with different political party affiliations, those who  did and did not use public financing, and those who won or lost in primary  and general elections in Maine and Arizona. Further, we interviewed a  nonprobability sample of 10 interest group representatives in Maine and  Arizona, which we selected to reflect a variety of industry sectors, such as  communications or construction, and range of contributions made to  political campaigns. While the results of these interviews cannot be  generalized to reflect the views of all candidates or all interest groups in  Maine and Arizona, the interviews provided us with an overview of the  range of perspectives on the effects of the public financing programs. We  also contracted with professional pollsters to survey representative  samples of voting-age citizens in Maine and Arizona about their views of  interest group influence and confidence in government.", "To examine changes in voter participation, we reviewed information about  voter turnout data from the Census Bureau, Federal Election Commission,  United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the American  National Election Studies, and other resources, including two repositories  of elections data and information\u2014George Mason University\u2019s United  States Election Project (the Elections Project) and the Center for the  Study of the American Electorate. We identified these sources through  our review of the literature and through discussions with researchers. To  determine the extent to which changes in voter participation could be  assessed over time, we reviewed documentation and research on these  potential data sources, including information on collection and  measurement of the voting-age or voting-eligible population and the type  of turnout recorded. Finally, we examined data and methodologies for  measuring changes in voter turnout and other forms of participation to  determine whether changes in participation could be analyzed at the state  level. We found that the different data sources required to calculate  changes in turnout are not always comparable across sources and over  time because of differences in the way that data are collected or changes  in how turnout is defined. As such, there was no need to conduct  electronic testing to further assess the reliability of the data for our  purposes. This does not indicate that the data are unreliable for other  purposes. We also discussed voter turnout calculations with state officials  and researchers. Appendix I presents more details about our objectives,  scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2008 through May  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Certified  candidates, among other things must (1) forgo self-financing and all  private contributions, except for a limited amount of \u201cseed money\u201d prior  to certification, and (2) demonstrate citizen support by collecting a  minimum number of $5 contributions from registered voters. After being  certified by the state as having met qualifying requirements, participating  candidates receive initial distributions (predetermined amounts) of public  funding and are also eligible for additional matching funds from public  moneys based on spending by or for privately funded opponents. These  matching funds, up to predetermined limits, are given to participating  candidates when an opposing nonparticipating candidate exceeds the  initial distribution of funds provided to the participating candidate during  the primary or general election. Table 1 shows the public funding  available to each participating candidate in the 2008 election cycle in  Maine and Arizona. The calculation to assess whether matching funds for  participating candidates are triggered is to include reported independent  expenditures that, in general, are made on behalf of a nonparticipating or  another participating candidate in the race by individuals, corporations,  political action committees, or other groups.", "Various revenue sources are used to support the public financing  programs. In Maine, state appropriations were the largest funding source,  contributing 82 percent of total revenue in 2008. In Arizona, a surcharge on  civil and criminal fines and penalties was the largest funding source,  accounting for 59 percent of total revenue in 2008. In addition, funding for  public financing programs comes from state income tax checkoff  donations in both states. During the 2008 primary and general elections,  participating legislative candidates in Maine received a total of almost $3  million, and participating legislative candidates in Arizona received a total  of about $6 million.", "Before the passage of Maine\u2019s Act in 1996 and Arizona\u2019s Act in 1998,  political campaigns in the two states were financed completely with  private funds. There were no limitations placed on expenditures by  candidates from their personal wealth. Under Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public  financing laws, nonparticipating candidates are not limited in the amount  they may spend from their personal financial resources on their own  campaigns. While not faced with limits on the total amount of money that  they can raise or spend, nonparticipating candidates are subject to certain  limitations on the amount that an individual, corporation, or political  committee can contribute to the campaigns of nonparticipating  candidates, and nonparticipating candidates have additional reporting  requirements. For example, in Maine, a nonparticipating candidate in the  2008 legislative elections could accept individual contributions of up to  $250 per election, and in Arizona, a nonparticipating candidate could  accept individual contributions of up to $488 per election. In both states,  nonparticipating candidates must file certain reports with the state when  their campaigns exceed certain statutory thresholds relating to, for  example, expenditures or contributions.

For example, research on the effects of  state public financing programs in general has been limited because the  programs vary widely and were implemented at different times, hindering  comparability. With regard to Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public financing  programs, research tends to be limited to a single state or a limited  number of years, or produced by groups that support or oppose public  financing. Thus, in revisiting our 2003 report, we describe the five goals  of the public financing programs and include a discussion of proponents\u2019  and opponents\u2019 views on the effects of these programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increase Electoral Competition", "paragraphs": ["One goal of the public financing programs in Maine and Arizona was to  increase electoral competition, which refers to the level of competition for  elected positions as demonstrated by whether races were contested (that  is, involved more candidates than available positions) and by the  percentage of the vote candidates received. For example, levels of  electoral competition can vary from none at all in the case of an  uncontested race, in which the sole candidate receives 100 percent of the  vote (less any write-in votes), to an election in which several candidates  vie competitively for a position, each winning a significant portion of the  votes. Proponents of public financing for campaigns contended that public  funding could increase electoral competition by allowing candidates,  especially candidates challenging incumbents, to overcome the financial  hurdles that would otherwise prevent them from entering a race. Further,  proponents argued that public financing promotes competition by giving  more candidates the opportunity to effectively communicate with the  electorate once they have entered the race. Additionally, some proponents  asserted that increasing the pool of challengers would also increase the  diversity of the candidate pool and consequently make some races more  competitive by offering candidates that appeal to a broader range of  voters.

The intended outcome of this approach was to lower  the cost of running for office by reducing and capping the amount of  money available for campaign spending.

Opponents further asserted there is no  evidence that government-financed campaigns attract more worthy  candidates than do the traditional system or that, once elected, the  publicly financed candidates vote any differently as legislators than do  traditionally financed candidates. Moreover, some opponents argued that  interest groups can still assert influence on the political process through  means other than contributing directly to candidates\u2019 political campaigns,  such as contributions to political parties, independent expenditures on  behalf of or for opposing candidates, as well as providing nonfinancial  resources such as mobilizing members to volunteer for grassroots  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase Voter Participation", "paragraphs": ["Increasing voter participation, as indicated by increases in voter turnout,  was the fifth goal of public financing programs in Maine and Arizona.

While independent  expenditures decreased somewhat (by about $20,000) in the 2008 election  compared to the 2006 election, the total amount remained high.", "Average candidate spending in Arizona legislative races has generally  increased in the five elections under the public financing program;  however, we were not able to compare these spending levels to those in  the period before public financing became available. As shown in figure  16, average candidate spending in Arizona House races has increased in  each subsequent election since 2000, with the exception of 2006, when  average spending declined about $1,000 from the previous election. In  2008, average spending increased to $48,700, a $13,000 increase from 2006.  In Arizona Senate races, average candidate spending has been increasing  following the 2002 election, after a decrease of about $10,000 in the 2002  election.", "State officials told us that the way candidates have spent campaign funds  has changed since the implementation of the public financing program.  For example, they said that candidates have coordinated their campaigns  with other candidates in their district to maximize their campaign  resources. For example, two Republican candidates for the Arizona House  of Representatives may pool their campaign funds to send out one mailing  in support of both candidates, rather than each candidate sending out  separate mailings.", "Average spending by challengers and incumbents fluctuated from year to  year, with challengers spending more in some elections, and incumbents  spending more in other elections in both Arizona House and Senate races,  as shown in figure 17.", "Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between average  incumbent and average challenger spending in either Arizona House or  Senate races in the five elections under public financing. Further, spending  by open race challengers in House races was not significantly different  from spending by incumbents or challengers after public financing became  available. However, in each of the five elections examined, average  spending by open race challengers in Arizona Senate races was higher  than average spending by incumbents or challengers, and overall, open  race challengers spent between $14,600 and $16,200 more on average than  either incumbents or challengers.", "Participating candidates spent more on average than nonparticipating  candidates in Arizona House, while in Senate races nonparticipating  candidates spent more on average than participating candidates in some  years and less in others, as shown in figure 18. Participating candidates in  Arizona House races spent $44,500 on average, compared to  nonparticipating candidates, who spent an average of $29,700 in the five  elections under the public financing program. In Arizona Senate races,  there was not a statistically significant difference between average  spending by participating and nonparticipating candidates in the five  elections examined. State officials said that the amount spent on  independent expenditures has increased since 2000. Therefore, they stated  that matching funds distributed to participating candidates for  independent expenditures may account for some of the difference in  average spending by participating and nonparticipating candidates.", "According to state officials, independent expenditures have increased in  Arizona legislative elections under the public financing program. In 2008,  independent expenditures in Arizona House and Senate races totaled  $2,170,000. While complete data on independent expenditures specifically  in legislative elections were not available for elections prior to 2008, state  officials told us that independent expenditures have increased.", "Furthermore, in our 2003 report, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections  Commission identified independent expenditures in the 1998, 2000, and  2002 legislative and statewide elections. Independent expenditures in  both legislative and statewide races totaled $102,400 in 1998, $46,700 in  2000, and $3,074,300 in 2002.

In Maine, about half of the candidates (5 of 11) we interviewed said that  campaign spending increased in the 2008 election as a result of the public  financing program. Candidates provided a number of reasons for the  perceived increase in campaign spending. For example, one candidate said  that campaign spending increased because some participating candidates  spent more than they would have if they had raised private funds for their  campaigns. Another candidate noted that the amount of money spent by  participating candidates has increased in some races because they  received additional matching funds for independent expenditures made by  interest groups. Spending by nonparticipating candidates may have  increased in some cases as well, according to one candidate, since the  presence of a participating candidate in the race forces nonparticipating  candidates to take the election more seriously and spend more on their  campaigns than they would have otherwise. However, 3 other candidates  we interviewed in Maine contended that campaign spending had  decreased. For example, one candidate noted that spending had decreased  because of the spending cap placed on participating candidates. Three  candidates felt that spending in Maine legislative races had neither  increased nor decreased as a result of the public financing program. In one  candidate\u2019s view, contribution limits have had a greater influence on  spending than the public financing program.", "In Arizona, the majority of candidates (7 of 11) we interviewed believed  that candidate spending increased in the 2008 election as a result of the  public financing program. One nonparticipating candidate told us that,  because of the matching funds provision of the public financing program,  in 2008 he spent almost double the amount than he spent in any previous  campaign in order to get out his message and outspend his participating  opponent. Another candidate commented that the increase in independent  expenditures has driven up campaign spending by triggering additional  matching funds for participating candidates. On the other hand, 3  candidates felt that the public financing program led to a decrease in  campaign spending in the 2008 election. One participating candidate  explained that she could have raised more money traditionally than she  received from the public financing program. One candidate indicated that  spending neither increased nor decreased.", "Regarding interest groups in Maine, two of the five representatives stated  that candidate spending increased. One of these representatives  commented that there has been an increase in money spent by candidates  because there is more access to money and the races are more  competitive. Further, this representative stated that the public financing  program gives challengers an opportunity to level the playing field when  running against incumbents. Participating candidates who would  otherwise not be able to raise enough private money can run a well- financed campaign using public funds and have an opportunity to present  their issues for debate in the race. On the other hand, three of the five  interest group representatives stated that candidate spending neither  increased nor decreased in the 2008 election as a result of the public  financing program. One of these representatives commented that the  amount of money spent by candidates has not changed because limits are  set by the legislature. However, this representative opined that the amount  of money spent on behalf of the candidates in the form of independent  expenditures had increased dramatically and consistently. He went on to  say that the public financing program is reducing the disparity between the  candidates who can raise the money and those candidates who cannot  raise the money and that a candidate who is not serious can receive as  much money as a serious candidate.", "In Arizona, four of the five interest group representatives believed that  candidate spending increased as a result of the public financing program.  For example, one of these representatives said that the public financing  program has moved money from the candidates to independent  expenditures, and that political parties are playing a significant role in this  shift. Another interest group representative believed that candidate  spending increased but was unsure if this increase was due to the public  financing program, noting that increased campaign spending could be  attributed to more competitive races or the rise in the cost of campaign  materials due to inflation. Further, he noted that a pattern has emerged in  which candidates run as participating candidates during their first  election, and after being elected run subsequently as nonparticipating  candidates. These legislators have name recognition and can raise the  money required to run their campaigns and can also help other candidates  get elected. On the other hand, one of the five representatives believed  that campaign spending had neither increased nor decreased and that  money has been redirected from the candidate campaigns to independent  expenditures. He did not believe that his organization was spending any  less money on campaigns.", "In general, candidates and interest group representatives in Maine and  Arizona reported that equality in financial resources among candidates  had increased in the 2008 election as a result of the public financing  programs. In Maine, the majority of the candidates interviewed (7 of 11)  said that equality in financial resources among candidates increased as a  result of the public financing program. Two candidates commented that  candidates from different political parties compete on a roughly equal  playing field under the public financing program. Another Maine candidate  said that both nonparticipating and participating candidates spend about  the same amount on their campaigns. However, 2 candidates we  interviewed said that equality in financial resources had decreased as a  result of the public financing program. According to one candidate, more  money may be spent by political action committees than by candidates in a  race, which can reduce equality. One nonparticipating candidate  responded that the public financing program increased equality in  financial resources among participating candidates, but decreased equality  in financial resources among nonparticipating candidates, and 1 candidate  was not sure how the public financing program had influenced equality in  financial resources among candidates.", "In Arizona, about half of the candidates (6 of 11) thought equality in  financial resources among candidates had increased.

On the other hand, 1 candidate said that equality  in financial resources had decreased, and commented that he was  outspent by his participating opponents by a ratio of 13 to 1. Three of the  11 candidates we interviewed said that the equality in financial resources  neither increased nor decreased as a result of the public financing  program. For example, one candidate told us that incumbents continue to  outspend their opponents and that nonparticipating candidates have  developed strategies to maximize their financial advantage, such as raising  funds at the end of the campaign so participating candidates have little  time to spend matching funds. The remaining candidate was not sure  about the change in resource equality.", "Seven of the 10 interest group representatives we interviewed in Maine (3  of 5) and Arizona (4 of 5) said that equality in financial resources among  candidates as a result of the public financing programs had increased. For  example, an Arizona interest group representative commented that the  public financing law holds the candidates\u2019 financial resources even. On the  other hand, 1 of the 5 representatives from Maine stated that equality in  financial resources among candidates decreased and commented that  since monetary limits are set statutorily, it is the independent expenditures  that skew the financial resources among candidates. Finally, 2 of the 10  representatives, 1 from Maine and 1 from Arizona, believed that equality in  financial resources neither increased nor decreased, while 1 of these  representatives further commented that even though financial resources  stayed the same, some nonparticipating candidates had a financial  advantage because they asked for larger donations from interest groups.", "Candidates\u2019 and Interest Group Representatives\u2019 Views on  Independent Expenditures  Independent expenditures were of varying importance in the races of the  candidates we spoke with. The majority of the Maine legislative candidates  we interviewed (7 of the 11) reported that independent expenditures were  of little or no importance to the outcome of their races in the 2008  election. One candidate explained that no independent expenditures were  made on his behalf because he was perceived to be the likely winner.  However, 2 candidates we interviewed said that independent expenditures  were moderately important, and 2 candidates said that independent  expenditures were extremely or very important to the outcome of their  races in the 2008 election. The candidates who had independent  expenditures made in their races shared their experiences with us. One  candidate said an independent expenditure made on his behalf could have  possibly hurt his campaign since the expenditure was for a mailer that was  poorly conceived and included a photograph of him that was of low  quality. Another candidate who participated in the public financing  program in Maine said that she and her participating opponent received  large amounts of matching funds in response to independent expenditures  made by business, trucking, state police, and equal rights groups that went  towards mailings, television ads, and newspapers ads. However, the  candidate thought that other factors played a greater role in the outcome  of her election.", "In Arizona, independent expenditures reportedly played an important role  in the outcome of 6 of the 11 candidates\u2019 races, with 5 candidates saying  that independent expenditures were moderately important and 1  candidate reporting that independent expenditures were extremely  important. One of these candidates said that groups made independent  expenditures on behalf of his opponent to produce a number of mailers as  well as billboards and television commercials that hurt his election  campaign by shifting the focus away from the issues that he had  concentrated on. Another candidate said that groups made independent  expenditures opposing her near the end of her 2008 campaign; however,  since she participated in the public financing program, she received  matching funds and was able to respond. On the other hand, 5 candidates  reported that independent expenditures were of little or of no importance  in the outcome of their races. One candidate said that while there was a lot  of money spent on independent expenditures in his race, the independent  expenditures did not play a big role in the outcome of the election since  roughly the same amount was spent on behalf of both him and his  opponent. Another candidate explained that since she was an incumbent  and her reelection was secure, not much was spent on independent  expenditures in her race.", "Eight of the 10 interest group representatives in Maine (5 of 5) and Arizona  (3 of 5) we interviewed said their groups made independent expenditures  in support of candidates in the 2008 elections; although, the  representatives had varying views about the influence the expenditures  had on the outcome of the races. All 5 Maine interest group  representatives made independent expenditures in the 2008 elections, and  all expenditures included mailers in support of candidates. Three of these  5 Maine representatives were not sure how much influence the  expenditures had on the outcome of the elections. On the other hand, the  remaining 2 representatives had different views. One Maine representative  believed that her group\u2019s expenditures were effective in getting the  candidate\u2019s message out to the voters. Finally, another Maine  representative, who made several independent expenditures, said his  experience was mixed, and the candidates he made independent  expenditures on behalf of lost in more cases than they won. In Arizona, 3  of the 5 interest groups made independent expenditures. Two of these  representatives said the expenditures were for mailers in support of  candidates and believed that they were beneficial because the candidates  won.

Issue advocacy spending is  often viewed as those forms of media advertisements that do not expressly  advocate for or against a clearly identified political candidate. For  example, such issue advocacy ads do not use terms like \u201cvote for,\u201d \u201cvote  against,\u201d or \u201creelect.\u201d In general, courts have not upheld campaign finance  law regulation of issue advocacy spending upon the reasoning that the  rationales offered to support such regulations did not justify the  infringement upon constitutional free speech protections. According to  state officials in Maine and Arizona, neither Maine nor Arizona track issue  advocacy spending.", "In Maine, 7 of the 11 candidates we interviewed reported that issue  advocacy advertisements were of little or of no importance to the outcome  of their races. One of these candidates explained that his race was not  targeted by issue advocacy ads because he was expected to win and his  opponent was not perceived to be very competitive. Another candidate we  interviewed had a negative issue advocacy ad made in his race, but he did  not think it affected the outcome of the election. The candidate told us the  issue advocacy ad listed the tax increases he voted for alongside a smiling  picture of him; however, according to the candidate, the ad only told half  of the story, since the bill that contained the tax increases was revenue  neutral and raised some taxes while lowering others. In contrast, 4 of the  11 candidates we interviewed said that issue advocacy was moderately  important in their 2008 races.

One of these  candidates explained that participating candidates are more empowered  to serve as they see fit and are less willing to listen to political party  leadership. On the other hand, a different candidate said that the elected  officials are less likely to serve free of influence by specific individuals or  groups as a result of the public financing program. The candidate  explained that under the public financing program, lobbyists and special  interest groups have focused less on individual candidates, and more on  winning favor with the Democratic and Republican party leadership.

She explained that interest groups  approach candidates with questionnaires and ask them to take pledges on  different policy issues and also send their members voter guides and  scorecards that rate candidates.

One of these three  representatives stated that interest groups are one step removed from the  candidate because to make independent expenditures they cannot directly  coordinate with the candidate. As a result, this representative further  stated that interest groups have established stronger relationships with  political parties.

Further, she stated that for participating candidates, the only  thing an interest group can do is give an endorsement. In turn,  participating candidates use these endorsements in their campaign  advertisements. On the other hand, one representative said that there has  not been much difference in campaign tactics since public financing has  been available, and another representative said that the same tactics, such  as direct mailers and going door-to-door for monetary solicitations, have  been used.", "Interest group representatives in Arizona similarly reported that public  financing has changed campaign strategies. For example, one  representative said that there is an increased reliance on volunteer  activities, especially for statewide races.

Volunteer  activities, such as handing out flyers door-to-door or working phone banks  to call voters, have become increasingly important. Another representative  stated that since more candidates are participating in the public financing  program and cannot accept direct contributions, there is more money  available to nonparticipating candidates. He has noticed that  nonparticipating candidates are asking for more money from interest  groups than before public financing. According to another representative,  campaign strategies are evolving. For example, a recent strategy has been  the teaming of public and private candidates to maximize their resources  such as on mailers.", "Candidates and interest group representatives in Maine and Arizona also  commented on how the public financing program has changed the timing  of some campaign activities. In Maine, three candidates said that  candidates or interest groups are changing the timing of spending in order  to minimize either the amount or the effectiveness of matching funds  distributed to opponent participating candidates. For example, one  participating candidate told us that supporters of his opponent distributed  mailers right before the date when communications that support or  oppose clearly identified candidates are presumed to be independent  expenditures and trigger matching funds for participating opponents.  Another strategy, according to one candidate, is for nonparticipating  candidates or interest groups to spend money in the days immediately  before the election, when participating candidates\u2019 ability to use the  money is effectively restricted due to time constraints. In response, one  candidate told us that participating candidates have television, radio, or  other advertisements ready in case they receive additional matching funds  that need to be spent quickly.", "In Arizona, five candidates said that the tactics surrounding the timing of  campaign spending have changed since the implementation of the public  financing program. For example, one candidate said that the start of the  campaign season is determined by the date on which spending by or on  behalf of candidates triggers matching funds. In addition, one candidate  explained that nonparticipating candidates have changed the timing of  fundraising efforts, so that more funds are raised at the end of campaign,  when it is more difficult for participating candidates to spend matching  funds effectively. As in Maine, one candidate in Arizona said that  participating candidates have responded to this tactic by preparing  advertisements ahead of time, just in case they receive additional  matching funds.", "Interest group representatives in Maine and Arizona also commented on  how the public financing program has changed the timing of some  campaign activities. In Maine, one interest group representative stated that  candidates were strategically timing their advertisements to gain a  competitive advantage. For example, candidates are thinking about from  whom to get their seed money, and when to qualify for the money. In  addition, usually, incumbents have an advantage because they can send  out newsletters to constituents close to the election without triggering  matching funds. This representative stated the biggest consideration  regarding campaign strategies is how and when matching funds will be  triggered by the independent expenditures. She said that independent  expenditures are made in the last 5 days before an election on the  assumption that the opposing participating candidate cannot make  effective use of the matching funds. In Arizona, one interest group  representative said that generally nonparticipating candidates control the  timing of their fundraising and spending, and participating candidates  make plans to spend matching funds to counter last-minute attack  advertisements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations and Differences in Measurement Hinder Analysis of Changes in Voter Participation in Maine and Arizona", "paragraphs": ["While increasing voter participation, as indicated by increases in voter  turnout, was a goal of public financing programs in Maine and Arizona,  limitations in voter turnout data, differences in how voter turnout is  measured across states and data sources, and challenges isolating the  effect of public financing programs on voter turnout hindered the analysis  of changes over time.", "Voter turnout is typically calculated as a percentage of the voting-age  population (VAP) or voting-eligible population (VEP) who cast a ballot in  an election. The calculation of changes in voter turnout over time  depends less on the specific data used for the numerator and denominator  than it does on the consistency of how these data were collected over time  and the use of comparable time frames and types of elections (e.g.,  presidential and congressional races). However, data reporting issues,  changes in measurement, and other factors affect the calculation of voter  turnout estimates.", "With respect to data limitations, data on voter turnout are not consistent  across states or data sources. Depending on the source, the numerator of  the turnout calculation (i.e., who cast a ballot in an election) may include  the total number of approved ballots cast, the number of ballots counted  whether or not they were approved, self-reports of voting information, or  the number of ballots cast for the highest office on a ticket, such as for  president. For example, official voter turnout data compiled by the  Election Assistance Commission (EAC) are based on surveys of states;  however, states vary in their policies, for example, related to voter  registration, as well as in which turnout statistics they report. Some  states report voter turnout as the highest number of ballots counted,  whereas other states report voter turnout as the number of votes for the  highest office. Further, which specific statistic is reported is not  necessarily constant over time. For example, EAC data prior to 2004  provide voter turnout based on the number of votes for the highest office  on the ticket. Beginning in 2004, EAC reported total ballots cast, counted,  or total voters participating for Maine and Arizona, but has not  consistently reported the vote for highest office in these states. The  Federal Election Commission (FEC) also provides information on turnout  for federal elections, but the specific highest office in a given state and  year could be for a state office such as governor that would not be  reported along with federal election results.", "Other voter turnout statistics, including those based on surveys of U.S.  residents as part of the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey (CPS)  or the American National Election Studies, rely on respondents\u2019 self- reports of voting behavior. However, self-reports of voting behavior are  subject to overreporting because many respondents perceive that voting is  a socially desirable behavior. Additionally, estimates of voting based on  self-reports can fluctuate depending on the wording of the question used  in a survey. Further, survey results are generalizable only to the population  covered by the survey, or sampling, frame. The CPS sampling frame  excludes individuals living in group quarters such as nursing homes,  meaning that estimates of turnout based on CPS data would not include  turnout among these individuals. Data on other forms of voter  participation, such as volunteering for a campaign, contacting media,  donating money, fundraising, and contacting representatives on issues of  concern, are limited because they are rarely collected with the express  purpose of making state-level estimates, and surveys with this information  are not usually designed in a manner to allow comparison across  individual states over many years.", "In addition, measurements of the denominator of voter turnout differ with  respect to whether citizenship or other factors that affect eligibility are  taken into account. Turnout estimates produced by the Census Bureau  have historically used the VAP as a denominator, which includes those  U.S. residents age 18 and older. In theory, a more accurate estimate of  voter turnout can be made by adjusting VAP to account for the statutory  ability of individuals to vote, in particular by removing noncitizens from  the estimate. This is particularly important at the state level because the  proportion of noncitizens varies across states and over time. However,  the practical application of such adjustments may be complicated by the  timing of available data relative to the date of the election or by other data  limitations. For example, although the Census Bureau began to produce  estimates of a citizen VAP for EAC in 2004, the estimate is calculated as of  July 1 of the election year and does not adjust for population changes that  may occur between July and the time of the election. Other alternatives for  adjusting VAP for citizenship include calculating estimates between  decennial Census surveys. The Census data currently provided to EAC  include adjustments for citizenship based on another alternative, the  American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS uses a different sampling  frame than other surveys used to adjust for citizenship, such as the CPS,  and has slightly different estimates of citizenship. In addition to  adjustments for citizenship, researchers have also adjusted VAP to  account for other factors that affect eligibility to vote, including state  felony disenfranchisement laws, and overseas voting, among others. To  make these adjustments, researchers use alternative data sources such as  information on the population in prison from the Department of Justice\u2019s  Bureau of Justice Statistics; however, these adjustments cannot always be  applied similarly because of differences across states over time (such as in  the proportion of probationers that are felons).", "Lastly, changes in voter turnout cannot be attributed directly to public  funding as there are a number of factors that affect voter turnout. Voter  turnout can be affected by demographic factors such as age, income, how  recently a person registered to vote, and previous voting history. For  example, studies have shown that much higher percentages of older  Americans vote than do younger citizens. Voter turnout can also be  influenced by a broad range of contextual factors, including the candidates  and their messages, mobilization efforts, media interest, campaign  spending, and negative advertising. These potential confounding factors,  along with aforementioned difficulties in calculating precise and  consistent turnout information at the state level, prevented us from  quantifying the extent to which, if any, Maine\u2019s and Arizona\u2019s public  financing programs affected these states\u2019 voter turnout.

In our  interviews, we asked similar, but not identical, questions to those from our  2003 report.
