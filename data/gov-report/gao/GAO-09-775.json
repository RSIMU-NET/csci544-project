In an effort to expedite the exchange of electronic  health information between the two departments, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 included provisions directing DOD  and VA to jointly develop and implement, by September 30, 2009, fully  interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities that are  compliant with applicable federal interoperability standards. Such systems  and capabilities are important for making patient information more readily  available to health care providers in both departments, reducing medical  errors, and streamlining administrative functions.

Historically, patient health information has been  scattered across paper records kept by many different caregivers in many  different locations, making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a  patient\u2019s health information at the time of care. Lacking access to these  critical data, a clinician may be challenged to make the most informed  decisions on treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at  greater risk. The use of electronic health records can help provide this  access and improve clinical decisions.", "As we have previously noted, electronic health records are particularly  crucial for optimizing the health care provided to military personnel and  veterans. While in military status and later as veterans, many DOD and VA  patients tend to be highly mobile and have health records residing at  multiple medical facilities within and outside the United States. Making  such records electronic can help ensure that complete health care  information is available for most military service members and veterans at  the time and place of care, no matter where it originates.", "Key to making health care information electronically available is  interoperability\u2014that is, the ability to share data among health care  providers. Interoperability enables different information systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information that has  been exchanged. This capability is important because it allows patients\u2019  electronic health information to move with them from provider to  provider, regardless of where the information originated. If electronic  health records conform to interoperability standards, they can be created,  managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff across more  than one health care organization, thus providing patients and their  caregivers the necessary information required for optimal care. Paper- based health records\u2014if available\u2014also provide necessary information,  but unlike electronic health records, do not provide decision support  capabilities, such as automatic alerts about a particular patient\u2019s health, or  other advantages of automation.", "Interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon standards to ensure  that information can be shared and used. In the health IT field, standards  may govern areas ranging from technical issues, such as file types and  interchange systems, to content issues, such as medical terminology. DOD  and VA have agreed upon numerous common standards that allow them to  share health data. They have also participated in numerous standards- setting organizations tasked to reach consensus on the definition and use  of standards. For example, DOD and VA officials serve as members and  are actively working on several committees and groups within the  Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. The panel identifies  and harmonizes competing standards and develops interoperability  specifications that are needed for implementing the standards.", "Interoperability can be achieved at different levels. At the highest level,  electronic data are computable (that is, in a format that a computer can  understand and act on to, for example, provide alerts to clinicians on drug  allergies). At a lower level, electronic data are structured and viewable,  but not computable. The value of data at this level is that they are  structured so that data of interest to users are easier to find. At still a  lower level, electronic data are unstructured and viewable, but not  computable. With unstructured electronic data, a user would have to find  needed or relevant information by searching uncategorized data. Beyond  these, paper records also can be considered interoperable (at the lowest  level) because they allow data to be shared, read, and interpreted by  human beings. According to DOD and VA officials, not all data require the  same level of interoperability, nor is interoperability at the highest level  achievable in all cases. For example, unstructured, viewable data may be  sufficient for such narrative information as clinical notes. Figure 1 shows  the distinction between the various levels of interoperability and examples  of the types of data that can be shared at each level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and VA Have Been Working to Exchange Health Information for Over a Decade", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA have been working to exchange patient health information  electronically since 1998.

These gateways are to  support health record data exchange, thus facilitating future growth in  data sharing. As of early July 2009, the departments reported that five  network gateways were operational and that data migration to two of the  operational gateways had begun. The departments believed these five  gateways satisfy the intent of the objective and will provide sufficient  capacity to support health information sharing between DOD and VA as of  September 2009.

Questions relate to a wide  range of personal health information, such as dietary habits, physical  exercise, and tobacco and alcohol use. Our review of the departments\u2019  project documentation determined that they have established the  capability for VA to view questions and answers from the questionnaires  collected by DOD at military treatment facilities; however, they have not  yet established the capability for VA to view information from DOD\u2019s  health assessment reporting tool.

If the departments complete the  development of results-oriented performance goals and measures for their  interoperability objectives, they will be better positioned to gauge their  progress toward achieving fully interoperable capabilities and improving  veterans\u2019 health care.", "Development of an integrated master schedule is also a key IT program  management activity, especially given the complexity of the departments\u2019  efforts to achieve full interoperability. According to DOD guidance, an  integrated master schedule should identify detailed project tasks and the  associated start, completion, and interim milestone dates; resource needs;  and relationships (e.g., sequence and dependencies) between tasks.", "While the program office has begun to develop an integrated master  schedule as required by its charter, the current version does not include  the attributes of an effective schedule. For example, the schedule included  limited information for three of the six interoperability objectives (i.e.,  refine social history data, share physical exam data, and expand  questionnaires and self-assessment tools). Specifically, the schedule  included the name of each objective and a completion date of September  30, 2009. However, the schedule contained no information on tasks to be  performed to meet the objectives. Further, the schedule did not reflect  start dates, resource needs, or relationships between tasks for any of the  six interoperability objectives. Without a complete and detailed integrated  master schedule, the departments are missing another key activity that  could be useful in determining their progress towards achieving full  interoperability.", "Similarly, development of a project plan is an important activity for IT  program management. Industry best practices and IT project management  principles stress the importance of sound planning for any project.  Inherent in such planning is the development and use of a project  management plan that describes, among other factors, the project\u2019s scope,  resources, and key milestones.

First, they stated that because it has taken longer than  anticipated to hire staff, the office has not been able to perform all of its  responsibilities. Second, the office\u2019s interim leadership and staff have  focused their efforts on providing to interested parties (e.g., federal  agencies and military organizations) briefings, presentations, and status  information on activities the office is undertaking to achieve  interoperability, in addition to participating in efforts to develop a strategy  for implementation of the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record, which the  President announced in April 2009. Finally, according to the officials, the  office waited until June 2009 to begin the process of developing metrics so  that they could do so in conjunction with the departments\u2019 annual update  to the joint strategic plan that is scheduled for completion in late 2009.  However, without metrics to monitor progress, a complete integrated  master schedule, and a project plan, the interagency program office\u2019s  ability to effectively provide oversight and management, including  meaningful progress reporting on the delivery of interoperable  capabilities, is jeopardized.
