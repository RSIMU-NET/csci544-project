Teacher quality can  be enhanced through a variety of activities, including training, recruitment,  and curriculum and assessment tools. In turn, these activities can  influence student learning and ultimately improve the global  competitiveness of the American workforce in a knowledge-based  economy. Prior GAO reports have noted that sustained coordination  among key federal education programs could enhance state efforts to  improve teacher quality.", "Federal efforts to improve teacher quality have led to the creation and  expansion of a variety of programs across the federal government.  However, there is no governmentwide strategy to minimize fragmentation,  overlap, or potential duplication among these many programs. Specifically,  GAO identified 82 distinct programs designed to help improve teacher  quality, either as a primary purpose or as an allowable activity,  administered across 10 federal agencies. Many of these programs share  similar goals. For example, 9 of the 82 programs support improving the  quality of teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics  (STEM subjects) and these programs alone are administered across the  Departments of Education, Defense, and Energy; the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Further,  in fiscal year 2010, the majority (53) of the programs GAO identified  supporting teacher quality improvements received $50 million or less in  funding and many have their own separate administrative processes.", "The proliferation of programs has resulted in fragmentation that can  frustrate agency efforts to administer programs in a comprehensive  manner, limit the ability to determine which programs are most cost  effective, and ultimately increase program costs. For example, eight  different Education offices administer over 60 of the federal programs  supporting teacher quality improvements, primarily in the form of  competitive grants. Education officials believe that federal programs have  failed to make significant progress in helping states close achievement  gaps between schools serving students from different socioeconomic  backgrounds, because, in part, federal programs that focus on teaching  and learning of specific subjects are too fragmented to help state and  district officials strengthen instruction and increase student achievement  in a comprehensive manner. While Education officials noted, and GAO  concurs, that a mixture of programs can target services to underserved  populations and yield strategic innovations, the current programs are not  structured in a way that enables educators and policymakers to identify  the most effective practices to replicate. According to Education officials,  it is typically not cost-effective to allocate the funds necessary to conduct  rigorous evaluations of small programs; therefore, small programs are  unlikely to be evaluated. Finally, it is more costly to administer multiple  separate federal programs because each program has its own policies,  applications, award competitions, reporting requirements, and, in some  cases, federal evaluations.", "While all of the 82 federal programs GAO identified support teacher quality  improvement efforts, several overlap in that they share more than one key  program characteristic. For example, teacher quality programs may  overlap if they share similar objectives, serve similar target groups, or fund  similar activities. GAO previously reported that 23 of the programs  administered by Education in fiscal year 2009 had improving teacher  quality as a specific focus, which suggested that there may be overlap  among these and other programs that have teacher quality improvements  as an allowable activity. When looking across a broader set of criteria,  GAO found that 14 of the programs administered by Education overlapped  with another program with regard to allowable activities as well as shared  objectives and target groups (see figure 1). For example, the Transition to  Teaching program and Teacher Quality Partnership Grant program can  both be used to fund similar teacher preparation activities through  institutions of higher education for the purpose of helping individuals from  non-teaching fields become qualified to teach.", "Although there is overlap among these programs, several factors make it  difficult to determine whether there is unnecessary duplication. First,  when similar teacher quality activities are funded through different  programs and delivered by different entities, some overlap can occur  unintentionally, but is not necessarily wasteful. For example, a local  school district could use funds from the Foreign Language Assistance  program to pay for professional development for a teacher who will be  implementing a new foreign language course, and this teacher could also  attend a summer seminar on best practices for teaching the foreign  language at a Language Resource Center. Second, by design, individual  teachers may benefit from federally funded training or financial support at  different points in their careers. Specifically, the teacher from this  example could also receive teacher certification through a program funded  by the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program. Further, both  broad and narrowly targeted programs exist simultaneously, meaning that  the same teacher who receives professional development funded from any  one or more of the above three programs might also receive professional  development that is funded through Title I, Part A of ESEA. The actual  content of these professional development activities may differ though,  since the primary goal of each program is different. In this example, it  would be difficult to know whether the absence of any one of these  programs would make a difference in terms of the teacher\u2019s ability to  teach the new language effectively.", "In past work, GAO and Education\u2019s Inspector General have concluded that  improved planning and coordination could help Education better leverage  expertise and limited resources, and to anticipate and develop options for  addressing potential problems among the multitude of programs it  administers. Generally, GAO has reported that uncoordinated program  efforts can waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program customers,  and limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort. However, given the  large number of teacher quality programs and the extent of overlap, it is  unlikely that improved coordination alone can fully mitigate the effects of  the fragmented and overlapping federal effort.", "In 2009, GAO recommended that the Secretary of Education work with  other agencies as appropriate to develop a coordinated approach for  routinely and systematically sharing information that can assist federal  programs, states, and local providers in achieving efficient service  delivery. Coordination is essential to ensure that programs do not work at  cross-purposes, do not repeat mistakes, and do not engage in wasteful  duplication of services. Education has established working groups to help  develop more effective collaboration across Education offices, and has  reached out to other agencies to develop a framework for sharing  information on some teacher quality activities, but it has noted that  coordination efforts do not always prove useful and cannot fully eliminate  barriers to program alignment, such as programs with differing definitions  for similar populations of grantees, which create an impediment to  coordination.", "Congress could help eliminate some of these barriers through legislation,  particularly through the pending reauthorization of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965 and other key education bills.  Specifically, to minimize any wasteful fragmentation and overlap among  teacher quality programs, Congress may choose either to eliminate  programs that are too small to evaluate cost-effectively or combine  programs serving similar target groups into a larger program. Education  has already proposed combining 38 programs into 11 programs in its  reauthorization proposal, which could allow the agency to dedicate a  higher portion of its administrative resources to monitoring programs for  results and providing technical assistance. Congress might also include  legislative provisions to help Education reduce fragmentation, such as by  giving broader discretion to the agency to move resources away from  certain programs. Congress could provide Education guidelines for  selecting these programs. For example, Congress could allow Education  discretion to consolidate programs with administrative costs exceeding a  certain threshold or failing to meet performance goals, into larger or more  successful programs. Finally, to the extent that overlapping programs  continue to be authorized, they could be better aligned with each other in  a way that allows for comparison and evaluation to ensure they are  complementary rather than duplicative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Information on Colocating Services and Consolidating Administrative Structures Could Promote Efficiencies Across Multiple Employment and Training Programs", "paragraphs": ["Federally funded employment and training programs play an important  role in helping job seekers obtain employment. In fiscal year 2009, 47  programs spent about $18 billion to provide services, such as job search  and job counseling, to program participants. Most of these programs are  administered by the Departments of Labor, Education, and HHS.", "GAO has previously issued reports on the number of programs that  provide employment and training services and overlap among them. In the  1990s, GAO issued a series of reports that identified program overlap and  possible areas of resulting inefficiencies. In 2000 and 2003, GAO identified  programs for which a key program goal was providing employment and  training assistance and tracked the increasing number of programs. GAO  recently updated information on these programs, found overlap among  them, and examined potential duplication among three selected large  programs\u2014HHS\u2019s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and  the Department of Labor\u2019s Employment Service and Workforce Investment  Act (WIA) Adult programs.", "Forty-four of the 47 federal employment and training programs GAO  identified, including those with broader missions such as multipurpose  block grants, overlap with at least one other program in that they provide  at least one similar service to a similar population. Some of these  overlapping programs serve multiple population groups. Others target  specific populations, most commonly Native Americans, veterans, and  youth. Even when programs overlap, they may have meaningful  differences in their eligibility criteria or objectives, or they may provide  similar types of services in different ways.", "GAO examined the TANF, Employment Service, and WIA Adult programs  for potential duplication and found they provide some of the same services  to the same population through separate administrative structures.  Although the extent to which individuals receive the same services from  these programs is unknown due to limited data, GAO found these  programs maintain parallel administrative structures to provide some of  the same services such as job search assistance to low-income individuals  (see figure 2). It should be noted that employment is only one aspect of the  TANF program, which also provides a wide range of other services,  including cash assistance. At the state level, the TANF program is typically  administered by the state human services or welfare agency, while the  Employment Service and WIA Adult programs are typically administered  by the state workforce agency and provided through one-stop centers.  Agency officials acknowledged that greater efficiencies could be achieved  in delivering services through these programs but said factors such as the  number of clients that any one-stop center can serve and one-stop centers\u2019  proximity to clients, particularly in rural areas, could warrant having  multiple entities provide the same services.", "Colocating services and consolidating administrative structures may  increase efficiencies and reduce costs, but implementation can be  challenging. Some states have colocated TANF employment and training  services in one-stop centers where Employment Service and WIA Adult  services are provided. Three states\u2014Florida, Texas, and Utah\u2014have gone  a step further by consolidating the agencies that administer these  programs, and state officials said this reduced costs and improved  services, but they could not provide a dollar figure for cost savings. States  and localities may face challenges to colocating services, such as limited  office space. In addition, consolidating administrative structures may be  time consuming and any cost savings may not be immediately realized.", "An obstacle to further progress in achieving greater administrative  efficiencies is that little information is available about the strategies and  results of such initiatives. In addition, little is known about the incentives  that states and localities have to undertake such initiatives and whether  additional incentives are needed.", "To facilitate further progress by states and localities in increasing  administrative efficiencies in employment and training programs, we  recommended in 2011 that the Secretaries of Labor and HHS work  together to develop and disseminate information that could inform such  efforts. This should include information about state initiatives to  consolidate program administrative structures and state and local efforts  to colocate new partners, such as TANF, at one-stop centers. Information  on these topics could address challenges faced, strategies employed,  results achieved, and remaining issues. As part of this effort, Labor and  HHS should examine the incentives for states and localities to undertake  such initiatives, and, as warranted, identify options for increasing such  incentives. Labor and HHS agreed they should develop and disseminate  this information. HHS noted that it lacks legal authority to mandate  increased TANF-WIA coordination or create incentives for such efforts.", "To the extent that colocating services and consolidating administrative  structures reduce administrative costs, funds could potentially be  available to serve more clients or for other purposes. For the TANF  program alone, GAO estimated that states spent about $160 million to  administer employment and training services in fiscal year 2009. According  to a Department of Labor official, the administrative costs for the WIA  Adult program were at least $56 million in program year 2009. Officials  told GAO they do not collect data on the administrative costs associated  with the Employment Service program, as they are not a separately  identifiable cost in the legislation. Labor officials said that, on average, the  agency spends about $4,000 for each WIA Adult participant who receives  training services. In periods of budgetary constraints, it is all the more  important that resources are used effectively. Depending on the reduction  in administrative costs associated with colocation and consolidation, these  funds could be used to train potentially hundreds or thousands of  additional individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Congress to Consider as it Addresses Fragmentation, Overlap, and Potential Duplication", "paragraphs": ["This Committee has authority over a wide range of programs intended to  help many of our neediest and most vulnerable citizens. With pending  reauthorizations, it is an opportune time to consider options for  addressing fragmentation, overlap, and potential duplication among these  programs. In the past, Congress has taken a range of actions to address  these issues that may help you as you seek approaches on how to proceed.  Today, I would like to highlight 3 of these approaches:  1.  enhancing program evaluations and performance information,  2.  fostering coordination and strategic planning for program areas that  span multiple federal agencies, and 3.  consolidating existing programs or coordinating service delivery."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enhancing Program Evaluations and Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["Information about the effectiveness of programs can help guide  policymakers and program managers in making tough decisions about  how to prioritize the use of scarce resources and improve the efficiency of  existing programs. However, there can be many challenges to obtaining  this information. For example, it may not be cost-effective to allocate the  funds necessary to conduct rigorous evaluations of small programs and as  a result these programs are unlikely to be evaluated. As we have reported,  many programs, especially smaller programs, have not been evaluated,  which can limit the ability of Congress to make informed decisions about  which programs to continue, expand, modify, consolidate, or eliminate.  For example,    We found that of 47 employment and training programs we identified, 23  have not had a performance study of any kind completed since 2004, and  only 5 have had an impact study completed since 2004.", "We recommended that Labor comply with the requirement in the  Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to conduct an impact evaluation of  WIA services to better understand what services are most effective for  improving outcomes. However, Labor has been slow to implement this  requirement, and does not expect to complete the study until June 2015.", "In 2009, GAO reported that while evaluations have been done, or are under  way, for about two-fifths of 23 programs we identified as being focused on  teacher quality, little is known about the extent to which most programs  are achieving their desired results.", "In 2010, GAO reported that there were 151 different federal K-12 and early  education programs, but that more than half of these programs have not  been evaluated, including 8 of the 20 largest programs which together  accounted for about 90 percent of total funding for these programs.", "There are also other governmentwide strategies that may play an  important role. Specifically, in January 2011, the President signed the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), updating the almost two- decades-old Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).  Implementing provisions of the new act\u2014such as its emphasis on  establishing outcome-oriented goals covering a limited number of  crosscutting policy areas\u2014could play an important role in clarifying  desired outcomes and addressing program performance spanning multiple  organizations. Specifically, GPRAMA requires agencies to (1) disclose  information about the accuracy and reliability of performance information  (2) identify crosscutting management challenges, and (3) report quarterly  on priority goals on a publicly available Web site. Additionally, GPRAMA  significantly enhances requirements for agencies to consult with Congress  when establishing or adjusting governmentwide and agency goals. OMB  and agencies are to consult with relevant committees, obtaining majority  and minority views, about proposed goals at least once every 2 years. This  information can inform deliberations on spending priorities and help re- examine the fundamental structure, operation, funding, and performance  of a number of federal education programs. However, to be successful, it  will be important for agencies to build the analytical capacity to both use  the performance information, and to ensure its quality\u2014both in terms of  staff trained to do the analysis and availability of research and evaluation  resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fostering Coordination and Strategic Planning for Program Areas that Span Multiple Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Where programs cross federal agencies, Congress can establish  requirements to ensure federal agencies are working together on common  goals. For example, Congress mandated\u2014through the America  COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010\u2014that the Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP), develop and maintain an inventory of STEM  education programs, including documentation of the effectiveness of these  programs, assess the potential overlap and potential duplication of these  programs, and develop a 5-year strategic plan for STEM education, among  other things. In establishing these requirements, Congress put in place a  set of requirements to provide information it can use to inform decisions  about strategic priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating Existing Programs or Coordinating Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["Consolidating existing programs or coordinating service delivery are other  options for Congress to address fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.  In the education area, Congress consolidated several bilingual education  programs into the English Language Acquisition State Grant Program as  part of the 2001 ESEA reauthorization. As we reported prior to the  consolidation, existing bilingual programs shared the same goals, targeted  the same types of children, and provided similar services. In consolidating  these programs, Congress gave state and local educational agencies  greater flexibility in the design and administration of language  instructional programs. Congress has another opportunity to address these  issues through the pending reauthorization of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965. Specifically, to minimize any wasteful  fragmentation and overlap among teacher quality programs, Congress may  choose either to eliminate programs that are too small to evaluate cost  effectively or to combine programs serving similar target groups into a  larger program. In the employment and training area, Congress took steps  to better coordinate service delivery for many employment and training  programs when it enacted the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA).  Specifically, WIA established one-stop centers in all states and mandated  that numerous programs provide their services through the centers. In  doing so, WIA sought to unify a fragmented employment and training  system and create a single, universal system\u2014a one-stop system that  could serve the needs of all job seekers and employers.", "In conclusion, removing and preventing unnecessary duplication, overlap,  and fragmentation among federal teacher quality and employment and  training programs is clearly challenging. These are difficult issues to  address because they may require agencies and Congress to re-examine  within and across various mission areas the fundamental structure,  operation, funding, and performance of a number of long-standing federal  programs or activities. Implementing provisions of GPRAMA\u2014such as its  emphasis on establishing priority outcome-oriented goals, including those  covering crosscutting policy areas\u2014could play an important role in  clarifying desired outcomes, addressing program performance spanning  multiple organizations, and facilitating future actions to reduce  unnecessary duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. Sustained attention  and oversight by Congress will be critical also. As the nation rises to meet  its current fiscal challenges, GAO will continue to assist Congress and  federal agencies in identifying actions needed to address these issues.  Likewise, we will continue to monitor developments in the areas we have  already identified.", "Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Miller, and Members of the  Committee.
