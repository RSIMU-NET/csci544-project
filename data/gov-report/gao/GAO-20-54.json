However, the limited availability of local USVI personnel to staff key recovery positions and the territory's difficult fiscal situation presented challenges in implementing these programs. Further, FEMA and USVI officials stated they faced challenges with implementing the Public Assistance alternative procedures program, which provides the USVI with flexibility in determining when and how to fund projects. Specifically, these officials stated that developing accurate fixed-cost estimates and using new flexibilities authorized by law delayed longer-term recovery projects. USVI officials told GAO they plan to take a cautious approach when deciding whether to pursue projects using the alternative procedures.", "FEMA expanded its Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power (STEP) pilot program in the USVI to address the lack of other sheltering options for survivors, such as hotels. The program aimed to provide minimal, temporary repairs to damaged homes to quickly make them habitable. In May 2019, FEMA decided it would not use the STEP pilot program in the future since it did not provide assistance as rapidly as intended. Historically, the program was used to address survivors' emergency sheltering needs. However, since ending it, FEMA has not evaluated options for providing future emergency sheltering assistance. Doing so could help FEMA plan for when the next disaster inevitably strikes.", "The USVI and FEMA established structures for overseeing recovery efforts. For example, the USVI established a new office to oversee federal recovery programs and FEMA has processes in place to oversee recovery projects at the local, regional, and headquarters levels.

USVI and FEMA officials cited the  limited number of local USVI personnel with the knowledge and expertise  necessary to staff recovery-related positions in key USVI agencies as a  significant challenge following the 2017 hurricanes. For example, USVI  officials told us that the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management  Agency\u2014the agency initially responsible for overseeing all aspects of  both the Public Assistance program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  in the territory\u2014did not have enough employees on staff to effectively  implement and manage these programs. Further, a senior FEMA official  noted that after the storms, the USVI had only one individual responsible  for managing all aspects of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program across  the territory. In addition, the limited availability of local staff in the USVI  was exacerbated by the departure of qualified individuals following the  hurricanes as well as competition among recovery agencies to hire  qualified staff that remained in the territory, according to USVI officials.", "To address these challenges, the USVI hired two contractors to augment  the territory\u2019s capacity in the shorter term and established a new Office of  Disaster Recovery to oversee recovery efforts in the longer term. First, in  December 2017, the USVI hired two contractors to assist the territory in  planning, developing, implementing, and overseeing recovery projects,  among other responsibilities. Second, in February 2019, the USVI  established the Office of Disaster Recovery as the primary territorial  agency responsible for coordinating and overseeing all disaster recovery  efforts in the USVI, including the Public Assistance program and Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program. The office\u2019s Director told us that while  contractor personnel had been valuable in augmenting the USVI\u2019s  capacity, the territory was prioritizing the hiring and training of qualified  local hires to replace these contractors for the longer term.", "Shortage of local construction crews. Due to the territory\u2019s relatively  small population, FEMA and USVI officials stated there were not enough  local construction crews to address the large amount of construction work  required to repair and rebuild damaged infrastructure following the 2017  hurricanes. These officials told us this construction crew shortage  affected the USVI\u2019s ability to keep Public Assistance program and Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program projects proceeding on time. FEMA and  contractor personnel stated that unlike in the contiguous United States,  the USVI does not have neighboring states that can easily send  construction crews to affected areas to augment local crews. In addition,  historically, the USVI relied on Puerto Rico to supplement the territory\u2019s  capacity, but this was not an option as Puerto Rico was undergoing its  own massive recovery effort as a result of Hurricane Maria.", "The USVI\u2019s fiscal situation. USVI officials and contractor personnel  stated that the challenging fiscal situation in the territory directly affected  its ability to effectively implement recovery programs. Specifically, USVI  officials told us that the territory\u2019s financial condition made it difficult to  provide initial funding to reimburse subrecipients for completed work prior  to drawing down funding from the account holding FEMA-obligated money. These officials stated this process was problematic because  instead of funding all eligible projects as quickly as possible to move the  recovery forward, the USVI had to prioritize certain recovery projects over  others based on the availability of funding. Further, USVI contractor  personnel told us that the territory often does not have the cash on hand  necessary to provide these reimbursements to subrecipients, which can  result in delays in paying subrecipients and contractors. According to  USVI officials, pursuing projects under the Public Assistance alternative  procedures program may help to address these issues by providing more  flexibility regarding when and how projects are funded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Implementing the Public Assistance Alternative Procedures Program Have Delayed Recovery Projects in the USVI", "paragraphs": ["The Public Assistance alternative procedures program provides the USVI  with financial incentives and new flexibilities in implementing recovery  projects that are not available through the standard Public Assistance  program. However, FEMA and USVI officials stated that implementing the  alternative procedures program in the USVI presented challenges that  affected recovery efforts and delayed the obligation of funding for  permanent work projects. Specifically, they cited challenges in (1)  developing accurate fixed-cost estimates for program projects and (2)  implementing the new flexibilities authorized by section 20601 of the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Senior USVI officials told us that due to  these challenges and the financial risk associated with the use of fixed- cost estimates, the USVI is planning to take a cautious approach in  pursuing alternative procedures projects. As established in FEMA  guidance, USVI officials have a deadline of March 2020 to finalize the  fixed-cost estimates for such projects for inclusion in the alternative  procedures program.", "Fixed-cost estimates. As the USVI is financially responsible for any  actual costs that exceed the fixed-cost estimate for any given alternative  procedures project, ensuring the accuracy of these estimates is critical  due to the USVI\u2019s already difficult fiscal situation. However, USVI  officials told us that developing fixed-cost estimates that accurately  forecast the future costs of completing large, complex permanent work  projects in the remote island territory is difficult given the unique  circumstances that influence construction costs in the USVI, such as the  limited availability of local resources and the need to import construction  materials and labor. To address this challenge, in October 2018, FEMA  asked an independent contractor to analyze whether a USVI-specific  \u201ccost factor\u201d should be incorporated into FEMA\u2019s process for developing  fixed-cost estimates to ensure the actual costs of implementing  permanent work projects in the territory were captured. According to  FEMA officials, the independent contractor determined that a cost factor  was appropriate for use in the USVI and the contractor proposed several  options. However, territorial officials contended that these proposals did  not sufficiently or accurately capture the unique circumstances that  influence construction costs in the territory. Further, USVI officials stated  that ensuring the accuracy of the cost factor was critical given the  significant financial risk using fixed-cost estimates posed to the USVI.", "Since incorporating a cost factor into the process for developing fixed- cost estimates increases the base cost for any given permanent work  project\u2014and therefore the amount of funding FEMA obligates\u2014FEMA  officials explained the USVI had an incentive to delay the obligation of  projects until FEMA finalized this factor. As a result, FEMA officials told us  in May 2019 that obligations for permanent work projects had been  mostly on hold since October 2018 while the contractor worked to  develop the USVI-specific cost factor. As the USVI is reliant on federal  recovery funding to reimburse subrecipients for completed work, this  delay in obligations directly affected the USVI\u2019s ability to move recovery  projects forward.", "In May 2019, the contractor proposed a new cost factor, which FEMA  approved on an interim basis pending further analysis. In July 2019,  FEMA officials told us that while additional analyses are required to  ensure its final process for developing fixed-cost estimates in the USVI  accurately captures construction costs, using this interim cost factor in the  meantime allows FEMA and USVI officials to move forward with the  development and final approval of alternative procedures projects. In  August 2019, a senior USVI official told us the territory plans to begin  using the interim cost factor, where appropriate, to keep projects  progressing forward. However, she stated that the USVI questioned  whether the interim cost factor did, in fact, sufficiently capture the actual  costs of construction in the USVI. Given the uncertainty around these  fixed-cost estimates, USVI officials told us the territory will need to  balance the potential flexibilities provided by the alternative procedures  program with the financial risk posed by cost overruns when deciding  whether to use the alternative procedures or the standard Public  Assistance program for any given permanent work project. We are  currently assessing FEMA\u2019s process for developing cost estimates for  projects under both the standard and alternative procedures programs,  and plan to report our results in early 2020.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. While FEMA and USVI officials told  us that section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act presented a valuable  opportunity to advance the USVI\u2019s recovery, they also reported  challenges with implementing the new flexibilities authorized by the Act,  which made developing eligible permanent work projects difficult. For  example, USVI officials stated that, at times, they were unclear about the  implementation process for key components of the Act and thus ensuring  subrecipients understood the process was difficult. Further, FEMA  officials in the USVI told us that initially, they had difficulty obtaining  clarification from FEMA headquarters regarding how to implement key  provisions of the Act, such as the process for identifying and incorporating  relevant industry standards for specific alternative procedures projects.  As a result, permanent work projects that were eligible to use the  flexibilities provided by the Act remained on hold until FEMA could clarify  the process for implementing the Act and pertinent industry standards  could be approved.", "In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act was signed into law in February  2018 and applies exclusively to federal disaster assistance to the USVI  and Puerto Rico. As a result, FEMA officials faced the challenge of  interpreting the Act\u2019s language and appropriately implementing its  provisions for the first time. For example, the Act allows for a new process  for determining whether a disaster-damaged facility is eligible to receive  funding to (1) repair the existing facility or (2) replace the facility with a  new structure. Under the standard Public Assistance program, this  determination is calculated using the \u201c50 percent rule\u201d\u2014if the cost of  repairing the disaster-related damage sustained by the facility exceeds 50  percent of the cost of replacing it, FEMA may fund the replacement of the  facility. In contrast, the Act does not provide a similar cost estimating  process for use in developing fixed-cost estimates through the alternative  procedures program. In September 2018, FEMA issued guidance for  implementing section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act through the  Public Assistance alternative procedures program, which provides that  critical services infrastructure\u2014such as medical and educational  facilities\u2014is eligible for replacement \u201cif repair is feasible, but replacement  is more prudent.\u201d FEMA officials in the USVI told us that since the agency  did not have further guidance or criteria on the appropriate process for  evaluating repair or replacement under this new standard, they were  responsible for developing the agency\u2019s first justification to support the  replacement of a hospital in St. Croix based on their interpretation of the  new standard. These officials also stated that since their rationale  justifying the facility\u2019s eligibility for replacement was the first of its kind and  would set a precedent for future projects, they submitted it to FEMA  headquarters for review. In May 2019, FEMA officially approved the  replacement of this hospital through the alternative procedures program.  For more information on how the Public Assistance program and the  Bipartisan Budget Act are affecting recovery efforts at this facility, see  appendix III.", "The Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of  2019, which was signed into law in June 2019, provides additional  direction to FEMA regarding the implementation of section 20601 of the  Act. Among other things, this legislation includes a provision directing  FEMA to change its process for determining whether a disaster-damaged  facility is eligible for repair or replacement. FEMA evaluated this and  other provisions of the Act and, in September 2019, issued an updated  policy to provide clear guidance moving forward, according to agency  officials.", "The USVI Governor and senior territorial officials stated that due to the  challenges outlined above and the financial risk posed by exceeding  fixed-cost estimates, the USVI plans to take a cautious approach in  implementing the Public Assistance alternative procedures program.  Specifically, the Governor told us the territory will most likely pursue  alternative procedures projects that are simple, have clear scopes of  work, and do not include high levels of uncertainty to reduce the financial  risk of potential cost overruns. USVI officials added that if they are not  comfortable with the fixed-cost estimate for any given alternative  procedures project, the territory has the option to pursue the project under  the standard Public Assistance program. Under the standard program,  the USVI cannot take advantage of the flexibilities and financial incentives  provided by the alternative procedures and the Bipartisan Budget Act, but FEMA would reimburse the USVI for the actual cost\u2014including any cost  overruns\u2014of all work completed in accordance with a project\u2019s approved  scope of work, thereby mitigating the territory\u2019s financial risk. The USVI is  ultimately responsible for deciding whether the benefits provided through  the alternative procedures program and the Bipartisan Budget Act  outweigh the financial risk associated with agreeing to fixed-cost  estimates for permanent work projects. Since the territory has until March  2020 to finalize these fixed-cost estimates, it remains too early to  determine the extent to which the alternative procedures program will play  a role in the USVI\u2019s long-term recovery strategy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Discontinued the STEP Pilot Program After Expanding It in the USVI, but Has Not Evaluated Options for Providing Future Emergency Sheltering Assistance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Expanded the STEP Pilot Program in the USVI", "paragraphs": ["In October 2017, FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program in the USVI in  response to the widespread damage to homes that displaced residents  and overwhelmed sheltering and temporary housing resources in the  territory. Through the program, FEMA funded minimal, temporary  protective repairs (or \u201cPhase I\u201d repairs) to private homes to allow  residents a safe place to shelter. For example, Phase I emergency  repairs included applying temporary patches to roofs and windows to  protect the interior from outside weather conditions and ensuring a  functional kitchen and bathroom and safe sleeping area. According to  FEMA documentation, the intent of these minimal temporary repairs was  to quickly make damaged homes habitable in the short term until  homeowners could complete more permanent repairs independently  through other FEMA programs or using private insurance payments.", "In August 2018, FEMA expanded the STEP pilot program to include the  \u201cpermanent\u201d repair or replacement of damaged roofs (or \u201cPhase II\u201d  work)\u2014the first time in its history that FEMA authorized such work  through this pilot program. Phase II work funded more permanent work on  USVI residents\u2019 damaged roofs\u2014either by repairing damages to the  existing roof or replacing it with a new one. In addition, Phase II work  included incorporating roof hardening measures, such as installing  hurricane clips to the roof berms, to increase the resiliency of the roofs  against hurricane-force winds. Figure 8 provides two examples of USVI  homes that participated in Phase II of the STEP pilot program.", "FEMA expanded the STEP pilot program to address the USVI\u2019s unique,  longer-term sheltering needs. Specifically, as the 2018 hurricane season  arrived, FEMA was faced with the challenge of ensuring adequate  sheltering options were available to USVI residents in the event that  another hurricane struck the territory. The following factors contributed to  FEMA\u2019s decision to expand the STEP pilot program:  Infeasibility of other sheltering programs. Alternate sheltering  options were not viable in the USVI due to the unique circumstances  in the territory. For example, the Transitional Sheltering Assistance  program\u2014where FEMA funds non-congregate sheltering (typically in  hotels or motels) for displaced residents who cannot safely return to  their homes\u2014was not a feasible option as there was only one  operating hotel in the USVI capable of sheltering disaster survivors.  Further, FEMA officials told us that temporary housing units\u2014such as  manufactured housing units or recreational vehicles\u2014could not be  deployed to supplement the territory\u2019s available housing stock due to  logistical challenges, including the prohibitive costs of shipping these  units to the remote territory and the limited availability of space to  install them.", "Operation Blue Roof caused additional damage to homes.", "According to FEMA officials, FEMA\u2019s decision to allow homes that had  received temporary blue tarps as an emergency roofing measure  through Operation Blue Roof to be eligible for the STEP pilot program  led to expanding the scope of allowable work funded by the  program. FEMA and USVI officials told us this change was  implemented to address several issues with the blue tarps installed on  homes, including the temporary nature of the tarps\u2014which had a  post-installation lifespan of only 30 days\u2014and the need to fix the  damage caused by installing the blue tarps on undamaged sections of  roofs. FEMA officials stated that expanding the STEP pilot program  to conduct more permanent roof repairs on these homes helped to  ensure homeowners were able to safely shelter in the event of  another hurricane.", "Shortage of construction crews. As previously discussed, FEMA  and USVI officials cited the limited number of construction crews  available to implement recovery work as a challenge, including for the  STEP pilot program. Specifically, this challenge made it difficult for  private homeowners to independently hire qualified contractors to  conduct permanent repairs to their homes, according to FEMA  officials. Therefore, these officials explained that using Phase II of the  STEP pilot program to manage contractors in an official capacity  made it more likely that necessary permanent repairs would be  completed in a timely manner.", "Evacuation was not an option. When requested, FEMA is  responsible for providing safe sheltering options following a disaster  and, in the absence of feasible local sheltering options, FEMA is  responsible for evacuating residents to a safe location outside the  potentially affected area. However, according to FEMA  documentation, developing and executing a plan to evacuate the  USVI\u2019s more than 100,000 residents in the event of another hurricane  was impractical.", "Given these factors and the risk of another hurricane, FEMA officials  determined that authorizing Phase II roof repairs or replacements of a  permanent nature represented an appropriate solution to ensure eligible  program participants could safely shelter in their homes.", "The STEP pilot program in the USVI officially ended on April 15, 2019.  FEMA reported that 7,381 homes ultimately received repairs through the program. Specifically, 6,372 homes received Phase I temporary repairs  and 1,631 homes received Phase II roof repairs or replacements of a  permanent nature. In addition, 622 homes received both Phase I and  Phase II repairs.

Specifically, FEMA stated that while FEMA had implemented the STEP  pilot program within its authority pursuant to Section 403 of the Stafford  Act, the agency was no longer \u201ccomfortable from a legal, policy, or  pragmatic perspective\u201d with implementing the STEP pilot program  following future disasters.", "FEMA cited two main challenges in implementing the program in the  USVI and elsewhere: (1) limiting the program\u2019s scope to provide only  minimal, emergency repairs, as intended, and (2) completing these  emergency repairs in a timely manner. First, FEMA stated that in multiple  iterations of the STEP pilot program\u2014including in the USVI\u2014FEMA  officials had \u201csuccumbed to the pressure\u201d from state and territorial leaders  to expand the scope of allowable repairs under the program to conduct  more extensive repairs. For example, in the USVI specifically, although  expanding the program to authorize permanent roof repairs was legally  supportable and represented an earnest effort to meet the territory\u2019s  needs, the expansion did \u201cpush the boundaries of appropriateness\u201d and  increased FEMA\u2019s risk of interfering with the agency\u2019s authority to provide  assistance through other FEMA programs.", "Second, FEMA stated that the lengthy process for delivering the STEP  pilot program\u2014including in the USVI\u2014undercut the program\u2019s stated  intent of providing emergency sheltering within 3 to 4 months following a  disaster. For example, while FEMA authorized the program in the USVI in  October 2017, initial repairs did not begin until March 2018 and eligible  work was not completed until April 2019\u201418 months after the program\u2019s  authorization. According to FEMA, completing STEP pilot program repairs  took longer than intended across most instances of the program\u2019s  implementation due to the amount of time required to develop disaster- specific program guidance, hire a large number of construction crews to  undertake the repair work, obtain the necessary permissions from  homeowners, and ultimately complete the repairs. Given the STEP pilot  program\u2019s protracted period of implementation, FEMA stated the agency  had not been successful in ensuring that program repairs provided  disaster survivors with emergency shelter in a timely manner.", "FEMA\u2019s decision to discontinue the STEP pilot program following future  disasters raises questions about how the agency plans to address the  emergency sheltering needs of disaster survivors in the future\u2014especially  in communities that face challenges and circumstances similar to those  the program was specifically designed to address. Since implementing it  in 2012, FEMA used the STEP pilot program to supplement other FEMA  sheltering programs and provide necessary additional capacity to help  address the emergency sheltering needs of disaster-affected  communities, as described below. In certain cases, the program  provided assistance to more disaster survivors than other relevant FEMA  programs, including the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program and  the provision of temporary housing units. FEMA implemented the STEP  pilot program in the following locations:", "Louisiana: FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program to supplement  other federal programs implemented in Louisiana following severe  storms and flooding in 2016. Specifically, the Transitional Sheltering  Assistance program was not a viable option for most survivors,  partially due to the limited availability of hotels and motels in the  affected area, and FEMA ultimately used this program for  approximately 4,300 households. In addition, FEMA deployed  temporary housing units for approximately 4,600 households. FEMA  also funded repairs through the STEP pilot program for nearly 11,000  homes.", "Texas: FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program to supplement other  federal programs in Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017.  Specifically, FEMA determined that implementing the STEP pilot  program provided a useful option since the number of displaced  survivors significantly exceeded the available capacity for sheltering  survivors in local hotels and motels. FEMA used the Transitional  Sheltering Assistance program for approximately 55,000 households  and deployed temporary housing units for more than 3,500  households. FEMA supplemented these programs by funding repairs  through the STEP pilot program for approximately 15,700 homes.", "Puerto Rico: FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program to address  the unique emergency sheltering needs in Puerto Rico following  Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Specifically, FEMA determined  that approximately 80 percent of the island did not have power and  would not have it restored for an extended period of time. As a result,  FEMA implemented the STEP pilot program to, among other repairs,  reconnect homes to a functioning electricity grid or, as necessary,  fund the installation of generators if the grid could not be restored in a  timely manner. Further, similar to what occurred in the USVI, FEMA  authorized the STEP pilot program to repair homes that participated in  Operation Blue Roof to address the roof damage caused by the  installation of the blue tarps. FEMA funded repairs through the STEP  pilot program for nearly 108,500 homes in Puerto Rico. In addition,  due to the lack of available hotels and motels in Puerto Rico,  participation in FEMA\u2019s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program  was limited to approximately 7,000 households, most of which were  relocated to hotels and motels in the contiguous United States.  Further, as detailed below, FEMA implemented its new Voluntary  Agencies Leading and Organizing Repair program for the first time in  Puerto Rico to conduct repairs to approximately 4,600 homes.", "North Carolina: FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program to address  the particular emergency sheltering needs in North Carolina following  Hurricane Florence in 2018. FEMA amended the STEP pilot program  to allow both contracted construction crews and voluntary  organizations to conduct the repairs, and ultimately funded repairs  through the program for approximately 2,200 homes. In addition,  FEMA used the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program for more  than 870 households and deployed temporary housing units for  approximately 650 households.", "Overall, FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program following 8 declared  disasters since 2012 and obligated approximately $2.6 billion to fund  repairs to more than 167,000 disaster survivors\u2019 homes, according to  FEMA documentation. While the program may not have provided  repairs as rapidly as FEMA intended, these repairs nonetheless played a  significant role in ensuring these disaster survivors could safely shelter in  their homes.", "Since discontinuing the program, FEMA has not evaluated its options for  addressing the emergency sheltering needs of disaster survivors. FEMA  stated that it continues to support the use of congregate sheltering and  will consider authorizing the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program,  among other options, to address disaster survivors\u2019 needs following future  disasters. However, as detailed above, FEMA used the STEP pilot  program for the specific purpose of providing necessary additional  capacity to supplement these and other federal programs. Further, in  certain cases, the STEP pilot program was used when implementing  these other programs was unfeasible, such as in the USVI and New York  where the particular circumstances on the ground made using the  Transitional Sheltering Assistance program or deploying temporary  housing units impractical.", "FEMA officials also told us the agency could utilize voluntary  organizations to a greater extent than in the past to conduct the same  types of repairs provided through the STEP pilot program. Specifically,  FEMA officials stated that the Voluntary Agencies Leading and  Organizing Repair program\u2014which was implemented in Puerto Rico in  response to the 2017 hurricanes and used to repair about 4,600 homes\u2014 could be used for this purpose following future disasters. However, given  the program\u2019s limited implementation, it is too early to determine the  extent to which it represents a feasible solution for addressing emergency  sheltering needs, or is capable of providing assistance on as large a scale  as other federal programs, such as the STEP pilot program that funded  repairs on more than 100,000 homes in Puerto Rico alone. Further, in  North Carolina\u2014where FEMA amended the STEP pilot program to allow  both hired construction crews and voluntary organizations to conduct the  repairs\u2014the number of homes repaired by the construction crews\u2014about  2,000\u2014far exceeded the number of homes repaired by voluntary  organizations\u2014about 150\u2014which raises questions about the ability of  voluntary organizations to undertake the large volume of repairs  necessary following disasters.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should identify, on a timely basis, significant changes to  internal conditions that have already occurred, including changes to the  entity\u2019s programs or activities.

FEMA has not assessed how its decision to discontinue the  STEP pilot program will affect its ability to provide emergency sheltering  assistance following future disasters. While FEMA officials told us they  plan to use other sheltering programs when the next disaster strikes,  these programs may not be sufficient in addressing the emergency  sheltering needs of disaster survivors, especially in communities where  implementing such programs is not feasible. FEMA officials also stated  that given the agency\u2019s decision to discontinue the STEP pilot program,  conducting a broad evaluation of FEMA\u2019s emergency sheltering programs  and the agency\u2019s options for addressing emergency sheltering needs  would be useful to ensure that FEMA is prepared to respond effectively to  future disasters.

Of the more than $1.8 billion FEMA obligated as of  June 30, 2019, more than 1.1 billion (61 percent) was obligated for 410  emergency work projects in Public Assistance program categories A and  B.", "Category A: Debris removal. FEMA obligated about $139.9 million for  88 projects focused on debris removal activities across the territory.  For example, FEMA obligated $81.8 million to the USVI Water and  Power Authority for territory-wide debris removal efforts (see fig. 9). Of  the $139.9 million FEMA obligated for debris removal, the USVI  expended about $76.9 million (55 percent) as of June 30, 2019.", "Category B: Emergency protective measures. FEMA obligated about  $985.6 million for 322 projects focused on emergency measures. For  example, FEMA obligated about $278.2 million for the Sheltering and  Temporary Essential Power (STEP) pilot program as of June 30,  2019, to fund certain types of temporary repairs to private homes. In  addition, FEMA obligated approximately $111.9 million for the  purchase and installation of modular units to be used as temporary  classrooms and other facilities while permanent school buildings are  repaired or replaced (see fig. 10).

Of the more than $1.8 billion in Public Assistance grant  funding FEMA obligated as of June 30, 2019, about $588.5 million (32  percent) was obligated for 200 permanent work projects across  categories C through G. These permanent work projects included more  than $383.1 million for cost-effective hazard mitigation measures to  reduce the future risk of disaster damage to infrastructure.", "Category C: Roads and bridges. FEMA obligated about $5.9 million  for 40 projects focused on repairing roads and bridges in the territory,  9 of which included hazard mitigation measures totaling about $1.6  million. For example, FEMA obligated about $233,000 for one project  to repair a road on St. Croix damaged by floodwaters. This project  included approximately $61,000 for hazard mitigation measures to  reduce the likelihood of erosion during future flooding events. Of the  $5.9 million FEMA obligated for category C, the USVI expended about  $86,000 (1.5 percent) as of June 30, 2019.", "Category D: Water control facilities. As of June 30, 2019, FEMA did  not have any projects in this category. According to FEMA officials,  the USVI does not have water control infrastructure\u2014such as berms  or levees\u2014that would fall under category D.", "Category E: Buildings and equipment. FEMA obligated about $68.3  million for 101 projects focused on repairing damaged structures in  the territory, 49 of which included hazard mitigation measures totaling  about $3.1 million. For example, FEMA obligated about $59.7 million  for one project to replace 5 heavily damaged buildings in a public  housing facility in St. Thomas (see fig. 11). While FEMA obligated this  project through the standard Public Assistance program, FEMA and  the USVI plan to work to develop a fixed-cost estimate with the  intention of transitioning this project to the alternative procedures  program, according to FEMA documentation. Further, this  documentation states that hazard mitigation measures will be  incorporated into the new structures by implementing internationally  adopted building codes and standards for wall and window  replacements. Of the $68.3 million FEMA obligated for Category E,  the USVI expended about $533,000 (0.8 percent) as of June 30,  2019.", "Category F: Utilities. Of the $588.5 million FEMA obligated for  permanent work projects, $505.6 million (86 percent) was obligated  for 23 projects focused on repairing utilities, 13 of which included  hazard mitigation measures totaling about $378.2 million.  Specifically, FEMA obligated $481.8 million\u2014or 95 percent of the  $505.6 million\u2014through the standard Public Assistance program for  projects focused on territory-wide permanent electrical distribution  system repairs. This includes replacing damaged wooden utility poles  with more resilient composite fiberglass poles that can withstand 200  mile per hour winds as well as power transmission lines and  transformers (see fig. 12). Of the $505.6 million FEMA obligated for  category F, the USVI expended about $210.4 million (42 percent) as  of June 30, 2019.", "Category G: Parks, recreational, and other facilities. As of June 30,  2019, FEMA obligated about $8.8 million for 36 projects focused on  repairing parks, playgrounds, and other facilities, 5 of which included  hazard mitigation measures totaling about $214,000. For example,  FEMA obligated about $1.5 million in March 2019 for two projects to  repair the USVI\u2019s Tsunami Early Warning System, which comprises a  network of warning stations that alert residents of a potential tsunami  event (see fig. 13). As of September 2019, these were the only  projects FEMA had obligated under the Public Assistance alternative  procedures program in the territory, according to FEMA officials.  These projects included about $185,000 for hazard mitigation  measures to replace wooden poles with higher-rated steel poles that  are able to withstand high winds and impacts from flying debris during  a storm.

The new facility will serve as the  headquarters for both the USVI Territorial Emergency Management  Agency and the USVI Bureau of Information Technology and house a  911 Emergency Call Center. According to FEMA documentation, the  facility will include a safe room to allow emergency personnel to  shelter in place during disasters and will contain sufficient space to  house FEMA and other federal personnel, as necessary. Further, the  facility will include a hardened communications system to ensure  emergency responders are able to effectively communicate during  emergency events, among other improvements.", "The Comprehensive Territorial Hazard Mitigation and Resilience  Plan Project. FEMA obligated nearly $5.0 million to fund the  development of an in-depth, comprehensive hazard mitigation and  resilience plan for territory-wide use. FEMA officials stated that unlike  in the contiguous United States, the USVI does not have any entities  responsible for formally developing similar plans to guide operations  and mitigation activities across various sectors, such as protecting the  potable water supply and assessing economically feasible options for  development. As a result, FEMA officials told us that this project  represents an important effort to develop a holistic, territory-wide  hazard mitigation plan that would cover all relevant sectors.", "The Spring Gut Watershed Green Space Acquisition and  Stormwater Management Project. FEMA obligated nearly $1.0  million to fund the first phase of a $2.0 million project to purchase 50  acres of undeveloped land and develop storm water retention  measures\u2014such as berms and rock linings\u2014to reduce downstream  flooding and the associated damages to roads, homes, and  infrastructure (see fig. 14). FEMA officials told us that the first phase  of the project included an environmental and historical preservation  review of the target locations to confirm program eligibility before  actual construction activities can begin.", "Fortuna/Bordeaux Fire Station Retrofit. FEMA obligated more than  $470,000 to fund the first phase of a nearly $5.0 million project to  retrofit a fire station in St. Thomas. Specifically, the project will  upgrade the facility\u2019s structure to applicable codes and standards to  mitigate the risks posed by hurricane-force winds, including the  dangers posed by flying debris.

Figure 15 details selected  hurricane damage to the facility.", "Due to the extensive damage, the JFL hospital has been operating at  reduced capacity since the hurricane and certain functions have been  relocated to undamaged areas, according to FEMA documentation. This  documentation states that while the hospital continues to provide limited  medical services to St. Croix residents, it is no longer capable of providing  critical care services. Since alternate options were either limited or  unavailable on the island following the storms, St. Croix residents in need  of life sustaining medical treatments such as chemotherapy infusions or  who are experiencing life-threatening health events such as cardiac  failure or trauma must be transported out of the territory to receive life- saving care, according to FEMA documentation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Assistance Program Emergency Work Projects at the JFL Hospital", "paragraphs": ["Following Hurricane Maria, FEMA obligated grant funding for several  Public Assistance emergency work projects to help keep the JFL hospital  functioning and capable of providing limited medical services to St. Croix  residents.

According to JFL  personnel, this funding covered the cost of using the backup generator  until the facility\u2019s primary electrical system could be restored. In another  example, FEMA obligated about $2.4 million in August 2018\u2014also  through Public Assistance program category B\u2014to fund the rental of  mobile dialysis trailers (see fig. 16). According to JFL personnel, these  trailers were acquired to replace all 14 of the facility\u2019s dialysis units that  were destroyed during the storm.", "In addition to Public Assistance projects focused on maintaining the  existing facility, FEMA obligated $43.2 million in January 2018 to fund the  purchase and installation of modular units to serve as a temporary  medical facility through category B emergency work.

However, they stated that  implementing this project has been challenging.", "For example, JFL personnel told us that when former JFL administrators  were developing the project, they incorporated the cost of procuring and  installing the modular units, but omitted the costs associated with  acquiring, installing, and certifying new medical equipment for use in the  interim facility. These personnel stated that these costs should have been  incorporated into the original project paperwork and clarified that the  acquisition and certification of new equipment was critical in ensuring the  hospital\u2019s provision of medical services would not be disrupted.  Specifically, they explained that relocating the facility\u2019s existing medical  equipment was not a feasible option as it would result in an unacceptable  lapse in medical services during the time-consuming process of  deconstructing, transferring, reinstalling, and recertifying this equipment in  the modular facility. JFL personnel stated they worked closely with  FEMA officials and contractor personnel to update the project\u2019s  paperwork and request additional program funding for this new medical  equipment. In August 2019, FEMA approved the updated paperwork and  obligated additional funding for this project, according to FEMA  documentation.", "JFL personnel also stated they have limited capacity to effectively  manage and oversee the construction of the temporary facility due to  competing responsibilities. In addition to managing this project, they  stated they were occupied with the continuous maintenance challenges  associated with keeping the deteriorating main facility functioning while  also working to develop options for a permanent facility through the Public  Assistance alternative procedures program, as discussed below. They  told us FEMA officials and contractor personnel had been helpful in  providing assistance, but stated they would benefit from a larger hospital  management team that could focus specifically on planning and  implementing the facility\u2019s numerous recovery efforts.

Further, in providing a critical service, the JFL  hospital is eligible to use the new flexibilities provided by the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2018. This Act allows FEMA\u2014when using the alternative  procedures\u2014to fund the repair or full replacement of the hospital to  accepted industry standards regardless of any pre-disaster damage or  wear and tear the facility may have sustained prior to the 2017  hurricanes. FEMA officials and JFL personnel stated the Act therefore  provides a valuable opportunity to restore the facility to a better condition  than it was in prior to the storms. However, JFL personnel told us that  pursuing this permanent work project included challenges. For example,  JFL personnel told us that maintaining the damaged facility while FEMA  determined whether the hospital was eligible for repairs to the existing  structure or a complete replacement under the Bipartisan Budget Act was  challenging. Specifically, they explained that while FEMA worked to  finalize this determination, management was in the difficult position of  deciding where and how to invest its finite resources to keep the  constantly deteriorating facility functioning. For example, these personnel  explained that if FEMA determined that the facility is ineligible for  replacement under the Act, they would immediately invest money into the  existing facility to address critical components that require urgent  attention, such as the water and wastewater systems. In contrast, if  FEMA determined that the facility is indeed eligible for replacement,  management would strategically invest the minimum amount of resources  required to keep the facility functioning with the full knowledge that it  would eventually be demolished.
