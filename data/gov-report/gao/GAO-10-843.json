NWS's on-site staff is called a center weather service unit. For several years, NWS and FAA have been exploring options for improving the aviation weather services provided at en route centers.

To do so, GAO evaluated agency progress and plans and compared agency efforts with leading practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After developing and shelving four proposals for restructuring the center weather service units over the last 5 years, in July 2010, senior NWS and FAA officials agreed to continue the current center weather service units at each of the 21 en route centers through September 2011 and to take immediate steps to improve aviation weather services by (1) having the service units provide forecasts for 10 key FAA terminal radar facilities and (2) having nearby weather forecast offices support FAA's en route centers when the service units are closed for the night. In addition, the agencies agreed to establish a joint team to baseline current capabilities and develop firm requirements for aviation weather services supporting air traffic flow management. While this agreement is important, the details have not been fully defined. Thus, it is not yet clear what will happen to the 21 service units after September 2011, when the immediate improvements in services will be in place, whether there are any costs associated with these steps, and who will pay for them. Until the two agencies further define their plans, the risk remains that the agencies will misjudge their responsibilities and not fulfill their agreements. FAA and NWS have made progress in identifying performance measures for the weather service units located at FAA en route centers, and NWS is beginning to track its service units' performance. However, NWS has not yet tracked, established baselines for, and reported to FAA on all applicable performance measures. Specifically, of seven possible performance measures, NWS is tracking performance for three of the measures and partially tracking a fourth measure. Of these four measures, the agency has established a sound baseline and reported on two of these measures and has made partial progress on two others. The agency is not tracking performance, documenting baselines, or reporting on three of the measures because it has not yet determined how to track them. Without an understanding of the current level of performance of the identified measures, the agencies will be limited in their ability to evaluate what progress has been made. In addition, until NWS regularly reports on its performance, the agencies lack the information they need to determine what is working well and what needs to be improved. In September 2009, GAO identified three challenges in modifying NWS's aviation weather services provided at FAA's en route centers: achieving interagency collaboration, defining requirements, and aligning changes with the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)--a long-term initiative to increase the efficiency of the national airspace system. The agencies have not yet fully addressed these challenges. Specifically, while senior agency officials recently agreed on how to proceed, work remains to be done to refine requirements, develop and execute an implementation plan, and to ensure that improvements are aligned with the long-term vision for NextGen. Until these fundamental challenges are addressed, the agencies are unlikely to achieve significant improvements in the aviation weather services provided at en route centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Departments of Commerce and Transportation define their agreements, refine performance management processes, and address key challenges.

In addition, at any one time, as many  as 7,000 aircraft\u2014both civilian and military\u2014could be aloft over the  United States. In 2004, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization was formed to,  among other responsibilities, improve the provision of air traffic services.  More than 34,000 employees within FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization support  the operations that help move aircraft through the national airspace  system. The agency\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy  and reliability of its air traffic control systems, as well as weather  forecasts made available by NWS and automated systems. These resources  reside at, or are associated with, several types of facilities: air traffic  control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, air route traffic  control centers (en route centers), and the Air Traffic Control System  Command Center. The number and functions of these facilities are as  follows:    510 air traffic control towers manage and control the airspace within  about 5 miles of an airport. They control departures and landings, as well  as ground operations on airport taxiways and runways.   163 terminal radar approach control facilities provide air traffic control  services for airspace within approximately 40 miles of an airport and  generally up to 10,000 feet above the airport, where en route centers\u2019  control begins. Terminal controllers establish and maintain the sequence  and separation of aircraft.    21 en route centers control planes over the United States\u2014in transit and  during approaches to some airports. Each center handles a different  region of airspace. En route centers operate the computer suite that  processes radar surveillance and flight planning data, reformats the data  for presentation purposes, and sends it to display equipment used by  controllers to track aircraft. The centers control the switching of voice  communications between aircraft and the center, as well as between the  center and other air traffic control facilities.

In its  comments, NOAA stated that our report is generally representative of  challenges facing NWS and FAA in the execution of aviation weather  services provided by the center weather service units. The agency agreed  with our recommendations and identified plans to implement selected  parts of the recommendations. Specifically, NOAA reiterated its plan to  form a joint NWS/FAA team to determine weather requirements for traffic  flow management and to implement products and services through the  year 2015. NOAA stated that this team\u2019s results will serve as additional  documentation of the agreements. In addition, NOAA reported that it plans  to begin measuring format consistency in September 2010 and forecast  accuracy in December 2010.", "NOAA also noted that it was using 2009 site evaluations as the basis for its  scoring and that the 2009 results would serve as a baseline for comparison  to 2010 and subsequent results. However, as we discuss in the report, our  analysis of the 2009 site evaluations and scoring process found that the  results were not reliable because the process for collecting information on  customer service was inconsistent, and the scores did not always  accurately reflect the centers\u2019 performance. As a result, the 2009 scores  are not useful as a baseline or as a feedback tool. Moving forward, as  NOAA analyzes the results from its ongoing 2010 site evaluations, it will be  important to ensure that the scores accurately reflect each center\u2019s  performance. Further, in future years, it will be important to ensure that  comparable information is collected from year to year so that a reliable  performance baseline can be established.", "The Department of Transportation\u2019s Director of Audit Relations provided  comments on a draft of this report via e-mail.

We  analyzed NWS\u2019s approach to measuring center weather service unit  performance and compared its performance measurement practices with  guidance and best practices in performance management identified by  government and industry. Specifically, we assessed the agencies\u2019 actions  taken to identify performance measures, track them, establish baselines of  performance, and report on those baselines. We also assessed the  reliability of the performance data that NWS reported. Specifically, for the  customer satisfaction measurements, we analyzed supporting data and  calculated customer satisfaction scores using NWS\u2019s guidance for  developing scores. We then compared the scores we calculated with  NWS\u2019s scores. In instances where our scores did not match NWS\u2019s, we  interviewed agency officials in order to determine why NWS\u2019s scores did  not match our own, focusing on four sites with the largest number of  findings. We found that the agency\u2019s customer satisfaction data was not  reliable. For the other reported measures, we evaluated supporting data  and interviewed responsible agency officials to determine the agency\u2019s  processes for validating the data. We found that the data reported for  these performance measures was sufficient to meet our reporting  purposes.", "To evaluate plans to address key challenges identified in our prior report,  we reviewed agency documents including FAA requirements, an NWS  proposal, plans for the Next Generation Air Transportation System  (NextGen), and FAA\u2019s response to NWS\u2019s proposal.
