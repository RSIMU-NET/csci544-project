For most transactions, Ex-Im can identify the exporter and thus bases its determination of the small business financing share on whether the exporter qualifies as a small business. For other transactions, Ex-Im cannot identify the exporter at the time it authorizes the transaction and estimates the small business share based on shipment patterns in an earlier period. GAO determined that Ex-Im generally classifies companies' small business status correctly. However, GAO identified weaknesses in Ex-Im's process for calculating its small business support. For transactions where Ex-Im can identify the exporter, GAO found internal control weaknesses such as Ex-Im's data systems containing conflicting records for the same company. For transactions where Ex-Im cannot identify the exporter when it authorizes the transaction, a weakness is not including a large value of shipments in its calculations. GAO also determined that Ex-Im's reporting on the number of transactions--as opposed to the value of transactions--that directly benefit small business includes transactions that do not benefit small business. Prior to the enactment of credit reform legislation, Ex-Im interpreted the mandate as requiring it to make available for financing small business exports an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate principal amount of loans, guarantees and insurance specified by Congress for that fiscal year. Given changes in law including federal credit reform and the removal of specific financing authority limits, Ex-Im currently interprets its statutory small business financing mandate as requiring it to attempt to ensure that 20 percent of the authorized value of its transactions during a year directly benefits small business."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Export-Import Bank\u2019s (Ex-Im) level of support for small businesses has  been an issue of long-standing congressional interest.

Over time, there  has been considerable debate regarding what this percentage should be  and what should be included in its calculation. In 2002, Congress  established several new requirements for Ex-Im relating to small business,  including increasing from 10 to 20 percent the proportion of Ex-Im\u2019s  aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority that must be made  available for the direct benefit of small businesses.

Ex-Im's mission is to assist U.S. companies to create and maintain  American jobs by financing exports of goods and services and filling gaps  in the availability of commercial financing for creditworthy export  transactions. It also helps American exporters meet government-supported  financing competition from other countries so that American exporters can  compete for overseas business on the basis of price, performance, and  service. Its authorizing legislation requires Ex-Im not to compete with  commercial lenders.", "To accomplish its mission, Ex-Im offers a variety of financing instruments,  including loan guarantees and direct loans for buyer financing; export  credit insurance; and working capital guarantees for pre-export financing.  Under its loan guarantee program, Ex-Im agrees to guarantee loans made  by other lenders to help buyers in other countries obtain financing to  purchase U.S. exports. Ex-Im also provides export credit insurance to  protect U.S. exporters against nonpayment by their customers. It provides  this insurance either directly to exporters, or to banks which in turn  finance U.S. exporters. In addition, Ex-Im provides working capital  guarantees to U.S. companies that would like to export but need funds to  produce or market their goods or services for export.", "After it receives an application for financing from a U.S. exporter, bank, or  foreign buyer, Ex-Im determines whether the applicant meets certain  eligibility requirements. After Ex-Im approves or \u201cauthorizes\u201d the  transaction, it issues the loan, loan guarantee, or insurance policy. The  amount actually exported or shipped as a result of the transaction may  differ from the authorized value of the transaction. For example, for bank- held insurance policies, the total value of the policies authorized during the  year often exceeds the amount shipped under these policies.", "Figure 1 shows Ex-Im\u2019s reported fiscal year 2004 financing, by type of  transaction. Ex-Im reported authorizing more than $13 billion in loans,  guarantees, and export insurance in fiscal year 2004. Of this amount, Ex-Im  reported that more than $2.2 billion, about 17 percent, directly supported  U.S. small businesses.", "Congress has demonstrated its interest in Ex-Im\u2019s supporting small  business by, among other things, requiring that Ex-Im make available a  specified portion of its financing for small business. In 1983, Congress  required Ex-Im to make available for fiscal year 1986 and thereafter not less  than 10 percent of its aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority  for financing exports by small businesses. In 2002, Congress increased the  percentage, requiring that Ex-Im \u201cshall make available, from the aggregate  loan, guarantee, and insurance authority available to it, an amount to  finance exports directly by small business concerns. . .which shall be not  less than 20 percent of such authority for each fiscal year.\u201d Figure 2 shows  the proportion of its total financing that Ex-Im has reported directly  benefits small business. Ex-Im is also required to report annually (1) the  number of its transactions that directly benefit small business and (2) an  estimate of the number of small businesses Ex-Im indirectly supports as  suppliers to companies receiving Ex-Im financing.", "Ex-Im uses the Small Business Administration (SBA) methodology to  determine whether a company qualifies as a small business. SBA uses \u201csize  standards\u201d to identify the largest a company can be and still qualify as a  small business. SBA\u2019s size standards vary by industry, as defined by the  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which replaced  the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, and are typically  expressed in either millions of dollars or number of employees, reflecting  average annual receipts or average employment of a firm.", "To apply the size standards, Ex-Im obtains company information through  its application process. Ex-Im also subscribes to Dun and Bradstreet  (D&B), a commercial information vendor, which provides information  about companies, including sales and employment data and SIC codes. Ex- Im uses the SIC codes provided by D&B to obtain the corresponding NAICS  codes through the SBA Web site.", "The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 affects how Ex-Im budgets for and  reports on its various credit programs. It requires that Ex-Im (and other  government credit agencies) obtain budget authority to cover the cost to  the government of new or modified loans and loan guarantees. Prior to  credit reform, Congress annually provided budget authority for the face  value of authorized loans and the value of defaulted guarantees. Credit  reform requires agencies to estimate the cost to the government, over the  life of the credit, of the financing they provide. Broadly speaking, this cost  represents net losses to the government on a present value basis. By  focusing on the cost to the government, credit reform allows policy makers  to compare the costs of credit programs with each other and with  noncredit programs in making budget decisions.", "Ex-Im\u2019s financial statements are audited annually by an independent  accounting firm, which does not examine Ex-Im\u2019s reporting on the  calculation of its small business financing share.

Ex-Im\u2019s methodology for calculating its  small business financing is based on directly counting the value of small  business financing for transactions where the exporter can be identified  and estimating the small business value of transactions where the exporter  cannot be identified at the time Ex-Im authorizes the transaction.

For some  types of transactions, the amount of money authorized may be significantly  different from the amount of financing that the exporters actually utilize.  For most transactions, Ex-Im can identify the exporter at the time the  transaction is authorized and, in those cases, it bases its calculation on  whether the exporter qualifies as a small business under the SBA  definition. About one-quarter of the time, such as in cases where Ex-Im  provides an insurance policy to a bank, which in turn finances exports, Ex- Im cannot, when it approves the transaction, identify the company that will  be the exporter. In these cases, Ex-Im estimates the share of the financing  benefiting small business based on data regarding previous shipments  under those types of transactions.", "To determine the value of the small business share of its financing  authorized during a year, Ex-Im adds the value of small business financing  for the types of transactions where the exporter can be identified at the  time of authorization and the estimated small business value of the types of  transactions where the exporter cannot be identified at that time. To  determine the portion of financing directly supporting small business, Ex- Im divides this total by the total dollar value of all transactions authorized.  According to Ex-Im officials, they have used this general methodology for  calculating the small business portion since the late 1980s. (See fig. 3.)", "For transactions where the exporter can be identified, Ex-Im bases its  calculation on actual data on the value of the transaction and the  participants. For most of these transactions, Ex-Im generally counts 100  percent of the value of the transaction as benefiting small business if the  exporter is a small business. For medium- and long-term loans and  guarantees, only the amounts associated with small business suppliers to  small business exporters are counted as directly supporting small business.  Ex-Im officials noted that by not including the value of a transaction  associated with a nonsmall business supplier, the small business share is  reduced. They said this indicates Ex-Im\u2019s desire to not overrepresent its  direct support of small business. When the exporter is not a small business,  none of the value of the transaction is counted as directly supporting small  business.", "For transactions where the exporter is not known at the time Ex-Im  authorizes the transaction, Ex-Im estimates the small business share based  on data on the size of companies making shipments under these types of  transactions for a previous period. To make these estimates, Ex-Im  analyzes data on exports under each type of transaction and determines  whether each exporter is small, nonsmall, or unknown. For each type of  transaction, Ex-Im estimates the percentage of the value of shipments by  small businesses. Ex-Im divides the value of shipments made by small  business exporters by the sum of the shipments by small and nonsmall  business exporters. (Shipments by companies of unknown size are  excluded from the calculation.) Ex-Im applies this percentage to the value  of the entire year\u2019s authorized transactions of this type, resulting in its  estimate of the value of direct support for small business from that  transaction type.", "In some cases, these estimates of the small business share of authorized  transactions can differ significantly from the small business amounts  actually shipped under the authorizations. For example, in 2005 Ex-Im  authorized a $10 million short-term insurance policy under which no  shipments have been reported. In contrast, in 2005 Ex-Im also authorized a  $50 million short-term insurance policy where shipments under the policy  exceeded $87 million for a 6-month period (or $174 million on an  annualized basis). A 2004 authorization for Iraq provides another example.  In February 2004 Ex-Im issued a $250 million short-term bank-held  insurance policy involving Iraq. Using the methodology described above,  Ex-Im estimated that 21 percent of the value of bank-held insurance,  overall, would directly benefit small business, and thus credited  approximately $53 million of this authorization for Iraq to its accounting of  small business financing.

In other instances, other information in the paper transaction  files supported Ex-Im\u2019s designation of the company\u2019s small business status.

For both fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the value of shipments  under bank-held insurance policies was a fraction of the total authorized  value of the bank-held insurance policies. For example, according to Ex-Im  records, they authorized $3.4 billion of bank-held insurance transactions  for fiscal year 2004, but there were only $280 million in shipments under  bank-held insurance policies in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Ex-Im  applied its estimate of the small business share of transactions, based on  these shipments, to the $3.4 billion of bank-held insurance policies it  authorized during the year, and determined that about $720 million of the  authorized value of bank-held insurance policies during the year directly  benefited small business. Thus, this method results in estimates of small  business shares for the authorized value of these types of transactions that  are based on a very small share (about 8 percent) of the total authorized  value. Ex-Im officials stated that the difference between amounts  authorized and amounts actually shipped can be very large because banks  sometimes want as much flexibility as possible in the amount of insurance  they can provide and request that Ex-Im authorize large policies. Ex-Im  officials acknowledge that, as a result, the total authorized value of bank- held insurance transactions can be significantly greater than the value of  shipments under these policies.", "Second, Ex-Im classifies the small business status of a significant portion  of the companies making shipments as \u201cunknown\u201d and excludes them from  its calculation of the estimate of its small business support. For the $280  million of shipments under bank-held insurance discussed above, an Ex-Im  official reviewed the data and classified about $128 million (or nearly half)  as shipments by companies whose small business status was \u201cunknown.\u201d It  then excluded these shipments from its calculation of total shipments.", "For credit guarantee facilities, which account for about 1 percent of Ex- Im\u2019s small business financing, Ex-Im\u2019s system for calculating its small  business share led to errors.

Within the companies classified as \u201cunknown\u201d are some clearly large, easily  recognized companies.

First, Ex-Im\u2019s General Counsel stated  that, in establishing the requirement, Congress generally intended to ensure  that a specified percentage of Ex-Im\u2019s loan, guarantee, and insurance authority be available for small businesses. At the time the requirement  was created, Congress exercised control over Ex-Im\u2019s financing by  establishing specific dollar limitations (in annual appropriations acts) on  the value of transactions Ex-Im could approve during the year. Thus,  according to Ex-Im, doing the calculation on the basis of the authorized  value of transactions is reasonable based on the legislative history of the  provision.", "Second, Ex-Im officials stated that Ex-Im interprets and implements the  small business requirement in the broader context of Ex-Im\u2019s operation as a  demand-driven institution that provides financing to U.S. exporters who  apply for Ex-Im financing. Because of the demand-driven nature of its  business, Ex-Im has limited control over how much financing U.S.  exporters apply for each year or, consequently, how much financing it  provides during the year. Third, Ex-Im also implements the small business  financing requirement in the broader context of Ex-Im\u2019s other legislative  mandates to support U.S. exports and increase domestic employment.  Moreover, Ex-Im officials stated that, under Ex-Im\u2019s approach to  implementing the requirement, it has never had to turn down a small  business transaction due to a lack of funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Law Have Occurred Since Original Enactment of the Requirement", "paragraphs": ["Circumstances have changed since the small business financing  requirement was enacted that have affected how Ex-Im implements it.   Specifically, the removal of a direct congressional cap on annual Ex-Im  financing and enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed  how Congress exercised control over Ex-Im\u2019s financing activities. Prior to  credit reform, Ex-Im interpreted the mandate as requiring it to make  available for financing small business exports an amount equal to 10  percent of the aggregate principal amount of loans, guarantees and  insurance specified by Congress for that fiscal year. Following the  implementation of credit reform, the authority available, or the amount of  financing Ex-Im can provide during a year, is determined by the amount of  subsidy appropriation Ex-Im receives from Congress and the estimated subsidy cost to the government of each transaction. Some transactions do  not require a subsidy (or even make money), so the subsidy appropriation  covers the expected total net losses of all transactions during the year.  Thus, for the same amount of subsidy appropriation, Ex-Im could provide  different amounts of total financing depending on the characteristics of the  transactions it authorizes. It could authorize relatively few large, but risky  transactions, or it could authorize many smaller, less risky transactions.", "At the time the small business financing requirement was enacted,  Congress had historically specified in annual appropriations acts the total  principal amount of loans and guarantees that Ex-Im could provide. Ex-Im  could then make available for financing small business exports an amount  equal to the required percentage, regardless of the actual budget authority  utilized by Ex-Im by the end of the year. In these circumstances, Ex-Im  could easily determine how much financing it needed to make available for  small business to satisfy the requirement. However, in 1994 (and  subsequent years), Congress did not specify any limitation on the total  principal amount of loans, guarantees, and insurance that Ex-Im could  provide during the year. As a result, Ex-Im no longer has a specific, pre- determined, amount from which it could calculate the required percentage  to be made available for small business financing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While Ex-Im generally classifies companies\u2019 small business status correctly,  we identified several areas for improvement related to the processes and  data it uses to determine and report on its support of small business.

While  we did not determine whether these weaknesses result in Ex-Im  overstating or understating the value of its small business financing,  improvements are needed to address internal control weaknesses and  improve the reliability of Ex-Im\u2019s reporting on its small business financing.

In addition, it includes information on Ex-Im\u2019s  efforts to monitor and track its small business financing (see app. II) and  how Ex-Im estimates the share of its financing that indirectly supports  small business (see app. III).", "To analyze Ex-Im\u2019s methodology for calculating its direct support for small  business and the reliability of the data used in the calculation, we  interviewed knowledgeable Ex-Im staff, reviewed Ex-Im documentation  regarding the calculation, and analyzed data on Ex-Im transactions and  participants from fiscal years 2004 and 2005. To review the operation of Ex- Im data systems involved in the calculation of small business financing, we  interviewed knowledgeable Ex-Im officials and staff from Ex-Im\u2019s external  auditor (Deloitte & Touche), reviewed annual audit reports of Ex-Im\u2019s  financial statements, viewed a demonstration of the data systems, and  obtained detailed and summary data related to transactions from fiscal  years 2004 and 2005. We performed basic electronic tests of the data\u2019s  reliability, including determining whether the data fell within the expected  time periods, contained the types of transactions we expected, and were  generally comparable to Ex-Im\u2019s summary data from its Annual Reports.   On this basis, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  use in further analysis. We then identified the individual companies  involved in Ex-Im transactions and analyzed data on companies\u2019 industry  classifications (Standard Industrial Classification ), number of  employees, and annual revenues. We also reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s electronic  records for companies receiving financing in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to  identify whether there were any instances where Ex-Im\u2019s small business  designation for the same company differed in the insurance and loan and  guarantee databases. We identified the Small Business Administration\u2019s  (SBA) \u201csize standard\u201d for each company based on the SIC code in Ex-Im\u2019s  electronic records and applied the SBA methodology to Ex-Im\u2019s electronic  company records to determine how frequently Ex-Im\u2019s decision regarding  companies\u2019 small business status was supported by the data in Ex-Im\u2019s  databases.", "To test whether Ex-Im\u2019s classification of companies\u2019 small business status  is accurate, we drew a stratified random probability sample of 300  companies from a population of 2,755 companies receiving Ex-Im  financing in fiscal years 2004 or 2005, stratified by type of transaction. We  developed our list of 2,755 companies from a transaction-level data set  provided to us by Ex-Im by identifying all unique company identification  numbers and then checking to ensure that there was no repetition of  company names across the identification numbers. We stratified the  population into three types of transactions: loans and guarantees, nonbank- held insurance, and working capital guarantees. We obtained data  regarding the sampled companies\u2019 industry classification, employment, and  revenues from a commercial information vendor, Dun and Bradstreet  (D&B), which Ex-Im also uses to update its company records. We obtained  269 credible matches based on searches either for each company\u2019s DUNS  number or name. We then applied the SBA \u201csize standards\u201d to the Dun and  Bradstreet data for these companies to determine whether they qualify as  small businesses. We then compared these results to Ex-Im\u2019s small  business designation for each company. Three potential limitations could  affect this analysis: (1) the D&B data may be inaccurate or outdated, (2)  companies\u2019 small business status may have changed between the time Ex- Im authorized the transaction (2004 or 2005) and when we obtained the  D&B data (December 2005), and (3) Ex-Im\u2019s small business designation  may have been based on data not available to D&B.", "With our probability sample, each member of the study population had a  nonzero probability of being included and that probability could be  computed for any member. Each sample company was subsequently  weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the companies in the  population, including those who were not selected. Most estimates  provided in this report apply only to the subset of companies for which we  were able to obtain enough credible matching information in the D&B data  to determine a classification into small or nonsmall.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as  95 percent confidence intervals (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage points).  These are intervals that would contain the actual population values for 95  percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent  confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include  the true values in the study population.", "We also reviewed a selection of the 61 companies identified from our  statistical sample for which Ex-Im\u2019s small business designation did not  match the designation based on applying the SBA methodology to the D&B  data. This selection included companies involved in medium- and long-term  loans and guarantees, working capital transactions, and nonbank-held  insurance transactions. For these companies, we reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s paper  transaction files to (1) identify whether Ex-Im designated the company as a  small business and (2) determine what supporting documentation existed  regarding Ex-Im\u2019s designation.", "To determine the reliability of Ex-Im\u2019s estimates of small business financing  when the exporter is not known at the time of the transaction, we  interviewed Ex-Im staff and analyzed Ex-Im\u2019s data for fiscal years 2004 and  2005.

Similarly, Ex-Im recognized that it would rely on its customers to provide  information to develop the estimate and wanted to minimize the burden on  the customers.", "To establish a methodology, Ex-Im officials decided to examine a subset of  Ex-Im transactions, based on the term (i.e., short-term, medium-term, or  long-term) of the financing. Ex-Im considered analyzing the indirect  support for small business from all the short-term transactions for the year.  However, there are a large number (about 1,900 in fiscal year 2004) of these  transactions, so analyzing them all would require a significant amount of  resources. Additionally, a high percentage of short-term transactions  directly benefit small business, so an analysis of these transactions would  yield an unrealistically low amount of indirect support for small business.  Ex-Im also considered analyzing medium-term transactions, but since there  are a large number of such transactions (about 700 in fiscal year 2004),  such an analysis would still take a significant amount of resources.  Therefore, Ex-Im decided to analyze the indirect small business support  resulting from its long-term transactions. Ex-Im officials told us that  analyzing long-term transactions is appropriate because (1) there are a  small number of such transactions each year (42 in fiscal year 2004), (2) the  analysis would yield a \u201cwell-rounded\u201d view of Ex-Im\u2019s total support for  small business when combined with its data on its direct support of small  business, and (3) long-term transactions account for a significant share of  the value of Ex-Im\u2019s financing each year ($7.3 billion, or nearly half of the  value of all transactions for fiscal year 2004).", "Ex-Im officials said they have been estimating Ex-Im\u2019s indirect support of  small business since the 1980s and use three sources of information to  develop their estimate. These three sources of information are the  following:  Information directly from the primary exporter: Some of Ex-Im\u2019s  customers compile and provide data directly to Ex-Im regarding their  small business suppliers. According to Ex-Im officials, this happens  most frequently when the company is a large and well-established  company and collects a significant amount of information from its  suppliers. For instance, Boeing (a frequent Ex-Im customer) maintains a  variety of data on its suppliers and subcontractors and reports this  information to Ex-Im. According to Ex-Im, it based its estimate of  indirect support of small business solely on information directly from  the primary exporter for 19 of 42 long-term transactions for fiscal year  2004.", "Ex-Im analysis of the exporter\u2019s list of subcontractors or sub- suppliers: For each long-term transaction, Ex-Im customers must  submit a list of major contractors. The Ex-Im official assigned to the  transaction reviews this list and, among other things, identifies which of  the companies on the list is a small business by checking data on each  company\u2019s sales and employment in the Dun and Bradstreet database.  According to Ex-Im, it based its estimate of indirect support of small  business solely on its analysis of the exporter\u2019s list of major contractors  for 5 of 42 transactions for fiscal year 2004.", "Ex-Im officials\u2019 judgment: Ex-Im officials sometimes must use their  judgment to estimate the amount of indirect support for small business  associated with a transaction. According to Ex-Im officials, the Ex-Im  official assigned to the transaction can use his or her knowledge of the  exporter (including any past history of its indirect support of small  business), industry (including industry benchmarks regarding small  business contracting), and the specific details of the transaction.  According to Ex-Im, it based its estimate of indirect support of small  business solely on an Ex-Im officials\u2019 judgment for 10 of 42 transactions  for fiscal year 2004.", "According to Ex-Im, for some transactions, it estimates the amount of  indirect support for small business using a combination of sources of  information. For example, for fiscal year 2004, Ex-Im estimated the indirect  support of small business for four transactions based on a combination of  information directly from the primary exporter and Ex-Im\u2019s analysis of the  exporter\u2019s list of subcontractors or subsuppliers. For four other  transactions in fiscal year 2004, Ex-Im estimated the indirect support for  small business based on a combination of Ex-Im\u2019s analysis of the exporter\u2019s  list of subcontractors or subsuppliers and an Ex-Im official\u2019s judgment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Export-Import Bank", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Celia Thomas (Assistant  Director), Jason Bair, Eugene Beye, David Dornisch, Ernie Jackson, and  Bill Tuceling made key contributions to this report.
