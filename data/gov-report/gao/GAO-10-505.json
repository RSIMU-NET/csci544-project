In 2005 the Department of State (State) created the office of the United States Security Coordinator (USSC) to help the parties meet these obligations. GAO was asked to (1) describe the nature and extent of U.S. security assistance to the PA since 2007; (2) assess State's efforts to measure the effectiveness of its security assistance; and (3) describe factors that may affect the implementation of U.S. security assistance programs. GAO analyzed documents; interviewed officials and regional experts; and conducted fieldwork in Jerusalem, the West Bank, Israel, and Jordan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State has allocated about $392million to train and equip the PA security forces, oversee construction of related infrastructure projects, and develop the capacity of the PA during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. Of this total, State has allocated: (1) more than $160 million to help fund and support training, primarily for the PA's National Security Force (NSF); (2) approximately $89 million to provide nonlethal equipment; (3) about $99 million to renovate or construct several PA installations, including two of the operations camps it plans to provide; and (4) about $22 million to build the capacity of the Interior Ministry and its Strategic Planning Directorate. State also requested $150 million for its programs for fiscal year 2011. Although U.S. and international officials said that U.S. security assistance programs for the PA have helped to improve security conditions in some West Bank areas, State and USSC have not established clear and measurable outcome-based performance indicators to assess progress. Thus, it is difficult to determine how the programs support the achievement of security-related Roadmap obligations. U.S. officials attributed the lack of agreement on such performance indicators to a number of factors, including the relatively early stage of PA plans and capacity for reforming, rebuilding, and sustaining its security forces. Developing outcome-based indicators to measure and manage performance against program goals has been identified by GAO as a good management practice. Such indicators would help USSC provide objective and useful performance information for decision makers. State and USSC officials noted that they plan to incorporate performance indicators in a USSC campaign plan to be released in mid-2010. The implementation of the U.S. security assistance programs faces logistical constraints largely outside of U.S. control, and these implementation efforts outpace international efforts to develop the limited capacity of the PA police and justice sector. Logistical constraints include restrictions on the movement of USSC personnel in the West Bank, lack of a process to ensure approval and timely delivery of equipment, and difficulties in acquiring suitable land for infrastructure projects. State, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other international donors have been assisting the PA civil police and justice-sector reforms, although these efforts are not proceeding at the same pace as the security assistance programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1993, the U.S. government has committed more than $3.5 billion in  bilateral aid to the Palestinians, providing humanitarian, development, and  security assistance for the West Bank and Gaza.

Several U.S.  and international officials also noted the lack of spontaneous or organized  violence in PASF-controlled areas in response to the December 2008  through January 2009 Israeli incursion into Gaza was an indicator of the  PASF\u2019s growing capacity to anticipate and handle large scale  demonstrations and limit potential violence.", "Fewer Israeli government checkpoints. Several U.S. officials suggested  that the USSC also could point to some indicators as measures of the  growing effectiveness of USSC-supported security forces, including the  decline in the key manned Israeli security checkpoints in the West Bank.  However, the officials stated they could not independently verify the  validity or accuracy of the reported declines, nor would they directly  attribute these outcomes to USSC activities.", "Revived economic activity. According to PA and U.S. officials and  documents, the subsequent revival of private investment in Jenin, Hebron,  Bethlehem, and other areas where USSC-trained and -equipped PASF  battalions were deployed is another indicator that USSC assistance has  influenced the security situation, although a senior PA official noted that  PA fiscal policies may have also contributed to this revival.", "Improved public attitudes toward security forces. In addition, both  State and PA officials noted that Palestinian polling suggests people\u2019s  views of the PASF have improved, and a State report cited such a poll as  indicating growing understanding and confidence of the West Bank  populace in their security forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and USSC Officials Have Not Established Clear and Measurable Outcome-based Performance Indicators for PA Security Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Although State and USSC report on PASF program outputs such as the  number of personnel vetted, trained, and equipped, USSC has not defined  or established outcome-based performance measures to assess the  progress, impacts, and estimated costs of achieving USSC objectives. For  example, USSC documents and officials note that USSC objectives include  helping the PA create right-sized, professional security forces in support of  its Roadmap obligations but do not specify measurable outcome-based  program performance indicators. USSC and State officials attributed the  lack of clear and measurable outcome-based performance indicators and  their associated targets for their programs to three factors\u2014(1) changing  force requirements, (2) the early stages of PA planning and its limited  capacity to rebuild and sustain its security forces, and (3) lack of detailed  guidance from State about USSC program objectives, time frames, and  reporting requirements.", "First, the PA\u2019s planned force requirements have undergone several  revisions. According to a U.S. official, and as U.S. and PA documents  demonstrate, the planned size and composition of the NSF has changed  from seven special battalions (five in the West Bank, two in Gaza) in early  2007, to five special battalions solely in the West Bank after the Hamas  takeover of Gaza in June 2007. According to State officials and documents,  the PA increased the number of battalions for the West Bank from five to  seven by mid-2008, although the projected total number of personnel  remained at 3,500 as each battalion was reduced in size from 700 to 500  personnel in part to create smaller units better suited for the urban  environment in which they would operate. In 2009, the PA raised the  projected size of the NSF to 10 special battalions, according to USSC  officials. Some State officials and documents also noted that the PASF  has not clarified the role of the Presidential Guard and that some of its  units had assumed gendarmerie tasks beyond its original mandate, which  may overlap with NSF responsibilities.", "The revised and unclear requirements reflect that the parties to the  Roadmap agreement\u2014the PA and Israel\u2014have not agreed on common  measures to assess progress in meeting their Roadmap security  obligations, according to USSC officials. For example, a September 2008  USSC report noted that the Government of Israel and the PA have not  developed \u201ceffects-based metrics\u201d needed to define a successful PASF  security or counterterrorism effort under the Roadmap. State officials  stated that the Government of Israel prefers not to establish objectives or  measures that might limit its flexibility to conduct security operations  within the West Bank.", "Second, the PA\u2019s plans and capacity to reform, rebuild, and sustain its  security forces are still in a relatively early stage of development. As a  result, State and USSC officials said it is difficult to set outcome-based  targets to measure the progress or outcomes of their programs. For  example, the PA\u2019s capacity to direct its own transformation was lacking  until recently. According to a senior PA official, the Minister of the Interior  did not consolidate within the ministry the authority to request, accept,  and coordinate all foreign donor security assistance until August 2009.", "Third, USSC officials said that State did not give USSC a \u201cblueprint\u201d for  attaining defined and measurable objectives for its programs within a set  period of time, or for estimating the amount and type of resources needed  to achieve such USSC goals as aiding in the transformation of the PA  security sector and the creation of a professional, right-sized security  force. According to State, this stemmed from the absence of a  requirements-based budget allocation process for USSC programs until  2008. Since then, however, State officials said they required USSC and INL  to provide performance indicators beginning with the fiscal year 2009  Jerusalem mission strategic plan. Furthermore, a senior USSC official said  they had little incentive to emphasize or develop performance targets  because State had shown little interest in tracking performance in the past;  in fact, regular monthly reports from USSC to State on its activities  resumed only in November 2009 after a hiatus of more than a year.", "Despite these factors, deriving indicators to measure and manage  performance against an agency\u2019s results-oriented goals has been identified  by GAO as good management practice because it would help provide  objective and useful performance information for decision makers when  faced with limited resources and competing priorities. GAO has  previously reported that while agency managers encounter difficulties in  setting outcome-oriented goals or collecting useful data on expected  results in general, it is difficult to design effective strategies or measure  the impact of programs without them. State and USSC officials noted that  USSC was developing a campaign plan for release in mid-2010 to help the  Palestinians implement their own revised security strategy\u2014which was  still not released as of March 2010\u2013and expected the plan to incorporate  performance indicators to the extent possible. According to U.S. military  doctrine, effective planning cannot occur without a clear understanding of  the desired end state and the conditions that must exist to in order to end  the operation. Moreover, a campaign plan should provide an estimate of  the time and forces required to reach the conditions for mission success or  termination. Determining when conditions are met requires \u201cmeasures of  effectiveness,\u201d such as outcome-based performance measures. GAO has  reported on the importance of outcome-based performance indicators as a  key characteristic of effective national security strategy planning and a  necessary component of developing and executing campaign plans based  on these strategies (see list of related GAO products at end of report).", "Although the fiscal year 2010 Jerusalem mission strategic plan identifies  performance indicators for U.S. security assistance programs, the targets  to measure progress towards achieving these indicators focus on program  outputs rather than program outcomes. For example, the plan identified  the performance indicator \u201cbuilding Palestinian security capabilities\u201d to  assess progress toward achieving State\u2019s broader goal of reforming  Palestinian security forces to improve law and order and reduce  terrorism. However, this indicator is measured based on output targets  such as \u201ccompleting the training and equipping of at least one PG and one  NSF battalion\u201d in fiscal year 2008 rather than on outcomes such as  reduced terrorism as measured by, for example, changes in the number of  terrorist-related incidents or changes in crime rates. Moreover, neither the  performance plan nor USSC documents establish measurable outcome  targets for assessing progress towards such stated USSC objectives as  creating a \u201cright-sized, professional\u201d security force or helping the PA  transform its security sector. Nor do these plans and documents contain  information on expected time frames or estimated total costs for achieving  these goals.", "State and USSC officials acknowledged that it would be useful to describe  the impacts of U.S. security assistance on such outcomes as reductions in  the number of Israeli security checkpoints in the West Bank. Similarly,  they acknowledged it would be useful to tailor some survey questions to  establish baselines and assess over time the extent to which polling data  suggesting growing Palestinian confidence in their security can be  attributed to the conduct and actions of USSC-trained PASF personnel, but  noted the difficulty in separating the impact of U.S. security assistance  from the impact of such external factors as Israeli political and security  actions. In March 2010, State and USSC officials said that they had tasked  an officer to clarify how USSC activities achieve State objectives and to  improve reporting on USSC performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Security Assistance Programs Face Logistical Constraints and Outpace Development of the Rule of Law", "paragraphs": ["Logistical constraints on personnel movement and access, equipment  delivery, and acquisition of land for infrastructure projects challenge the  implementation of U.S. security assistance programs.

However, such  restrictions do not apply to personnel from other countries supporting the  USSC, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, according to State  officials. As a result, according to U.S. officials, USSC relies on non-U.S.  personnel to visit Palestinian security leaders on a daily basis, gauge local  conditions, and conduct training in the West Bank. Israeli security  checkpoints when traveling into and out of the West Bank border also  limit U.S. government personnel movement and access, according to U.S.  officials. For example, on more than one occasion, U.S. government  delegations, including staff from USSC and State, were prevented from  entering or exiting the West Bank, according to USSC and State officials.  PA officials also face movement and access difficulties crossing at Israeli  checkpoints when traveling into and out of the West Bank, which hampers  the ability of USSC to meet with PA outside of the West Bank."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Equipment Approval and Delivery", "paragraphs": ["While a process exists for equipment approval and delivery as shown in  figure 8, U.S. officials said problems affecting the approval and delivery of  equipment have hampered USSC\u2019s ability to equip the PASF in a timely  manner. USSC officials noted that without a significant effort at a higher  political level to streamline this process, delays will frequently occur with  little recourse available to USSC.", "Delays in equipment approval and delivery have occurred throughout this  process, for example:    Delays in approval. An absence of agreed-upon terms for the approval of  equipment requests, such as equipment specifications or a set timeframe  to make approval decisions, has resulted in delayed Israeli approval of  shipments of USSC and other donor equipment, according to U.S. and  other donor officials. For example, State and EU donor officials told us  that the Government of Israel has not agreed to specific procedures for  pre-approval of equipment orders as it prefers to continue to approve or  deny each equipment request on a case-by-case basis. According to an  Israeli official, each equipment request must be reviewed on its own  merits, as specifications can change. For example, an Israeli official stated  that although the Government of Israel had approved procurement of a  shipment of raincoats, it did not guarantee the approval of future  shipments of raincoats of comparable types and quantities. In addition,  because the parties have not agreed on time frames for submitting or  approving equipment requests, significant differences between the  amounts of time needed to approve various items have constrained USSC\u2019s  ability to estimate equipment delivery dates. For instance, some vehicles  ordered for the Presidential Guard and NSF 2nd Special Battalion in March  2008 were delivered in June 2008 while others were not delivered until  January 2009. On the other hand, USSC officials said in March 2010 that  the time needed to complete the approval process has declined from  approximately 3 months to 2 weeks for items that had been approved in  prior shipments by the Israeli government. Nevertheless, these officials  note there is no guarantee that previously approved items will continue to  be approved by the Government of Israel. For example, they noted that as  of November 2009 INL has paid at least $176,000 to store a $2.3 million  shipment of approximately 1,400 radios and associated gear that the Israeli  government approved for delivery, but was then impounded by Israeli  customs upon arrival in port in early 2009 after the Government of Israel  revoked this approval.", "Delays in delivery. Delays have occurred at Israeli customs and during  shipment into the West Bank, constraining USSC\u2019s mission of properly  equipping the NSF and Presidential Guard, according to officials we spoke  with. USSC officials stated that shipping items to Israel takes about 1  month by sea and as little as 1 day by air from the United States. However,  USSC officials also stated that while the time needed for Israeli customs to  approve shipments averages about 2 months, approval can take up to a  year or more for items that require modification by the Israelis in order to  pass Israeli customs inspections. For example, USSC officials noted that  vehicles and trailers were held up as Israeli customs required  modifications to their lights, brakes, and other specifications before they  would release them. According to an Israeli official, the PA also  contributes to the equipment delays at customs by not following the  shipment instructions in the approved requests. For example, in one case  equipment was shipped with other types of goods destined for the West  Bank and the quantity of equipment was lower than the approved amount.  In another case, the shipper consolidated a shipment of PASF items with  items for other customers. The increasing number of equipment deliveries  in 2009 has also added to the delays in clearing customs, according to the  Israeli government official. Additional unexpected delays in delivery have  occurred when Israeli customs inspectors have not released equipment  shipments they have approved, according to USSC and INL officials.  These officials told us that security inspections required at Israeli border  crossings and checkpoints in the West Bank have also delayed delivery.  USSC and INL officials noted that they have taken steps to improve their  ability to deliver equipment on time, including: developing standardized  NSF battalion equipment packages to minimize Israeli opportunities to  question equipment specifications; requiring the contracted freight  forwarder in Virginia to check every item against shipment manifests prior  to shipment; and making greater use of airfreight delivery. In addition,  USSC officials said they have shortened the lead times needed to procure  and ship equipment over time by pre-ordering items previously approved  by the Israelis to be included in later shipments.", "Moreover, USSC, INL, and PA officials and staff have found it difficult to  check on the status of the shipment or to hold parties accountable for  delays, according to USSC officials. These officials stated that conflict  appears to exist between various Israeli government departments related  to the equipping process, which periodically results in unexplained delays  in equipment release or approval. According to USSC, it is unclear with  whom USSC or PA officials should speak to seek redress for unexplained  equipment delays; as a result, delays are often elevated to high level U.S.  and Israeli officials, who then negotiate a resolution.   These delays have  hampered USSC\u2019s ability to equip the trained NSF and Presidential Guard  battalions in a timely manner. While the USSC planned to deliver  equipment to these battalions upon their graduation from JIPTC, some of  these battalions have operated for several months after graduation without  all of their needed equipment. For example, INL ordered equipment for the  PG 3rd battalion and NSF 2nd special battalion in December 2007 to be  distributed at the time of their May 2008 graduation; however, USSC and  INL officials noted that although these two battalions had received all of  their vehicles as of March 2010, they had yet to receive 14 percent of their  equipment. As of March 2010, the 3rd and 4th NSF special battalions that had  completed training in Jordan prior to December 2010 had received over 90  percent of their vehicles but only 44 to 50 percent of their other  equipment, according to State officials. These officials said that the 1st NSF  special battalion, which graduated in January 2010, had not received any  of the purchased vehicles and only 2 percent of its other equipment as of  March 2010.", "INL officials stated that these equipment shortfalls had not significantly  affected the ability of the NSF special battalions to operate once they were  deployed back to the West Bank.  However, they acknowledged that these  units had been deployed to the field lacking critical items, such as helmets,  armored vests, and communications gear, that had been proposed, and in  some cases procured, by the USSC and INL but had not been approved for  delivery by the government of Israel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constraints on Land Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["The completion of U.S.-funded infrastructure projects has been delayed by  constraints on acquiring land in the West Bank that are largely outside of  U.S. control, according to USSC, INL, and PA officials. Israel must approve  the location of all proposed facilities and does not set formal standards by  which locations are approved, according to USSC officials. These officials  also said the PA is largely limited to building in Oslo Area A, which is  solely under PA authority but comprises less than 20 percent of the West  Bank\u2019s territory. USSC officials also stated that it is difficult to determine  whether a proposed installation site includes land solely in Area A. In  addition, the Government of Israel requires that the proposed installation  sites must not be near Israeli settlements or access routes. After the  Government of Israel approves an installation site, USSC officials stated  they face a lengthy Palestinian process for establishing ownership rights  and obtaining legal title to the land. These officials noted that conflicting  land and property claims on the site also create a challenge to acquiring  land for PA infrastructure projects. Figure 9 depicts areas where the PA  usually can acquire land for security installations in the West Bank (area  A) and areas where it cannot (areas B and C).", "Because of these restrictions and delays, USSC and INL officials said  efforts to develop NSF operations camps beyond the two already under  construction remain stalled as of March 2010. Owing to delays in acquiring  suitable land for permanent camps and the need to house newly trained  battalions, USSC and INL officials said they have built temporary  operations camps. Similarly, because of delays in land acquisition, USSC  and INL cancelled renovation plans of an NSF facility in Alami and  redirected the funding to the Nuweimah facility, according to an INL  official. Originally designed to house 700 trainees, Nuweimah will be  expanded to house 2,000 trainees upon completion in fiscal year 2011. To  work around restricted property in certain urban areas, the USSC and INL  are planning to construct or renovate multistory buildings within urban- based security compounds known as muquata\u2019as. This effort is underway  or being planned for compounds in Tulkarm and other urban locations. As  a result, some U.S.-funded PASF centers are holding more troops than  originally planned and facilities are being built in a way that allows them  to be expanded upon if needed, according to USSC and INL officials.

Although  infrastructure exists, such as joint operation centers and prison facilities,  about 60 new police stations need to be rebuilt or constructed and existing  facilities need to be refurbished, according to a USSC document. The PCP  also have difficulties obtaining certain types of equipment, such as finger  printing equipment, radios, and personal protective equipment, according  to EUPOL COPPS. Also, the judicial police\u2014charged with serving court  orders, protecting judges and judicial facilities, and transporting  prisoners\u2014lack vehicles and operating capabilities outside of Ramallah,  according to a USSC report. According to a U.S. official, a decision was  made in 2008 to increase the size of the NSF in the West Bank from 5 to 10  NSF special battalions in part to compensate for the lack of PCP capacity.", "According to State and international officials, the NSF and the PCP do not  coordinate programs to a large extent. Although the NSF receives training  on operating with the PCP at JIPTC and PCP are trained on operating with  NSF at many different levels, including at USSC-sponsored courses, the  NSF and PCP coordination needs to be strengthened, according to U.S.  and other officials. While an INL official said the PA is taking efforts to  increase coordination between these two security forces through the  Interior Ministry\u2019s Strategic Planning Directorate, the PCP\u2019s lack of  communication equipment, such as radios, limits coordination. A EUPOL  COPPS official told us that it is difficult for the PCP to obtain radios and  frequencies and such a lack of communication equipment constrains the  building of a sophisticated and well-equipped civil police force.", "Justice sector capacity is limited. The PA justice sector still lacks  sufficient infrastructure, organization, and updated laws, according to PA,  U.S., and international documents and officials. Justice-sector  infrastructure, such as facilities and courts in each governorate, require  upgrades and improvements by 2011, according to USSC. U.S. and foreign  officials told us that to improve justice-sector organization, the PA needs  to more clearly define the roles of its government agencies. According to a  USSC report, cooperation between the elements of the criminal justice  system\u2014the courts, police, and prosecutors\u2014is poor. In addition, USSC  reported that the physical separation of government agencies within and  between governorates results in poor coordination. USSC further  reported that the lack of clarity and consistency in PA laws and the lack of  a working legislature also undermine PA civil police and justice-sector  capacity. USSC reported that the PASF, including the civil police, are  constrained in their ability to conduct security operations and to detain  persons who present a security threat and the justice sector is constrained  in convicting such persons because Palestinian laws on some related  issues are vague and sometimes contradictory. However, such laws cannot  be reviewed and updated until after a new Palestinian Legislative Council  is installed.", "Moreover, a State document noted that the civil police and justice-sector  capacity limitations have become a matter of greater concern as it has  become apparent that other donors are not providing the necessary civil  policing, justice-sector, and other pledged assistance necessary to keep  pace with the progress the U.S. security assistance programs are  achieving. According to U.S. and PA officials and documents, sustaining  the progress they have made with U.S. assistance in the security sector  may be difficult unless the lack of capacity in the civil police and the  justice sectors with which the USSC-supported security forces must  operate are addressed. To help address some of these gaps, State officials  said State had recently reinforced its role for facilitating coordination  among U.S. agencies and international donors for justice-sector issues.  Examples of U.S. and international justice-sector reform programs  include: the INL\u2019s Justice Sector Assistance Project, USAID\u2019s Rule of Law  and Justice Enforcement Program, EUPOL COPPS\u2019 civil police and rule of  law program, and the Canadian International Development Agency\u2019s  \u201cSharaka\u201d Program, as shown in table 3."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2007 through 2010, State allocated approximately $392  million in USSC assistance to support U.S. strategic goals and Roadmap  objectives in the Middle East, and has requested $150 million more for  fiscal year 2011.

To assess logistical constraints, we  reviewed relevant UN and State documents on access and movement; INL  and USSC documents on the logistics of providing equipment to the PA; and  met with USSC officials to discuss challenges in acquiring land for U.S.- funded infrastructure in the West Bank. To illustrate the U.S.-funded  equipment approval and delivery process, we developed a schematic  representation and identified points during which the process may  experience problems based on discussions with U.S., Israeli, and PA  officials. We consulted with INL and USSC officials and incorporated their  comments into our representation of the equipment approval and delivery  process. To assess the capacity of the PA police and justice sector and its  impact on U.S. security assistance, we reviewed documents from and met  with USSC, Israeli, PA, and international officials. To examine the pace of  U.S. and international assistance to the PA civil police and justice sector, we  also reviewed State documents and met with current PA police and justice  sector donors, including USAID, INL, and EUPOL COPPS.", "We conducted our work from July 2009 to May 2010 and in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.
