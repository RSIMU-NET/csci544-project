Although FDIC has made substantial improvements in its information system controls, GAO identified additional weaknesses that diminish FDIC's ability to effectively protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of its financial and sensitive information systems. These included weaknesses in electronic access controls, network security, segregation of computer functions, physical security, and application change control. Although these do not pose significant risks to FDIC's financial and sensitive systems, they warrant management's action to decrease the risk of unauthorized modification of data and programs, inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, or disruption of critical operations. A key reason for FDIC's weaknesses in information system controls is that it had not fully implemented a complete test and evaluation process, which is a key element of a comprehensive agency information security program with effective controls. Although FDIC has made substantial progress in implementing its information security program and has enhanced its process to test and evaluate its information system controls, it did not ensure that all key control areas supporting FDIC's financial environment are routinely reviewed and tested. These control areas included electronic access, network security, and audit logging."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Effective information system controls are essential to ensuring that  financial information is adequately protected from inadvertent or  deliberate misuse, fraudulent use, improper disclosure, or destruction.

Our review was performed in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress created FDIC in 1933 to restore and maintain public confidence  in the nation\u2019s banking system. The Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 sought to reform, recapitalize, and  consolidate the federal deposit insurance system. The act created the  Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, both of  which are responsible for protecting insured bank and thrift depositors.  The act also abolished the FSLIC and created the FSLIC Resolution Fund to  complete the affairs of the former FSLIC and liquidate the assets and  liabilities transferred from the former Resolution Trust Corporation. It also  designated FDIC as the administrator of these funds. As part of this  function, FDIC has an examination and supervision program to monitor the  safety of deposits held in member institutions.", "FDIC insures deposits in excess of $10 trillion for about 8,900 institutions.  Together, the three funds\u2014the Bank Insurance Fund, the Savings  Association Insurance Fund, and the FSLIC Resolution Fund\u2014have about  $52 billion in assets. FDIC had a budget of about $1.1 billion for calendar  year 2004 to support its activities in managing the three funds. For that  year, it processed more than 3.8 million financial transactions.", "FDIC relies extensively on computerized systems to support its financial  operations and store the sensitive information it collects. Its local and wide  area networks interconnect these systems. To support its financial  management functions, it relies on several financial systems to process and  track financial transactions that include premiums paid by its member  institutions and disbursements made to support operations. In addition,  FDIC uses other systems that maintain personnel information for its  employees, examination data for financial institutions, and legal  information on closed institutions. At the time of our review, about 6,200  individuals were authorized to use FDIC\u2019s systems. The corporation\u2019s key  official for computer security is the Chief Information Officer, who is  responsible for establishing, implementing, and overseeing a  corporatewide information security program.", "Information system controls are a critical consideration for any  organization that depends on computerized systems and networks to carry  out its mission or business. Without proper safeguards, there is risk that  individuals and groups with malicious intent may intrude into inadequately  protected systems and use this access to obtain sensitive information,  commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer  systems and networks.", "We have reported information security as a governmentwide high-risk area  since February 1997. Our previous reports, and those of agency inspectors  general, describe persistent information security weaknesses that place a  variety of federal operations, including those at FDIC, at risk of disruption,  fraud, and inappropriate disclosure.", "Congress and the executive branch have taken action to address the risks  associated with persistent information security weaknesses. In December  2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,  which is intended to strengthen information security, was enacted as Title  III of the E-Government Act of 2002. In addition, the administration  undertook important actions to improve security, such as integrating  information security into the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard.

Our  evaluation was based on (1) our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual (FISCAM), which contains guidance for reviewing  information system controls that affect the integrity, confidentiality, and  availability of computerized data and (2) our May 1998 report on security  management best practices at leading organizations, which identifies key  elements of an effective information security program.", "Specifically, we evaluated information system controls intended to  prevent, limit, and detect electronic access to computer resources (data,  programs, and systems), thereby protecting these resources against  unauthorized disclosure, modification, and use;  provide physical protection of computer facilities and resources from  espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft;   ensure that work responsibilities for computer functions are segregated  so that no one individual controls all key aspects of a computer-related  operation and thereby has the ability to conduct unauthorized actions or  gain unauthorized access to assets or records without detection by  another individual performing assigned responsibilities;  prevent the implementation of unauthorized changes to application or   ensure recovery of computer process operations and data in case of  disaster or other unexpected interruption; and  ensure an adequate information security program.", "To evaluate these controls, we identified and reviewed pertinent FDIC  security policies and procedures, guidance, plans, and reports. We also  discussed whether information system controls were in place, adequately  designed, and operating effectively with key security representatives,  system administrators, and management officials. In addition, we  conducted tests and observations of controls in operation and reviewed  corrective actions taken by the corporation to address vulnerabilities  identified in our audits for calendar years 2002 and 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDIC Has Made Significant Progress in Correcting Weaknesses and Implementing Controls", "paragraphs": ["FDIC has made significant progress in correcting previously reported  information system control weaknesses. Of the 22 weaknesses reported in  our 2003 audit, FDIC corrected 19 and is taking action to resolve the 3 that  remain. In addition, the corporation corrected the one weakness still open  from our 2002 audit. FDIC\u2019s actions included resolving weaknesses  related to its key access controls, network security, and monitoring  capabilities. For example, the corporation  restricted user access to critical financial and sensitive data and   strengthened security configurations of network devices, including  firewalls, routers, switches, and servers; and   enhanced its monitoring of security-relevant events by fully  implementing its intrusion detection system to monitor its computer  network traffic for unusual or suspicious access activities.", "In addition to addressing previously reported weaknesses, FDIC took other  steps to improve information security. For example, the corporation  strengthened its oversight of contractor connections to its network by  requiring contractors to develop security plans to protect these  connections and to perform periodic inspections of contractor facilities to  ensure security effectiveness. Further, FDIC established certification and  accreditation guidelines that outline requirements for performing this  process as part of each system\u2019s life cycle and certified and accredited each  of its key systems. In addition, the corporation updated its disaster  recovery procedures and has been routinely performing different types of  tests of its disaster recovery plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Information System Controls", "paragraphs": ["Although FDIC made substantial improvements in its information system  controls, we identified 20 additional weaknesses that diminish its ability to  effectively protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of its  financial and sensitive information and information systems.

Although these information system control weaknesses  do not pose significant risks to FDIC\u2019s financial and sensitive systems, they  warrant management\u2019s action to decrease the risk of unauthorized  modification of data and programs, inappropriate disclosure of sensitive  information, or disruption of critical operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Access Controls", "paragraphs": ["A basic management control objective for any organization is the  protection of its information systems and critical data from unauthorized  access. Organizations accomplish this objective by granting employees the  authority to read, create, or modify only those programs and data that they  need to perform their duties. Effective electronic access controls should be  designed to restrict access to computer programs and data and detect  unauthorized access. These controls include assigning user access rights  and permissions and reviewing audit logs to ensure that access privileges  are used appropriately.", "Although FDIC restricted access to programs and information, we found  instances in which access was not sufficiently controlled. For example,  about 250 users were inadvertently granted access to read, create, or  modify critical production programs and data for financial,  payroll/personnel, and bank regulatory systems. The risk of weakening  security access was further heightened because the access activities of  these users were not being logged for review. In addition, emergency  access accounts with broad system access to all critical system and  security resources intended to be used solely to manage problems or  emergencies that interrupt the system\u2019s 24-hour-a-day operation were  routinely used by four system and operations staff. Further, FDIC did not  configure security software to appropriately restrict, log, and monitor  access to certain sensitive system software libraries. As a result, increased  risk exists that individuals could circumvent security controls to read,  create, or modify critical or sensitive programs and data, possibly without  detection.", "In response to these weaknesses, FDIC\u2019s Chief Information Officer said  that they have taken steps to restrict access to critical financial data and  program and related sensitive information. Further, the corporation stated  that it has restricted access to sensitive system software libraries and plans  to generate monthly audit reports for review and follow-up action as  needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Network Security", "paragraphs": ["Networks are a series of interconnected devices and software that allow  individuals to share data and computer programs. Because sensitive  programs and data are stored on network servers or transmitted along  networks, effectively securing networks is essential to protecting  computing resources and data from unauthorized access, manipulation,  and use. Organizations secure their networks, in part, by installing and  configuring network devices that permit authorized network service  requests and deny unauthorized requests and by limiting the services that  are available on the network. Network devices include (1) firewalls  designed to prevent unauthorized access to and from the network, (2)  routers that filter and forward data along the network, (3) switches that  forward information among parts of a network, and (4) servers that host  applications and data. Network services consist of protocols for  transmitting data between network devices. In addition, effective network  controls, such as passwords, should be established to authenticate  authorized users who access the network from local and remote locations.  Since networks often provide the entry point for access to electronic  information assets, failure to secure them increases the risk of  unauthorized use of sensitive data and systems.", "Although FDIC\u2019s network controls were generally effective, we identified  instances where FDIC did not adequately secure specific network services  and devices or protect passwords. For example, database server  configurations for some of the corporation\u2019s financial applications were not  adequately secured. These servers had insecure settings that could have  allowed an unauthorized user to gain access without providing  authentication. In addition, FDIC did not have controls in place to  consistently ensure that data transmitted between network devices were  secure. Further, the passwords of local network administrators who had  broad system access privileges were not adequately secured. As a result,  increased risk exists that a malicious user could gain unauthorized access  to some of FDIC\u2019s sensitive network systems, read and modify sensitive  system data, and disrupt or deny computer processing services to  corporation employees.", "In response to these weaknesses, FDIC\u2019s Chief Information Officer said  that the corporation had taken steps to improve network security including  strengthening server settings, data transmission, and administrator  passwords."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical Security", "paragraphs": ["Physical security controls are important for protecting computer facilities  and resources from espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. These controls  involve restricting physical access to computer resources, usually by  limiting access to the buildings and rooms in which the resources are  housed and by periodically reviewing access rights granted to ensure that  access continues to be appropriate based on criteria established for  granting it. At FDIC, physical access control measures (such as guards,  badges, and locks, used either alone or in combination) are vital to  protecting computing resources and the sensitive data it processes from  external and internal threats.", "Although FDIC had taken numerous actions to strengthen its physical  security over its computing environment, certain weaknesses reduced its  effectiveness in protecting and controlling physical access to sensitive  work areas. For example, 4 employees and contractors had access to the  computer data center even though they had changed their job  responsibilities and no longer required this access. As a result, there is an  increased risk that unauthorized individuals could gain access to sensitive  computing resources and data and inadvertently or deliberately misuse or  destroy them.", "In response, FDIC\u2019s management plans to update procedures to ensure that  physical access to the data center is limited to authorized individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Segregation of Computer Functions", "paragraphs": ["Segregation of computer functions refers to the policies, procedures, and  organizational structure that helps ensure that one individual cannot  independently control all key aspects of a process or computer-related  operation and, thereby, gain unauthorized access to assets or records.  Often segregation of computer functions is achieved by dividing  responsibilities among two or more organizational groups. Dividing duties  among two or more individuals or groups diminishes the likelihood that  errors and wrongful acts will go undetected because the activities of one  individual or group will serve as a check on the activities of the others.  Inadequate segregation of computer functions increases the risk that  erroneous or fraudulent transactions could be processed, improper  program changes implemented, and computer resources damaged or  destroyed.", "Although computer responsibilities were generally properly segregated at  FDIC, we identified one instance in which responsibilities were not  adequately segregated: system administrators were also serving as  database administrators for systems that maintained FDIC\u2019s key financial  information. The risk associated with this weakness was further  heightened because these administrators could take full control over the  financial applications and databases that include audit and reconciliation  data. Consequently, there is an increased risk that these individuals could  perform unauthorized system activities without being detected.", "In response to this weakness, FDIC\u2019s Chief Information Officer said that  the corporation plans to segregate the duties of system and database  administrator functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Application Change Controls", "paragraphs": ["It is important to ensure that only authorized and fully tested application  programs are placed in operation.

Our May 1998 study of security management best practices determined  that a comprehensive information security program is essential to ensuring  that information system controls work effectively on a continuing basis.  Also, FISMA, consistent with our study, requires an agency\u2019s information  security program to include certain key elements. These elements include  a central information security management structure to provide overall  security policy and guidance along with oversight to ensure compliance  with established policies and reviews of the effectiveness of the  information security environment;  periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of the harm that could  result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of information and information systems;  policies and procedures that (1) are based on risk assessments, (2) cost  effectively reduce risks, (3) ensure that information security is  addressed throughout the life cycle of each system, and (4) ensure  compliance with applicable requirements;  security awareness training to inform personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems, of information security risks  and their responsibilities in complying with agency policies and  procedures; and  a process of tests and evaluations of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices relating to management,  operational, and technical controls of every major information system  identified in the agency\u2019s inventories.", "FDIC has made substantial progress in establishing a comprehensive  information security program. The corporation strengthened its central  information security management structure by providing additional staff  resources to oversee the program. Further, the corporation initiated a  program to routinely perform risk assessments on all major systems. In  addition, FDIC updated its overall security policies covering network  security, computer center access, and security management and it  developed security plans for all key systems. Also, the corporation  continued to enhance its security awareness program by adding specialized  training for selected technical staff.", "Although FDIC enhanced its process to test and evaluate its information  system controls, it did not ensure that all key control areas supporting the  corporation\u2019s financial environment were routinely reviewed and tested.  These areas included electronic access controls, network security, and  audit logging. During the past year, FDIC strengthened its test and  evaluation process to cover additional key information system control  areas, provide for independent tests of corrective actions, and assess and  test newly-identified weaknesses and emerging security threats. Although  FDIC established a process to test and evaluate network and mainframe  information system controls, its program did not include routine  evaluations of network desktop and database application controls. Further,  the process did not include comprehensive tests to ensure that electronic  access to key financial programs and data (1) were restricted to only those  users who need it to perform their job functions and (2) had appropriate  audit logs maintained to record security-relevant events for subsequent  review. Without routine tests and evaluations of all key information system  control areas, FDIC will have limited assurance that its financial and  sensitive information is adequately protected.", "Incorporating these key areas into its test and evaluation process should  allow FDIC to better identify and correct security problems, such as those  identified in our 2004 audit. Further, the corporation\u2019s implementation of  new financial systems in the coming year will significantly change the  nature of its information systems environment and of the related  information systems controls necessary for their effective operation.
