In contrast, benefits from defined  contribution plans are based on the contributions to and the performance  of the investments in individual accounts, which may fluctuate in value.  Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k) profit-sharing and  thrift-savings plans, stock bonus plans, and annuity plans.", "Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) oversees  401(k) plans\u2014including the fees associated with running the plans\u2014 because they are considered employee benefit plans under ERISA.  Enacted before 401(k) plans came into wide use, ERISA establishes the  responsibilities of employee benefit plan decision makers and the  requirements for disclosing and reporting plan fees. Typically, the plan  sponsor is a fiduciary. A plan fiduciary includes a person who has  discretionary control or authority over the management or administration  of the plan, including the plan\u2019s assets.

Generally  there are two ways to provide services: \u201cbundled\u201d (the sponsor hires one  company that provides the full range of services directly or through  subcontracts) and \u201cunbundled\u201d (the sponsor uses a combination of service  providers).", "Fees are one of many factors\u2014such as the historical performance and  investment risk for each plan option\u2014participants should consider when  investing in a 401(k) plan because fees can significantly decrease  retirement savings over the course of a career.

Industry professionals suggested that comparing the  expense ratio across investment options is the most effective way to  compare fees within a 401(k) plan.

Labor does this in a number of  ways, including collecting some information on fees from plan sponsors,  investigating participants\u2019 complaints or referrals from other agencies on  questionable 401(k) plan practices, and conducting outreach to educate  plan sponsors about their responsibilities.", "However, the information plan sponsors are required to report to Labor is  limited, and the lack of information hinders the agency\u2019s ability to  effectively oversee fees. Many of the fees are associated with the  individual investment options in the 401(k) plan, such as a mutual fund;  they are deducted from investment returns and not included on the annual  reporting form plan sponsors submit to Labor, Form 5500. As a result, the  Form 5500 does not include the largest type of fee, even though plan  sponsors receive this information from the mutual fund companies in the  form of a prospectus. In 2004, the ERISA Advisory Council concluded that  Form 5500s are of little use to policy makers, government enforcement  personnel, and participants in terms of understanding the cost of a plan  and recommended that Labor modify the form and its accompanying  schedules so that all fees incurred directly or indirectly can be reported or  estimated. Without information on all fees, Labor\u2019s oversight is limited  because it is unable to identify fees that may be questionable.", "Labor and plan sponsors also may not have information on arrangements  among service providers that could steer plan sponsors toward offering  investment options that benefit service providers but may not be in the  best interest of participants. For example, the SEC released a report in  May 2005 that raised questions about whether some pension consultants  are fully disclosing potential conflicts of interest that may affect the  objectivity of the advice. Plan sponsors pay pension consultants to give  them advice on matters such as selecting investment options for the plan  and monitoring their performance and selecting other service providers,  such as custodians, administrators, and broker-dealers. The report  highlighted concerns that these arrangements may provide incentives for  pension consultants to recommend certain mutual funds to a 401(k) plan  sponsor and create conflicts of interest that are not adequately disclosed  to plan sponsors. Plan sponsors may not be aware of these arrangements  and thus could select mutual funds recommended by the pension  consultant over lower-cost alternatives. As a result, participants may have  more limited investment options and may pay higher fees for these options  than they otherwise would.", "In addition, specific fees that are considered to be \u201chidden\u201d may mask the  existence of a conflict of interest. Hidden fees are usually related to  business arrangements where one service provider to a 401(k) plan pays a  third-party provider for services, such as record keeping, but does not  disclose this compensation to the plan sponsor. For example, a mutual  fund normally provides record-keeping services for its retail investors, i.e.,  those who invest outside of a 401(k) plan. The same mutual fund, when  associated with a plan, might compensate the plan\u2019s record keeper for  performing the services that it would otherwise perform, such as  maintaining individual participants\u2019 account records and consolidating  their requests to buy or sell shares.", "The problem with hidden fees is not how much is being paid to the service  provider, but with knowing what entity is receiving the compensation and  whether or not the compensation fairly represents the value of the service  being rendered. Labor\u2019s position is that plan sponsors must know about  these fees in order to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities. However, if the  plan sponsors do not know that a third party is receiving these fees, they  cannot monitor them, evaluate the worthiness of the compensation in view  of services rendered, and take action as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Has Several Initiatives Under Way to Improve Information It Has on Fees and the Various Business Arrangements Among Service Providers", "paragraphs": ["Labor officials told us about three initiatives currently under way to  improve the disclosure of fee information by plan sponsors to participants  and to avoid conflicts of interest:    Labor is considering promulgating a rule regarding the fee information  required to be furnished to participants in plans where sponsors have  elected liability protection.

To better enable the agency to effectively  oversee 401(k) plan fees, we recommended that the Secretary of Labor  should require plan sponsors to report a summary of all fees that are paid  out of plan assets or by participants. To allow plan sponsors, and  ultimately Labor, to provide better oversight of fees and certain business  arrangements among service providers, we also recommended that  Congress should consider amending ERISA to explicitly require that  401(k) service providers disclose to plan sponsors the compensation that  providers receive from other service providers. In response to our draft  report, Labor generally agreed with our findings and conclusions.  Specifically, Labor stated that it will give careful consideration to GAO\u2019s  recommendation that plans be required to provide a summary of all fees  that are paid out of plan assets or by participants.
