Last year we  reported that AEHF and WGS had worked through the bulk of their  technical problems. Since our testimony, the first WGS satellite was  launched, but the AEHF program experienced technical problems with  hardware components that have pushed back its first launch date by 6  months. Also, this year, as described below, we found that NPOESS and  SBIRS still face very high risks, even after recent acquisition replanning  efforts. Further, GPS IIF has experienced additional technical problems.", "SBIRS continues to face cost and schedule setbacks. Software problems  have recently delayed the first satellite launch by about a year, which will  likely increase the program\u2019s overall delay to roughly 7 years. Correcting  the problems may necessitate hardware and software changes that could,  according to the Air Force, also drive cost increases up to $1 billion, which  would be in addition to the $6 billion cost growth already incurred.  Management-reserves expenditure continues at an unsustainable rate.  Program officials acknowledge that management reserves set aside to fix  unexpected problems will likely be depleted in early 2009, even though the  reserves were intended to last through 2012. Given the complexity of the  SBIRS satellites, it is possible that further design flaws may be discovered,  leading to more cost and schedule increases. If management reserves are  depleted and not replenished, the program will likely experience further  cost and schedule problems.", "In July 2007, the NPOESS program finalized its restructure in response to a  Nunn-McCurdy (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2433) program acquisition unit breach of the  critical cost growth threshold. The restructure included about an  additional $4.1 billion, or about a 49 percent, life-cycle cost increase for  fewer satellites to be acquired, delays in satellite launches, and deletions  or replacements of satellite sensors. The restructure also included  removing 7 of the original 14 critical technologies from the program.  Furthermore, 3 of the remaining technologies remain immature and the  program continues to experience development problems, increasing risks  of further problems. At this point, the program has seen a 153 percent unit  cost increase.", "The GPS IIF program has faced technical challenges in completing  development and production, causing another schedule delay in the  launch of the first IIF satellite\u2014over a 2-year slip from the original launch  Not all of DOD\u2019s space programs are facing the problems being  experienced by GPS, NPOESS, and SBIRS. For example, the Navy\u2019s Mobile  User Objective System (MUOS), another communications satellite  program, is meeting cost and schedule goals. Further, as discussed later in  this testimony, newer Air Force acquisition efforts such as the  Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) and Space  Radar have been taking actions to ensure they can meet their cost and  schedule goals, though their funding has been reduced in light of overall  affordability of space acquisitions. These two efforts were highly complex  and ambitious and were predicted to be the most expensive military  satellite developments ever.", "In addition, in December 2005, the Air Force was directed to begin efforts  to develop competing capability in parallel with the SBIRS program; this  effort was previously known as the Alternative Infrared Satellite System  (AIRSS). We reported in September 2007 that DOD had not positioned the  AIRSS effort for success. DOD agreed, and revised the effort\u2019s  development strategy to reflect best practices. The effort has a new name,  the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (Third Gen), and is now a  follow on to the SBIRS program. The first sensor prototypes are expected  later this month.", "Lastly, our annual weapons system assessment this year will be reporting  on challenges faced by the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV)  program, as the two providers\u2014Boeing and Lockheed Martin\u2014undertake  a joint venture that will provide U.S. government launches of medium- to  heavy-lift rockets. The consolidation of production, engineering, test, and  launch operations under the joint venture, called the United Launch  Alliance or ULA, is expected to yield cost savings in the future, but when  and how much remains unknown. ULA expects the consolidation to be  nearly complete by the end of 2010, but there are preliminary indications  that some elements of the consolidation are falling behind schedule.", "Furthermore, the Air Force revised its acquisition and contracting strategy  for EELV in 2005, which among other things increased program office  oversight responsibilities. The change in contracting strategy created new  data analysis activities for the program and expanded the types of  expertise needed by the program office to utilize the new information  provided by contractors. Despite its increased responsibilities, the  program office is experiencing staff reductions and expects staffing  vacancies to continue in the near term. The current military staff lacks  some of the technical expertise needed to fully analyze contractor  performance data now being collected under the new contracting strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Causes of Acquisition Problems in Space Programs", "paragraphs": ["Our work has identified a variety of reasons for this cost growth, most  notably that weapons programs are incentivized to produce and use  optimistic cost and schedule estimates in order to successfully compete  for funding.

Moreover, problematic implementation of an  acquisition strategy in the 1990s, known as Total System Performance  Responsibility, for space systems resulted in losses of technical expertise  and weaknesses in contracting strategies that space programs are still  dealing with the effects of."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Needed to Address Space and Weapon Acquisition Problems", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, we have identified best practices that DOD space  programs can benefit from. DOD has taken a number of actions to address  the problems that we have reported on. These include initiatives at the  department level that will affect its major weapons programs, as well as  changes in course within specific Air Force programs. Although these  actions are a step in the right direction, additional leadership and support  are still needed to ensure that reforms that DOD has begun will take hold.", "Our work\u2014which is largely based on best practices in the commercial  sector\u2014has recommended numerous actions that can be taken to address  the problems we identified. Generally, we have recommended that DOD  separate technology discovery from acquisition, follow an incremental  path toward meeting user needs, match resources and requirements at  program start, and use quantifiable data and demonstrable knowledge to  make decisions to move to next phases. We have also identified practices  related to cost estimating, program manager tenure, quality assurance,  technology transition, and an array of other aspects of acquisition program  management that space programs could benefit from. Table 1 highlights  these practices; appendix II provides more detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constructive Actions Are Being Taken", "paragraphs": ["DOD is attempting to implement some of these practices for its major  weapons programs. For example, we recently reported that DOD released  a strategy to enhance the role of program managers in carrying out its  major weapon system acquisitions. As part of this strategy, DOD  established a policy that requires formal agreements among program  managers, their acquisition executives, and the user community intended  to set forth common program goals. In addition, DOD plans a variety of  actions to enhance development opportunities, provide more incentives,  and arrange knowledge-sharing opportunities for its program managers.  Within this strategy, the department also acknowledged that any actions  taken to improve accountability must be based on a foundation from  which program managers can launch and manage programs toward  greater performance, and must include an overarching strategy and  decision-making processes that prioritize programs based on a match  between customer needs and available resources. DOD highlighted several  initiatives that, if adopted and implemented properly, could provide such a  foundation. Some of these include establishing an early decision gate to  review proposed programs at the concept stage, testing portfolio  management approaches in selected capability areas and using capital  budgeting accounts for programs in development.", "Additionally, as we reported previously, the Air Force adopted a \u201cback to  basics\u201d approach for space designed to reduce technology risk and ensure  programs were more executable. Specifically, for its TSAT and Space  Radar acquisition efforts, the Air Force committed to delaying product  development until critical technologies could be demonstrated to work in  a relevant environment. This stood in sharp contrast to previous programs,  started with immature technologies, such as NPOESS and SBIRS.", "The Air Force also committed to deferring more ambitious technology  efforts associated with these efforts to science and technology  organizations until they are ready to be added to future increments. TSAT,  for example, deferred the wide-field of view multi-access laser  communication technology, and contributed about $16.7 million for \u201coff- line\u201d maturation of this technology that could be inserted into future  increments. It laid out incremental advances in other capabilities over two  increments. Space Radar has deferred lithium-ion batteries, more efficient  solar cells, and onboard processing for its first increment, and like TSAT,  contributed toward their development by space and technology  organizations. Further, both efforts have used systems engineers to help  determine achievability of requirements.", "In our experience, the Navy has tended to follow good acquisition  practices for its space programs, especially in relation to keeping  technology risks out of programs. The Navy\u2019s Mobile User Objective  System (MUOS) is an example. Specifically, the MUOS acquisition effort  began development with almost all of its critical technologies mature.  Additionally, about 95 percent of design drawings had been completed at  the critical design review milestone in March 2007. Since MUOS\u2019s  development start in September 2004, the program has been meeting its  overall cost and schedule goals, with the first satellite expected to become  operational in March 2010.", "Furthermore, the Air Force, U.S. Strategic Command, and other key  organizations have made progress in implementing the Operationally  Responsive Space (ORS) initiative. This initiative encompasses several  separate endeavors with a goal to provide short-term tactical capabilities  as well as identifying and implementing long-term technology and design  solutions to reduce the cost and time of developing and delivering simpler  satellites in greater numbers. ORS provides DOD with an opportunity to  work outside the typical acquisition channels to more quickly and less  expensively deliver these capabilities. In performing a review of ORS for  this committee, we found that DOD has made progress in putting a  program management structure in place for ORS as well as executing ORS- related research and development efforts, which include development of  low-cost small satellites, common design techniques, and common  interfaces.", "Other parts of DOD are also moving towards space programs with less risk  and that have a greater chance of being more successful. The Missile  Defense Agency\u2019s Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS)  program office is seeking an operational constellation that would be easier  to produce than originally envisioned for the constellation. The new  development approach for the constellation would involve no technology  breakthroughs or scientific discovery, and the program office wants to  scale the system design so that it will only require only a 5- to 6-year build  cycle.", "DOD has also pushed back the decisions to start the TSAT and Space  Radar acquisitions so it could reformulate their acquisition schedules and  approaches to make them more affordable within DOD\u2019s overall space  portfolio. For example, TSAT is currently being assessed by the Office of  the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to better ensure that proposed future  funding levels for TSAT are affordable in the near term. In the meantime,  the program office is continuing to fund risk-reduction efforts between  two separate contractors to further reduce overall risk in TSAT. Similarly,  the Space Radar program office told us that it is adjusting its acquisition  approach to better balance affordability through incremental evolution of  the Space Radar capability. In both of these cases, DOD will likely be  better positioned with acquisition programs that are more affordable and  executable in terms of meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions Needed", "paragraphs": ["The actions that the Air Force and OSD have been taking to address  acquisition problems are good first steps. The back to basics policy and  ORS, in particular, represent significant shifts in thinking about how space  systems should be developed as well as commitment from senior  leadership. But, there are still more, significant changes to processes,  policies, and support needed to ensure reforms can take hold.", "First, while DOD pilot initiatives related to portfolio management are  targeted at addressing funding pressures, there has not been a real  commitment to prioritizing investments across DOD. For the past several  years, we have emphasized that DOD starts more space and weapon  programs than it can afford, creating a competition for funding that  encourages low cost estimating, optimistic scheduling, overpromising,  suppressing of bad news, and, for space programs, forsaking the  opportunity to identify and assess potentially better alternatives. Programs  focus on advocacy at the expense of realism and sound management.  Invariably, with too many programs in its portfolio, DOD is forced to  continually shift funds to and from programs\u2014particularly as programs  experience problems that require additional time and money to address.  Such shifts, in turn, have had costly, reverberating effects. This year,  significant cuts were made to several major space programs including  TSAT, Space Radar, and STSS largely in light of the realization that new,  expensive programs were not affordable at a time when DOD was  attempting to upgrade other capabilities and still contending with  problematic programs like SBIRS. In the case of TSAT, resulting delays in  capability could have a dramatic effect on other new programs, such as  the Army\u2019s Future Combat System, which were counting on TSAT-like  capabilities to enhance their performance.", "Second, as we have testified before, space programs are facing capacity  shortfalls. These include shortages of staff with science and engineering  backgrounds as well as staff with program-management and cost- estimating experience. Several of our reviews of major space programs  have cited shortages of personnel as a key challenge that increases risk for  the program, specifically in technical areas. In addition, during our review  of DOD\u2019s space cost estimating function, Air Force space cost-estimating  organizations and program offices said that they believed their cost- estimating resources were inadequate to do a good job of accurately  predicting costs. Because of the decline in in-house cost-estimating  resources, space program offices and Air Force cost-estimating  organizations are now more dependent on support contractors. We  recognize that there are actions being taken to strengthen the space  acquisition workforce, but we have not yet seen the condition get much  better at the individual program office level.", "Our past work has also pointed to capacity shortfalls that go beyond  workforce. For example, in 2006, we reported that cost-estimation data  and databases are incomplete, insufficient, and outdated. And in previous  testimonies, we pointed to limited opportunities and funding for space  technologies, and the lack of low-cost launch vehicles. The ORS initiative  is designed to help alleviate shortfalls in launch and testing resources, but  one concern raised in interviews with launch providers was that there was  still not enough investment being directed toward low-cost launch.", "Furthermore, policies that surround space acquisition need to be further  revised to ensure best practices are instilled and sustained. For example,  DOD\u2019s space acquisition policy does not require that acquisition efforts  such as TSAT and Space Radar achieve a technology readiness level (TRL)  6 (that is, testing in a relevant environment) or higher for key technologies  before being formally started\u2014key decision point B (KDP B). Instead, the  policy suggests that TRL 6 be achieved later\u2014at preliminary decision  review (KDP C) or soon after. In fact, the back to basics approach that was  adopted by the Air Force has not been incorporated into DOD\u2019s  space  acquisition policy. Given that there are many pressures and incentives that  are driving space and other weapon programs to begin too early and to  drive for dramatic rather than incremental leaps in capability, DOD needs  acquisition policies that ensure programs have the knowledge they need to  make investment decisions and that DOD and Congress have a more  accurate picture of how long and how much it will take to get the  capability that is being promised. In addition, although the policy requires  that independent cost estimates be prepared by bodies outside the  acquisition chain of command, it does not require that they be relied upon  to develop program budgets. Officials within the space cost-estimating  community also believed that the policy was unclear in defining roles and  responsibilities for cost estimators. We continue to recommend changes  be made to the policy\u2014not only to further ingrain the shift in thinking  about how space systems should be developed, but to ensure that the  changes current leaders are trying to make can be extended beyond their  tenure.", "Last, while DOD is planning many new practices that will provide program  managers with more incentives, support and stability, the overall  environment within which program managers perform their work is very  difficult to change simply with policy initiatives. Policies similar to the one  DOD issued in 2007 to increase accountability of program managers have  existed for some time, but according to DOD and Air Force officials, they  have not always been practiced. For example, while DOD policy provides  for program managers of major defense acquisition programs to serve as  close to a 4-year tenure as practicable, many serve for only 2 years. One  example is the SBIRS program, which has had six program managers in 12  years. In fact, our work has shown that rather than lengthy assignment  periods between key milestones as suggested by best practices, many of  the programs we have reviewed had multiple program managers within  the same milestone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In conclusion, senior leaders managing DOD\u2019s space portfolio are clearly  working in a challenging environment. There are pressures to deliver new,  transformational capabilities, but problematic older satellite programs  continue to cost more than expected, constrain investment dollars, pose  risks of capability caps, and thus require more time and attention from  senior leaders than well-performing efforts. To best mitigate these  circumstances and put future programs on a better path, DOD needs to  continue with the actions it has begun undertaken. However, these  measures should be complemented by realistic estimating of what it will  take to complete space programs, prioritizing programs for investment,  and strengthening DOD acquisition policy for space. At the same time,  DOD should ensure its ORS program is well-supported and focused on  alleviating capability gaps as well as developing longer-term solutions for  space programs. Taken together, such actions, with the support of  Congress, should help senior leaders negotiate acquisitions in a  challenging environment and ensure their commitments to reform can be  sustained into the next administration.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.

In effect, the companies evolve products,  continuously improving their performance as new technologies and methods allow. These  evolutionary improvements to products eventually result in full desired capability, but in multiple  steps, delivering enhanced capability to the customer more quickly through a series of interim  products.

These cover critical facets of the  program such as cost, schedule, technology readiness, design readiness, production readiness, and  relationships with suppliers. Development is not allowed to proceed until certain thresholds are met,  for example, a high proportion of engineering drawings completed or production processes under  statistical control. Program managers themselves place high value on these requirements, as it  ensures they are well positioned to move into subsequent phases and are less likely to encounter  disruptive problems.", "The organizations we have studied empower program managers to make decisions on the direction  of the program and to resolve problems and implement solutions. The program managers can make  trade-offs among schedule, cost, and performance features, as long as they stay within the confines  of the original business case.
