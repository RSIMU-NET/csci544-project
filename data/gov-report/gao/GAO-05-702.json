Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop, by September 2005, a well-defined business enterprise architecture (BEA) and a transition plan. GAO has made numerous recommendations to assist the department in successfully doing so. As part of ongoing monitoring of the architecture, GAO assessed whether the department had (1) established an effective governance structure; (2) developed program plans, including supporting workforce plans; (3) performed effective configuration management; (4) developed well-defined BEA products; and (5) addressed GAO's other recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To effectively and efficiently modernize its nonintegrated and duplicative business operations and systems, it is essential for DOD to develop and use a well-defined BEA. However, it does not have such an architecture, and the products that it has produced do not provide sufficient content and utility to effectively guide and constrain ongoing and planned systems investments. As a result, despite spending almost 4 years and about $318 million, DOD does not have an effective architecture program. The current state of the program is due largely to long-standing architecture management weaknesses that GAO has made recommendations over the last 4 years to correct. In particular, DOD has not done the following: (1) established an effective governance structure, including an effective communications strategy, to achieve stakeholder buy-in. In particular, the structure that has been in place since 2001 lacks the requisite authority and accountability to be effective, and the key entities that made up this structure have not performed according to their respective charters; (2) developed program plans that explicitly identify measurable goals and outcomes to be achieved, nor has it defined the tasks to be performed to achieve the goals and outcomes, the resources needed to perform these tasks, or the time frames within which the tasks will be performed. DOD also has not assessed, as part of its program planning, the workforce capabilities that it needs in order to effectively manage its architecture efforts, nor does it have a strategy for doing so; (3) performed effective configuration management, which is a formal approach to controlling product parts to ensure their integrity. The configuration management plan and the charter for the configuration control board are draft; the board has limited authority; and, after 4 years of development, the department has not assigned a configuration manager; (4) developed a well-defined architecture. The latest versions of the architecture do not include products describing the \"As Is\" business and technology environments and a transition plan for investing in business systems. In addition, the versions that have been produced for the \"To Be\" environment have not had a clearly defined purpose and scope, are still missing important content, and contain products that are neither consistent nor integrated; and (5) fully addressed other GAO recommendations. DOD recognizes that these weaknesses need to be addressed and has recently assigned a new BEA leadership team. DOD also has either begun steps to or stated its intentions to (1) revise its governance structure; (2) develop a program baseline, by September 30, 2005, that will be used as a managerial and oversight tool to allocate resources, manage risks, and measure and report progress; and (3) revise the scope of the architecture and establish a new approach for developing it. However, much remains to be accomplished to establish an effective architecture program.

To help DOD transform  its operations, we recommended in 2001 that the department develop an  enterprise architecture to guide and constrain its multibillion dollar annual  investment in business systems. In July 2001, the department initiated a  business management modernization program to, among other things,  develop a business enterprise architecture (BEA).", "Recognizing the importance of DOD\u2019s efforts to transform its business  operations and systems through the use of an enterprise architecture,  Congress included provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2003 aimed at having the department develop and effectively  implement a well-defined BEA.

In fiscal year 2004, the  department reported that its operations involved $1.2 trillion in assets, $1.7  trillion in liabilities, over 3.3 million military and civilian personnel, and  over $605 billion in net cost of operations. For fiscal year 2005, the  department received appropriations of about $417 billion. Moreover,  execution of its operations spans a wide range of defense organizations,  including the military services and their respective major commands and  functional activities, numerous large defense agencies and field activities,  and various combatant and joint operational commands, which are  responsible for military operations for specific geographic regions or  theaters of operations.", "In executing these military operations, the department performs an  assortment of interrelated and interdependent business functions,  including logistics management, procurement, health care management,  and financial management. DOD reports that, in order to support these  business functions, it currently relies on about 4,200 systems\u2014including  accounting, acquisition, finance, logistics, and personnel. As we have  previously reported, this systems environment is overly complex and error  prone and is characterized by (1) little standardization across the  department, (2) multiple systems performing the same tasks, (3) the same  data stored in multiple systems, and (4) manual data entry into multiple  systems. These problems continue despite the department\u2019s spending  billions of dollars annually to operate, maintain, and modernize its business  systems. DOD received approximately $13.3 billion for fiscal year 2005 to  operate, maintain, and modernize this environment. In addition, our  reports continue to show that the department\u2019s stovepiped and duplicative  systems contribute to fraud, waste, and abuse. Of the 25 areas on GAO\u2019s  governmentwide \u201chigh-risk\u201d list, 8 are DOD program areas, and the  department shares responsibility for 6 other high-risk areas that are  governmentwide in scope.", "Because of the department\u2019s size and complexity, modernizing its business  systems is a huge management challenge that we first designated as one of  the department\u2019s high-risk areas in 1995, and we continue to do so today.  To help meet this challenge, DOD established its business systems  modernization program in 2001. As we testified in 2003, one of the seven  key elements that are necessary to successfully execute this modernization  program is to establish and implement an enterprise architecture.  Subsequently, in its Fiscal Year 2004 Performance and Accountability  Report, DOD acknowledged that deficiencies in its systems and business  processes hindered the department\u2019s ability to collect and report financial  and performance information that was accurate, reliable, and timely.

Managed properly, an  enterprise architecture can clarify and help to optimize the  interdependencies and relationships among an organization\u2019s business  operations and the underlying IT infrastructure and applications that  support these operations. Employed in concert with other important  management controls, such as portfolio-based capital planning and  investment control practices, architectures can greatly increase the  chances that an organization\u2019s operational and IT environments will be  configured to optimize its mission performance.

At that time, the Secretary  tasked the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and  Information Integration)/Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII)/CIO), with  responsibility for overseeing the program. To accomplish this, in October  2001, the Comptroller established governance bodies and assigned them  responsibilities associated with developing, maintaining, and implementing  the BEA. These entities and their respective roles and responsibilities are  shown in table 1. DOD is currently revising its BEA governance structure,  including recently eliminating its long-standing governance entities. These  revisions are discussed later in this report.", "Also in 2001, the BMMP program office was established to execute the  program\u2019s day-to-day activities, including implementing internal  management controls and other mechanisms to provide reasonable  assurance that the office would develop and implement an effective BEA.

In 2004, DOD increased the contract amount  to $250 million; however, the contract did not provide a reason for this  increase, and program officials have yet to provide an explanation. As of  September 2004, DOD reported that it had obligated approximately $318  million for the program, which is primarily for contractor support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Reviews of DOD\u2019s Architecture Efforts Have Identified Many Weaknesses and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 4 years, we have identified the need for, and reviewed DOD\u2019s  efforts to develop an enterprise architecture for modernizing its business  operations and systems, and we have made a series of recommendations to  assist the department in successfully developing the architecture and using  it to guide and constrain its ongoing and planned business systems  investments.", "In particular, we reported in May 2001 that the department did not have an  architecture for its financial and financial-related business operations, nor  did it have the management structures, processes, and controls in place to  effectively develop and implement one. We concluded that continuing to  spend billions of dollars on new and modified systems would result in more  processes and systems that were duplicative, not interoperable,  unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and not optimizing mission  performance and accountability. We made eight recommendations to the  Secretary of Defense that were aimed at providing the means for effectively  developing and implementing an architecture and limiting DOD  components\u2019 systems investments until it had a well-defined architecture  and the means to enforce it. In July 2001, DOD initiated the BMMP.", "In February 2003, we reported that the department was following some  architecture best practices, such as establishing a program office to be  responsible for managing the enterprise architecture development effort.  We also reported challenges and weaknesses in DOD\u2019s architecture efforts.  For example, we reported that DOD had not yet (1) established a  governance structure and the process controls needed to ensure ownership  of and accountability for the architecture across the department; (2) clearly  communicated to intended stakeholders its purpose, scope, and approach  for developing the architecture; and (3) defined and implemented an  independent quality assurance process. We reiterated our earlier  recommendations and made six new recommendations aimed at enhancing  DOD\u2019s ability to develop its architecture and to guide and constrain its  business systems modernization investments.", "In March 2003, we reported that DOD\u2019s draft release of its architecture did  not include a number of items that were recommended by relevant  architectural guidance, and that DOD\u2019s plans would not fully satisfy the  requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2003. For example, the draft architecture did not include a \u201cTo Be\u201d  security view, which would define the security requirements\u2014including  relevant standards to be applied in implementing security policies,  procedures, and controls. DOD officials generally agreed, and they stated  that subsequent releases of the architecture would provide these missing  details.", "In July and September 2003, we reported that the initial release of the  department\u2019s architecture, including the transition plan, did not adequately  address statutory requirements and other relevant architectural  requirements. For example, the description of the \u201cAs Is\u201d environment did  not include (1) the current business operations in terms of entities and  people who perform the functions, processes, and activities and (2) the  locations where the functions, processes, and activities are performed. The  description of the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment did not include actual systems to be  developed or acquired to support future business operations and the  physical infrastructure that would be needed to support the business  systems. The transition plan did not include time frames for phasing out  existing systems within DOD\u2019s then reported inventory of about 2,300  business systems. We concluded that the department\u2019s initial release of  the architecture did not contain sufficient scope and detail either to satisfy  the act\u2019s requirements or to effectively guide and constrain  departmentwide business systems modernization. In our September 2003  report, we reiterated the open recommendations that we had made in our  May 2001 and February 2003 reports, and we made 10 new  recommendations to, among other things, improve DOD\u2019s efforts for  developing the next release of the architecture.", "In March and July 2004, we testified that DOD\u2019s substantial long-standing  financial and business management problems adversely affected the  economy, effectiveness, and efficiency of its operations and had resulted in  a lack of adequate transparency and appropriate accountability across all  major business areas. Further, we said that substantial work remained  before the BEA would begin to have a tangible impact on improving the  department\u2019s overall business operations. We concluded that until DOD  completed a number of actions, including developing a well-defined BEA,  its business systems modernization efforts would be at a high risk of  failure.", "In May 2004, we reported that after 3 years of effort and over $203 million  in obligations, DOD had not made significant change in the content of the  BEA or in its approach to investing billions of dollars annually in existing  and new systems. We reported that few actions had been taken to address  the recommendations we had made in our September 2003 report, which  were aimed at improving the department\u2019s plans for developing the next  release of the architecture and implementing the institutional means for  selecting and controlling both planned and ongoing business systems  investments. We also reported that DOD had still not adopted key  architecture management best practices that we had recommended, such  as assigning accountability and responsibility for directing, overseeing, and  approving the architecture and explicitly defining performance metrics to  evaluate the architecture\u2019s quality, content, and utility. Further, DOD had  not added the scope and detail to its architecture that we had previously  identified as missing. For example, in the latest release of the BEA\u2014 Release 2.0\u2014DOD did not provide sufficient descriptive content related to  future business operations and supporting technology to permit effective  acquisition and implementation of system solutions and associated  operational change. Moreover, the department had not yet explicitly  defined program plans, including milestones, detailing how it intended to  extend and evolve the architecture to incorporate this missing content. We  concluded that the future of DOD\u2019s architecture development and  implementation activities was at risk, which in turn placed the  department\u2019s business transformation effort in jeopardy of failing.  Therefore, we added that it was imperative that the department move  swiftly to implement our open recommendations. Because many of our  prior recommendations remained open, we did not make any new  recommendations in our May 2004 report, but we reiterated the open  recommendations that we had made in our May 2001, February 2003, and  September 2003 reports.", "In November 2004 and April 2005, we testified that for DOD to  successfully transform its business operations, it would need a  comprehensive and integrated business transformation plan; people with  the skills, responsibility, and authority to implement the plan; an effective  process and related tools, such as a BEA; and results-oriented performance  measures that would link institutional, unit, and individual personnel goals  and expectations to promote accountability for results. We testified that  over the last 3 years, we had made a series of recommendations to DOD  and suggested legislative changes that, if implemented, could help the  department move forward in establishing the means to successfully  address the challenges it faces in transforming its business operations. We  also testified that, after about 3 years of effort and over $203 million in  reported obligations, the architecture\u2019s content and the department\u2019s  approach to investing billions of dollars annually in existing and new  systems had not changed significantly, and that the program had yielded  very little, if any, tangible improvements in DOD\u2019s business operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Yet to Implement Effective Governance and Communications, but Improvements Are Under Way", "paragraphs": ["Long-standing weaknesses in DOD\u2019s BEA governance structure and  communications strategy still remain.

This governance approach, however, does not assign  accountability and responsibility for directing, overseeing, and approving  the BEA to these entities either singularly or collectively.

Moreover, the DO/IT did not include military service representatives,  and it did not establish any policies and procedures for how to address  and resolve issues.

Plan Start-up: Conduct a formal tactical review, including an  assessment of current communication tools, communication  procedures, available resources, and agency or industry best practices. 2. Discovery and Assessment: Identify and verify all internal and external  stakeholders and begin defining the benchmarking and reporting  requirements. 3.

Evaluation: Evaluate the progress and overall success of the plan\u2019s  implementation, using metrics.", "The strategic communications plan states that the five phases were to have  been fully implemented by December 2004. Although 5 months have passed  since the plan was to be implemented, none of the five phases have been  completed, and communications activities that have been performed by  those responsible for implementing the plan have been limited in scope.  Specifically, communications activities have focused on raising program  awareness through the distribution of posters and press releases and the  establishment of a Web site that provides information about the program.  However, an assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of communication  tools and procedures, available resources, and agency or industry best  practices in communicating the program\u2019s purpose to the various  stakeholders (e.g., the domains and the military services) has not been  performed. In addition, the program\u2019s Acting Assistant Deputy Director for  Communications stated that a systematic approach, including metrics, to  measure the effectiveness of the communications strategy has not been  defined.

Moreover, the plan  focuses first on internal stakeholders, and it defers efforts to proactively  promote understanding and buy-in with external stakeholders, such as  Congress. The plan defines the internal stakeholders to exclude key  departmental components, such as the military services and the defense  agencies. Instead, it defines internal stakeholders to include only the  program office and the domains.", "As a result, both the internal and external DOD stakeholders with whom  we spoke said that they did not have a clear understanding of the program,  including its purpose, scope, approach, activities, and status, as well as  stakeholders\u2019 roles and responsibilities.

Similarly, the  Acquisition domain representative stated that the roles and responsibilities  of the domains for the program are confusing, because the domains should  be the entities that are developing the BEA, and not the program office.  According to this representative, the current approach will result in  redundancy and increased program costs.", "In addition, the program office\u2019s Acting Assistant Deputy Director for  Communications acknowledged that stakeholders are confused, stating  that they do not have a good understanding of either the BEA\u2019s goals,  objectives, and intended outcomes or stakeholders\u2019 roles and  responsibilities. This official also stated that cross-domain integration  issues remain that require strong DOD leadership to move the  communications efforts beyond conducting awareness activities to  achieving departmentwide buy-in.", "The Special Assistant for Business Transformation has recently begun to  better communicate with key external stakeholders, such as Congress. For  example, this official stated that department officials have met with and  intend to hold future meetings with congressional staff to brief them on the  department\u2019s plans and efforts to date.

According to the program director, this baseline was to include program  goals, objectives, and activities as well as performance, cost, and schedule  commitments. Further, the baseline was to establish program roles,  responsibilities, and accountabilities and was to be used as a managerial  and oversight tool to allocate resources, manage risk, and measure and  report progress.

Moreover, this absence of program plans has created a lack of transparency  and understanding about what is occurring on the program and what will  occur\u2014both inside and outside the department. It has also inhibited BEA  governance entities\u2019 ability to ensure that resources (e.g., program office,  domains, and contractors) are being effectively used to achieve worthwhile  outcomes and results. Although the contractor\u2019s work statements have  provided some additional detail, these task descriptions lack the specificity  necessary to use them effectively to monitor the contractor\u2019s progress and  performance.

However, DOD  has not taken steps to ensure that the people assigned to the program have  the right skill sets or qualifications. In particular, DOD has not defined the  requisite workforce skills and abilities that the department needs in order  to develop, maintain, and implement the architecture. To illustrate, the  program\u2019s Assistant Deputy Director for Administrative Support told us  that the position descriptions used to staff the program office were generic  and were not tailored to the needs of an enterprise architecture program.  This official added that, as a result, a person might satisfy the qualifications  contained in the position description, but still not meet the needs of the  BEA program.

The purpose of configuration management is  to maintain integrity and traceability, and control modifications or changes  to the architecture products throughout their life cycles. Effective  configuration management, among other things, enables integration and  alignment among related architecture products. As we have previously  reported, an effective configuration management process comprises four  primary elements, each of which should be described in a configuration  management plan and implemented according to the plan. In addition,  responsibility, accountability, and authority for configuration management  should be assigned to a configuration manager. The four elements are:  Configuration identification: Procedures for identifying, documenting,  and assigning unique identifiers (e.g., serial number and name) to  product types generated for the architecture program, generally referred  to as configuration items.", "Configuration control: Procedures for evaluating and deciding whether  to approve changes to a product\u2019s baseline configuration, generally  accomplished through configuration control boards, which evaluate  proposed changes on the basis of costs, benefits, and risks and decide  whether to permit a change.", "Configuration status accounting: Procedures for documenting and  reporting on the status of configuration items as a product evolves.

However, the plan is not being  followed. For example, according to the plan and procedures, certain  product types should be placed under configuration management and be  assigned a unique identifier. However, in one case, the verification and  validation contractor reported that DOD had updated one of the BEA  products (i.e., All View-1) that was initially published in Release 2.3, but  that this updated product was not given a unique identifier and a new  release date, and no entry was made in the version history to enable  stakeholders to differentiate between the two versions.", "Configuration naming conventions also have not been consistently  followed, resulting in the updates to a single document being given  different unique identifiers than the original document. For example, the  November 2003 configuration management plan had the unique identifier  \u201cC0008_05_03_BMMP_Configuration_Management_Plan.doc,\u201d which was  comprised of the call number, the task number, the subtask number, and  the name of the document. However, the department later assigned this  document the following unique identifier  \u201cConfiguration_Management_Plan.doc,\u201d which did not include the call and  task numbers. Such inconsistencies could permit changes to be made to  the wrong version of a product, thereby compromising the integrity and  reliability of the information.", "Consistent with relevant guidance, the procedures require that a  configuration manager be assigned and that this individual be responsible  for ensuring that the four elements are executed. However, after almost 4  years of architecture products development, a configuration manager has  not been assigned. In addition, while the department established a  configuration control board and chartered it to evaluate and decide  whether to approve proposed product changes, this board is not fully  functioning.

However, one of these  reports was missing key data, such as the date of the report, the submitter,  and the version of the product currently being reviewed and, thus, was of  limited use. It was also unclear as to which version of the product was  referenced in the report, and these officials told us that the current baseline  of approved configuration items, including the configuration management  plan, is unknown. As a result, configuration items can be duplicated. For  example, the Acting Assistant Deputy Director for Communications had a  second communications plan prepared, and this official told us that he did  not know that a prior draft plan existed. Because of this, the new strategy  did not leverage any of the work that had previously been done, and  duplicative plans exist.", "Program officials, including the Configuration Control Board Chair, stated  that they recognize the importance of effective configuration management.

However, the frameworks do not prescribe the degree to  which the component parts should be described to be considered correct,  complete, understandable, and usable\u2014essential attributes of any  architecture. This is because the depth and detail of the descriptive content  depends on what the architecture is to be used for (i.e., its intended  purpose and scope). Relevant architecture guidance states that a well- defined architecture should have a specific and commonly understood  purpose and scope, and that it should be developed in incremental releases.  Using this purpose and scope, the necessary content of architecture  releases can then be defined.", "In September 2003, we reported that Release 1.0 of the BEA was missing  important content, and we made 62 recommendations to add this content.

Specifically, the releases do not include products  describing the \u201cAs Is\u201d environment for those areas of the enterprise that are  likely to change, and they do not include a sequencing plan that serves as a  road map for transitioning from the \u201cAs Is\u201d state to the \u201cTo Be\u201d state. For  example, the BEA releases do not contain a description of the \u201cAs Is\u201d  environment that would include current business operations in terms of the  entities or people who perform the functions, processes, and activities, and  the locations where the functions, processes, and activities are performed.  It also does not describe the data or information being used by the  functions, processes, and activities. As a result, DOD does not have a  picture of its current environment to permit development of a meaningful  and useful transition plan.", "The BEA releases also do not contain a transition plan that would include  information such as time frames for phasing out existing systems within  DOD\u2019s current inventory and resource requirements for implementing the  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture. As a result, DOD does not yet have a meaningful and  reliable basis for managing the disposition of its existing inventory of  systems or for sequencing the introduction of modernized business  operations and supporting systems. As we previously reported, not having  defined the \u201cAs Is\u201d operations and technology at this juncture is risky  because it defers until too late in the architecture development cycle  creation of sufficient descriptive content and context to develop an  effective transition plan. (See app. II for our prior recommendations and  their current status.) DOD\u2019s architecture framework (DODAF), which the  department is using to develop the BEA, does not require the development  of an \u201cAs Is\u201d architectural description or a transition plan, and thus neither  has been the focus of the program. However, according to program  officials, including the Chief Architect, the September 2005 BEA release  will include both the \u201cAs Is\u201d architectural description and a transition plan.", "In addition, DOD has not clearly linked the purpose of any of the \u201cTo Be\u201d  architecture releases produced to date to the goals and objectives of  increment 1. Further, these releases also do not have a clearly defined  scope with respect to what business processes and supporting systems  each release would focus on. According to program officials, the last five  versions (i.e., Releases 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 and the January and March 2005  Updates) support the objectives of increment 1 (see table 3). These  objectives are broad-based strategic goals or outcomes that DOD proposed  achieving through a series of architecture releases. However, DOD did not  define how many releases were needed to achieve each objective and how  the purpose of each release is associated with the objectives. Restated,  while each incremental objective would describe the mission outcome that  DOD intended to achieve via implementation of the series of releases that  make up that increment, the purpose of the releases was not specified in  terms of architectural questions that were related to the objectives. To  illustrate, one objective of increment 1 is to achieve an unqualified audit  opinion for consolidated DOD financial statements. Examples of the  purpose questions that would support this objective include the following: 1. What changes need to be made to existing business processes and the  supporting systems to address material internal control weaknesses  affecting significant line items on the financial statements? 2. Where are gaps in IT support (systems functions) that need to be  addressed in order to provide the business capabilities for ensuring that  property, plant, and equipment are appropriately valued and recorded  on the financial statements?", "The department did not include architecture products that would answer  these types of questions to support the increment 1 objective. As a result,  the context needed to plan and measure content sufficiency was not  established. Program officials, including the Special Assistant for Business  Transformation and the Chief Architect agreed, stating that prior releases  have not included a specific purpose and scope. Moreover, the Chief  Architect told us that the architecture releases do not fully support  increment 1\u2019s objectives, nor do they describe the extent to which they do  address the increment 1 objectives.", "According to program officials, including the deputy program director and  the Chief Architect, the prior releases were developed with the goal of  producing as many architecture products as possible within a predefined  schedule. The releases were not developed to provide the content needed  to meet the defined purpose and scope of the release. Until the department  defines the intended purpose and scope of its BEA, including its  incremental releases, and ensures that the architecture products include  adequate descriptions of the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments, as well as a  plan for transitioning between the two, it will not have a well-defined  architecture to guide and constrain its systems modernization efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BEA Products Are Incomplete, Inconsistent, and Not Integrated", "paragraphs": ["Architecture frameworks provide for multiple products, each describing a  particular aspect of the enterprise, such as data or systems.

DODAF recognizes this need for integration of  the products that make up its three \u201cTo Be\u201d views\u2014operational view (OV),  systems view (SV), and technical standards view (TV). (See app. IV for a  brief description of the products that comprise each of these views.)  According to the framework, an architecture must be well structured so  that the products can be readily assembled or decomposed into higher or  lower levels of detail, as needed. It should also be consistent\u2014that is,  information elements should be the same throughout the architecture.", "As noted in the previous section, we reported in September 2003, that  Release 1.0 of the BEA was missing important content, and we made 62  recommendations to add this content. The latest releases of the BEA do not  adequately address our 30 prior recommendations related to the \u201cTo Be\u201d  description. For example, these releases do not include descriptions of  the actual systems to be developed or acquired to support future business  operations and the physical infrastructure (e.g., hardware and software)  that will be needed to support the business systems. As a result, the \u201cTo Be\u201d  environment lacks the detail needed to provide DOD with a common vision  and frame of reference for defining a transition plan to guide and constrain  capital investments and, thus, to effectively leverage technology to  orchestrate logical, systematic change and to optimize enterprisewide  mission performance. (See app. II for details on the status of our prior  recommendations.)", "In addition, the respective products of each of the latest BEA releases  continue to be inconsistent and not integrated, because key architecture  products were either not developed or not updated to reflect changes made  in other products. Examples of where Releases 2.2 and 2.3 are not  consistent and integrated follow:  In Release 2.2, the department updated the system data exchange matrix  (SV-6), which assigns attributes (e.g., timeliness) to the data to be  exchanged (e.g., Performance Metrics) between system functions\u2014 \u201cManage Business Enterprise Reporting\u201d and \u201cEstablish and Maintain  Performance Information\u201d\u2014to support business operations. However,  the OV-3 in Release 2.2, which shows the attributes of the information to  be exchanged to support operations, is not consistent with the attributes  defined in the SV-6. For example, in the OV-3, the attribute referred to as  \u201ctimeliness\u201d is defined in terms of either \u201chours,\u201d \u201cminutes,\u201d or  \u201cseconds;\u201d however, in the SV-6, the attribute referred to as \u201ctimeliness\u201d  is only defined in terms of either \u201chigh, medium, or basic.\u201d", "In Releases 2.2 and 2.3, the department updated the respective  operational event-trace description product (OV-6c), which depicts  when activities are to occur within operational processes. However, the  department did not update, in either release, the operational activity  model (OV-5), which shows the operational activities (or tasks) that are  to occur and the input and output flows among these activities. For  example, the OV-6c shows the sequence of the activities to occur for the  process labeled \u201cproduce obligation reports;\u201d however, the activities  shown in the OV-5 were not associated with this process.", "The latest releases also do not provide for traceability among the  architecture products by clearly identifying the linkages and dependencies  among the products, such as associating processes (e.g., produce  obligation reports) with activities (e.g., compare expense to obligation) in  the operational views and then associating these same processes to  systems (e.g., financial reporting system) in the systems view. In addition,  the linkage between the two functions (i.e., \u201cManage Business Enterprise  Reporting\u201d and \u201cEstablish and Maintain Performance Information\u201d)  previously discussed cannot be traced to the OV-3 in Release 2.2. This is  because Release 2.2 did not include an SV-5, which would provide a  traceability of system functions back to operational activities. The lack of  an updated SV-5 also raises questions as to whether all operational  requirements are satisfied by the system functions. In addition, the  architecture products were not developed in a logical sequence, as called  for in relevant guidance and standards (e.g., the OV-6c, which shows the  timing or sequencing of activities, was built before the OV-5, which shows  the activities that are to occur).", "Further, according to the verification and validation contractor, the  department has yet to address 242 of its 299 outstanding comments since  Release 1.0. The verification and validation contractor also cited similar  concerns, as previously described, for Releases 2.2 and 2.3. Specifically, the  contractor reported that the BEA products were not integrated, and that  key products were missing or had not been updated\u2014such as the  operational nodes connectivity description (OV-2) and the operational  information exchange matrix (OV-3). In its report on the January 2005  Update, the contractor stated that the architecture products were  developed in an order different from that recommended in DODAF, and  that the dependency relationships between and among BEA products were  not clearly depicted. For example, the contractor reported that the logical  data model (OV-7) was to have been developed using the OV-3, OV-5, and  OV-6c artifacts as inputs. However, this was not the case. Instead, the OV-7  was developed using information that may have been reverse engineered  from existing systems and architectures external to the BEA. The  contractor reported that unless these dependencies are clearly  documented and depicted, new systems may be implemented without  satisfying all operational requirements, with missing functions and  interfaces or based on obsolete data models, recreating many of the  problems the modernization is intended to resolve. The contractor also  reported that the resulting technical problems in the OV-7 could interfere  with the department\u2019s achievement of the increment 1 objectives.", "The March 2005 Update also did not have fully integrated products.  Specifically, while some of the products were integrated, this integration  occurred at the highest level only and could not be found at lower levels of  decomposition (e.g., subprocesses and subactivities) within the  architecture. For example, the level of integration does not enable the user  to determine all information inputs for the activities at all levels, nor does it  clearly reflect the dissemination or use of the information after it has been  processed. In addition, this update did not include key architecture  products that are recommended by DODAF\u2014such as the system data  exchange artifact (SV-6), which assigns attributes (e.g., timeliness) to the  data to be exchanged between system functions and the system inventory  (SV-8). The SV-8 provides a basis for portfolio investment decisions by  depicting the evolution of systems, systems integration, and systems  improvements over time. We also found that the architecture was not user  friendly in that it was difficult to navigate. For example, the linkages among  the architecture products did not always work, thereby, requiring manual  navigation through the architecture to find the linkages. This would take  hours to do, especially since it was complicated by the fact that certain  artifacts (e.g., diagrams) could not be read online and had to be printed.", "Relatedly, as shown in table 4, the latter BEA releases have not included all  of the recommended DODAF products. DODAF recommends that the BEA  include 23 out of 26 possible architecture products to meet the  department\u2019s stated intention to use the BEA as the basis for  departmentwide business and systems modernization. However, Release  2.2 of the architecture included only 16 of the 23 recommended  architecture products, and 6 of the 16 products (OV-1, OV-2, OV-3, OV-4,  OV-5, and SV-9) were actually Release 2.0 products that had not been  updated to align with the changes that had been made to the 10 products  that were updated in this release. Similarly, Release 2.3 included only 4  products; the January 2005 Update included 6, and the March 2005 Update  included 15. According to the Chief Architect, all prior architecture  products that were not included in a specific release or update are  obsolete. For example, Release 2.2 included 16 architecture products, of  which 10 had been updated. The remaining 6 products had not been  updated, but they were still considered to be valid because they were  included in this release. This means that for all releases and updates, only  those products included in the release or update are relevant. For example,  DOD updated 15 products and included them in the March 2005 Update;  therefore, as of March 2005, only these 15 products were considered to be  valid artifacts of the BEA.", "Program and contractor officials, including the Acting Assistant Deputy  Director for Transition Planning, stated that although the department\u2019s first  release of its architecture included a fairly consistent and integrated set of  architecture products, DOD\u2019s current releases do not because the  department did not update all the recommended architecture products.  These officials, including the Chief Architect, also stated that, as a result,  the utility of the architecture is limited. However, according to key program  officials, including the Special Assistant for Business Transformation and  the Chief Architect, the integration of the architecture products was not the  focus; rather, DOD\u2019s primary goal was to produce as many products as it  could within a specified time period (see tables 3 and 4).", "Recognizing these weaknesses, the Special Assistant for Business  Transformation stated that the department intends to reduce the scope of  the architecture and revise the development approach, which will be  reflected in the September 30, 2005, architecture release. However,  according to program officials, including the Special Assistant for Business  Transformation, the September 2005 BEA release will not be  comprehensive (i.e., it will not meet all the act\u2019s requirements). Further, the  department has yet to develop plans and a methodology to execute this  new focus and vet it through the department. Program officials also stated  that as a result of the new focus, they are trying to decide which products  from prior releases could be salvaged and used.", "Nevertheless, the department has spent almost 4 years and approximately  $318 million in obligations to develop an architecture that is incomplete,  inconsistent, and not integrated and, thus, has limited utility. Until the  department develops an approved, well-defined architecture that includes  a clear purpose and scope and integrated products, it remains at risk of not  achieving its intended business modernization goals and of not having an  architecture that the stakeholders can use to guide and constrain ongoing  and planned business systems investments to prevent duplicative and  noninteroperable systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BEA Releases Have Not Been Approved", "paragraphs": ["Relevant architecture guidance state that architecture versions should be  approved by the committee overseeing the development and maintenance  of the architecture; the CIO; the chief architect; and senior management,  including the department head.

In contrast, our  recommendations have all focused on establishing the means by which to  deliver a well-defined BEA and ensuring that delivered releases of the  architecture contain this requisite content.

This means that despite spending  almost 4 years and about $318 million to develop its BEA, the department is  not positioned to meet its legislative mandates. In our view, the state of the  architecture is due largely to long-standing architecture management  weaknesses that the recommendations we have made over the last 4 years  are aimed at correcting, as well as the department\u2019s prior focus on  producing as many products as it could within a specific time period.

Similar to most frameworks, FEAF\u2019s proposed  models describe an entity\u2019s business, the data necessary to conduct the  business, applications to manage the data, and technology to support the  applications.", "More recently, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established  the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Program Management Office to  develop a federated enterprise architecture in the context of five \u201creference  models, and a security and privacy profile that overlays the five models.\u201d", "The Business Reference Model is intended to describe the federal  government\u2019s businesses, independent of the agencies that perform  them. This model consists of four business areas: (1) services for  citizens, (2) mode of delivery, (3) support delivery of services, and  (4) management of government resources. It serves as the foundation  for the FEA. OMB expects agencies to use this model, as part of their  capital planning and investment control processes, to help identify  opportunities to consolidate information technology (IT) investments  across the federal government. Version 2.0 of this model was released in  June 2003.", "The Performance Reference Model is intended to describe a set of  performance measures for major IT initiatives and their contribution to  program performance. According to OMB, this model will help agencies  produce enhanced performance information; improve the alignment and  better articulate the contribution of inputs, such as technology, to  outputs and outcomes; and identify improvement opportunities that  span traditional organizational boundaries. Version 1.0 of this model  was released in September 2003.", "The Service Component Reference Model is intended to identify and  classify IT service (i.e., application) components that support federal  agencies and promote the reuse of components across agencies. This  model is intended to provide the foundation for the reuse of  applications, application capabilities, components (defined as \u201ca self- contained business process or service with predetermined functionality  that may be exposed through a business or technology interface\u201d), and  business services. According to OMB, this model is a business-driven,  functional framework that classifies service components with respect to  how they support business and/or performance objectives. Version 1.0  of this model was released in June 2003.", "The Data Reference Model is intended to describe, at an aggregate level,  the types of data and information that support program and business  line operations and the relationships among these types. This model is  intended to help describe the types of interactions and information  exchanges that occur across the federal government. Version 1.0 of this  model was released in September 2004.", "The Technical Reference Model is intended to describe the standards,  specifications, and technologies that collectively support the secure  delivery, exchange, and construction of service components. Version 1.1  of this model was released in August 2003.", "The Security and Privacy Profile is intended to provide guidance on  designing and deploying measures that ensure the protection of  information resources.
