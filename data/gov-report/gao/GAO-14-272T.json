At the same time, the percentage of married women entering the labor force has increased. The decline in marriage and rise in women's labor force participation have affected the types of Social Security benefits households receive, with fewer women receiving spousal benefits today than in the past. In addition, the shift away from DB to DC plans has increased financial vulnerabilities for some due to the fact that DC plans typically offer fewer spousal protections. DC plans also place greater responsibility on households to make decisions and manage their pension and financial assets so they have income throughout retirement.

Specifically, for our first objective  we analyzed data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation  (SIPP); the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS); and recent  Census Bureau (Census) and Bureau of Labor Statistics publications. For  our second objective, we analyzed the SIPP Gold Standard File\u2014SIPP  data that have been matched to administrative data from the Social  Security Administration (SSA)\u2014and the Survey of Consumer Finances  (SCF). We also relied on projections based on simulations SSA  conducted with the Modeling Income in the Near Term model, Version 6  (MINT6). For our third objective, we reviewed past GAO work in the area  of retirement security and human services. We assessed the reliability of  selected IPUMS, SIPP, SCF, and MINT6 data and found, for the  purposes of our analyses, them to be sufficiently reliable.

From 1960 to 2010, the percentage of single-parent families  also rose.

Similarly,  the percentage of single parents among 45- to 54-year-old men and  women in the highest income quintile remained flat, while there was a  steep rise in the percentage of single parents in the lowest income  quintile, according to our estimates.

Since then, the differences in labor force  participation rates for these four groups have narrowed, with labor force  participation among married and single women within 3 percentage points  in 2010.

Specifically, over the last two  decades employers have increasingly shifted away from offering their  employees traditional DB to DC plans, and roughly half of U.S. workers  do not participate in any employer-sponsored pension plan. DB plans  typically offer retirement benefits to a retiree in the form of an annuity that  provides a monthly payment for life, including a lifetime annuity to the  surviving spouse, unless the couple chooses otherwise. In contrast, under  a DC plan, workers and employers may make contributions to individual  accounts. Depending on the options available under the plan, at  retirement DC participants may take a lump sum, roll their plan savings  into an IRA, leave some or all of their money in the plan, or purchase an  annuity offered through the plan. Further, many of the remaining DB plans  now offer lump sums as one of the form-of-payment options under the  plan. Participants who elect a lump sum forgo a lifetime annuity.

In general, the trend away from women receiving  spousal benefits is projected to continue, with the largest shift occurring  among black women, according to SSA analyses. For many elderly, this  shift is likely to be positive, reflecting their higher earnings and greater  capacity to save for retirement. However, elderly women with low levels of  lifetime earnings, who have no spouse or do not receive a spousal  benefit\u2014a group that is disproportionately represented by black women\u2014  For blacks, the rise in ineligibility for spousal or widow benefits has  are expected to have correspondingly lower Social Security retirement  benefits relative to those with higher incomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Retirement Savings and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["These trends have also affected household savings behavior and the  financial risks households face in retirement. Households with DC plans  have greater responsibility to save and manage their retirement savings  so that they have sufficient income throughout retirement. However, our  analysis of SCF data shows that many households approaching  retirement still have no or very limited retirement savings (see fig. 4).  Married households\u2014in which many women now make significant  contributions to retirement savings\u2014are more likely to have retirement  savings, but their median savings are low. The majority of single-headed  households have no retirement savings. Single parents, in particular, tend  to have fewer resources available to save for retirement during their  working years and are less likely to participate in DC plans.", "In addition to challenges with accumulating sufficient savings for  retirement, individuals may also find it difficult to determine how to invest  their savings during their working years and spend down their savings  when they reach retirement. During their working years, DC plan  participants typically must determine the size of their contributions and  choose among various investment options offered by the plan. At  retirement or separation from their employer, plan participants must  decide what to do with their plan savings. Participants in DB plans also  face similar decisions if the plan offers a lump sum option, including  whether to take the annuity or lump sum, and if a lump sum is elected,  how to manage those benefits. GAO has found that these decisions are  difficult to navigate because the appropriate investment strategy depends  on many different aspects of an individual\u2019s circumstances, such as  anticipated expenses, income level, health, and each household\u2019s  tolerance for risk. In addition, individuals with DC plans face challenges  comparing their distribution options, in part due to a host of complicated  factors that must be considered in choosing among such options. They  may also lack objective information to inform these complicated  decisions.  In fact, while financial experts GAO has interviewed typically  recommended that retirees convert a portion of their savings into an  income annuity, or opt for the annuity provided by an employer-sponsored  DB pension instead of a lump sum withdrawal, we found that most  retirees pass up opportunities for additional lifetime retirement income.  These choices coupled with increasing life expectancy may result in more  retirees outliving their assets.", "Lastly, the transition from DB to DC plans has increased the vulnerability  of some spouses due to differences in the federal requirements for  spousal protections between these two types of retirement plans. For DB  plans, spousal consent is required if the participant wishes to waive the  survivor annuity for his or her spouse. In contrast, for DC plans, spousal  consent is not required for the participant to withdraw funds from the  account\u2014either before or at retirement\u2014and DC plans do not generally  offer annuities at all, including those with a survivor benefit.

These groups include older women, especially those who are  unmarried or over age 80, and nonwhites.", "Moreover, individuals nearing retirement who experience economic  shocks, such as losing a job or spouse, are also vulnerable to economic  insecurity. During the 2007-2009 recession, unemployment rates doubled  for workers aged 55 and older. When older workers lose a job they are  less likely to find other employment. In fact, the median duration of  unemployment for older workers rose sharply from 2007 to 2010, more  than tripling for workers 65 and older and increasing to 31 weeks from 11  weeks for workers age 55 to 64. Prior GAO work has shown that long- term unemployment can reduce an older worker\u2019s future retirement  income in numerous ways, including reducing the number of years the  worker can accumulate savings, prompting workers to claim Social  Security retirement benefits before they reach their full retirement age,   Similarly, our  and leading workers to draw down their retirement assets.past work has shown that divorce and widowhood in the years leading up  to and during retirement have detrimental effects on an individual\u2019s assets  and income, and that these effects were more pronounced for women.", "As a result of the trends described above, these vulnerable populations  may face increasing income insecurity in old age and be in greater need  of assistance.

For those with little or no  pension or other financial assets, ensuring income in retirement may  involve difficult choices, including how long to wait before claiming Social  Security benefits, how long to work, and how to adjust consumption and  lifestyle to lower levels of income in retirement. Poor or imprudent  decisions may mean the difference between a secure retirement and  poverty.
