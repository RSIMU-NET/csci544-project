As an example, when shipping acetyl chloride  (flammable liquid, class 3 HAZMAT) the shipper must review several  sources to determine how to properly ship the item. If the shipper intends  to ship the HAZMAT on a commercial aircraft carrying passengers, the  Hazardous Materials Regulations indicate that no more than 1 liter of this  liquid per package can be shipped because of the risk posed by  transporting HAZMAT of that classification. If the HAZMAT is being  shipped by military aircraft or on an international flight, additional  requirements and limitations may need to be applied. On the other hand,  if carriers transport acetyl chloride by highway, they may be able to  transport greater quantities.", "DOD may also ship DOD-unique HAZMAT items that are not addressed  in DOT\u2019s Hazardous Materials Regulations or for which DOD needs to  seek a waiver or approval. In these cases, the Hazardous Materials  Regulations and DOT guidance specify a process that any commercial or  government entity can use to apply for a DOT waiver in the form of a  special permit or approval providing relief from requirements in the  Hazardous Materials Regulations. DOD shipments may also use  certificates of equivalence, which are approvals issued by DOD itself in  instances where a packaging design differs from the requirements of the  Hazardous Materials Regulations. Certificates of equivalence certify that  the packaging equals or exceeds the comparable requirements of the  Hazardous Materials Regulations. DOD shippers can use special  permits or approvals from DOT or certificates of equivalence from DOD to  handle department-unique HAZMAT shipments in a way commensurate  with the DOT requirements. For example, according to officials, missiles  transported in certain configurations are not standard items covered by  the Hazardous Materials Regulations. Therefore, DOD obtained an  approval from DOT that indicates the type of packaging and container to  be used to transport this item, which, according to officials, is equal to or  exceeds the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Regulations.

According to DOD officials, improper documentation and packaging also  result in delays for the sea transportation mode. Agency officials stated  that the specific documentation and packaging issues that resulted in  delays varied. Following are examples that illustrate the types of  instances that we identified during the course of our review in which,  according to officials, the documentation and packaging of HAZMAT  shipments were not in compliance with the Defense Transportation  Regulation requirements and resulted in delays:  Improper documentation (air): At a major aerial port we visited, we  identified examples of HAZMAT shipments containing acetaldehyde  (flammable liquid, class 3 HAZMAT) that were delayed because,  according to officials, they were missing the Shipper\u2019s Declaration for  Dangerous Goods. The Defense Transportation Regulation requires  that when transporting HAZMAT by air, the shipper must complete a  Shipper\u2019s Declaration for Dangerous Goods for the shipment. In  another example, at a depot we visited, we identified various  HAZMAT shipments of lithium batteries that were also delayed  because, according to officials, they had improper HAZMAT shipping  names on the bill of lading.  Improper documentation (surface): We found instances of similar  documentation problems for surface transportation that led to  HAZMAT transportation delays. Reviewing examples of  Transportation Discrepancy Reports\u2014which are used to document  shipper-related discrepancies, among other things\u2014we found that  improper documentation is a major cause for delays. For example, in  the reports we found instances where the required Dangerous Goods  Declaration forms were missing and where the proper HAZMAT  material name was not included with the shipment as required by the  Defense Transportation Regulation.  Improper packaging (air): At a major aerial port we visited, we  identified a shipment of rusted acetylene (flammable gas, class 2.1  HAZMAT) gas cylinders that were delayed in transport because,  according to officials, they had arrived at the aerial port improperly  packaged\u2014stacked on top of one another in lidless wooden boxes  (see fig. 6). According to military aerial port officials, to comply with  the requirements of the Defense Transportation Regulation the rusted  cylinders need to be recertified to ensure the integrity of the  packaging before they are safe for air transport and may not be  stacked on top of one another. Officials told us that, as a result of  improper packaging, the potentially dangerous acetylene cylinders  were delayed at the aerial port until the packaging discrepancies  could be resolved by the shipper.", "Improper packaging (air): We observed a dented drum of flammable,  toxic liquid (class 3 HAZMAT) that aerial port officials identified as  improperly packaged under the Defense Transportation Regulation  because of its potential to leak (see fig. 7). The military aerial port  officials pointed out that, when transported by air, leaking HAZMAT  drums can cause serious damage to DOD personnel and aircraft  transporting them.", "Improper packaging (surface): Similarly, reviewing samples of  Transportation Discrepancy Reports, we found instances of improper  packaging. For example, we found a report of a shipment of helium  gas (nonflammable gas, class 2.2 HAZMAT) in a container that,  according to the report, was not properly secured (blocked and  braced) for shipment. Another report identified an instance where a  grenade (explosive, class 1.1 HAZMAT) arrived inside an armored  vehicle instead of proper packaging for an explosive. Additionally, we  found a report of a bottled oxygen (nonflammable gas, class 2.2  HAZMAT) shipment that arrived via highway improperly packaged for  air shipment. According to the report, the material must be packed in  a flame penetration and thermal-resistant package aboard an aircraft  to prevent a potentially serious accident.", "During the course of our review, DOD officials pointed out several  potential causes for these types of noncompliance.

According to the Defense Transportation  Regulation, temporary parking for certain arms, ammunition, and  explosive shipments should be conducted at DOD-approved or  commercially owned secure holding facilities.", "A DOD installation denied a commercial carrier access to a secure  hold area for a shipment of thousands of pounds of aircraft flares and  directed the carrier to park at a nearby major retail store parking lot.  DOD personnel told the Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command Operations Center that they regularly send carriers arriving  after hours to this retail store or a nearby rest area. Parking arms,  ammunition, and explosives at either location may be inconsistent  with DOD guidance.", "DOD personnel at a secure hold installation instructed a commercial  carrier of a small-arms and parts shipment to arrive before the  installation closed because they would not accept after-hours  shipments. Furthermore, DOD personnel explained that the  installation was located in an unsafe neighborhood and advised the  carrier to park in a safe public parking lot away from the installation if  arriving after hours. Observing that the shipment would arrive after  hours, the carrier decided to spend the night in his truck with the  shipment parked at a public truck stop near the interstate highway.  The Defense Transportation Regulation indicates that personnel at  the DOD installation should assist the commercial carrier in identifying  another location that could provide secure hold.", "According to the Defense Transportation Regulation, when commercial  carriers experience challenges gaining access to a secure hold area, the  carrier or DOD installation personnel can contact the Surface Deployment  and Distribution Command for assistance. According to officials,  Operations Center personnel are to attempt to resolve the issue by  referring to relevant regulations such as the Defense Transportation  Regulation, DOD Manual 5100.76-M (Physical Security of Sensitive  Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives), or rerouting the  shipment to another DOD location that can provide secure hold for the  shipment. However, if the installation and Operations Center personnel  cannot resolve the issue and grant carriers access to the secure hold  area, Operations Center personnel are to generate an Emergency  Response Report to document the actions taken by both parties and store  those reports in the Defense Transportation Tracking System. According  to the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials,  Operations Center personnel forward the Emergency Response Reports  to military-service representatives through an ad hoc process. However,  according to the officials, no further corrective action is required by those  representatives. As an example, during our visit the Operations Center  personnel demonstrated several examples of recent incidents where they  generated an Emergency Response Report as a result of DOD  installation personnel denying a carrier access to a secure hold area or  not assisting them in locating the nearest alternate means to secure those  shipments.", "While the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command\u2019s Emergency  Response Reports document installation and carrier issues gaining  access to secure hold areas at some DOD installations, according to  Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials they lack  authority to change or require corrective actions to installation access  policies. According to these officials, such actions would be taken by the  military services or individual installation commanders. However, officials  told us that there is no process within the installations\u2019 commands\u2014which  set installation access policies\u2014that requires them to follow up on  Emergency Response Reports to identify needed improvements or  recommend any corresponding corrective action at installations identified  in the reports. However, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control provides that  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  control to achieve objectives such as compliance with applicable laws and  regulations. It further notes that agencies and individual federal managers  must take systematic and proactive measures to, among other things,  assess the adequacy of internal control in federal programs and  operations, identify needed improvements, and take corresponding  corrective action. Without such a process, DOD may not be able to  minimize the time that sensitive arms, ammunition, and explosives  shipments spend in public areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Safety Measurement System Used by DOD to Evaluate Transportation Protective Service Carriers Lacks Sufficient Information to Reliably Compare Safety Performance Across Carriers", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the safety and security of DOD\u2019s shipments of sensitive arms,  ammunition, explosives, and classified shipments, DOD established a  Transportation Protective Services program as part of the Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command. Among other requirements to  participate in the program, commercial carriers providing certain services  must meet safety performance thresholds defined in DOD guidance using  scores from DOT\u2019s Compliance, Safety, Accountability program, which is  managed by DOT\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  Specifically, DOD uses the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s  Safety Measurement System scores\u2014one component of the Compliance,  Safety, Accountability program\u2014to determine which carriers are eligible  to participate in the department\u2019s Transportation Protective Services  program. The Safety Measurement System within the Compliance,  Safety, Accountability program is a data-driven approach for identifying  carriers at risk of presenting a safety hazard or causing a crash. Safety  Measurement System data comprise information collected during  roadside inspections and from reported crashes to calculate scores  across seven categories that quantify a carrier\u2019s safety performance  relative to that of other carriers. Specifically, the categories are: unsafe  driving, crash indicator, hours of service compliance, driver fitness,  controlled substances/alcohol, vehicle maintenance, and HAZMAT  compliance.violation rates in each of these categories for each commercial carrier  and then compares these rates to other carriers.", "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration calculates  DOT uses the Safety Measurement System scores to, among other  things, establish safety performance thresholds for carriers. For example,  for HAZMAT commercial carriers, DOT establishes a threshold score of  60 or lower (lower scores are better) in each of three categories: unsafe  driving, crash indicator, and hours-of-service compliance. DOT\u2019s Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Administration identifies carriers who score above  the threshold as those posing the greatest safety risk. The Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Administration can then intervene to focus on specific  safety behaviors. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  intervention actions include sending warning letters, conducting on- and  off-site investigations, fines, or placing the carrier out of service.", "DOD uses DOT\u2019s Safety Measurement System scores to determine  whether commercial carriers are eligible for transporting HAZMAT under  the department\u2019s Transportation Protective Services program. For all but  one of the seven Safety Measurement System categories, DOD requires  that commercial carriers seeking to provide certain Transportation  Protective Services meet DOT\u2019s established HAZMAT carrier thresholds.  For compliance with the Safety Measurement System HAZMAT  regulations category, however, DOT establishes a threshold score no  higher than 80 for commercial carriers. In contrast, DOD requires a more- stringent score of 75. At the time of our review, only 53 of the over  400,000 commercial carriers in the United States had been selected to  participate in the Transportation Protective Services program.", "In February 2014, we found that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration faces challenges in reliably assessing safety risk for the  majority of carriers. Among other things, most carriers lack sufficient  safety performance data to ensure that Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration can reliably compare them with other carriers using Safety  Measurement System scores. Basing an assessment of a carrier\u2019s safety  performance on limited data may misrepresent the safety status of  carriers, particularly those without sufficient data from which to reliably  draw such a conclusion. In addition, previous evaluations of the Safety  Measurement System have focused on estimating the correlations  between crash risk and regulatory violation rates and Safety  Measurement System scores. These evaluations have found mixed  evidence that Safety Measurement System scores predict crash risk with  a high degree of precision for specific carriers or groups of carriers. As we  found, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s own  methodology, the Safety Measurement System is intended to prioritize  intervention resources, identify and monitor carrier safety problems, and  support the safety fitness determination process.Carrier Safety Administration also includes a disclaimer with the publicly  released Safety Measurement System scores stating that the data are  intended for agency and law-enforcement purposes, and readers should  not draw safety conclusions about a carrier\u2019s safety condition based on  the Safety Measurement System score, but rather the carrier\u2019s official  safety rating. Due to ongoing litigation related to the Compliance, Safety,   The Federal Motor  Accountability program and the publication of Safety Measurement  System scores, we did not assess the potential effects or tradeoffs  resulting from the display or any public use of these scores. We  recommended that DOT improve the Compliance, Safety, Accountability  program by revising the Safety Measurement System methodology to  better account for limitations in drawing comparisons of safety  performance information across carriers; and in doing so, conduct a  formal analysis that specifically identifies, among other things, the  limitations in the data used to calculate Safety Measurement System  scores including variability in the carrier population and the quality and  quantity of data available for carrier safety performance assessments.  According to federal internal control standards, for an entity to run and  control its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely  communications, including operational data. Program managers need  operational data to determine whether they are meeting their agencies\u2019  goals for accountability, and effective and efficient use of resources.", "DOT agreed to consider our February 2014 recommendations, but  expressed what it described as significant and substantive disagreements  with some aspects of our analysis and conclusions. To the extent that  DOT makes changes to the Safety Measurement System methodology,  this could also affect how DOD uses the information to evaluate  Transportation Protective Services carriers\u2019 safety performance because  of the underlying data reliability concerns with the Compliance, Safety,  Accountability program\u2019s Safety Measurement System data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The complex framework governing the handling, labeling, and packaging  of DOD\u2019s HAZMAT shipments exists to ensure the safe, timely, and cost- effective handling of these materials, but its complexity creates  challenges as shippers, carriers, and receivers implement the various  statutes and regulations of that framework. The distributed nature of this  framework\u2014policies and procedures drawn from various organizations,  varying by class of HAZMAT and mode of transportation, and executed  by multiple players\u2014creates conditions under which mistakes can be  made, particularly regarding pre-transportation functions (e.g., packaging  and labeling). While DOD has issued regulations and other guidance  regarding the handling of HAZMAT, it lacks adequate internal controls to  help ensure that its actions are consistent with those regulations and  guidance. Furthermore, the department lacks a clear understanding of  why these pre-transportation mistakes keep occurring. Absent a better  understanding of the root causes for these mistakes, the department will  be unable to identify corrective actions to better ensure the safe, timely,  and cost-effective transportation of its HAZMAT shipments. Moreover,  absent a department-wide process to identify necessary corrective action  to ensure that DOD installations provide access to secure hold, there is  no assurance that the installations will not repeatedly deny access to the  secure hold area for HAZMAT shipments or fail to assist carriers in finding  alternative means to secure those shipments. While the relative scale of  these incidents is fairly small, the nature of HAZMAT shipments is such  that the risk to public safety as well as the potential impact of cost and  timeliness should be minimized to the greatest extent practicable. DOD  uses Safety Measurement System scores to determine safety  performance of its Transportation Protective Services carriers. However,  both our February 2014 report and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration state that these scores should not be used to draw safety  conclusions about a carrier\u2019s safety condition.

To better understand the  statutes, regulations, guidance, policies, and procedures that govern  DOD\u2019s handling, labeling, and packaging of HAZMAT shipments to  support military operations, several members of the audit team completed  a 2-day DOD-sponsored course on HAZMAT that covered the above- mentioned areas and passed a comprehensive exam at the end of the  course demonstrating their understanding and knowledge of those topics.

Additionally, we interviewed  officials from another major aerial port\u2014Travis Air Force Base (Fairfield,  California). We also visited Aberdeen Proving Ground (Aberdeen,  Maryland) to review the transport of arms, ammunitions, and explosives,  and to visit a secure hold location for that type of HAZMAT. We selected  these locations because they provided a cross section of the various  modes of transportation and hazardous-material classes. We also  selected these locations because they provided us with information on the  various central locations through which DOD transports these materials.  We focused our review on surface and air modes of transport\u2014on  surface transport because most individual shipments are transported by  highway (94 percent of all shipments in fiscal year 2013) and on air  transport because that mode generally has more-restrictive requirements,  for example the quantity of certain HAZMAT (like acetic acid, class 8  HAZMAT) allowed on passenger air transport is lower than in other  modes. We reviewed data from TRANSCOM\u2019s Global Air Transportation  Execution System for 5 fiscal years (fiscal years 2009 through 2013) and  the Defense Transportation Tracking System for fiscal years 2012 and  2013 to analyze records related to pretransportation and transportation  functions (e.g., handling, labeling, and packaging activities and the  transport of HAZMAT in commerce to the final destination point),  respectively.
