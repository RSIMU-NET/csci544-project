However, CMS did not provide estimates of fiscal year 2014 obligations for certain categories of CCIIO-related transactions, such as advertising and other public relations activities. In addition, CMS provided data on CCIIO's staffing levels as of September 30, 2013, but did not provide complete staffing reassignment data.", "GAO was unable to consistently verify the reliability of the data received from CMS. Specifically:", "GAO was able to determine the reliability of CMS's estimates for total obligations for fiscal year 2014, which was $3.7 billion; the number of staff as of September 30, 2013, which was 347; and total salary expenditures from March 2010 through fiscal year 2013, which were $79.8 million.", "GAO could not determine the reliability of any of the other financial information CMS provided because CMS's core financial system did not produce totals for much of the CCIIO-related information requested. For example, the system did not produce expenditure totals for CCIIO-related polling, focus groups, or advertising and other public relations activities because of how these activities are captured in the system. Similarly, information related to reassignment of staff to CCIIO from other CMS and HHS units was not readily available. Consequently, the staff reassignment information provided to GAO was not complete, was not supported by documentary evidence, and could not be verified.", "GAO identified several issues that contributed to CMS's inability to provide complete information that is independently verifiable in a timely manner. First, CMS does not have an effective means of identifying CCIIO-related information. While CMS had policies and procedures for its standard financial operations, it did not have documented policies and procedures for responding to nonroutine information requests. Instead, CMS relied on ad hoc manual procedures that were labor intensive and time consuming. As a result, CMS required an extended period of time to provide most of the information GAO requested, in some cases taking several months. Second, CMS does not have documented procedures to ensure that data requests are reviewed and approved for accuracy. CMS officials told GAO that the information they provided had been subject to review and approval at several levels, including review by subject matter experts. However, these procedures were not documented. Consequently, GAO was not able to independently verify that they had been properly performed. Because CMS's processes are inconsistent with certain federal accounting and internal control standards, Congress and other decision makers may not have access to timely and reliable CCIIO-related information that they may need to make resource allocation decisions and assessments of program performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS identify and evaluate options to facilitate reporting CCIIO-related financial management information that is independently verifiable in a timely manner, and develop and implement policies and procedures to document the preparation, review, and approval of information produced for nonroutine requests.", "HHS did not concur with GAO's recommendations.

Within HHS, CMS is the primary  component responsible for PPACA implementation. In 2011, CMS  created CCIIO, one of six centers under CMS, to oversee implementation  of PPACA\u2019s private health insurance and health insurance exchange  provisions. PPACA provided much of the funding used by CMS to  implement the CCIIO-related private health insurance and health  insurance exchange provisions it contains. Most such funding provided  by PPACA is dedicated to funding these CCIIO-related provisions and  cannot be used for any other CMS activities. However, CMS also used  funding provided by other legislation that was not specifically dedicated to  the private health insurance and health insurance exchange provisions of  PPACA and thus was also available to fund other CMS activities. This  includes CMS\u2019s annual Program Management appropriation, which  provides funding for CMS\u2019s administrative activities and the Health  Insurance Reform Implementation Fund. Funding for CCIIO-related  activities represents a relatively small portion of the total funding used by  CMS and recorded in its core financial system, the Healthcare Integrated  General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS). For example, for fiscal  year 2013, CMS reported that it incurred obligations totaling $1.16 trillion  of which $5.72 billion (0.49 percent) was for CCIIO-related transactions  according to data provided by CMS.", "CMS\u2019s accounting for CCIIO-related transactions is significantly affected  by the manner in which transactions are funded and recorded in HIGLAS,  which is used by all of CMS\u2019s 21 offices and centers, including CCIIO.  Appropriated funds are recorded in HIGLAS using separate appropriation  accounts established by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).  Each year, CMS uses funding from these appropriation accounts to  support its activities, including the implementation of the CCIIO-related  private health insurance provisions of PPACA. HIGLAS accounts for  financial transactions by appropriation account to ensure that funds are  obligated and expended in accordance with applicable appropriations law.  Accordingly, the appropriation accounts in HIGLAS correspond to the  related budgetary funding sources that gave rise to them, rather than to  the CMS office responsible for implementing the specific activities for  which the funding was provided. Consequently, appropriation accounts  that were created based on legislation that funds only CCIIO-related  activities will include only CCIIO-related transactions, and appropriation  accounts that were created based on legislation that funds both CCIIO- related and non-CCIIO-related CMS activities will include both types of  transactions.", "Each fiscal year from 2010 through 2013, CMS\u2019s financial statements,  which were derived from its core financial system, were audited by an  independent public accountant (IPA). In each of these years, the IPA  concluded that CMS\u2019s financial balance sheets\u2014and statements of net  costs, changes in net position, and budgetary resources\u2014were free of  material misstatement.HIGLAS constitute reliable evidence of the nature of the underlying  transactions and their total dollar amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in CMS\u2019s Policies and Procedures Impeded Efforts to Determine the Reliability of Most of the CCIIO-Related Resources That CMS Reported It Received and Used", "paragraphs": ["CMS provided most of the CCIIO-related information we requested, but  limitations in its policies and procedures made the process of obtaining it  difficult and time consuming, and we could not determine the reliability of  most of the amounts CMS provided.

The scope of our review encompassed the financial and staff resources  provided to and used by CMS to help implement the private health  insurance and health insurance exchange provisions of PPACA from  enactment in March 2010 through fiscal year 2013 and the amounts CMS  estimates it will use for fiscal year 2014.", "To achieve our audit objective, we contacted responsible officials at CMS  to request the (1) data concerning total CCIIO-related obligations and  expenditures from the enactment of PPACA in March 2010 through fiscal  year 2013, including amounts related to salaries, travel, advertising and  other public relations activities, polling and focus groups, and  conferences; (2) CMS\u2019s estimates of obligations in total and in each of  these categories for fiscal year 2014; and (3) the number of full- and part- time CCIIO staff as of September 30, 2013, including the number  reassigned from other CMS and Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) units. We also requested available supporting  documentation for the information requested to assist in determining its  reliability. We reviewed policies and procedures\u2014including internal  controls in place to ensure the reliability of the information CMS  provided\u2014in order to assess the information\u2019s applicability to our audit  objectives and its conformance with internal control standards. In order  to determine whether the information CMS provided was reliable, we  analyzed the information we received, conducted extensive follow-up  inquiries with agency officials to ensure that we had received what we  requested, and compared the information to available supporting  documentation. Specifically, we  compared the detailed financial information CMS extracted from the  Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS)  to its related totals, where available, to determine whether all  appropriate information had been extracted and the amounts provided  by CMS were complete and estimated the amount of salaries based on detailed information on  individual grade levels and pay rates that CMS obtained from its  payroll system and compared the amount to the total salaries CMS  obtained from HIGLAS to determine whether the total number of  employees and related staff salary data were reliable as of   September 30, 2013.", "To determine the reasonableness of CCIIO\u2019s estimated funding and  spending amounts for fiscal year 2014, we compared CMS\u2019s estimates to  the President\u2019s budget, with the exception of changes made subsequent  to preparation of the President\u2019s budget.estimates, we obtained an understanding of the basis upon which the  changes were developed to determine if they were reasonable.", "For such changes to the  As described in our report, we could not determine the reliability of most  of the data provided to us. We also met with officials from the Office of  Inspector General of HHS and CMS\u2019s independent financial statement  auditor to determine whether they were aware of any internal control or  substantive issues pertinent to CCIIO-related activities that could affect  our ability to rely upon the financial management information CMS  provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Charles Fox (Assistant Director),  William Brown, Joshua Edelman, Wilfred Holloway, Robert Mabasa,  Phillip McIntyre, and John Warner made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
