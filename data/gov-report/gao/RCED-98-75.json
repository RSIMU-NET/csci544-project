Because tritium decays, it has to be periodically replaced in weapons, but DOE has not produced tritium since 1988 and currently has no production capability. The Department is currently using tritium removed from dismantled weapons to replace decayed tritium in active weapons. However, that supply is limited and new tritium production capacity will be needed in 2005.", "As part of its plans to provide tritium, DOE will build a Tritium Extraction Facility at its Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The $383.4 million project, managed by the Commercial Light Water Reactor Project Office at the Savannah River Site, is scheduled for completion in 2005. During 1997, DOE completed the project\u2019s conceptual design, issued a conceptual design report, and began the preliminary design for the project. Three different teams reviewed the conceptual design and related documents. At your request, we obtained information on (1) the major comments raised by the three reviews and (2) the process used by DOE to respond to those comments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Tritium, which makes possible smaller, more powerful nuclear weapons, decays at a rate of 5.5 percent per year. Therefore, for nuclear weapons to be capable of operating as designed, the tritium in the weapons must be periodically replaced. DOE used to produce new tritium in its reactors at the Savannah River Site, but the last of these reactors was shut down in 1988 because of safety and operational problems. DOE currently has no tritium production capability, although the Department has been able to meet its requirements for tritium by reusing material recovered from dismantled weapons.", "In order to meet currently planned requirements for tritium, a new production capability must be available in 2005. To accomplish this, DOE is pursuing a dual-track program to select the primary production source. The first track is based on using a commercial light water reactor to produce tritium. Target rods containing lithium would be placed in the reactor, and during the reactor\u2019s normal operations, some of the lithium would be turned into tritium. Once removed from the reactor, the target rods would be transported to the Tritium Extraction Facility, where the tritium would be removed.", "The second track involves building an accelerator as the primary producer of tritium. This device accelerates protons (particles within an atom that have a positive electrical charge) to nearly the speed of light. The protons are crashed into tungsten, releasing neutrons (particles within an atom that have no electrical charge), which can be used to change helium into tritium. As currently envisioned, this process would not involve the Tritium Extraction Facility.", "DOE\u2019s current plan is to choose one of the two tracks in late 1998. If the commercial-light-water-reactor track is chosen, the accelerator will be pursued to the point of establishing an engineering design for it, but it will not be built. If the accelerator track is chosen, the accelerator will be built and operated and, as a backup, all aspects of the commercial light water reactor option will be completed\u2014with the exception of the actual production of tritium. The target rods will be produced, agreements with utilities for the use of their reactors will be signed, and the Tritium Extraction Facility will be built.", "Thus, under both tracks, DOE intends to build the Tritium Extraction Facility. Construction of the facility\u2014to be managed by the Commercial Light Water Reactor Project Office at the Savannah River Site\u2014is currently estimated to cost $383.4 million and is scheduled for completion in 2005. The Tritium Extraction Facility project completed the conceptual design phase in October 1997. The preliminary design, currently being developed, is scheduled to be completed in June 1998.", "The conceptual design for the Tritium Extraction Facility was reviewed by three teams\u2014the \u201cRed Team,\u201d the \u201cIndependent Review Team,\u201d and the \u201cFormal Design Review Team.\u201d Although there is no requirement for such reviews, they were requested by DOE headquarters\u2019 Office of Commercial Light Water Reactor Production and the Project Office at Savannah River to increase their confidence in the conceptual design of the facility before proceeding to the preliminary design phase. All teams reviewed drafts of the conceptual design and/or the conceptual design report.

The Red Team and the Formal Design Review Team expressed a favorable opinion overall of the facility\u2019s design and the related documentation. According to the Red Team, the conceptual design\u2019s scope, cost, and schedule are appropriate; the technical concept and approach are sound; all major risks have been identified; and the building is constructible and, in general, appears to comply with DOE\u2019s current requirements. The Formal Design Review Team reported that it did not identify any significant items that could not be corrected with three documents due to be completed after the team\u2019s review\u2014the Facility Design Description, the System Design Description, and the Conceptual Design Statement of Work. The Independent Review Team did not make any overall comments on the conceptual design.", "In addition to the overall comments made by two of the review teams, all three teams made a number of specific comments. The Red Team had 34 comments (see app. I for a listing of the Red Team\u2019s major comments), and the Independent Review Team had 60 comments (see app. II for a listing of the Independent Review Team\u2019s major comments). The Formal Design Review Team made 691 specific documentary and technical comments on the conceptual design and related documents\u2014none of which it considered to be major impediments to the design and construction of the Tritium Extraction Facility. The specific comments made by all three review teams covered a wide range of topics, including the design of specific systems, the design and construction schedule, life-cycle costs, the method of contracting for the design and construction, and the level of detail in the supporting documentation and in the conceptual design report.", "Comments that the review teams considered to be significant and that we believe cover issues that could affect the success of the project related to the design of the remote handling and tritium extraction processes, the need to include contingencies in the schedule, and the level of detail in the conceptual design report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Remote Handling and Tritium Extraction Processes", "paragraphs": ["The remote handling system for the Tritium Extraction Facility, the means by which nearly all facility processes and maintenance, including moving tritium target rods and opening them, will be controlled from a separate (remote) room. The extraction process involves heating the target rods in a furnace and removing the tritium and other gases from them. Project officials do not consider design and construction of these systems to be high-risk, but they do believe that they are the highest-risk tasks involved in the project.", "The Red Team reported that the remote handling and tritium extraction processes include risks that need to be addressed in the near term. The team found that a plan to mitigate the risks was not evident and that the subsystems to manipulate and open the target rods had not been demonstrated. The team believed that the time and cost to engineer and develop the processes would be greater than the estimates in the conceptual design report. Similarly, in a comment it deemed \u201csignificant,\u201d the Independent Review Team stated that the target rod handling process was overly complex. The team proposed an alternative method and suggested that it be discussed in the conceptual design report.", "The Red Team and the Independent Review Team consider DOE\u2019s actions and responses to the comments on the remote handling and tritium extraction processes to be generally adequate. According to Red Team members and the chairman of the Independent Review Team, much has changed since their reviews were conducted.

The chairman of the team told us that it was specifically concerned with the plans for a mock-up of the remote handling process and a prototype of the tritium extraction furnace\u2014believing that any problems with them could delay the project overall because the tasks run concurrently with the development of the detailed design. The chairman explained that although the conceptual design report now contains more detail on the project\u2019s schedule, it still does not include contingencies. Because he believes this feature to be very important, he considers DOE\u2019s response to this comment to be inadequate.", "DOE officials informed us that they believe there is no need for the schedule to include contingencies. The Tritium Extraction Facility\u2019s schedule is based on a 5 day per week, 8 hour per day work schedule.

The Red Team concluded that the conceptual design package was insufficient to permit an architect engineering firm to independently proceed with the preliminary design.", "Since the three teams reviewed the draft conceptual design, the Project Office has provided considerable additional information in the issued conceptual design report. Furthermore, according to program officials, DOE never intended for an architect engineering firm to develop the preliminary design independently, but rather for the firm to work with the Project Office to develop the design. After reviewing the final conceptual design report, the Red Team and the chairman of the Independent Review Team consider their comments about the level of detail to be resolved. The Formal Design Review Team has yet to review DOE\u2019s actions subsequent to its review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Process for Handling Review Teams\u2019 Comments", "paragraphs": ["Although one of the review teams was chartered by DOE headquarters and two were chartered by the Savannah River Project Office, the purpose of obtaining the independent reviews of the conceptual design was similar in all three cases\u2014to provide confidence in the adequacy of the Tritium Extraction Facility\u2019s conceptual design. Nevertheless, there were no uniform guidelines established for these reviews, and the comments made by each of the review teams were handled differently. In addition, DOE and the Project Office did not reach closure with any of the review teams prior to initiating the preliminary design phase.", "Neither DOE nor the Project Office at the Savannah River Site initially responded to all of the Red Team\u2019s comments. In April 1997, on the basis of a briefing provided by the Red Team, DOE headquarters selected 10 items that it believed to be most important and that required action before the beginning of the preliminary design phase. On October 31, 1997, the Project Office sent a letter to DOE headquarters describing the actions taken in response to the comments selected by headquarters and one other item added by DOE officials at Savannah River. For 8 of the 11 comments, the Project Office analyzed the comments and formally documented its responses. The Project Office took no action on two of the comments, deferring action until later in the project. The Project Office disagreed with one comment.", "On December 2 and 3, 1997 (after DOE\u2019s October 31, 1997, approval to proceed to the preliminary design phase), DOE headquarters officials took a team composed of three former Red Team members to the Savannah River Site to determine what had been done in response to all 34 comments contained in the team\u2019s report. The Project Office prepared a list of the actions taken, and the three members of the Red Team concluded that, overall, the Project Office had been responsive to the comments. They concluded that the conceptual design had been completed with the level of detail required by DOE orders and concurred with the decision to proceed with the preliminary design. DOE project officials informed us that they intend to also have a panel similar to the Red Team review the project\u2019s design at the conclusion of the preliminary design phase.", "The Project Office handled the Independent Review Team\u2019s comments differently. On July 31, 1997, prior to the initiation of the preliminary design phase, the Project Office formally responded to all 60 of the team\u2019s comments. Neither DOE nor the Project Office transmitted the responses to members of the Independent Review Team, and their review of the responses was not solicited. However, we asked the chairman of the Independent Review Team to review the Project Office\u2019s responses. The chairman considers the responses to 55 of the comments to be adequate and to 5, inadequate. One of these five comments involves the project\u2019s schedule, as discussed earlier. The chairman does not consider the other four to be significant.", "The Project Office handled the Formal Design Review Team\u2019s comments in a different manner still. By October 31, 1997, the Project Office had reviewed each of the Formal Design Review Team\u2019s 691 comments and recommended 454 for closure\u2014that is, that the Project Office\u2019s actions satisfied the comments. A number of the comments recommended for closure (about 12 percent) pertained to work at Building 233-H that will be conducted as part of another project. These comments will be forwarded to the office managing that project for consideration and disposition. According to the Project Office, the 237 outstanding comments will be dealt with during the preliminary design phase of the project.", "The original intention was for the Formal Design Review Team to review the Project Office\u2019s responses and for the chairman of the team to issue a \u201cclosure\u201d memo (1) stating that the team had reviewed and agreed with the Project Office\u2019s responses to its comments and (2) endorsing the conceptual design. As of January 1998, the Formal Design Review Team had not reviewed the Project Office\u2019s responses and the chairman had not issued such a memo. Project Office officials informed us that relevant action plans will be completed by the spring of 1998, at which time the chairman could issue the memo."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the overall favorable responses to the Tritium Extraction Facility\u2019s conceptual design, it may have been prudent to proceed with the preliminary design phase in October 1997. However, the intent of having independent reviews was to enhance confidence in the conceptual design, and numerous concerns were identified, some of which the review teams considered to be important. None of the various approaches for handling the review teams\u2019 comments resulted in reaching closure with the teams before the start of the preliminary design phase. A structured, consistent approach to resolving comments and obtaining concurrence would have helped ensure that the project received the maximum benefit from the reviews. Such a structured approach could apply in the future, as DOE intends to have an independent team review the Tritium Extraction Facility\u2019s design after the preliminary design work is completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Energy establish guidelines for formally responding to and reaching closure within a reasonable time frame on comments made during future independent design reviews of the Tritium Extraction Facility project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOE for its review and comment. Overall, DOE agreed with the facts contained in the report and concurred with the recommendation.

First, DOE stated that our report inferred that the Department began the preliminary design prematurely because not all of the review teams\u2019 comments were resolved. As stated in our draft report, given the overall favorable responses to the conceptual design, we believe it may have been prudent to proceed with the preliminary design phase. However, as a general practice, we believe that to maximize the usefulness of a design review team\u2019s comments, DOE should present the team with responses to each comment and reach closure with the team on how and when the comment will be resolved. By responding to the design review team\u2019s comments in this manner, DOE would ensure agreement by all parties on the appropriate timing and proper course of action required to resolve the problems noted. In cases in which DOE disagrees with the comment, this type of formal response process could open a dialogue that could convince the design review team that no action is required or would at least provide a record of the reasons why DOE and the design review team chose to disagree.", "Second, DOE expressed the opinion that addressing contingencies in the schedule, as advocated by the Independent Review Team, is not a major concern. However, the chairman of the Independent Review Team still believes that the lack of this feature is significant. Both DOE and the Independent Review Team\u2019s perspectives are presented in our report. We believe that this disagreement demonstrates why DOE needs a formal procedure for dealing with design review teams\u2019 comments. In this case, DOE did not provide the Independent Review Team with responses to its comments, and there was no effort made to discuss and document areas of disagreement.
