The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014primarily through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)\u2014developed the national strategy, consistent with congressional direction, to govern federal transportation security efforts. However, TSA and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials all identified some degree of redundancy or overlap regarding the role of the strategy in light of other transportation security strategies such as the National Strategy for Aviation Security. Agencies reported using the national strategy for reference, context, and general coordination, but not for driving program activities. Agencies instead use separate strategies and plans to guide program and resource decisions. Similarly, agencies in DHS and DOT (key stakeholders of the strategy) use various strategy documents to allocate resources for federal efforts, which the strategy may inform. However, DHS has not communicated how the strategy aligns with related strategies to guide these efforts. By doing so, federal stakeholders would be better positioned use the national strategy as part of a whole-of-government approach to preventing terrorist attacks.", "TSA effectively incorporated input from stakeholders and considered risk information to develop the 2018 National Strategy for Transportation Security. TSA iteratively updated the biennial strategy by incorporating input across transportation modes and feedback from stakeholders in a manner that generally met GAO's leading practices for collaboration. For example, TSA clearly communicated roles and responsibilities regarding the strategy development process for participating agencies. In addition, the strategy compiles risks identified for each transportation mode in other strategic planning documents. TSA strategy development officials stated that they also included emergent risk information, for example cybersecurity risks. The security risks identified in these risk assessments, in general, aligned with the risk-based priorities highlighted in the strategy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS should, in consultation with DOT, communicate to key stakeholders how the National Strategy for Transportation Security aligns with related strategies to guide federal efforts.

In  October 2010, terrorists placed concealed explosive devices in cargo  onboard two U.S.-bound all-cargo aircraft, which could have caused  catastrophic damage if not intercepted by multiple foreign governments  working together.", "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and recognizing  vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s transportation systems, Congress directed  the creation of a National Strategy for Transportation Security to serve as  the governing document for federal transportation security efforts. The  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released the first National  Strategy for Transportation Security in 2005, and since then it has  prepared and released the strategy six times. The 2018 national strategy  aims to identify and evaluate U.S. transportation assets that must be  protected from attack or disruption by terrorist or other hostile forces. It  sets out to provide a forward-looking, risk-based plan for the security and  freedom of movement of people and goods while preserving civil rights,  civil liberties, and privacy. The national strategy includes a base plan,  modal security plans\u2014covering aviation, maritime, and surface  transportation\u2014and an intermodal security plan.

Specifically, we compared TSA\u2019s  development of the national strategy with selected leading practices for  implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms that we have  previously identified, including leadership; clarifying roles and  responsibilities; and documenting and updating written guidance and  agreements. Further, we reviewed the risk-based priorities in the  national strategy base plan, modal plans, and intermodal plan. We then  assessed the extent to which the national strategy\u2019s risk-based priorities  reflected risks to transportation security identified in key assessments: the  2014 National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment; the 2017 National  Maritime Terrorist Threat Assessment; and the 2017 Transportation  Sector Security Risk Assessment.

Following  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act, enacted in November 2001, established TSA  as the federal agency with primary responsibility for transportation  security. Within this framework, two components of DHS\u2014TSA and  Coast Guard\u2014are responsible for most transportation security activities.  TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for security in all modes of  transportation, including civil aviation, passenger and freight rail, highway  and motor carrier transportation, and pipeline transportation systems.  Coast Guard is the lead federal agency responsible for maritime  transportation security, though TSA plays a role in managing, for  example, credentialing for workers at seaports.", "TSA and Coast Guard\u2019s regulatory authorities vary across modes, which  affects how transportation security activities are planned for and  implemented. For example, TSA and Coast Guard exercise more  regulatory authority over (and, in some cases, have operational  responsibility for) the aviation and maritime modes pursuant to their  respective statutory authorities. In the aviation mode, TSA has  operational responsibility for the screening of passengers and property  transported on aircraft, but also imposes and enforces security  requirements established through regulation on air carriers and other  industry stakeholders. Similarly, Coast Guard has responsibility for  ensuring that maritime vessels and facilities are compliant with applicable  security requirements. TSA\u2019s statutory responsibilities for the surface  transportation modes, however, are generally less prescriptive. With  respect to these modes, TSA works with transportation operators on a  broad set of risk-based activities such as training, information sharing,  and community outreach within a collaborative environment. For example,  in freight rail TSA and its partners undertake collaborative efforts to  establish security priorities, identify vulnerabilities and capability gaps,  and reduce risks. Freight rail operators, meanwhile, engage in  cooperative and independent security initiatives to assess risks and refine  security plans.", "Other federal agencies are involved in transportation security, but to  varying degrees. At the department level, DHS is responsible for  providing strategic guidance, directing a national unity of effort, and  coordinating security across critical infrastructure sectors. CBP  manages programs designed to secure cargo and ensure intermodal  transportation security, among other things. CBP activities include  programs to encourage trade partners to implement security best  practices and identify high-risk shipments and travelers before they reach  U.S. ports of entry. DOT also has some transportation security  responsibilities, which we describe below. Figure 1 illustrates agencies\u2019  activities across transportation modes.", "Federal policies and plans establish specific coordination mechanisms  and activities for transportation security. Specifically, in accordance with  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, DHS created the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan to guide the national effort to  manage risk to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including through  coordination of agencies and various critical infrastructure sectors,  including transportation systems. Under this structure, DHS and DOT  are co-Sector-Specific Agencies for the Transportation Systems Sector.  DHS delegated its sector responsibilities to TSA and Coast Guard.  Within the transportation systems sector, agencies and stakeholders  charter councils for individual transportation modes as well as the sector  as a whole. Sector Coordinating Councils and Government Coordinating  Councils for each critical infrastructure sector provide forums for  promoting efficient collaboration within the sectors. Further, the Sector- Specific Agencies are to develop, in close collaboration with Sector  Coordinating Councils and other sector partners, a sector-specific plan  that tailors the National Infrastructure Protection Plan to the specific  characteristics and landscape of each critical infrastructures sector.  Under the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan, DOT and DHS,  through TSA, and Coast Guard, coordinate with infrastructure owners and  operators, provide technical assistance, and carry out incident  management responsibilities.

The Commission found that the screening of passengers and their property at airports accounted for the majority of transportation  security investments, leaving vulnerable other facets of transportation  security, such as cargo, general aviation, and surface transportation. The  Commission recommended that the U.S. government identify and  evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected, set risk- based priorities for defending them, select the most practical and cost  effective means of doing so, and then develop a plan, budget, and  funding source to implement the effort.", "Congress subsequently passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 (Intelligence Reform Act), which directed the  Secretary of DHS to develop, prepare, implement, and update, as  needed, a National Strategy for Transportation Security and  transportation modal security plans. The statute further directs the  Secretary of Homeland Security to work jointly with the Secretary of  Transportation to develop, revise, and update the national strategy and  transportation modal security plans. Within DHS, responsibility for such  strategic planning had been delegated by the Secretary of Homeland  Security in May 2003 to TSA for transportation security across all modes  of transportation and to Coast Guard for maritime security, specifically.

As TSA  develops future iterations of the national strategy, key stakeholders would  be better positioned to use it if the departments communicate how the  national strategy aligns with related strategies.
