The regulators alleged that the firms allowed their investment bankers to pressure equity research analysts in ways that could cause them to issue misleading research to the harm of investors. Under the Global Research Analyst Settlement (Global Settlement), the firms had to undertake reforms designed to sever links between research and investment banking. The SROs also adopted equity research rules to address analyst conflicts across the industry, but these rules were not as stringent in some areas as the Global Settlement. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required GAO to study these issues. This report discusses (1) what is known about the effectiveness of the regulatory actions taken to address analyst conflicts and (2) what further actions, if any, could be taken to address analyst conflicts. GAO reviewed empirical studies and SEC and SRO rules, examination findings, and enforcement actions. GAO interviewed SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) staff, and market participants and observers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Existing research and stakeholder views suggest that the Global Settlement and other regulatory actions have helped to address conflicts faced by equity research analysts. The results of the empirical studies that GAO reviewed generally suggest that the Global Settlement and equity research rules adopted by the SROs were associated with improvements in analysts\u0092 stock recommendations. FINRA officials and SEC staff told GAO that the regulatory reforms have been effective, citing minor deficiencies in their examinations and the limited number of enforcement actions involving conflicts between research and investment banking as evidence of the reforms\u0092 effectiveness. Independent monitors, which were required as part of the Global Settlement, also found that the 12 firms generally were complying with the Global Settlement. Finally, broker-dealers, institutional investors, and others told GAO that the regulatory actions have helped insulate equity research from investment banking influence, although some noted that not all conflicts can be eliminated and certain restrictions can be circumvented.", "Although SEC and FINRA have been taking regulatory action to further address conflicts faced by research analysts, additional action is warranted. FINRA has been working to finalize a rule proposal designed to broaden the obligations of firms to identify and manage equity analyst conflicts and better balance the goals of helping ensure objective and reliable research with minimizing regulatory costs and burdens. FINRA also has been working to finalize another rule proposal that would address conflicts faced by debt research analysts. The current SRO research rules do not cover debt research analysts, although these analysts face conflicts of interests similar to those faced by their equity analyst counterparts. In the absence of an SRO debt research rule, the SROs have relied on antifraud statutes and SRO rules requiring ethical conduct. They also have encouraged firms\u0097with limited success\u0097to comply voluntarily with industry-developed principles designed to address debt analyst conflicts. FINRA plans to package its two rule proposals together and submit them to SEC in the first half of 2012. In contrast, SEC and FINRA have not proposed codifying the Global Settlement\u0092s remaining terms. At the request of the broker-dealers, a court modified the Global Settlement in 2010 and eliminated settlement terms where, for the most part, comparable SRO rules existed. Nonetheless, some of the Global Settlement\u0092s terms that serve to protect investors have not been codified. As a result, the Global Settlement firms continue to be subject to the requirements of the Global Settlement and the SRO research analyst rules, while other firms that provide the same services are subject only to the SRO research analyst rules. As a result, investors may not be provided the same level of protection. GAO has previously reported that a regulatory framework should ensure that market participants receive consistent and useful information as well as consistent protections for similar financial products and services. SEC staff told GAO that they periodically have discussed and analyzed the Global Settlement terms but have not formally assessed and documented whether any of the Global Settlement\u0092s remaining terms should be codified. By not formally assessing whether codifying any of the Global Settlement\u0092s remaining terms provides an effective way of furthering investor protection, SEC may be missing an opportunity to provide the same level of protection for all investors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SEC formally assess and document whether any of the Global Settlement\u0092s remaining terms should be codified.

In the  enforcement actions leading to the Global Research Analyst Settlement  (Global Settlement), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and  other authorities alleged that the firms allowed their investment bankers to  pressure equity research analysts in ways that could and, in some cases,  did cause them to issue misleading or false research to the potential harm  of investors. For example, investment bankers at certain firms could  influence the amount of compensation received by equity analysts,  potentially enabling them to pressure the analysts into improperly  promoting the stocks of companies whose investment banking business  the firms were seeking to attract.

According to the staff, these deficiencies  included broker-dealers failing to disclose analyst conflicts in their  research reports and failing to comply with requirements that restrict an  analyst\u2019s public appearance.", "In addition to their findings from broker-dealer examinations, FINRA  officials and SEC staff said that the limited number of enforcement  actions involving conflicts between equity research and investment  banking suggests that the regulatory reforms have been effective. From  2005 through 2010, FINRA took 10 enforcement actions against broker- dealers for violations of NASD Rule 2711 that involved conflicts between  research and investment banking. Five of the enforcement actions were  taken against Global Settlement firms and largely involved failures to  adequately comply with disclosure requirements (see fig. 3). The other  five enforcement actions were taken against nonGlobal Settlement firms:  three for allowing investment banking personnel to influence analyst  compensation and two for failing to comply with requirements to disclose  the firm\u2019s compensation for investment banking services. In each  instance, the firm was required to sign an Acceptance, Waiver, and  Consent, a settlement wherein the broker-dealer consents, without  admitting or denying the findings, to the entry of the findings and to the  imposition of sanctions. In addition, FINRA censured the firms for their  misconduct and imposed monetary fines.", "SEC also has taken enforcement actions involving conflicts between  research and investment banking. Specifically, SEC took a total of three  such actions from 2005 through 2010. In 2005, SEC brought a settled  action against two research supervisors for their failure to reasonably  supervise an equity research analyst who published fraudulent research.  The case focused on the adequacy of supervision of a research analyst,  who was subject to a prior enforcement action that alleged the analyst  produced biased research to support the firm\u2019s investment banking  business. In 2007, SEC issued a cease and desist order against a firm for  employing business practices that linked research and investment  banking, creating incentives for its analysts to support the firm\u2019s  investment banking business. In 2010, SEC issued a cease and desist  order against a firm for failing to establish and enforce policies and  procedures to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information. The  firm engaged in securities research and was the parent of an investment  advisory subsidiary that shared the same chief compliance officer. In its  order, SEC alleged that the firm failed to prevent its investment advisory  subsidiary from misusing material research information, such as the  initiation of research coverage or changes in price targets, produced by  its research department.", "Additionally, under the Global Settlement, each of the 12 broker-dealers  had to (1) hire an independent monitor to assess whether the firm had  developed adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with  the Global Settlement and (2) certify compliance with the Global  Settlement within 5 years of the date of the entry of the final judgment.  Each independent monitor generally completed and filed their reports  between October 2003 and February 2006.", "Based on our review of the independent monitor reports, all the monitors  generally concluded that each firm had implemented effective policies  and procedures to comply with the Global Settlement. To conduct their  reviews, the monitors typically examined each firm\u2019s policies and  procedures, reviewed supporting documents to verify the implementation  and effectiveness of the policies and procedures, made observations,  conducted inspections (for example, of physical separation of research  and investment banking), and interviewed the firm\u2019s management and  staff. Although the independent monitors concluded that each firm was in  compliance with the Global Settlement, all of them included  recommendations in their reports. The recommendations generally were  intended to clarify or enhance a firm\u2019s compliance policies and  procedures or improve a firm\u2019s ability to track and monitor its compliance.  According to SEC staff, all the Global Settlement firms certified that they  were in compliance with the Global Settlement by August 2008.  According to SEC staff, on a number of occasions, the Global Settlement  firms self-reported instances of noncompliance with the Global Settlement  to SEC staff. These reported instances largely concerned technical  failures to provide disclosures regarding the availability of independent  research or ratings on customer account statements and confirmations.  Upon receiving these reports, SEC staff typically notified the other  regulators involved in the Global Settlement, discussed the violations and  remedial measures with the reporting firm, and asked that the firm write to  inform the court of the matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Market Participants and Others Generally View the Reforms as Effective, Some Noted Conflicts Could Not Be Completely Addressed or Eliminated", "paragraphs": ["Most market participants and observers we interviewed told us that the  regulatory reforms have been effective in mitigating analyst conflicts but  provided different reasons why.

Furthermore, officials  from the consumer interest group said that the media attention  surrounding the investigations that led to the Global Settlement helped to  raise investors\u2019 awareness of analyst conflicts.", "Despite generally viewing the regulatory reforms as effective, some  market participants and observers told us that the reforms do not  completely eliminate research analysts\u2019 conflicts. For example, according  to an academic, the SRO research analyst rules and the Global  Settlement prohibit sell-side analysts from being compensated based on  their investment banking contributions, but their pay may be based on  their firm\u2019s overall profitability\u2014of which investment banking can be a  major source. As a result, sell-side analysts face inherent conflicts  because they know that negative ratings can harm their firm\u2019s investment  banking business and, in turn, their personal compensation, according to  state securities regulators, institutional investors, academics, and others  with whom we spoke. Officials from a consumer interest group told us that  this inherent conflict can be eliminated by prohibiting firms from engaging  in both investment banking and research. In addition, although the Global  Settlement requires the firms to physically separate research and  investment banking staff, this prophylactic measure can be circumvented,  according to officials from an investor advocacy group and a consumer  interest group. For example, officials from the investor advocacy group  said analysts and investment bankers could talk outside of the firm.

As part of its  2005 request that the SROs review the effectiveness of their research  rules, SEC asked NASD and NYSE to make any recommendations for  rule changes or additions. To address this request, NASD and NYSE staff  conducted a section-by-section review of the rules, which included  assessing whether the rules were accomplishing their purpose,  comparing the rules to the Global Settlement, considering gaps in  coverage, and reviewing industry questions and comments about the  rules. As discussed in the following paragraphs, the SRO staff  recommended revising their rules to prohibit a practice that was not  permitted under the Global Settlement\u2019s terms. In general, the staff  recommended several rules changes that were intended to improve rule  effectiveness by striking a better balance between trying to ensure  objective and reliable research and permitting the flow of information to  investors and minimizing costs and burdens to firms. Specifically, the  recommendations included:  changing the definition of \u201cresearch analyst,\u201d \u201cresearch report,\u201d and  other terms used in the rule, to codify exceptions set forth in previous  interpretive material and to align with SEC Regulation Analyst  Certification and the Global Settlement; eliminating a provision that permitted investment banking personnel to  review research before publication (to verify factual information),  because SRO staff believed that such a review raised concerns about  the objectivity of the research and noted that such a review was not  permitted under the Global Settlement\u2019s terms; amending the disclosure rules to provide more effective disclosure by  allowing, in lieu of disclosure in the research report itself, a prominent  warning on the cover of research reports that conflicts exist and  information about how investors could obtain more details about those  conflicts of interest on the firm\u2019s website, because staff were  concerned that the volume of disclosures in the reports could obscure  their overall message; and amending the provision that prohibited investment banking personnel  from retaliating against research analysts as a result of unfavorable  research to include all of a firm\u2019s employees.", "Similar to the concerns raised by the SRO staff about the conflict  disclosures, various market participants and observers we interviewed  questioned the effectiveness of or raised concerns about the burden of  the conflict disclosures. For example, some broker-dealers told us that  that the volume and complexity of the disclosures have made the  information less useful for investors. Also, officials from three associations  representing investors and an institutional investor said the disclosures  are important but do not convey sufficient information for investors to fully  understand the nature and magnitude of analyst conflicts. Broker-dealers  further noted that their need to continually collect a wide range of data to  track analyst conflicts is costly and burdensome.", "In 2008, FINRA issued a proposal to consolidate the NASD and NYSE  research analyst rules in a new FINRA rule and move to a more  principles-based regulatory approach in this area. The proposal  included most of the recommendations made by the NASD and NYSE  staff in their December 2005 report. Additionally, FINRA\u2019s proposed  consolidated rule would broaden the obligations of its member broker- dealers to identify and manage analyst conflicts. Specifically, it included a  provision to require FINRA members to establish, maintain, and enforce  policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and effectively  manage conflicts related to the preparation, content, and distribution of  research reports and public appearances by equity analysts. The  proposal also specified that the policies and procedures must address  information barriers and other safeguards to insulate research analysts  from pressure by investment banking personnel. The proposal largely  maintained the same disclosures, including a provision that would require  a member to disclose in any research report all conflicts that reasonably  could be expected to influence the objectivity of the report and that are  known or should have been known on the date of the report\u2019s publication  or distribution. FINRA received five comment letters on its proposal. The  comments (which were from a venture capital association, a securities  industry association, a securities firm, a law office, and an individual)  generally supported the proposal but expressed concerns, including that  some terms were too broadly defined and, thus, would make compliance  difficult.", "FINRA has not yet finalized its 2008 proposal designed to consolidate the  SRO research analyst rules and implement recommendations made by  NASD and NYSE staff in 2005.

SEC  staff and FINRA officials told us that SEC encouraged FINRA to consider  adopting a rule to address conflicts of interest faced by fixed-income  research analysts. As discussed later in the report, FINRA recently issued  a concept release for a fixed-income research rule.

The  Global Settlement also originally provided that SEC would agree, subject  to court approval, to modify any term in Section I or II of the addendum  that had not been superseded within 5 years of the entry date of the  Global Settlement, unless SEC determined the modification would not be  in the public interest.", "While NASD and NYSE adopted research analyst rules that are similar to  many of the Global Settlement\u2019s terms (see app. II for a comparison of  the Global Settlement and SRO research analyst rules), they did not  expressly state that their rules superseded the terms.Global Settlement firms, with SEC\u2019s agreement, submitted a request to a   In 2009, the  federal district court to modify the Global Settlement\u2019s addendum.

However, the firms noted in their  request that SEC indicated that certain provisions should be retained in  the public interest. Consequently, the firms did not ask the court to  terminate in full Sections I and II, but instead to modify the majority of the  terms in Section I and a disclosure requirement in Section II. The  broker-dealers primarily justified their requested changes based upon the  existence of the SRO research analyst rules that addressed the same  concerns and provided comparable protections.", "On March 15, 2010, the federal district court approved all but one of the  requested changes.investment banking personnel to communicate with each other\u2014outside  the presence of internal legal or compliance staff\u2014about market or  industry trends, conditions, or developments, provided that such  communications were consistent in nature with communications that an  analyst might have with investing customers.

According to  SEC staff, the reference to FINRA\u2019s consolidated rule proposal was  included in the modified Global Settlement because of the possibility that  FINRA would amend its rule proposal to include the remaining terms.  According to FINRA officials, FINRA does not plan to state that its  consolidated rule, when finalized, would supersede the Global  Settlement. FINRA officials said the Global Settlement serves to address  bad behavior in which the Global Settlement firms allegedly engaged;  thus, some of the Global Settlement\u2019s terms are more stringent than the  SRO research analyst rules and should not apply to firms that did not  engage in such behavior. FINRA officials said that the decision to modify  or terminate the Global Settlement should not be done through a FINRA  rulemaking; rather, it should be determined by the court based on  whether the remedial actions required under the Global Settlement have  reached their finality. SEC staff told us that any rulemaking to codify the  provisions of the Global Settlement would be most appropriate as SRO  rules.  SEC staff continue to work with FINRA to achieve this goal.", "According to FINRA officials, they have carefully considered the  appropriateness and impact of codifying the Global Settlement\u2019s  remaining terms. They are concerned that some of the remaining terms  are potentially costly and burdensome and would affect unfairly those  firms that were not alleged to have engaged in wrongful conduct,  particularly some small firms that provide both research and investment  banking services. As discussed, NASD and NYSE staff conducted a  section-by-section review of the research analyst rules in 2005, which  included comparing the rules to the Global Settlement\u2019s terms, and  recommended codifying one of the terms not already in the rules. For  FINRA\u2019s consolidated equity rule proposal, FINRA officials told us that  they recently analyzed and discussed the Global Settlement\u2019s remaining  terms with SEC staff and conveyed to the SEC staff their position on  which ones should be codified. According to the FINRA officials, their  analysis considered the investor protection benefits of adopting the  Global Settlement\u2019s remaining terms and the costs and burdens that such  action would impose on non-Global Settlement firms. The officials told us  that their analysis largely was done through internal discussions and was  not documented.", "According to SEC staff, it is incumbent on the Global Settlement firms to  initiate action to repeal or modify any of the Global Settlement\u2019s terms (as  provided in the modified Global Settlement), and none of the firms have  contacted SEC to discuss further modifications since 2009. The staff said  that if the firms requested that the Global Settlement be modified, SEC  would have to find that the modifications were counter to the public  interest for SEC to oppose the request. Moreover, SEC staff said that the  Global Settlement firms continue to be subject to the Global Settlement,  because the related enforcement actions found them to be allegedly  engaged in a litany of misconduct. They told us that the Global Settlement  was not intended to create a competitive disadvantage for the Global  Settlement firms, but rather to address their conduct. At the same time,  the SEC staff said that the Global Settlement\u2019s terms provide useful  protections that could benefit all investors if applied more broadly.  According to SEC staff, the Global Settlement firms account for the vast  majority of the U.S. investment banking business, and other broker- dealers have opted to comply voluntarily with the Global Settlement. As a  result, SEC staff said that the majority of research produced by broker- dealers also engaged in investment banking is, in effect, affording  investors the protections provided under the Global Settlement\u2019s terms.", "Although SEC staff and FINRA officials periodically have discussed and  analyzed the Global Settlement\u2019s terms, they have not formally  determined and documented the benefits and costs of adopting rules  based on the Global Settlement\u2019s remaining terms. Such analysis would  serve to determine and make transparent whether the benefits of such  action would likely justify the costs. However, as long as the Global  Settlement remains in effect, the Global Settlement firms continue to be  subject to the requirements of the Global Settlement and the SRO  research analyst rules, while other firms that provide the same services  are subject only to the SRO research analyst rules. As a result, investors  may not be provided the same level of protection. We have previously  reported that a regulatory framework should include investor protection as  part of its mission to ensure that market participants receive consistent,  useful information, as well as consistent legal protections for similar  financial products and services.

Although fixed- income research analysts, like equity research analysts, face conflicts of  interest, fixed-income research conflicts were not addressed in the SRO  research analyst rules. For instance, Enron Corporation\u2019s (Enron)  bankruptcy in the early 2000s drew attention to the harm that could result  from fixed-income analysts\u2019 conflicts. In particular, a sell-side fixed- income analyst assigned to cover Enron\u2019s debt securities testified in 2001  that she perceived pressure from her superiors not to issue negative  public comments on Enron because of Enron\u2019s importance as an  investment banking client of the broker-dealer. When NASD and NYSE  initially adopted their research analyst rules in 2002, the rules did not  cover fixed-income analysts. And neither the Global Settlement nor the  research-related provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (which resulted in  subsequent amendments to the SRO research analyst rules in 2004)  apply to fixed-income research. However, in 2003, SEC adopted  Regulation Analyst Certification to require both equity and fixed-income  analysts to certify that the views expressed in their research reports  accurately reflected their personal views and disclose whether they  received compensation or other payments in connection with their views.", "In the absence of specific SRO research analyst rules covering fixed- income research conflicts, NASD and NYSE generally relied on antifraud  statutes and SRO rules prohibiting fraud and requiring ethical conduct  and a comprehensive supervisory scheme to oversee a firm\u2019s securities  business. In addition, NASD and NYSE encouraged firms to consider  adopting industry-developed principles to address such conflicts. In 2004,  to promote the integrity of fixed-income research, the Bond Market  Association (BMA), an industry association, issued voluntary, principle- based guidelines designed to help firms manage potential conflicts faced  by fixed-income analysts. At the time, BMA did not support the adoption of SRO rules designed to address fixed-income conflicts. The industry  maintained that the nature and intensity of the conflicts fixed-income  analysts faced differed from those equity analysts faced. For example,  industry participants held that prices of debt securities were relatively less  sensitive to the views of research analysts, credit rating agencies played  an important role in the debt markets by providing investors with  independent information, and users of fixed-income research typically  were sophisticated investors presumed to be less in need of protection. In  a December 2005 report on the effectiveness of the SRO research  analyst rules, NASD and NYSE staff concluded that it was not appropriate  at the time to amend the rules to cover fixed-income analysts or codify  BMA\u2019s guiding principles. Instead, staff noted that the SROs were  monitoring the extent to which firms adopted the BMA principles and  would consider rulemaking after assessing the effectiveness of voluntary  compliance with the principles. NASD and NYSE staff further noted that  the existing antifraud statutes and SRO rules could cover any egregious  conduct involving fixed-income research.", "NASD, Research Analysts and Research Reports: NASD and NYSE Joint Interpretive  Guidance on Fixed Income Research, Notice to Members 06-36 (July 2006). systems reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable SRO  rules and securities laws and regulations.

Based partly on BMA\u2019s  guiding principles, FINRA developed an examination module to assess  whether a firm\u2019s fixed-income research supervisory procedures, policies,  and processes promote the integrity of fixed-income research and  address potential conflicts of interest. According to FINRA officials,  FINRA has included a review of fixed-income research in some of its  cycle examinations. As shown in figure 5, between 2005 and 2010,  FINRA (or its predecessors) conducted 55 cycle examinations that  covered fixed-income research and found related deficiencies in 11  examinations. The deficiencies generally involved inadequate supervisory  procedures for managing fixed-income analyst conflicts or inadequate  disclosures of such conflicts. Although none of the examinations resulted  in a formal disciplinary action, one examination found that the firm lacked  procedures not only to prohibit staff from directly or indirectly offering  favorable fixed-income research coverage to issuers but also to prevent  nonresearch staff from attempting to coerce fixed-income analysts to alter  their views on the content of a research report. Finally, the examinations  included eight Global Settlement firms; deficiencies were found in one of  these eight firms.", "In March 2011, FINRA issued a regulatory notice to explore and obtain  public comment on the concept of adopting a rule to address conflicts of  interest faced by fixed-income analysts. In its release, FINRA noted that it  long had been monitoring broker-dealers\u2019 management of conflicts of  interest in fixed-income research and that it was an appropriate time to  engage in rulemaking to address such conflicts because, among other  things, FINRA staff had observed increased retail investment risk in  complex debt securities, such as auction rate securities. Specifically, the  staff noted that the allegations of misconduct in the sale of auction rate  securities illustrated this risk and provided a concrete example that  potential conflicts of interest in the publication and distribution of debt  research existed just as they did for equity research. FINRA officials told  us that SEC staff also encouraged FINRA to adopt a rule to address  fixed-income analyst conflicts.", "According to FINRA officials, the primary purpose of the fixed-income  research rule is to protect retail investors. To that end, the majority of the  existing structural safeguards and disclosures in NASD\u2019s research analyst  rule would apply to retail debt research. Similarly, the disclosures  applicable to equity research largely should apply to debt research and  would include the disclosure of personal and firm financial interests and  the receipt of compensation for investment banking services from  companies covered by fixed-income analysts. However, the scope of the  safeguards would be expanded to cover conflicts between debt research  and sales and trading personnel. Specifically, a firm\u2019s sales and trading  staff would be prohibited from attempting to influence a fixed-income  analyst\u2019s opinion or views for the purpose of benefiting the trading  position of the firm\u2014which allegedly occurred in certain firms engaged in  auction rate securities\u2014or a customer or class of customers. For  example, in 2008, a state securities regulator alleged that a broker-dealer  permitted its sales and trading managers to unduly influence and  pressure its fixed-income research department. The managers did not  agree with the tone or context of a published research report and  allegedly insisted that the report be retracted and replaced with a more  sales-friendly report.", "FINRA officials told us they faced challenges in balancing the benefits of  the rule in providing protections for retail investors with the cost and  burden of the rule for institutional investors. According to the officials,  institutional investors use the analytics, not the recommendations,  generated by fixed-income analysts and do not want rules that would  restrict the flow of timely information. Moreover, institutional investors  trading debt securities generally tend to interact with broker-dealers more  as counterparties than customers and are aware of potential conflicts  faced by fixed-income analysts. FINRA\u2019s concept proposal exempts fixed- income research that is disseminated solely to institutional investors from  some of the structural safeguards and most of the disclosures that would  be applicable to retail debt research. Firms operating under the  exemption would have to clearly distinguish such research from research  disseminated to retail investors. The proposal noted that not all  institutional investors are necessarily alike; therefore, institutional  investors would be allowed to opt out of the exemption and be treated like  retail investors.", "Another challenge in developing a fixed-income research rule is  separating fixed-income research from sales and trading, according to  FINRA. FINRA officials told us that it was easier to describe the conflicts  between fixed-income research and sales and trading than to craft  communication firewalls to separate the two departments. The officials  said that broker-dealers maintain that sales and trading should not be  wholly prohibited from communicating with research, because sales and  trading staff need information from research regarding the  creditworthiness of an issuer and other information reasonably related to  the price or performance of a debt security. In turn, debt analysts need  information from sales and trading to help, among other things, determine  the coverage universe and to assess current prices, spreads, and liquidity  of debt securities.", "Most market participants and observers we interviewed generally  supported the adoption of a FINRA rule to address conflicts faced by  fixed-income research analysts. Stakeholders cited the lack of  transparency in the fixed-income markets as the primary reason for the  need for a fixed-income research rule. Some said that investors lack  sufficient information about the securities in which they sought to invest,  because no regulations require broker-dealers to disclose potential  conflicts. Similarly, FINRA received six comment letters about the concept  proposal, all of which generally supported FINRA\u2019s efforts to develop the   However, all of the letters expressed concerns, including that  proposal.the communication restrictions were unclear and could limit fixed-income  analysts\u2019 ability to support sales and trading.", "As previously discussed, FINRA officials told us that they plan to submit a  proposed fixed-income rule to FINRA\u2019s Board of Governors for its review  and approval in December 2011. The officials said that FINRA then  tentatively plans to file the proposed rule, assuming its board approves it,  with SEC in the first half of 2012. While antifraud statutes and existing  SRO rules serve to protect investors from abuse arising from fixed- income analyst conflicts, SEC and FINRA staff, as well as most market  participants and observers we interviewed, acknowledged that additional  rulemaking is needed to protect investors, particularly retail investors.

Principal  actions include Regulation Analyst Certification, the SRO research  analyst rules, and the Global Settlement\u2014which include similar structural  requirements designed to separate research from investment banking  and thereby insulate research analysts from investment banking pressure  and influence. The Global Settlement imposes, in some areas, more  stringent requirements on the Global Settlement firms than the SRO rules  impose on other broker-dealers engaged in research and investment  banking, because the Global Settlement resulted from enforcement  actions involving analyst conflicts. Nonetheless, the structural  requirements in the SRO rules and the Global Settlement were  developed, in part, based on similar findings and generally seek to  achieve the same fundamental objective\u2014to enhance the integrity and  independence of securities research. But unlike the SRO rules, the Global  Settlement was not intended to be permanent.", "By establishing, in effect, separate but different requirements for  addressing analyst conflicts, the SRO research analyst rules and the  Global Settlement raise the question of whether any of the Global  Settlement\u2019s remaining terms need to be adopted as SEC or SRO rules to  better protect investors. While SEC staff and FINRA officials have  discussed this issue, they have not reached a consensus or formally  determined and documented whether any of the Global Settlement\u2019s  remaining terms should be codified. Through some of its more stringent  requirements, the Global Settlement potentially affords greater  protections to investors in some areas than the SRO rules but imposes  greater burdens on broker-dealers.
