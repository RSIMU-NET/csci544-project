This code allows agencies to track data on contract actions related to national emergencies, providing government-wide insight into response and recovery efforts. DHS closed the codes for Harvey and Irma on June 30, 2018, less than a year after those hurricanes hit. In contrast, the codes for prior hurricanes were open for at least five years, with Katrina remaining open for 13 years.", "Based on a review of 23 contract files from FEMA, USACE, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the Coast Guard, GAO identified challenges in the planning of selected contracts. For example, GAO found USACE officials were not consistently aware of the regulation that defines \u201clocal area.\u201d GAO also found that contracting officers at FEMA, USACE, and the Coast Guard did not consistently write justifications for awards to non-local vendors outside the disaster area, as required. FEMA developed guidance to address this, but the Coast Guard and USACE have not issued guidance or tools to address this requirement.

Federal agencies obligated billions of dollars on contracts in response to  those disasters. Our prior work identified issues related to post-disaster  contracts\u2014which are awarded after a disaster hits. For example, in  September 2015, we found that FEMA\u2019s contracting officers displayed  limited awareness of requirements enacted after Hurricane Katrina to  provide a contracting preference to local firms for disaster response  contracts to the extent feasible and practicable and to limit the length of  noncompetitive contracts awarded based on the urgency exception.", "You asked us to review the federal government\u2019s contracting efforts for  preparedness, response, and recovery efforts related to the three 2017  hurricanes and California wildfires. This report specifically addresses the  use of post-disaster contracts and: (1) assesses the extent to which  federal agencies obligated funds on post-disaster contracts in response to  the 2017 major disasters; (2) assesses the extent to which selected  agencies experienced challenges in the planning process for selected  post-disaster contracts; and (3) describes selected agencies\u2019 lessons  learned as a result of the 2017 major disasters and assesses the extent  to which they have taken action to address them. In December 2018, we  reviewed and reported on these areas on the use of advance contracts,  which are contracts for life-sustaining goods and services that are set up  prior to disasters to be used in the immediate aftermath of disasters.", "To identify the extent to which federal agencies obligated funds on post- disaster contracts in response to the 2017 disasters, we reviewed Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data through  June 30, 2018, the most recent and complete data available at the time of  our review. We identified obligations related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,  and Maria using the national interest action (NIA) code, as well as the  contract description. NIA codes are a data field established in FPDS-NG  for the purpose of tracking federal procurement related to a specific  disaster, emergency, or contingency event. We also assessed the  process for establishing and closing a NIA code. Specifically, we  reviewed the criteria in the 2012 and 2018 memorandum of agreement  between DHS, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the General  Services Administration (GSA)\u2014which oversees FPDS-NG\u2014and  interviewed officials involved in the process. Because a NIA code was not  established in FPDS-NG for the 2017 California wildfires, we asked the  agencies with the highest obligations on post disaster contracts for the  three hurricanes\u2014FEMA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast  Guard)\u2014to identify contracts that they used to respond to that event.  Therefore, our analysis does not capture whether other agencies\u2019  obligated funds on contracts related to the 2017 California wildfires. We  assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing existing information about the FPDS-NG system and the data it collects\u2014 specifically, the data dictionary and data validation rules\u2014and performing  electronic testing. We also compared FPDS-NG data to the contract files  in our review.

Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), as well as agency policy and  guidance. We identified a non-generalizable sample of 23 post-disaster  contracts from the four agencies with the highest post-disaster  obligations\u2014FEMA, USACE, DLA, and Coast Guard\u2014based on FPDS- NG data as of March 31, 2018. We selected contracts to obtain a range of  contracts across four primary selection criteria: (1) contracts awarded  using the unusual and compelling urgency exception to full and open  competition (\u201curgency exception\u201d); (2) contracts awarded using a local  area set-aside (wherein only vendors residing or primarily doing business  in the declared disaster area may compete for a contract award); (3)  contracts awarded to small businesses; and (4) contracts terminated for  default or convenience. We also selected contracts across all three  hurricanes and the California wildfires and all four of the selected  agencies. Using these criteria, we selected 12 FEMA, seven USACE, two  DLA, and two Coast Guard contracts (see Table 1).", "We assessed planning documentation in these contracts against  applicable regulatory and statutory criteria. For example, we assessed the  eight local area set-aside contracts against the related FAR and Stafford  Act requirements, and we assessed the 11 contracts using the urgency  exception against the relevant FAR and PKEMRA criteria. We met with  officials from FEMA, USACE, DLA, the Coast Guard, and the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy.

The  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 required  improvements in the quality of data on federal spending, including  disaster spending, by making data more accessible and transparent,  such as by improving the quality of data submitted by federal  agencies to USASpending\u2014an online tool that tracks federal grant,  loan, contract, and other awards. However, we found that  USASpending provided some information on contract obligations  using disaster response and recovery funds but does not separate  obligations by disaster event. Further, our prior work on the Digital  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 has found limitations  with the data agencies provide, notably the completeness and  accuracy of data. Specifically, we found that agencies routinely  provided award descriptions in an abbreviated way and lacked clarity  needed to compare data across the federal government. Moreover,  we found inconsistencies in agencies\u2019 ability to track contract actions  by disaster. While FEMA has the capacity to provide contract  information by disaster through a centralized contract tracking tool,  USACE officials stated that they use a decentralized tracking process  where they reach out to the districts and centers to identify and track  disaster contracts without a NIA code.", "Prior to the June 30, 2018 decision to close the NIA codes for Harvey  and Irma, DHS OCPO officials told us they found that the number of  actions FEMA was making for these events had decreased. Our  analysis of the NIA codes showed that components across ten  departments, including within DHS and DOD, were executing  contracts related to Harvey and Irma in June 2018. When we  requested supporting documentation and analysis, DHS OCPO  officials provided some correspondence with FEMA but did not  provide government-wide data analysis to identify what other  agencies were awarding and executing contracts related to these  events. DHS OCPO officials stated they also sought input from DOD  through the Defense Pricing and Contracting Office on whether to  keep the codes open. According to DHS officials, DOD deferred to  DHS on the decision because DHS was responsible for establishing  the codes. Further, DOD officials did not provide evidence that would  allow us to determine whether they assessed which defense  components were executing contracts related to these events or  sought the input of the components that were doing so, such as  USACE and the Navy.", "FPDS-NG\u2014a public, government-wide database of federal  procurements\u2014offers a resource the federal government can use to  create recurring and special reports for key users, such as the President,  Congress, executive agencies, and the general public. The NIA code in  FPDS-NG provides consistent tracking and government-wide visibility into  contracting related to disaster events through a publicly available  database. Without clear criteria for establishing and closing NIA codes  that consider the needs of data providers and users, such as FEMA, and  the high visibility of the event being tracked and a mechanism to ensure  consistent implementation of these criteria, insight into disaster  contracting may be limited. Additionally, federal internal control standards  state that management should use quality information, communicate  quality information internally, and communicate quality information  externally to achieve objectives. Management should accomplish this by  considering appropriate methods for communicating externally, such as to  the President, Congress, and the general public.", "As noted above, the 2018 agreement no longer includes the 2012 criteria  that a NIA code can be closed if the NIA no longer has high visibility and  there is no other interest in the NIA code. In our discussions with officials,  DHS OCPO could not provide a rationale for these changes and the  rationale is also not included in the updated agreement. Prior to DHS  OCPO\u2019s decision to close the codes for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a  senior FEMA procurement official requested that they remain open, in  part because of the high visibility of these events. As such, this official  stated that there will be continued interest in the 2017 hurricanes  including inquiries from Congress, which will require agency officials to  pull data for interested parties, as that data can no longer be tracked and  identified through public databases, such as FPDS-NG and  USASpending. DHS OCPO officials denied FEMA\u2019s request, pointing to  the criteria in the 2018 agreement, which does not include consideration  of the visibility of the event or key user needs. As the federal agency  responsible for coordinating disaster response and recovery, FEMA is  well positioned to understand the level of national and political interest in  tracking procurement information for a disaster or emergency event. Yet,  it is unclear why neither the 2012 nor the updated 2018 agreements  included a role for or consideration of key users, such as FEMA and  Congress. Further, as noted above, FEMA program officials expressed  concern over closing the Harvey and Irma codes because they had  planned to use the codes to assess recovery efforts for the 2017  disasters.", "As we have previously reported, it can take years to fully account for  federal contract obligations related to response and recovery after a  hurricane. Once a NIA code is closed, there is no publicly available,  government-wide system to track contract obligations for specific events.  Moreover, DHS OCPO officials were unable to provide data analysis  conducted using available data from prior events to determine historical  patterns in federal contracting obligations for disasters prior to closing the  codes for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Figure 11 illustrates the lack of  insight we have into disaster contracting activities related to the 2017  hurricanes, in comparison to what we know about prior storms with high  federal procurement obligations.", "Further, using the description field in FPDS-NG, we found that between  July 1 and September 30, 2018, after the NIA codes were closed,  agencies obligated at least $136 million on contracts for Hurricane Harvey  and $123 million on contracts for Hurricane Irma. While this provides  some important insights regarding the continued contracting activity  related to these hurricanes, the description field in FPDS-NG cannot be  relied on to provide a full picture. Some agencies may include event- specific information in the description field; however, we found that, for  the 2017 hurricanes, about 65 percent of contract obligations linked to a  NIA code did not include event-specific information in the description.  Without reopening the NIA codes for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and, to  the extent practicable, retroactively populating the NIA codes for contract  actions supporting response and recovery for these hurricanes during the  period they were closed, decision makers are missing important  information to understand the procurement impact of these disasters.  Retroactively entering NIA code information is not unprecedented. For  example, based on our analysis, the NIA codes for the 2005 hurricanes  were established in October 2005, and contracting officers retroactively  entered data for contracts related to these events which occurred as early  as August of that year to enable full insight into contracting for these  disasters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Planning Post- Disaster Contracts Hindered Response and Recovery Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Based on the contracts we reviewed and officials we spoke with  responsible for the planning of these contracts, we found that agencies  experienced challenges planning for post-disaster contracts, especially  when it came to contracting with local vendors.

USACE  removed more than 2.2 million tons of debris from more than 4,500  properties following the northern California wildfires. Due to the size  and scope of this mission, USACE used both its advance contracts  and additional post-disaster contracts for debris removal. According to  USACE officials, they relied on FEMA, the lead for coordinating  federal disaster response, to manage communication with states and  localities and to identify and manage expectations about the scope of  work to be performed using their debris removal contracts.", "USACE officials cited challenges with communicating to state and  local officials what the agency was permitted to do under its mission  assignment. For example, USACE officials told us that local officials  believed that USACE would replace soil removed as part of its debris  removal efforts; however, this was not part of the mission assignment  from FEMA. Further, officials added that different environmental  standards created confusion regarding what types of soil should be  removed. For example, Napa County officials said that USACE\u2019s  mission required them to ensure that no contaminated soil remained  on the properties, without regard for the naturally occurring levels of  arsenic and asbestos in Napa area soil. As a result, Napa County  officials said that USACE removed more soil than was necessary.  However, following discussions with Napa County officials, USACE  obtained site-specific samples from some properties to understand  pre-existing contamination levels prior to further debris removal.", "USACE power restoration mission: Hurricane Maria destroyed  much of the electricity grid in Puerto Rico, leaving millions without  power and resulting in the longest blackout in U.S. history. To restore  power to its 3.3 million people, Puerto Rico requested federal  assistance with its power grid. To coordinate this effort across all  stakeholders, FEMA established a unified command structure\u2014which  included the federal agencies, the Puerto Rican government and its  contractors, and utility companies providing mutual assistance.  According to FEMA officials, this structure allowed stakeholders to  target priority work, ensure crews could access the work areas, and  identify the needed materials. USACE officials stated that they  received direction from FEMA and had limited direct interaction with  Puerto Rican officials. However, despite this structure, USACE  officials noted that changing direction from FEMA contributed to  inefficiencies in contract management. For example, the scope of  power restoration work Puerto Rico was requesting changed several  times\u2014such as from transmission work to distribution. These changes  necessitated adjustments in contractor workforce configurations and  contributed to idle time and equipment, according to officials.", "FEMA\u2019s mission assignment policy designates a Federal Disaster  Recovery Coordinator as the person responsible for facilitating disaster  recovery coordination and collaboration among federal, state, local, tribal,  and territorial governments; the private sector; and voluntary, faith-based,  and community organizations. However, neither FEMA\u2019s mission  assignment policy nor its guide\u2014which provides guidance on how to  open and close mission assignments\u2014provide additional details on how  that coordination is to take place. Further, FEMA\u2019s Response  Directorate\u2014the office that oversees the mission assignment process\u2014 was unable to identify at what level this coordination should occur.", "USACE and Coast Guard officials also noted that the mission assignment  process does not account for other contracting considerations, such as  demobilization, which occurs when contractor personnel leave the work  site and return to their headquarters. According to USACE and Coast  Guard officials, demobilization is required to be completed by the end of  the contract\u2019s period of performance; therefore, contracting officers need  to know when the mission will end so that they can build adequate time  for demobilization into the contract.", "Coast Guard pollution mitigation mission: Under this mission, the  Coast Guard is responsible for responding to threats to public health,  welfare, or the environment caused by actual or potential oil and  hazardous materials incidents. Coast Guard officials told us that  mission timing and the length of requirements were not communicated  by FEMA in a timely manner. They told us that they contacted FEMA  multiple times to determine if its mission assignment would be  continued, but they did not receive an answer until shortly before the  end of a contract\u2019s period of performance. As a result, officials told us  they were unsure whether they would need to demobilize contractors  before completing the work, which created uncertainty about the  availability of subcontractors. A FEMA Response Directorate official  stated that these issues are coordination and planning concerns that  should be worked out in advance between FEMA and the mission  assigned agency. Ultimately, FEMA extended the Coast Guard\u2019s  mission assignment for pollution mitigation following Hurricane Maria  four times. Figure 13 depicts the number of times Coast Guard\u2019s  mission was extended by FEMA.", "USACE power restoration mission: USACE officials cited similar  challenges during the power restoration mission in Puerto Rico  following Hurricane Maria. For example, USACE officials stated they  typically begin planning for demobilization as soon as a mission  begins. However, in this instance, officials did not know the eventual  end date in order to plan for demobilization activities. Officials added  that demobilization may take about 30 days, but USACE cannot  extend contracts or obligate funds without a FEMA mission  assignment extension. For example, if the mission assignment is  scheduled to end on June 30, contracting officials would need to  direct the contractor to begin demobilization as early as May 31.  Officials stated that a mission assignment extension or option period  of 30 days beyond the anticipated mission end date would facilitate  demobilization and reduce any undue burden or concern around  demobilization efforts.", "FEMA\u2019s mission assignment guide does not provide a process or  mechanism to follow up on the status of a mission once it is assigned. A  FEMA official stated that the Response Directorate is responsible for  informing their leadership of expiring mission assignments and contacting  the mission-assigned agency to make them aware of the impending  expiration, but that there is no standard time frame for doing so. Further,  the official stated that, in some cases, FEMA may be performing this work  a few days before a mission is set to expire. However, officials at USACE  and Coast Guard told us they are dependent upon FEMA to reissue,  clarify, or extend mission assignments. Further, the FEMA official told us  that contracting considerations\u2014such as the time needed for a contractor  to mobilize and demobilize\u2014are not necessarily built into the period of  performance of a mission assignment.", "FEMA identified issues related to the mission assignment process, both  during the 2017 disasters and following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For  example, in its 2013 Hurricane Sandy After-Action Report, FEMA found  that the mission assignment process was not optimally set up to quickly  surge resources to the field in a large-scale incident. To address these  challenges, FEMA convened an Executive Steering Committee to update  the mission assignment process, among other actions, and subsequently  updated its mission assignment policy in 2015. Following the 2017  disasters, the Emergency Support Function Leadership Group identified  challenges related to the mission assignment process and made  recommendations to:  (1) ensure response officials are properly trained on their  department or agency\u2019s statutory authorities and FEMA\u2019s mission  assignment process, and  (2) develop specific recommendations to the FEMA Response  Directorate on ways to reform mission assignment submission  documents.", "These recommendations have been assigned to working groups within  the Emergency Support Function Leadership Group, which plans to track  the status until they are implemented. While these actions may improve  the mission assignment process, they do not specifically address the  issues we identified related to coordination and contracting.", "While the emergency support functions lay out agencies\u2019 general  responsibilities, agencies are dependent upon FEMA\u2019s mission  assignment process to further define how to perform their roles. Federal  internal control standards state that management should implement  control activities through its policies. These control activities include  periodically reviewing policies, procedures, and related control activities  for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving the entity\u2019s  objectives or addressing related risks. Further, these standards also state  that communicating internally and externally are key to achieving an  entity\u2019s objectives. As part of its internal controls, entities should evaluate  the methods to communicate quality information throughout and outside  of the entity on a timely basis. While FEMA revised its mission  assignment guide in 2017, it still does not require FEMA to lay out  coordination responsibilities in detail when assigning a mission. Without a  mission assignment policy and related guidance that better incorporates  contracting considerations, such as demobilization, and requires FEMA to  clearly define coordination responsibilities with federal, state, and local  stakeholders during the mission assignment process, federal agencies  may encounter challenges fulfilling their assigned missions and may not  fulfill their disaster response and recovery missions efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Identified Contracting Workforce Shortages, but Has Not Fully Assessed Its Needs", "paragraphs": ["During the 2017 disasters, FEMA leveraged contracting staff from its  regions, headquarters, and the DART teams\u2014FEMA\u2019s deployable  contracting workforce. However, FEMA\u2019s after-action report and officials  we spoke with cited workforce shortages as a continuing challenge for  disaster response and recovery. For example, officials we spoke with in  several regional offices stated that there are only one to three contracting  officers per region. Further, information provided by FEMA OCPO shows  that eight of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices have only one permanent full- time contracting official. Some of FEMA\u2019s regional offices have additional  contracting staff through FEMA\u2019s Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery  Employees, but this varies from region to region. Regional offices are  responsible for managing post-disaster contracts, even if regional  procurement staff were not involved in the initial award of those contracts,  according to FEMA officials.", "As noted in table 4 above, FEMA\u2019s after-action report recommended  increasing contract support capacities; however, it did not provide a  specific plan to do so. According to FEMA officials, the agency\u2019s  workforce needs have not been assessed since a FEMA workforce  analysis pilot conducted in 2014. We have identified several key  principles that strategic workforce planning should address, including: determining the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve current and future programmatic results, and developing strategies that are tailored to address gaps in the number,  deployment, and alignment of human capital approaches for enabling  and sustaining the contributions of all critical skills and competencies.", "Further, in our review of FEMA\u2019s 2014 analysis, we found that FEMA  evaluated contracting workforce needs, but did not specifically consider  contracting workforce needs in the regional offices or address DART  employees. The analysis was based on 5 years of workload data and  conducted at the task or activity level, such as performing market  research prior to making a contract award. However, the analysis did not  prioritize skills or mission needs, nor did it identify critical competencies.  In September 2018, FEMA procurement officials told us that, based on  the 2014 analysis, they planned to hire 57 additional contracting staff.  Officials noted that FEMA\u2019s general operation funding does not support  these additional hires, thus the agency plans to hire these staff as  Stafford Act employees for 2-year appointments using disaster funding.  While this is an important step, it is unclear when these staff will be hired  or how they will be allocated across FEMA OCPO. For example, as of  July 2018, FEMA OCPO had 72 vacant positions, including key  leadership positions and contracting specialists. Without assessing its  current contracting workforce needs\u2014including staffing levels, mission  needs, and skill gaps\u2014and developing a plan to address these gaps that  includes time frames, FEMA will not know whether it has the appropriate  number of contracting officials with the key skills needed to meet its  mission and is not likely to be well-positioned to respond to future  disasters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Contracting during a disaster can pose a unique set of challenges as  officials face a significant amount of pressure to provide life-sustaining  goods and services to survivors as quickly as possible. Given the scale  and consecutive nature of the 2017 disasters, disaster contracts\u2014 particularly post-disaster contracts\u2014played a key role in the response  and recovery efforts. In these situations, it is important that the federal  government be accountable for the contracting decisions it makes and the  money it obligates, support the local economy and survivors as effectively  as possible, and implement lessons learned before the next disaster  strikes.", "Regarding accountability for the contracting decisions it makes and  dollars obligated following disasters, without the ability to track disaster  contracts using a NIA code in FPDS-NG, agencies, Congress, and the  public lack full insight into post-disaster contracts. Providing clear criteria  for establishing and closing the NIA code that accounts for the needs of  users and consistently implementing these criteria will help ensure insight  into high-visibility disaster events. Further, the ability to identify and track  contracting dollars for disasters through a publicly available database,  such as FPDS-NG, can reduce the burden on agencies to provide these  data for interested parties, including Congress and other users, and offer  a resource for historical data across major disasters.", "To help meet the needs of the local economy as effectively as possible,  using a contracting preference for vendors in a disaster-affected area is  an important component to early recovery efforts. Without guidance or  training to ensure contracting officers are aware of the regulatory  definition of the local area, agencies may miss opportunities to provide  financial support to local vendors. Additionally, without clarifying how  contracting officers determine whether offerors reside or primarily do  business in a disaster area for the purposes of a local area set-aside,  contract officials will remain uncertain on how to implement related FAR  criteria. Similarly, guidance and tools to help ensure contracting officials  are aware of the requirement to provide preference to the extent feasible  and practicable to local vendors, including the need for written  documentation on the use of non-local vendors for post-disaster  contracts, will help ensure agencies comply with the requirement to do so.  Taken together, these actions could enhance compliance with the  Stafford Act provisions related to the award of contracts to local  businesses in the disaster area, which could help jump-start the local  economy.", "With regards to implementing lessons learned before the next disaster  strikes, large scale disasters, like those that occurred in 2017, require  effective coordination across emergency support function agencies.  Given the Emergency Support Function Leadership Group\u2019s responsibility  to identify gaps or seams in the federal government\u2019s efforts to respond to  disasters, it is essential that the group have accurate and up-to-date  information. Formal processes for soliciting and sharing information to  communicate lessons learned to this group would help enhance agencies\u2019  abilities to identify and address weaknesses in disaster response.  Further, incorporating contracting considerations, such as demobilization,  into the mission assignment policy, could enhance federal agencies\u2019  ability to fulfill their disaster response and recovery missions efficiently.

At  a minimum, the agreement should include criteria that take into account  the roles of the federal agencies involved in response and recovery and  provide a process that ensures consistent consideration and  implementation of the criteria. (Recommendation 1)", "Until the NIA code Memorandum of Agreement between the General  Services Administration and the Departments of Defense and Homeland  Security is revised, the Secretary of Homeland Security should, in  coordination with the Department of Defense and the General Services  Administration, keep the existing NIA code for Hurricane Maria open,  reopen the other NIA codes established for 2017 and 2018 hurricanes  (Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Florence, and Michael), and request that  agencies retroactively enter NIA codes for contract actions for Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma made after June 30, 2018, for Hurricane Florence made  after March 15, 2019, and for Hurricane Michael made after April 12,  2019 into FPDS-NG to adequately capture contract obligations, to the  extent practicable.

They generally provided steps they plan to take to  address these recommendations. As discussed further below, USACE  described actions it stated were sufficient to fully address the seventh  recommendation, the steps described by FEMA would not fully meet the  intent of the tenth recommendation, and DHS did not concur with our  second recommendation.", "In response to the seventh recommendation as written in our draft  report\u2014to establish a formal process to solicit input from officials directly  involved in the agency\u2019s response and recovery following a disaster and  to share that input with the Emergency Support Function Leadership  Group\u2014in its comments, USACE concurred and stated it has a formal  process and it considered the recommendation completed. USACE noted  that its Remedial Action Program solicits input from officials involved in  response and recovery efforts and added that USACE shares findings  from this program with the Emergency Support Function Leadership  Group throughout the year and annually during the senior leaders  seminar. During the course of our review, USACE did not provide  information that indicated that they had such a formal process.

FEMA also noted that it entered into a contract for acquisition support  services and plans to hire Cadre of On-Call Response and Recovery  employees to provide dedicated support during disasters. Following  FEMA\u2019s response, we requested and received the FEMA Office of the  Chief Component Procurement Officer\u2019s 2019 workforce assessment. As  with FEMA\u2019s 2014 workforce analysis, the 2019 assessment calculated  the number of employees needed based on the estimated time to  complete a task. However, the assessment did not include an analysis of  mission needs or skill gaps, and the assessment provided does not  specify whether it includes the needs of regional offices and DART.  FEMA estimates that it will implement this recommendation in September  2019, and we will continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s planned efforts through our  recommendation follow-up process.", "DHS did not concur with the draft report\u2019s second recommendation  regarding NIA codes. In its response, with regards to extending existing  NIA codes and reinstating expired NIA codes, DHS stated that it is bound  by the memorandum of agreement with GSA and DOD, unless or until all  three signatory agencies agree to revise or suspend the agreement. We  recognize that all three agencies are bound by the agreement, and also  recommended in the first recommendation that GSA, DOD, and DHS  jointly revisit the agreement. GSA concurred with this recommendation in  its written comments reproduced in Appendix V. In an email sent from an  official within DOD\u2019s Defense Pricing and Contracting Office, DOD  concurred. DHS did not respond to our first recommendation. As such, we  have revised the second recommendation to state that DHS take action in  coordination with DOD and GSA. We also note that the memorandum of  agreement states that extending expiring or already expired NIA code end  date is appropriate, in part, when two or more agencies do not have a  reasonable alternative method of identifying and internally tracking those  emergency acquisitions. We discuss in our report how once the NIA code  is closed, there is no publicly available, government-wide system to track  contract obligations for specific events. We also discuss how, using the  description field (which does not provide a full picture) in FPDS-NG,  agencies obligated more than $250 million on contracts for Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma during the three months after the NIA codes for these  two hurricanes were closed. Given this, we continue to believe DHS  should consider reopening the codes for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, in  coordination with DOD and GSA.", "Moreover, in its response to the second recommendation DHS further  stated that FEMA\u2019s Office of the Chief Component Procurement Officer  (who is not currently a party to the memorandum of agreement), believes  the recommendation to extend the NIA codes for 2018 Hurricanes  Michael and Florence goes beyond the scope of this audit. While the  main focus of this report is the 2017 hurricanes and California wildfires,  we discuss Hurricanes Florence and Michael in this draft with respect to  the NIA codes, as the same issues and concerns we raised apply  regardless of the year of the hurricane. However, after we sent the draft  to the agencies for comment, the agencies let the codes for Hurricanes  Florence and Michael expire on March 15, 2019 and April 12, 2019,  respectively. We therefore revised the second recommendation to  recommend that the codes for Hurricanes Florence and Michael should  be reopened (rather than kept open).", "In its written comments, DHS also stated that neither DHS nor FEMA can  unilaterally direct other agencies to retroactively enter FPDS-NG data for  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We acknowledge this and have revised the  recommendation to recommend that DHS request, rather than direct,  other agencies to retroactively enter the information, to the extent  practicable. As we state in the report, the NIA codes for the 2005  hurricanes were established in October 2005, and contracting officers  retroactively entered data for contracts related to these events to enable  full insight into contracting for these disasters. DHS further stated that  retroactively entering data into FPDS-NG is not practical and places an  unreasonable burden on contracting staff, and that the draft did not  support the case that there were any benefits to be gained. We recognize  that there is some burden associated with the recommendation, thus we  recommended that DHS request agencies take action to the extent  practicable.

Therefore, our analysis only captures obligations for FEMA and  USACE reported contracts related to the 2017 California wildfires.", "To determine which obligations were made through the use of post- disaster contracts versus advance contracts, we reviewed documentation  provided by FEMA and USACE identifying the advance contracts they  have in place and that were used in support of the 2017 disasters. We  analyzed the FPDS-NG data against these contracts to identify  obligations on post-disaster contracts and compared these to obligations  on advance contracts by disaster. We analyzed competition procedures  used and the types of goods and services procured for post-disaster  contracts. In addition to advance contracts for disaster response,  agencies can leverage other existing contract vehicles. For example, to  respond to its pollution mitigation functions under emergency support  function 10, the Coast Guard awards task orders off of its portfolio of  basic ordering agreements. For the purposes of this report, post-disaster  contracts include all contract awards and orders that were not identified  by FEMA or USACE as advance contracts.", "To assess the extent to which disaster contract obligations can be tracked  through FPDS-NG using the NIA code, we identified prior hurricane  events with the highest contract obligations from 2005 through September  2018. We analyzed the data to determine when the highest level of  federal contract obligations occurs following a hurricane. We also  assessed the process for establishing and closing a NIA code.  Specifically, we reviewed the criteria in the 2012 and 2018 memorandums  of agreement between DHS, DOD, and the General Services  Administration, and interviewed officials involved in the process.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing existing  information about the FPDS-NG system and the data it collects\u2014 specifically, the data dictionary and data validation rules\u2014and performing  electronic testing.

Based on the  steps we took, we determined the FPDS-NG data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of describing agencies\u2019 post- disaster contract  obligations.", "To assess the extent to which agencies experienced challenges in the  planning of selected post-disaster contracts, we reviewed relevant laws  and regulations, including the Post-Katrina Emergency Management  Reform Act (PKEMRA), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the  Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  (Stafford Act), as well as agency policy and guidance. We identified a  non-generalizable sample of 23 post-disaster contracts from the four  agencies with the highest post-disaster obligations based on FPDS-NG  data as of March 31, 2018\u2014DHS\u2019s FEMA, DOD\u2019s USACE, DOD\u2019s DLA,  and DHS\u2019s Coast Guard. We selected contracts across the four major  2017 disasters included in our scope (Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria, as well as the California wildfires) based on four selection  criteria\u2014(1) contracts using the urgency exception to full and open  competition; (2) contracts using a local area set-aside; (3) contracts  awarded to small businesses; and (4) contracts terminated for cause or  convenience. Our goal in this selection was to ensure we selected a  range of contracts within each of these four criteria so as to assess the  extent to which these contracts implemented certain laws and regulations.  Specifically, we selected contracts based on the use of urgency and local  area set-asides in order to assess agencies\u2019 implementation of relevant  PKEMRA, Stafford Act and FAR criteria for post-disaster contracts.  Because the obligations for local area set-aside contracts was low across  all federal agencies, about 5 percent of total post-disaster obligations, we  selected contracts that were awarded to small business vendors as a  proxy to identify other awards to local vendors. Finally, we selected  terminated contracts to assess additional challenges related to post- disaster contracts, such as the availability of contracted services and  supplies and the requirement setting process. Based on these criteria, we  selected 12 FEMA, 7 USACE, 2 DLA, and 2 Coast Guard contracts.  Findings based on information collected from the 23 contracts cannot be  generalized to all post-disaster contracts. Additional details on our  selected contracts can be found in table 5.", "To assess how agencies used the urgency exception to full and open  competition, we reviewed selected contracts for the inclusion of a  justification and approval for other than full and open competition  including sole source justifications and exclusion of sources justifications.", "To assess the extent to which agencies provided preference to local  vendors for post-disaster contracts, we reviewed selected contract files  for the use of a set-aside or an evaluation preference listed in the contract  solicitation, and the inclusion of justifications for contracts not awarded to  local vendors. Additionally, we reviewed applicable agency guidance and  interviewed contracting and senior procurement officials across all four  agencies regarding their use of local area set-asides, including the means  by which they define the geographic set-aside area and determine that an  offeror primarily resides or does business in the set-aside area. We also  met with officials from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of  Federal Procurement Policy to discuss relevant FAR criteria.", "To assess how FEMA program offices develop and deliver requirements  packages for use by contracting officers and the extent to which those  packages are sufficiently specific to allow contracting officers to issue a  contract solicitation, we interviewed contracting, program, and senior  procurement officials responsible for the contracts in our selection  sample. We discussed the specificity of initial versus final requirements,  the nature of requirements changes, the process of requirements  development, and training provided to program officials regarding the  requirements development process. We also reviewed new post-disaster  awards at FEMA to determine time frames between resource request to  award on average for post-disaster contracts. We compared these  findings to relevant agency guidance on acquisition planning.", "To describe lessons learned selected agencies identified related to the  use of post-disaster contracts and assess the extent to which agencies  have taken action to address them, we reviewed available completed  after-action reports from the 2017 and prior disasters, including the  Hurricane Sandy FEMA After-Action Report, the 2017 Hurricane Season  FEMA After-Action Report, USACE\u2019s Temporary Emergency Power  Mission After Action Review for Hurricane Matthew, USACE\u2019s Puerto  Rico After Action Review, USACE\u2019s Northern California Wildfires Debris  Removal Mission After Action Review, the Coast Guard\u2019s 2017 Hurricane  Season Strategic Lessons Learned After Action Report, and the Defense  Logistics Agency\u2019s 2017 Hurricane After Action Meeting papers. We also  reviewed findings from the Emergency Support Function Leadership  Group related to interagency lessons learned. As part of our review, we  identified requirements for agencies to document or practices agencies  use to document lessons learned following a disaster, agency specific  and interagency lessons learned specific to post-disaster contracts and  mission assignments, and recommendations or actions planned by the  agencies to address them. We reviewed federal internal control standards  and the Emergency Support Function Leadership Group charter and the  standard operating procedures for its Preparedness Evaluation/Corrective  Action Working Group.", "To describe challenges related to coordination with state and local  officials on the use of post-disaster contracts, we interviewed FEMA,  USACE, DLA, and Coast Guard officials. To obtain perspectives and  examples from state and local government officials involved in disaster  response, we interviewed officials in California on the use of federal  contracts. We also met with state and local officials in Texas, Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to discuss the federal response  to the 2017 hurricanes more broadly. The information gathered from  these officials is not generalizable to all officials.", "To describe challenges related to the mission assignment process, we  interviewed FEMA, USACE, and Coast Guard officials, including officials  from FEMA\u2019s Response Directorate and the contracting officials from  USACE and the Coast Guard that awarded the contracts these agencies  used to fulfill their missions. We also reviewed the mission assignment  documents, where FEMA assigned USACE and Coast Guard missions  and laid out their responsibilities.", "To assess workforce challenges, we reviewed DHS\u2019s 2014 workforce  assessment, which identified gaps in FEMA\u2019s contracting workforce. We  also obtained information from FEMA on its current contracting workforce  in headquarters, regional offices, Disaster Assistance Response Team,  and joint field offices. We also interviewed FEMA contracting officials to  obtain their perspectives and experiences during the 2017 disaster  season.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to April 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
