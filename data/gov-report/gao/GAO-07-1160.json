If IRS developed this type of data, officials could use this data to identify problems in existing programs, to try to identify the causes of problems, and/or to develop corrective actions. Records management officials have recently instituted some performance measures, but these measures do not specifically address paper case files. IRS program managers also have not developed performance measures or data to determine how well paper case files are managed to achieve performance targets. Program managers do not know who has overall responsibility for case file management so performance information cannot be developed across IRS's compliance programs.

In addition, in accordance with internal control  standards, IRS case files should be readily available for examination and  properly managed and maintained to ensure that management\u2019s directives  are carried out. Proper case file management is a particularly significant  issue for IRS because its staff investigate and close millions of case files  every year. In addition, IRS case files contain sensitive taxpayer  information that, by law, must be properly protected from inadvertent  disclosure.

Paper case files are also important for internal IRS  reviews, such as those performed by its research and quality review  groups.", "Based on your request, we reviewed IRS\u2019s case file storage, tracking, and  documentation processes to determine whether (1) IRS has an effective  process to ensure that paper case files can be located timely and (2) IRS  has sufficient data to assess the performance of its paper case file  processes. To make determinations in both areas, we interviewed officials  from the following IRS entities or programs: the Office of Agency-Wide  Shared Services (AWSS), the Small Business/Self-Employed Division  (SB/SE), the Wage and Investment Division (W&I), the Office of Appeals,  the Automated Collection System (ACS), and the National Research  Program (NRP). We did not interview officials from the Large and Mid-Size  Business Division (LMSB) or the Tax-Exempt and Government Entities  Division (TE/GE) since only a very small percentage of Appeals\u2019 cases that  are docketed for Tax Court where paper case files are very important  originate from these divisions according to Appeals officials. We also  reviewed IRS\u2019s policies and procedures. To determine whether IRS has an  effective process to ensure that paper case files can be located timely, we  compared IRS\u2019s process to the requirements of the FRA and our standards  for internal control in the federal government. Further, we interviewed  officials from other organizations to identify key practices in managing  case files. These organizations included the Department of Education, the  Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, and  the California Franchise Tax Board.

The program provides for the application of management practices in the  creation, maintenance, retrieval, preservation, and disposition of records.  Although the mission of the Records Management Program is to  document, protect, and efficiently manage all IRS records until final  disposition, actual day-to-day management of case files is left to each IRS  program. According to an IRS official, program managers establish  policies and procedures for the management of paper and electronic case  files and have overall responsibility for case file management in their  program. In addition, each program develops its own policies and  procedures, which are documented in IRS\u2019s Internal Revenue Manual  (IRM).", "Case files can be paper, automated, or a combination of both. For  example, when IRS examines a tax return, the documents completed by  the examiner can be automated (electronically maintained within their  system) or paper (placed in physical case files). Case files may include  income tax returns, audits, investigations, or claims. According to W&I and  SB/SE officials, in fiscal year 2006 they closed over 13 million and 9 million  cases, respectively. When cases are closed, IRS units perform managerial  and quality reviews to ensure cases were handled correctly and the case  files are complete and meet their quality standards. For example, in fiscal  year 2006, the SB/SE field collection quality review group found that over  96 percent of the case files they reviewed were complete.", "Paper case files can be stored in the files area of Submission Processing  Center (SPC) campuses or field offices which are spread throughout the  country. These case files are then transferred to Federal Records Centers  (FRC) by filing coordinators located at the SPC or by information  resource coordinators in the field. Once the specified retention period has  expired at the FRC, the case files are destroyed. The locations of  Submission Processing Centers, Area Records Managers, and Federal  Records Centers are illustrated in figure 1.", "According to an IRS official, the agency is in the process of automating  some of its paper case files. IRS is developing scanning capability to  convert documents from paper to electronic. However, this official stated  that IRS is initially developing this scanning capability for its campuses  and not its field offices. Furthermore, the agency does not have a plan or  time frame for when all of its case files will be automated.

In one case,  IRS obtained approval to file a nominee lien against a taxpayer because  the taxpayer had transferred an asset to another person. IRS pursued  collection action, but the taxpayer challenged IRS in District Court  asserting that IRS needed to prove that the taxpayer had use and control  of the asset that was transferred. IRS was unable to locate the case file for  the trial. As a result, IRS lost about $45,000. In another case, a taxpayer  commingled individual assets with corporate assets. IRS levied the funds  in the bank account of an individual who controlled the corporation to pay  the tax debt owed by the corporation. IRS collected the money owed, but  the taxpayer filed a claim that IRS needed to prove the money in the  individual account belonged to the corporation.

Therefore, IRS had to return the  levied money, which amounted to about $40,000.", "IRS has acknowledged its historic difficulties in locating and retrieving  case files. In September 2006, the Tax Court proposed a requirement that  IRS file answers in all small tax cases ($50,000 or less). An answer  includes admissions, qualifications, and denials by IRS of each material  fact alleged in the Tax Court petition filed by the taxpayer. In preparation  of the answer, IRS generally examines and relies on the information in the  case file.

For example, W&I recently made a  commitment to send docketed case files to Appeals within 25 days. To  assess W&I\u2019s performance, W&I requested Appeals to provide them with a  report so they could track their progress. Appeals developed a report  which showed that out of about 900 docketed cases from W&I campuses,  Appeals had been waiting over 25 days for 420, or 46 percent, of the case  files.

For example, for  Revenue Officers, sending a case file to CCP is not a top priority,  especially when their other priorities include active aged cases. Aged  cases take priority because the older the case is, the less likely IRS is to  recover the amounts owed. In addition, some Revenue Officers are  reluctant to let their cases leave their office.

According to TIGTA, these records included the following types of  case files: individual and business examination cases, Earned Income Tax  Credit adjustments, and Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP) cases. IRS  was unable to provide about 19 percent of the case files requested by  TIGTA. In the review, TIGTA recommended that IRS:    Ensure the quality and timeliness of the IRS Records Management  Program by developing a method to track specific requests for tax  records that will assign accountability, respond to customer problems,  and provide management information for the program.

This generates a form which the files  area receives and uses to locate the case file. The coordinator also said  that when the files area receives the form, files staff will either search for  the case file in the files area or request it from the FRC if it has been sent  for long-term storage.", "In contrast, we were told by an Area Records Manager (ARM), when a  paper case file such as a collection case file that does not contain a DLN  has been closed and sent directly to the FRC is later requested, a form is  sent to the ARM which includes the FRC accession number, box number,  and location of the case file which is needed by the FRC to locate the  record.

IRS has hired contractors to take over the responsibility of the  files areas. Contractors are performing files activities at two campuses and  will take over responsibility for the remaining five campuses between  August and October 2007. The contractors are required to adhere to a  Performance Work Statement (PWS) which lists the contractor\u2019s duties, as  well as IRM policies and procedures that are specified in the PWS.

IRS staff  said they requested the case files from many campuses. However, there  was no one in charge of the requests to track the progress of our file  requests and provide specific reasons why the case files could not be  located. For example, the ARMs act as liaisons with the FRCs and IRS  Business Units and can assist staff in tracking and locating case files from  the FRC. However, some staff who requested our case files did not request  assistance from their ARM either because the ARM did not handle the case  files sent to the FRC and left that up to the campus coordinators, or the  staff who requested the case files said they were not aware they had  ARMs. In addition, campus coordinators can assist in tracking and locating  case files.

This lack of clear responsibility differs from the way  IRS manages document requests during our annual audit of IRS\u2019s financial  statements. According to an IRS official, IRS uses many designated  coordinators and holds meetings to ensure that documents requested for  the financial statement audit are received. If IRS had established clearer  responsibility for coordinating and tracking our case file requests, such as  it did to manage document requests during our financial statement audit, it  might have located more of the case files we requested.", "IRS staff told us that when case files cannot be located, either the files  area or FRC should annotate the request form to show the reason the case  could not be located. In our Appeals audit, an Appeals official said the  person who had requested the case files had retired so they could not  provide a reason why the case files could not be located.

Therefore,  when the files area later tries to fill a request for that case file, the files  area does not know why the case file is not there. The case file may not be  there because it was not received or was misfiled.

IRS managers have said that the agency does not have  one centralized system to track paper case files. Instead, IRS uses many  systems in its enforcement process to track open case files. However,  these systems generally do not contain information on the location of case  files at the FRC once they are sent there. Instead, this information is  maintained manually throughout IRS. This can make it difficult to quickly  locate files. For example, according to an IRS official, when Revenue  Agents need a case file from outside their office, they have to determine  the state and office the case was worked in and the year it was closed.  Once they have identified this information, they have to go through that  office to locate the FRC paperwork including the accession number, box  number, and location. This information is needed to request the case file  from the FRC. IRS does not know whether staff, such as Revenue Agents,  are having difficulty obtaining paper case files when they use this process  to locate them.", "To automate the location of paper case files sent to the FRC, SB/SE  Collection officials said they enter FRC information along with other case  information into its Junior system. Junior has been designed as a case  processing, closed files inventory tracking system for cases that are being  sent to the FRC. While IRS officials told us this system has improved IRS\u2019s  ability to locate paper case files, they provided no data to support this  conclusion. In addition, the Junior system is only used by SB/SE Collection  for specific types of cases (taxpayer delinquency investigations, taxpayer  delinquency accounts, and installment agreements). However, an AWSS  official suggested that use of Junior by other programs and operating  divisions could improve locating closed paper case files.", "Using other technologies is another option IRS could consider to assist it  in capturing real-time information on the location of paper case files. For  example, field and headquarters officials from the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) provided the following description of how it uses barcoding to  track its benefit folders through its Control of Veterans Records System  (COVERS). The Veterans Benefits Administration tracks its benefit folders  by placing a barcode on each folder. Employees in the benefit office use a  barcode scanner and printer. As the folders are moved, they are scanned  and the location is automatically changed in VA\u2019s record tracking system.  VA\u2019s tracking system includes information on the claim number, veteran\u2019s  name, and the current and previous locations of the case. The system not  only tracks the location of benefit folders; it also assists in the  management of these folders throughout the claims processing cycle. For  example, reports can be run, such as aging reports which show how long a  VA staff member has had a case. The VA officials also described the  following benefits realized in barcoding benefit folders although they have  no data to support this conclusion. Benefits of barcoding include the  ability to scan the location of a benefit folder into their tracking system  instead of entering it manually, which saves time and provides improved  folder tracking accuracy. COVERS has also improved the files  management activity in two additional ways: first, folder retirement was  transformed from the previous manual IBM card-based process to the  current automated process; second, the sequence checking of files in  cabinets has been expedited while improving accuracy.", "An IRS Appeals official told us that Business Units receive listings of cases  docketed for Tax Court and it is their responsibility to review the listings  and send any docketed cases directly to Appeals. If the Business Units do  not send the case files to Appeals and send them to storage areas instead  (e.g., Files Area), this can result in long delays in receiving case files and  potential Tax Court losses. According to Appeals officials, Appeals and  W&I are tracking the number of days Appeals is waiting for docketed  cases. This is a good first step in tracking whether case files are received  timely.

The Acting Commissioner also described some  systemic enhancements undertaken by W&I to facilitate requests for tax  returns and associated records.", "IRS\u2019s planned review and development of corrective actions is responsive  to our recommendations, and we look forward to its consideration of our  recommendations in this review as well as to the benefits to taxpayers and  IRS of a more effective program.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate  congressional committees and the Acting Commissioner of Internal  Revenue. We also will make copies available to others upon request. In  addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions concerning this report, please  contact me at (202) 512-9110 or at brostekm@gao.gov.

We also visited one campus and one field office to gain an  understanding of the processes they use to store, track, and document  case files. We observed and inquired into the internal controls used by IRS  in these processes. We did not interview officials from the Large and Mid- Size Business Division or the Tax-Exempt and Government Entities  Division since only a very small percentage of Appeals\u2019 cases that are  docketed for Tax Court where paper case files are very important  originate from these divisions. We also reviewed IRS\u2019s policies and  procedures.", "To determine whether IRS has an effective process to ensure that paper  case files can be located timely, we compared IRS\u2019s process to the  requirements of the Federal Records Act and our standards for internal  control in the federal government. We interviewed officials from Appeals,  ACS, and NRP to identify the reasons IRS was unable to locate all of the  case files we requested. We also spoke to Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration (TIGTA) officials and reviewed prior TIGTA reports to  determine whether IRS was able to provide all case files requested by  TIGTA. Further, we interviewed officials from other organizations to  identify key practices in managing case files. These organizations included  the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the  Social Security Administration, and the California Franchise Tax Board.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and one campus and field  office from August 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact person named above, Jonda Van Pelt, Assistant  Director; Carl Barden; Wilfred Holloway; Laurie King; Donna Miller; Cheryl  Peterson; and Sam Scrutchins made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
