Since its inception in 2000, the agency has faced challenges in its ability to accurately identify the costs of major projects. In addition, both the DOE Inspector General, in 2003, and GAO, in 2007, reported concerns with NNSA\u0092s PPBE process, specifically in how NNSA validates budget estimates and decides on resource allocations or trade-offs.", "GAO was asked to review how NNSA manages programming and budgeting through its PPBE process. GAO examined (1) the current structure of NNSA\u0092s PPBE process, (2) the extent to which NNSA reviews its budget estimates, and (3) how NNSA decides on resource trade-offs in its PPBE process. To carry out its work, GAO reviewed NNSA policies, instructions, guidance, and internal reports documenting the agency\u0092s PPBE process and interviewed NNSA, DOE, and M&O contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Nuclear Security Administration\u0092s (NNSA) planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation (PPBE) process provides a framework for the agency to plan, prioritize, fund, and evaluate its program activities. Formal policies guide NNSA and management and operating (M&O) contractors through each of four phases of the agency\u0092s PPBE cycle\u0097planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation. These phases appear to be sequential, but the process is continuous and concurrent because of the amount of time required to develop priorities and review resource requirements, with at least two phases ongoing at any time.", "NNSA does not thoroughly review budget estimates before it incorporates them into its proposed annual budget. Instead, NNSA relies on informal, undocumented reviews of such estimates and its own budget validation review process\u0097the formal process for assessing budget estimates. Neither of these processes adheres to Department of Energy (DOE) Order 130.1, which defines departmental provisions for the thoroughness, timing, and documentation of budget reviews. NNSA officials said the agency does not follow the order because it expired in 2003. Nevertheless, the order is listed as current on DOE\u0092s website, and a senior DOE budget official confirmed that it remains in effect, although it is outdated in terminology and organizational structure. Additionally, according to NNSA officials, the agency\u0092s trust in its contractors minimizes the need for formal review of its budget estimates. GAO identified three key problems in NNSA\u0092s budget validation review process. First, this process does not inform NNSA, DOE, Office of Management and Budget, or congressional budget development decisions because it occurs too late in the budget cycle\u0097after the submission of the President\u0092s budget to Congress. Second, this process is not sufficiently thorough to ensure the credibility and reliability of NNSA\u0092s budget because it is limited to assessing the processes used to develop budget estimates rather than the accuracy of the resulting estimates and is conducted for a small portion of NNSA\u0092s budget\u0097approximately 1.5 percent of which received such review in 2011. Third, other weaknesses in this process, such as no formal evaluative mechanism to determine if corrective actions were taken in response to previous findings, limit the process\u0092s effectiveness in assessing NNSA\u0092s budget estimates.", "NNSA uses a variety of management tools to decide on resource trade-offs during the programming phase of the PPBE process. One of these tools, integrated priority lists\u0097which rank program activities according to their importance for meeting mission requirements\u0097is to provide senior managers with an understanding of how various funding scenarios would affect program activities. However, NNSA has weakened its ability to gauge the effects of resource trade-offs. For example, in 2010, NNSA disbanded its Office of Integration and Assessments, created in response to DOE Inspector General and GAO recommendations that NNSA establish an independent analysis unit to perform such functions as reviewing proposals for program activities and verifying cost estimates. NNSA agreed with these recommendations and, in 2009, instituted the office to identify, analyze, and assess options for deciding on resource trade-offs. Without an independent analytical capability, NNSA may have difficulty making the best decisions about what activities to fund and whether they are affordable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, DOE update the departmental order for budget reviews, improve the formal process for reviewing budget estimates, and reinstitute an independent analytical capability. The agency agreed in principle with six recommendations but not with one to consolidate various integrated priority lists. GAO continues to believe this recommendation has merit as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014a  semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014 manages the nation\u2019s nuclear security programs, the primary goals of  which are to maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of the U.S.  nuclear weapons stockpile; reduce the global threat posed by nuclear  proliferation and terrorism; and provide nuclear propulsion systems for the  U.S. Navy. To manage these programs, NNSA oversees eight separate  sites\u2014collectively known as the nuclear security enterprise\u2014that are  managed and operated by private contractors, known as management  and operating (M&O) contractors. Among other things, these contractors  operate and maintain the government-owned facilities and infrastructure  deemed necessary to support the nuclear security enterprise and to  support the capabilities to conduct scientific, technical, engineering, and  production activities. To fund these activities, the President requested  more than $11.5 billion for NNSA in his fiscal year 2013 budget  submission to Congress. Sound management practices, such as linking  program activities to defined objectives and ensuring the reliability of  budget estimates, can help NNSA use agency resources wisely. It is  particularly important for NNSA to embrace this approach because, as  our past work has shown, it has faced numerous challenges in accurately  estimating the costs of major projects since its inception in 2000. For  example, we reported in March of this year that the estimated cost to  construct the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear  Facility at NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory rose from between  $745 million and $975 million in 2005 to between $3.7 billion and $5.8  billion in 2010\u2014a near sixfold increase. In addition, in February of this  year we testified that the estimated cost to construct the modern Uranium  Processing Facility at NNSA\u2019s Y-12 National Security Complex jumped  from between $600 million and $1.1 billion in 2004 to between $4.2 billion  and $6.5 billion in 2011\u2014a near sevenfold increase. Furthermore, in  2000 and 2009, respectively, we reported that NNSA\u2019s efforts to extend  the operational lives of nuclear weapons experienced a $300 million cost  increase for the refurbishment of one warhead and a $70 million increase  for another.projects, we believe improved federal oversight of NNSA\u2019s modernization  of the nuclear security enterprise is critical to ensuring that resources are  spent in as an effective and efficient manner as possible.", "NNSA was created by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Pub.  L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 3201 et seq. ). have reported, DOD\u2019s PPBE process logically attempts to plan programs  and develop budgets based on high-level strategic goals, but at times it  has been poorly implemented. For example, DOD decision makers often  commit to more programs than the department can reasonably support.  Nonetheless, DOD\u2019s process has the potential to provide comparisons of  the cost-effectiveness of program activities and to help managers develop  the kinds of detailed program and budget plans called for in the NNSA  Act. However, both the DOE Inspector General and GAO have reported  on concerns with the development and implementation of NNSA\u2019s PPBE  process. Specifically, these reports identified deficiencies in how NNSA  ensures the validity of its budget estimates and how it decides to allocate  its resources (resource trade-offs). In our January 2007 report, we  recommended, among other things, that NNSA complete all of its PPBE  policy guidance. In response, NNSA issued PPBE policy in the form of  policy letters that identify the responsibilities of NNSA management,  program and site offices, and contractors throughout the agency\u2019s PPBE  cycle.", "In this context, you asked us to determine how NNSA manages its  programming and budgeting activities through its PPBE process. For this  report, our objectives were to examine (1) the current structure of NNSA\u2019s  PPBE process, (2) the extent to which NNSA reviews its budget  estimates, and (3) how NNSA decides on resource trade-offs in its PPBE  process.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed NNSA documentation\u2014 including policies, instructions, guidance, and internal reports\u2014related to  the implementation of NNSA\u2019s PPBE policy across NNSA, as well as  program-specific documentation from the Offices of Defense Programs,  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors; these three  offices correspond to NNSA\u2019s primary missions and collectively account  for approximately 85 percent of the President\u2019s fiscal year 2013 NNSA  budget submission to Congress. To examine the current structure of  NNSA\u2019s PPBE process, we reviewed NNSA policy documents, guidance,  and instructions. To determine the extent to which NNSA reviews its  budget estimates, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s formal budget validation review  process and associated internal NNSA reports and met with officials  involved in the development, oversight, or execution of NNSA budget  estimate reviews. To identify the tools NNSA uses to decide on resource  trade-offs, we analyzed how NNSA determines which program activities it  considers necessary to achieve NNSA goals. Additionally, to address all  these objectives, we met with officials from the NNSA Offices of the  Administrator, Management and Budget, Defense Programs, Defense  Nuclear Nonproliferation, Naval Reactors, and Acquisition and Project  Management; the site offices for Los Alamos, Sandia, and the Y-12  National Security Complex; and the Naval Reactors Laboratory Field  Office; DOE officials from the Office of Budget; and M&O contractor  officials from Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, the Y-12  National Security Complex, and Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory.Because NNSA\u2019s Office of Naval Reactors is organized as a separate  entity within NNSA reporting both to NNSA and the U.S. Navy, we also  met with Navy officials from its offices of Financial Management and  Budgeting, and Cost Engineering and Industrial Analysis.

NNSA has  primary mission responsibilities in three areas. First, it is responsible for  providing the United States with safe, secure, and reliable nuclear  weapons in the absence of underground nuclear testing and maintains  core competencies in nuclear weapons science, technology, and  engineering. Second, NNSA implements key U.S. government nuclear  security, nonproliferation, and arms control activities, including securing  vulnerable nuclear and radiological material at facilities throughout the  world; removing plutonium and highly enriched uranium from partner  countries; eliminating U.S. nuclear material declared surplus to defense  needs; negotiating and providing the technical capability to verify arms  control treaties and agreements; strengthening other countries\u2019 capacities  to implement nonproliferation obligations; and enhancing other nations\u2019  capabilities to deter and detect illicit movement of nuclear and radiological  materials. Third, NNSA provides the research, development, design, and  operational support for militarily effective naval nuclear propulsion plants,  as well as enriched uranium for fabrication into fuel for the Navy\u2019s  propulsion reactors.

NNSA conducts its activities at research and development laboratories,  production plants, and other facilities (collectively referred to as the  nuclear security enterprise). Specifically, NNSA operates three national  laboratories that design and ensure the reliability of nuclear weapons\u2014 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California; Los Alamos National  Laboratory, New Mexico; and the Sandia National Laboratories, New  Mexico and California; and four nuclear weapons production sites\u2014the  Pantex Plant, Texas; the Y-12 National Security Complex, Tennessee;  the Kansas City Plant, Missouri; and the Savannah River Site, South  Carolina; as well as the Nevada National Security Site.", "NNSA\u2019s relationship with its contractors has been formally established  over the years through its M&O contracts\u2014contracting strategies that  give these contractors responsibility to carry out major portions of NNSA\u2019s  missions and apply their scientific, technical, and management  expertise. M&O contractors at NNSA sites operate under NNSA\u2019s  direction and oversight but largely independently of one another. Various  headquarters organizations within NNSA develop policies and NNSA site  offices, colocated with NNSA\u2019s sites, conduct day-to-day oversight of the  M&O contractors, and evaluate the M&O contractors\u2019 performance in  carrying out the sites\u2019 missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Established a Formal PPBE Process That Includes Four Defined Phases", "paragraphs": ["According to NNSA\u2019s policy, the NNSA PPBE process is composed of  four phases\u2014planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation\u2014and  their associated activities. The different phases of PPBE appear  sequential, but because of the amount of time required to develop and  review resource requirements, the process is continuous and concurrent  with at least two phases ongoing at any given time, including phases for  different fiscal years. Figure 1 shows the four phases and the months  during which each phase is scheduled to occur, according to NNSA  policies and guidance.", "Planning. According to NNSA policy, in this phase, scheduled to begin  annually in November, NNSA is to identify the goals it needs to achieve  over the next 5 years and the program activities needed to meet these  goals. According to NNSA officials, these goals are defined in a variety of  documents, including presidential directives, policy statements, and DOE  and NNSA strategic plans. This phase begins with the issuance of  NNSA\u2019s annual Strategic Planning Guidance, which provides any updates  to the strategic plans and identifies any emerging issues. The NNSA  program offices use this guidance to conduct their own internal planning  processes, update their multiyear plans, including revising or adding  program activities needed to meet the agency\u2019s goals.", "Programming. According to NNSA policy, in this phase, scheduled to  begin annually in February, NNSA is to determine which program  activities and funding levels it will include in its budget proposal to DOE  for the fiscal year beginning in October of the following calendar year.  This determination is based on analysis of the activities\u2019 estimated costs,  as well as the need to meet the NNSA goals defined in the planning  process. To determine these activities, NNSA program offices are to work  with their contractors to obtain estimates for the cost of the program  activities identified in the planning phase and determine how to  accomplish these activities within anticipated funding levels, which are  defined in annual NNSA Program and Fiscal Guidance. NNSA program  offices are to then rank these activities in order of priority for meeting  program goals and document these decisions in integrated priority lists.  These lists can include proposed program activities above the anticipated  funding levels specified in NNSA guidance\u2014these proposed activities are  known as unfunded requirements. Using these lists, as well as other  briefing materials, a group of senior NNSA officials including the heads of  all program offices\u2014the Program Review Council\u2014then is to meet with  the Principal Deputy Administrator to discuss and defend each program\u2019s  proposed program activities. After reviewing the deliberations of the  Program Review Council and the associated documents provided by the  program offices, the NNSA Administrator is to decide on resources trade- offs that result in the combination of program activities that best meet  NNSA\u2019s goals over the 5-year period covered by the Future Years  Nuclear Security Program plan. The Administrator is responsible for  issuing the Administrator\u2019s Final Recommendations (AFR), scheduled to  be completed in May at the conclusion of the programming phase, to  document NNSA\u2019s justification for its priorities and to serve as the basis  for the agency\u2019s participation in DOE\u2019s program review process, the  Strategic Resources Review.", "Budgeting. According to NNSA policy, this phase is to integrate NNSA  planning and programming priorities and budget estimates into DOE\u2019s  departmental budget process and consists of the following three parts:", "Budget formulation. During formulation, which is scheduled to begin  annually in July for the fiscal year beginning in October of the  following calendar year, NNSA submits its proposed budget to DOE  and participates in the Strategic Resources Review. If DOE\u2019s budget  deliberations result in changes to NNSA\u2019s proposed budget, NNSA  may have to rebalance its work activities. In September each year,  DOE submits its proposed budget to the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) for review. Depending on OMB revisions, NNSA may  need to again revise its work activities. These revisions are  incorporated into the President\u2019s final budget request for DOE, which  is submitted to Congress in February.", "Budget validation. According to NNSA guidance, the agency uses its  budget validation review process to ensure its budget request is  consistent with NNSA priorities and its budget estimating processes  are reasonable. NNSA policy calls for NNSA\u2019s Office of PPBE to  manage a three-phase process of validating approximately 20 percent  of NNSA\u2019s programs each year, so that 100 percent of its budget is  validated every 5 years. Programs to undergo validations are to be  determined by a combination of factors, including Program Managers\u2019  request, Administrator direction, and/or significant external  interest/high program visibility. During Phase I of the process,  scheduled for completion in June, before the beginning of the fiscal  year in October, program officials determine if their activities conform  with strategic guidance and program plans and review their methods  for formulating budgets. In Phase II, scheduled annually for July to  September, NNSA contractors or program offices, whichever  developed the budget estimates, conduct a self-assessment of their  budget planning, formulation, and cost-estimating processes. Phase II  self-assessments are to be reviewed by a team\u2014known as a  validation review team\u2014that comprises NNSA headquarters and site  office staff. During Phase III, scheduled to occur from July through  August, these validation review teams also review the cost-estimating  practices used by the NNSA contractors and program offices.  Importantly, NNSA\u2019s validation guidance emphasizes that reviews  should focus on the processes used to formulate budget plans and  derive budget estimates rather than on the accuracy of the resulting  estimates. According to this guidance, validation review teams are to  issue a report on their findings on Phases II and III in September to  inform NNSA, DOE, and OMB decisions for the following year\u2019s  budget cycle.", "Budget execution. According to NNSA policy, during this process,  DOE and NNSA are to allocate, distribute, and control funds to  achieve the priorities established in the programming phase, and to  maintain the fiscal limits set up in the budgeting phase, which are  subject to appropriation of funds by Congress. The execution  coincides with the fiscal year and commences once appropriated  funds become available\u2014whether by appropriation or Continuing  Resolution\u2014at the beginning of the fiscal year every October.", "Evaluation. According to NNSA policy, NNSA is to employ an ongoing  cycle of evaluations to review program performance.

Neither of  these processes meets DOE provisions for ensuring the credibility and  reliability of agency budgets, as defined in DOE Order 130.1. According  to senior NNSA officials, NNSA does not comply with DOE Order 130.1  because it believes the order expired in 2003 and therefore no longer  applies to NNSA budget activities. Furthermore, they stated that the need  for a formal review of budget estimates is minimized, in part, because of  the inherent trust between NNSA and its M&O contractors. Additionally,  we identified three key problems in NNSA\u2019s formal budget validation  review process: it occurs too late to affect budget decisions, is not  sufficiently thorough, and includes other weaknesses that limit its  effectiveness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Process for Reviewing Budget Estimates Is Not Thorough or Documented", "paragraphs": ["NNSA does not have a thorough, documented process for assessing the  validity of its budget estimates prior to their inclusion in the President\u2019s  budget submission to Congress, thereby limiting the reliability and  credibility of the budget submission. Specifically, according to NNSA  officials from NNSA\u2019s Offices of Management and Budget, Defense  Programs; Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation; and the site offices for Los  Alamos, Sandia, and Y-12, during the programming phase of PPBE, site  and headquarters program office officials conduct informal,  undocumented reviews of the budget estimates that M&O contractors  submitted to determine their reasonableness, though some officials noted  that the level of review may vary across site and headquarters program  offices. According to these officials, this informal review is often  conducted by comparing current budget estimates with those from  previous years because the work is largely the same from year to year. If  the estimates are similar, and no major programmatic change has taken  place, site office and headquarters program office officials said that they  generally view these budget estimates as reasonable for inclusion in  NNSA\u2019s budget estimate. However, site office officials told us that their  ability to thoroughly review budget estimates is limited. For example,  according to NNSA officials at the Los Alamos Site Office, they do not  have the personnel needed or the time, because of other laboratory  management responsibilities, to oversee the laboratory\u2019s budget  estimation practices. They told us that only one dedicated budget analyst  is employed at the site office and, because of insufficient personnel  resources in the office, a majority of this analyst\u2019s time is spent  conducting work that is not directly related to budget oversight. NNSA  officials from the Y-12 Site Office also told us that they informally review  budget estimates when they initially submit them to headquarters  program offices. However, they also stated that they become more  involved in reviewing budget estimates when the agency is formulating its  final budget submission, and the M&O contractors are asked to develop  multiple iterations of budget estimates based on various hypothetical  funding scenarios. However, these officials also stated that their reviews  are not documented. NNSA officials from Defense Programs\u2019 Office of  Analysis and Evaluation told us that the presence of certified cost  engineers\u2014individuals with professional certification in the field of cost  assessment and program management\u2014at the NNSA site offices could  enhance NNSA\u2019s ability to understand how M&O contractors and  programs develop budget estimates and assess those estimates.", "The practices the site and headquarters program offices follow do not  align with the criteria for thoroughness or documentation established in  DOE Order 130.1. Specifically, DOE Order 130.1 states that contractor- developed budget estimates should be thoroughly reviewed and deemed  reasonable prior to their inclusion in agency budgets and that these  reviews should be documented. Senior officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of  Management and Budget told us that the agency does not strictly adhere  to DOE Order 130.1 because it believes that the order has expired and no  longer applies to NNSA budget activities. According to these officials, this  order expired in 2003, and they are unaware of any other DOE or federal  government requirement to conduct budget validation reviews. They  further stated that NNSA is conducting budget validation reviews only  because it considers them to be a good business practice and that NNSA  will work with DOE on updating the order if DOE initiates that process.  NNSA officials stated that, if DOE updated and reissued DOE Order  130.1, it would comply to the extent that it had the resources to do so.  However, DOE Order 130.1 remains listed on DOE\u2019s \u201cAll Current  Directives\u201d website, and a senior DOE budget official told us that DOE  Order 130.1 remains an active order. Additionally, this official stated that  a key principle of DOE Order 130.1\u2014federal oversight of contractors\u2019  practices for budget formulation\u2014is appropriate and valid. This official  noted, however, that the order is outdated in terms of the terminology it  uses to describe DOE\u2014it was issued in 1995, predating the 2000  establishment of NNSA\u2014and should be updated to reflect the  department\u2019s current organizational structure. Furthermore, in March  2009, we issued a cost-estimating guide\u2014a compilation of cost- estimating best practices drawn from across industry and government\u2014in  which we reported that validation is considered a best practice to ensure  that cost data are credible and reliable for use in justifying estimates to  agency management. As a result, NNSA\u2019s site and headquarters  program office reviews of budget estimates are neither thorough nor  documented. According to the Principal Deputy Administrator, NNSA  continues to face challenges in moving away from its historical process  for developing budgets based solely on the unreviewed estimates  produced by NNSA M&O contractors and that NNSA\u2019s practices for  understanding its program activity costs are not as sufficient as they need  to be.", "In contrast, NNSA\u2019s Office of Naval Reactors\u2019 is jointly staffed and funded  by both NNSA and the Navy and is therefore subject to naval and DOD,  as well as NNSA, standards for reviewing contractor-developed budget  estimates. The Office of Naval Reactors conducts a semiannual  process\u2014known as budget confirmation\u2014to review all contractor- developed budget estimates. This review is conducted and documented  by NNSA technical experts and approved by the Director of the Office of  Naval Reactors; this director manages both NNSA and the Navy\u2019s  activities within the office and has final budgetary decision authority.  Officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Budget told us that the  Office of Naval Reactors\u2019 process is much more rigorous than that used  by other NNSA program offices we reviewed. Furthermore, NNSA has  exempted the Office of Naval Reactors from NNSA\u2019s formal budget  validation review process because of management\u2019s confidence in the  quality of the office\u2019s budget confirmation process.", "Senior officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Budget told us that  NNSA does not have the financial and personnel resources needed to  conduct budget estimate reviews with the same rigor as the Navy and  DOD. Furthermore, these officials said, the need for a formal review of  M&O contractor-developed budget estimates is minimized within NNSA  because site office officials have historical knowledge of work with  NNSA\u2019s M&O contractors that allows them to assess the reasonableness  of M&O contractor-developed budget estimates without conducting a  formal review and because of the \u201cinherent trust\u201d between NNSA and its  M&O contractors that results from its contracting strategy with them.  Specifically, one of these officials stated that, to a large extent, only the  M&O contractors are in a position to know the scientific and engineering  details of nuclear weapons and the associated work scope and funding  necessary to ensure their safety and reliability. However, for the last 10  years, we have reported that NNSA has significant weaknesses in its  ability to control costs and effectively manage its M&O contractors. We  are therefore concerned that NNSA management continues to deny the  need for NNSA to improve its processes for developing credible and  reliable budget estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Formal Budget Validation Review Process Occurs Too Late to Affect Budget Decisions and Is Not Sufficiently Thorough", "paragraphs": ["We identified three key problems in NNSA\u2019s annual budget validation  review process\u2014its formal process for assessing M&O contractor- and  program-developed budget estimates. First, NNSA\u2019s annual budget  validation review process occurs too late in the budget cycle to inform  NNSA, DOE, OMB, and congressional budget development or  appropriations decisions. DOE Order 130.1, which is referenced in  NNSA\u2019s policy for its budget validation review process, states that  agencies should thoroughly review budget estimates before using these  estimates to develop budgets. However, NNSA\u2019s Phase II and Phase III  budget validation reviews are scheduled to begin 5 months after the  President submits his budget to Congress. Additionally, during each of  the past four budget validation cycles, NNSA did not complete its budget  validation reports for at least 12 months following the President\u2019s budget  submission to Congress and at least 4 months after the beginning of the  fiscal year for which NNSA reviewed the budget estimates. Therefore,  Congress considered the budget request for NNSA and appropriated  funds to it, and NNSA executed these funds to M&O contractors, before  NNSA had published the results of the budget validation reviews.  Because of their timing, NNSA\u2019s budget validation reviews cannot inform  NNSA\u2019s budget development, DOE or OMB reviews, or Congress\u2019  appropriation processes. According to NNSA policy, the timing of NNSA\u2019s  budget validation review process is designed to inform the NNSA, DOE,  and OMB budgeting processes for the fiscal year following that for which  the budget validation reviews were conducted. However, the timing of the  publication of the budget validation review reports for each of the last 4  years precluded even such delayed consideration because they were  issued following the OMB budget formulation process for the following  fiscal year.", "Second, NNSA\u2019s budget validation review process is not sufficiently  thorough to ensure the credibility and reliability of NNSA\u2019s budget. DOE  Order 130.1 states that budgets should be based on budget estimates  that have been thoroughly reviewed by site and headquarters program  offices. However, NNSA\u2019s budget validation review process is limited to  assessing the processes M&O contractors and programs used to develop  budget estimates rather than the accuracy of the resulting budget  estimates. NNSA\u2019s 2010 budget validation review guidance states that  the agency lacks the resources and expertise needed to thoroughly  evaluate the accuracy of budget estimates on its own and therefore relies  on assessments of the reasonableness of the processes used by M&O  contractors to develop budget estimates. NNSA officials from the Los  Alamos and Y-12 Site Offices told us that they believe the budget  validation review process would benefit NNSA more if it more thoroughly  assessed the budgetary processes M&O contractors used to develop  their budget estimates. Furthermore, NNSA policy and budget validation  review guidance stipulate that 20 percent of the agency\u2019s programs  should be reviewed annually to help ensure its validity, but NNSA\u2019s formal  validation process actually results in significantly smaller portion of its  budget being reviewed. For example, in 2011, NNSA\u2019s annual budget  validation guidance identified four programs subject to budget validation  review\u2014the Engineering Campaign, Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident  Response, Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and Fissile Materials  Disposition\u2014each of which is conducted at multiple NNSA sites.  However, NNSA conducted validation reviews at only one site for each of  these programs, which resulted in a formal validation review of  approximately 12, 21, 15, and 4 percent of each of those programs\u2019 total  budgets, respectively, which, together, constituted 1.5 percent of NNSA\u2019s  budget request for fiscal year 2012.", "Third, other weaknesses in NNSA\u2019s budget validation review process limit  its effectiveness as a resource to assess the validity of its budget  estimates. In particular, NNSA workgroups that reviewed the 2007 and  2008 budget validation review cycles recommended that NNSA formally  evaluate the status of recommendations made during previous budget  validation reviews. However, NNSA has not incorporated a formal  mechanism for implementing an evaluation into its budget validation  review process. NNSA officials at the Los Alamos and Y-12 site offices  also told us that not having such an evaluative mechanism was a  weakness in NNSA\u2019s budget validation process. Without a formal  mechanism, NNSA is limited in its ability to measure (1) any progress  M&O contractors or programs have made in their processes for  estimating budgets in response to recommendations from previous  budget validation reviews and (2) the effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s budget  validation review process. For example, a 2010 budget validation review  of the Readiness Campaign recommended that the program more  formally document its budget processes, guidance, and estimating  assumptions. Furthermore, a 2009 budget validation review of the  Elimination of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production program found that  the program could not provide documentation of its internal budget  processes. However, in both instances, NNSA did not follow up to  determine if the programs had addressed these concerns during  subsequent budget validation reviews. Additionally, budget validation  reviews do not always include recommendations to improve M&O  contractor or program processes for estimating budgets when they  identify potentially serious weaknesses in those M&O contractor\u2019s or  programs\u2019 ability to develop cost estimates. For example, according to a  2010 budget validation review of budget estimation activities for the  Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development program at  Sandia National Laboratories, six of the eight projects reviewed lacked  sufficient documentation to support their cost estimates, including two that  lacked any supporting documentation. The report noted the importance  of credible cost estimates, but it did not formally recommend any remedial  improvements and rated the overall processes used to develop those cost  estimates as satisfactory. Additionally, NNSA officials in the Defense  Programs\u2019 Office of Analysis and Evaluation told us that the cost  information used to support budget validation review reports is often  flawed or nonexistent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Implemented Some Tools to Support Decision Making on Resource Trade-offs but Has Stopped Using or Developing Other Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["During the programming phase of PPBE, NNSA uses a variety of  management tools, such as integrated priority lists and requirements and  resources assessments, to support its programming phase and assist  senior managers in making decisions on resource trade-offs.

NNSA\u2019s policy for the programming phase  stipulates that each of NNSA\u2019s nine program offices is to annually  develop an integrated priority list that ranks program activities according  to their importance for meeting mission requirements. These lists provide  senior NNSA and DOE managers with an understanding of how various  funding scenarios would affect program activities. Specifically, these lists  rank the priority of program activities that are within anticipated  appropriation levels\u2014which are of the highest priority\u2014as well as those  that NNSA would fund if the appropriation levels were sufficiently high to  do so. For example, the program activity listed last on an integrated  priority list would be the first to forgo funding if appropriation levels are  lower than anticipated. Conversely, these lists define program activities\u2014 unfunded requirements\u2014that would be funded if appropriation levels are  higher than anticipated. NNSA instructions for the programming phase  stipulate that the agency is to combine the nine program office-developed  integrated priority lists into four that correspond to the four congressional  appropriations NNSA receives. Three of the integrated priority lists\u2014 those of the Offices of the Administrator, Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors\u2014correspond directly to specific  appropriations,represent activities funded by the Weapons Activities appropriation into a   but NNSA does not combine the six others that  single integrated priority list. NNSA officials stated that these six others  represent separate and distinct mission areas and only the Administrator  can decide on the resource trade-offs among them. Of the six program  offices funded by the Weapons Activities appropriation, Defense  Programs accounts for a large majority\u2014approximately 82 percent\u2014of  the funding requested in NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget submission to  Congress. According to officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and  Budget, the Administrator is responsible for deciding on how to allocate  resources across program offices. However, these decisions are not  documented or reflected in a single integrated priority list for program  activities funded by the Weapons Activities appropriation. By not  combining these lists, NNSA is limiting the formal documentation  available to inform DOE about how various Weapons Activities  appropriation funding scenarios would affect the program activities  conducted by these six program offices. Specifically, because these six  lists are not integrated, it is unclear which program activities would be  affected by changes to appropriation levels or which programs across the  six lists are of the highest priority.", "Requirements and Resources Assessments. During the 2010 and 2011  programming cycles, NNSA used its Requirements and Resources  Assessment process to independently assess the need to conduct new  program activities and unfunded requirements. According to the NNSA  handbook for this process, officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and  Budget review program offices\u2019 budget submissions for activities that are  either above anticipated funding levels or are for new activities. For these  assessments, officials are to analyze specific factors related to these  activities, such as their need for meeting agency priorities and the  reasonableness of the assumptions used to produce their budget  estimates. The objective of this process is to ensure that new program  activities and unfunded requirements are needed to meet NNSA priorities.  For example, according to officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and  Budget, the use of the Requirements and Resources Assessment  process was a contributing factor in reducing the amount of unfunded  program activities included in NNSA\u2019s budget from approximately $1  billion for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $80 million for fiscal year  2013. Furthermore, draft NNSA guidance states that the process has  identified inconsistencies in the quality of estimates and the level of  insight and understanding program managers have regarding the fidelity  of the estimates supporting their budgets. According to officials in NNSA\u2019s  Office of Management and Budget, this process is a simple and effective  tool for providing management with additional information on the need to  conduct proposed new program activities or unfunded requirements.", "However, these officials also stated that this process is time-consuming  and would not be practical or efficient to apply to the entirety of NNSA  program activities because it was designed to assess program  components rather than entire programs; they added that other types of  program reviews or validations would be better suited for conducting  program needs analysis on an enterprise-wide basis. Additionally,  because the NNSA Office of Integration and Assessments, which was  responsible for conducting these assessments, was dissolved in 2010,  officials in NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Budget told us that they  may discontinue the use of Requirements and Resources Assessment  process in future programming cycles. Furthermore, in the current austere  budget environment, they do not foresee any programs proposing  activities that are either new or above anticipated funding levels.  Therefore, the continued use of this process in future programming cycles  is uncertain. However, we believe that NNSA has demonstrated this  process can be an important tool for assessing the necessity to fund  certain activities in order to meet its mission requirements.", "Enterprise Portfolio Analysis Tool. NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs is  implementing a data system\u2014the Enterprise Portfolio Analysis Tool\u2014 designed to provide a consistent framework for managing the PPBE  process within Defense Programs, which accounts for 54 percent, or $6.2  billion, of the President\u2019s $11.5 billion fiscal year 2013 budget request for  NNSA. As we testified in February 2012, a tool such as this could help  NNSA obtain the basic data it needs to make informed management  decisions, determine return on investment, and identify opportunities for   Currently, this tool includes a mechanism to identify when  cost saving.decisions on resource trade-offs must be made if, for example, M&O  contractor-developed budget estimates for program requirements exceed  the budget targets NNSA provided for those programs. Additionally, the  tool is to incorporate Defense Programs\u2019 common work activity  structure\u2014known as its work breakdown structure\u2014to facilitate an  analysis of consistent budget data from across the NNSA enterprise.  Specifically, the tool may allow Defense Programs managers to compare  the budget estimates for analogous activities across the nuclear security  enterprise regardless of which M&O contractor or program is conducting  them. Furthermore, Defense Programs officials stated that they eventually  plan to use this tool to compare budget estimates of program activities  with the amounts the programs ultimately expended, but they said that  the introduction of this capability is not imminent. According to Defense  Programs and M&O contractor officials, the implementation of this tool is  placing an additional labor burden on NNSA M&O contractors because of  the quantity of historical budget data that need to be entered into it.  However, according to Defense Programs officials, once these initial  historical data are entered, the M&O contractors will need to annually  update the system with the most recent year\u2019s data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Does Not Use Capabilities That Were Previously Implemented or Partially Developed to Support Its Programming Activities", "paragraphs": ["NNSA no longer has an independent analytical capability to perform such  functions as reviewing proposals for program activities and verifying cost  estimates.

Furthermore, NNSA has not  completed cost estimating guidance to assist NNSA program managers in  identifying reliable M&O contractor practices for estimating costs for  operations and sustainment activities.

NNSA agreed with these recommendations and, in  2009, instituted the Office of Integration and Assessments to identify,  analyze, assess, and present to senior NNSA management options for  managing its programs and making decisions on resource trade-offs. The  specific responsibilities of this office included analyzing program  performance, evaluating programming and funding alternatives, and  assessing the implementation and effectiveness of process improvement  initiatives. Furthermore, this office managed the Requirements and  Resources Assessment process during the 2010 programming cycle.  However, NNSA disbanded the office in 2010, 18 months after it was  formally created. NNSA officials also told us that it was never properly  staffed, which thereby limited its effectiveness.", "In the memorandum establishing the Office of Integration and  Assessments, NNSA stated that it expected the office, in conjunction with  DOE\u2019s Office of Cost Analysis, to provide DOD-like analytical resources   Since then, however, DOE has also eliminated its Office  across NNSA.of Cost Analysis. With both of these offices now gone, neither NNSA nor  DOE has independent cost assessment or program evaluation  capabilities analogous to those of DOD. In contrast, because NNSA\u2019s  Office of Naval Reactors is organized as a separate entity within NNSA  reporting both to NNSA and the U.S. Navy, unlike the rest of NNSA, it is  subject to the Navy\u2019s independent analytical resources, such as  assessments by the Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s Office of Cost  Engineering and Industrial Analysis and the Naval Center for Cost  Analysis, which conduct independent reviews and analyses of program  cost estimates. Furthermore, DOD has an Office of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation, which has a similar function but with a purview that  extends across DOD, including the Navy. These layers of independent  review approximate NNSA\u2019s vision for independent analysis, as described  in the memorandum establishing the Office of Integration and  Assessments. Following the dissolution of the Office of Integration and  Assessments in 2010, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs created the  Office of Analysis and Evaluation to conduct similar program review  functions. However, the capabilities of this office are limited by several  factors. For example, because the office is positioned within Defense  Programs, it does not have purview to conduct analysis on any of NNSA\u2019s  other programs, which, in total, constitute nearly half of the agency\u2019s  budget request for fiscal year 2013. Additionally, according to Defense  Programs officials, this office does not have the capability to self-initiate  reviews of programs but rather is instructed by Defense Programs\u2019  management on what activities to assess, thereby limiting the office\u2019s  independence. Furthermore, NNSA officials from this office stated that  properly staffing the office remains a challenge because many qualified  individuals left DOE and NNSA when they eliminated the Offices of Cost  Analysis and Integration and Assessments, respectively.", "Even though NNSA has had difficulty in maintaining an agencywide  independent analytical capability, NNSA\u2019s Principal Deputy Administrator  told us that NNSA remains supportive of the concept of an independent  analytical unit to conduct assessments of programs agencywide.

According to senior NNSA officials, the Administrator considered the AFR  to be a useful management tool but decided to discontinue issuing it  because of concerns that its contents, which are predecisional Executive  Branch deliberative material and embargoed from public release by OMB  Circular A-11, could be leaked and thereby reduce the flexibility of DOE  and OMB in making final decisions regarding the President\u2019s Budget.

However, DOE and NNSA have not  taken adequate steps to make this process as effective and efficient as  possible. In particular, DOE Order 130.1, which defines DOE\u2019s provisions  for budget activities, references outdated terminology and organizations  that no longer exist within the department, leading to confusion regarding  the order\u2019s applicability and requirement for implementation. As a result,  NNSA believes that the order has expired and that it is not required to  adhere to its provisions. By not adhering to these provisions, NNSA is  reducing the credibility of its budget proposals. Moreover, NNSA\u2019s  process for developing budget estimates continues to rely heavily on its  M&O contractors to develop budget estimates without an effective,  thorough review of the validity of those estimates. Without thorough  reviews by site and headquarters program offices of budget estimates,  NNSA cannot have a high level of confidence in its budget estimates or in  its ability to make informed decisions on resource trade-offs and to  enhance the credibility and reliability of its budget. Furthermore, NNSA\u2019s  formal budget validation review process does not sufficiently ensure the  credibility and reliability of NNSA\u2019s budget, primarily because of  deficiencies in the timing of these reviews. Also, without a formal  mechanism to evaluate the status of recommendations made during  previous budget validation reviews, NNSA is limited in its ability to  measure any progress M&O contractors or programs have made to their  budget estimating processes.", "NNSA has reduced its ability to decide on resource trade-offs because it  has not enhanced, made formal, or implemented capabilities that it has  already, to varying degrees, developed or used. In particular, NNSA does  not follow its instructions for preparing an integrated priority list for each  congressional appropriation, as it does not combine the six priority lists  that represent activities funded by the Weapons Activities appropriation  into a single integrated list. By not combining these lists into a single  integrated priority list, NNSA is limiting the formal documentation  available to inform DOE which program activities would be affected by  changes to this appropriation. Moreover, NNSA instituted and then  disbanded an independent analytic capability that would provide it with an  independent cost assessment or evaluation capabilities of the  reasonableness and affordability of various programs and projects  proposed by NNSA offices. By disbanding its independent analytical  capability, NNSA is losing its ability to improve its cost-estimating  capabilities and better ensure that its project cost estimates are credible  and reliable. Because of the fiscal constraints in the current budget  environment, it is all the more critical that NNSA have the capability to  conduct independent cost analyses to enhance its ability to make the  most effective and efficient resource decisions on resource trade-offs.  Despite previous recommendations that DOE\u2019s Inspector General made  in 2003, and that we made in 2007, to institute an independent analytical  capability to assess programs throughout all of NNSA, NNSA continues to  lack such a function. Not having this capability could preclude NNSA from  making the best decisions about what activities to fund and whether they  are affordable. In addition, NNSA may cease using its Requirements and  Resources Assessment process\u2014which is intended to provide some  independent analysis of new program activities and unfunded  requirements\u2014in future PPBE budget cycles because it does not  anticipate program proposals for new activities or unfunded requirements.
