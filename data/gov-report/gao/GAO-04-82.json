(The latter include Canadians and qualified visitors from 27 countries who enter under the visa waiver program.) The majority of visitors who are tracked depart on time, but others overstay--and since September 11, 2001, the question has arisen as to whether overstay issues might have an impact on domestic security. In this report, we (1) describe available data on the extent of overstaying, (2) report on weaknesses in the Department of Homeland Security's long-standing overstay tracking system, and (3) provide some observations on the impact that tracking system weaknesses and significant levels of overstaying may have on domestic security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Significant numbers of foreign visitors overstay their authorized periods of admission. Based in part on its long-standing I-94 system for tracking arrivals and departures, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated the overstay population for January 2000 at 2.3 million. But this estimate (1) excludes an unknown number of long-term overstays from Mexico and Canada, and by definition (2) excludes short-term overstays from these and other countries. Because of unresolved weaknesses in DHS's long-standing tracking system (e.g., noncollection of some departure forms), there is no accurate list of overstays. Tracking system weaknesses make it difficult to monitor potentially suspicious aliens who enter the country legally--and limit immigration control options. Post-September 11 operations identified thousands of overstays and other illegal immigrant workers who (despite limited background checks) had obtained critical infrastructure jobs and security badges with access to, for example, airport tarmacs and U.S. military bases. As of April 2004, federal investigators had arrested more than 1,360 illegal workers, while the majority had eluded apprehension. Together with other improvements, better information on overstays might contribute to a layered national defense that is better able to counter threats from foreign terrorists. A more comprehensive system, US-VISIT, the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology, is being phased in. The design and implementation of US-VISIT, however, face a number of challenges. It is important that this new program avoid specific weaknesses associated with the long-standing system. Checking for these weaknesses might help identify difficult challenges in advance and--together with other efforts--enhance USVISIT's chances for eventual success as a tracking system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Reliable data are critical to support effective public policy decisions in the  area of illegal immigration.

A large majority of these visitors depart  on time, but others overstay.", "The term \u201coverstay\u201d is defined as follows:  An overstay is an illegal alien who was legally admitted to the United  States for a specific authorized period but remained here after that  period expired, without obtaining an extension or a change of status or  meeting other specific conditions. Overstays who settle here are part of  the illegal immigrant population.", "Although overstays are sometimes referred to as visa overstays, we do not  use that term in this report for two reasons. First, many visitors are  allowed to enter the United States without visas and to remain for specific  periods of time, which they may overstay. Second, a visitor can overstay  an authorized period of admission set by a U.S. Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) inspector at the border\u2014even though that authorized  period may be shorter than the period of the visitor\u2019s visa. (For example, a  visitor with a 6-month multiple-entry visa from the Department of State  might be issued a 6-week period of admission by the DHS inspector and  remain here for 7 weeks, thus overstaying.)", "Viewed in terms of individuals, the overstay process can be summarized as  aliens\u2019 (1) legally visiting the United States, which for citizens of most  nations is preceded by obtaining a passport and a visa and filling out Form  I-94 at the U.S. border; (2) overstaying for a period that may range from a  single day to weeks, months, or years; and, in some cases, (3) terminating  their overstay status by exiting the United States or adjusting to legal  permanent resident status (that is, obtaining a green card). Most long- term overstays appear to have economic motivations.", "However, the overstay process can also be viewed in the context of a  layered defense for domestic security, supported by agencies such as DHS,  the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of State, among  others. Figure 1 illustrates the layered-defense concept and the many  interrelated issues that we have analyzed in numerous reports\u2014ranging  from the overseas tracking of terrorists to stateside security for critical  infrastructure locations. Intelligence, investigation, and information  sharing are the key ingredients supporting such a defense. A variety of  immigration issues are potentially relevant.", "Progress in deploying and effectively using watch lists is ongoing. In   2003, we reported that (1) the State Department, \u201cwith the help of other  agencies, almost doubled the number of names and the amount of  information\u201d in its Consular Lookout and Support System but that (2) \u201cthe  federal watch list environment has been characterized by a proliferation of   systems, among which information sharing is  occurring in some cases but not in others.\u201d Visitor biographical and  biometric data are now being checked against selected watch list data, to  verify visitors\u2019 identity, as part of the new U.S. Visitor and Immigrant  Status Indicator Technology program (US-VISIT).", "Keeping all dangerous persons and potential terrorist suspects from legally  entering the United States is difficult because some do not match the  expected characteristics of terrorists or suspicious persons. In addition,  some\u2014such as citizens of Canada or one of the 27 visa waiver countries\u2014 are not required to apply for visas and are not screened by the visa  process. Terrorists may continue to slip through border defenses, and  watch lists have therefore also been used for tracking foreign terrorists  within the United States.", "Overstay tracking\u2014that is, recording visitors\u2019 entries and exits as well as  their address information\u2014also logically plays a role. Overstay issues  have gained heightened attention because some of the hijackers of  September 11, 2001, had overstayed their periods of admission.", "Form I-94 (shown in appendix I) is the basis of DHS\u2019s long-standing system  for tracking overstays. For visitors from most countries, the period of  admission is authorized (or set) by a DHS inspector when they enter the  United States legally and fill out this form. Each visitor is to give the top  half of the form to the inspector and to retain the bottom half, which  should be collected when the visitor departs the country. However, two  major groups are exempt from filling out Form I-94 when they visit the  United States for business or pleasure:    Canadian citizens admitted for up to 6 months and    Mexican citizens entering the United States with a border crossing card  (BCC, illustrated in fig. 2) at the southwestern border who intend to limit  their stay to less than 72 hours and intend not to travel beyond a set  perimeter, generally 25 miles from the border (see app. II, fig. 6).", "During fiscal years 1999 to 2003, the Department of State issued 6.4 million  Mexican BCCs. Because the majority of Canadian and Mexican BCC visits  do not require Form I-94, the system based on this form cannot follow  them\u2014that is, cannot track them.

Earlier,  we identified challenges and potential weaknesses in Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS) procedures used in estimating these overstays  (including an incorrect INS formula). Therefore, we sought alternative,  and more current, data sources.", "The first alternative data source we identified is a survey that DHS and the  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development sponsored, in  partnership with other federal agencies. As reported in 2002, the survey  (1) sampled more than 1,000 adult green-card holders, (2) asked them  about their prior immigration status, and (3) found that more than 300 self- reported earlier illegal status. The computer run we requested showed that  31 percent of these former illegals said they had been overstays. (Most  others reported prior illegal border crossing.)", "A second alternative source was a set of data we obtained from Operation  Tarmac and other recent sweeps of employees who, in the course of their  work, had access to sensitive areas in airports, other critical  infrastructures, or special events (for example, the Super Bowl). Although  investigators conducting these operations collected information on  overstaying, they had not systematically recorded data for overstays  versus illegal border crossers or other categories of illegal immigrants. We  requested that DHS manually review case files for those arrested and  identify the number who were overstays. DHS reported to us on a total of  917 arrests, taken from operations at a sample of Operation Tarmac  airports and at all other critical infrastructure and special-event locations  investigated. As we detail later in this report, 246 of the 917 cases\u2014or   27 percent\u2014were categorized as overstays.", "Another source we obtained from DHS was similar information on an  operation identifying illegal alien employees at a retail chain (unrelated to  terrorist concerns). In this operation, 138 of 243 cases\u2014that is,   57 percent\u2014were identified as overstays.", "The percentages above do not represent the illegal population but, as  indicated above, do provide some evidence that in all likelihood, a  substantial proportion of illegal immigrants are overstays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Estimate Excludes Major Overstay Groups", "paragraphs": ["The DHS overstay estimate appears to be an understatement for two main  reasons.

The second is that, by definition, the population of illegal immigrants does  not include many short-term overstays.", "Thus, DHS\u2019s 2.3 million estimate excludes the following overstay groups:  1.  Mexican and Canadian visitors who did not fill out Form I-94 and  who overstayed and settled here. (Although these long-term  overstay settlers are included in DHS\u2019s estimate of 7 million illegal  immigrants, they are, erroneously, categorized as illegal  immigrants other than overstays. This is because DHS used   I-94 data to estimate overstays.)  2.  Visitors filling out Form I-94 who overstay for short periods of  time.  3.  Mexicans and Canadian visitors who do not fill out Form I-94 and  who overstay for short periods of time.", "The excluded groups are illustrated in figure 3, together with the overstay  group that is covered.", "As a result, an overstay settler group is omitted from DHS\u2019s overstay  estimate (that is, from DHS\u2019s estimate that one-third of the illegal  immigrant population, or 2.3 million, are overstays). The Mexican\u2013 Canadian overstay group at issue was apparently included in the   7 million\u2014but not the 2.3 million\u2014estimate. It is not clear whether this  issue may affect some of the three \u201crough-check\u201d comparison figures cited  above.", "DHS\u2019s procedures for arriving at the estimate of 7 million are heavily based  on the 2000 census and include those who settled here, were residing here  at the time of the 2000 census, and were included either in the actual  census count or in corrections for possible undercounts. The census is  not likely to include aliens illegally present for relatively short periods of  time, in part because such persons may not identify the United States as  their principal place of residence. Consistent with this, when using I-94  data to estimate overstays, DHS specifically excluded short-term  overstays. This is important because overstaying is not limited to those  who illegally immigrate here and intend to remain for years. Many others  overstay for only a few days, weeks, or months, including those discussed  above who are\u2014and are not\u2014required to fill out Form I-94.", "Finally, we note two possible further limitations: DHS overstay estimates  do not address either the issue of \u201cprior overstays\u201d or possible trends in  overstaying:    As indicated by the survey cited above (our first alternative data source),   a portion of overstays who settle here eventually obtain legal status. Many  prior overstays appear to be residing legally in the United States now, and  thus the \u201cflow\u201d of overstays who settle here may be larger than a net  estimate of the overstay population at a single point in time implies.", "DHS estimated overstays using I-94 data from the early 1990s, and it  projected those estimates forward to January 2000. Without independent  overstay estimates for two points in time, a reliable assessment of change  is not possible. DHS has not published estimates for more recent dates\u2014 that is, since January 2000.", "Overstay trend estimates would be of interest but are not available. Visits  to the United States decreased somewhat in 2002.

Last year, we reported that DHS does not  \u201cconsistently enter change of status data . . .  integrate these data with  those for entry and departure.\u201d DHS told us that linkage to obtain  updated information may occur for an individual, as when a consular  official updates information on an earlier period of admission for someone  seeking a new visa, but DHS acknowledged that linkage cannot be  achieved broadly to yield an accurate list of visitors who overstayed.", "Lack of reliable address information and inability to locate  visitors. Some visitors do not fill in destination address information on  Form I-94 or they do so inadequately. A related issue that we reported in  2002 is DHS\u2019s inability to obtain updated address information during each  visitor\u2019s stay. Such information could be a valuable addition to the arrival,  departure, and destination address information that is collected.", "Missing departure forms. We reported in 1995 that \u201cairlines are  responsible for collecting . . . departure forms when visitors leave   . . . . But for some visitors who may have actually left the United States   record of the departures.\u201d DHS acknowledges that this is still  a concern, the situation is analogous for cruise lines, and noncollection is  a larger problem for land exits.", "Our recent work has also drawn attention to identity fraud, demonstrating  how persons presenting fraudulent documents (bearing a name other than  their own) to DHS inspectors could enter the United States. Visitors  whose fraudulent documents pass inspection could record a name other  than their own on Form I-94.", "In our current work, we have identified two further weaknesses in the  overstay tracking system. One weakness is the inability to match some  departure forms back to corresponding arrival forms. DHS has suggested  that when a visitor loses the original departure form, matching is less  certain because it can no longer be based on identical numbers printed on  the top and bottom halves of the original form. The other weakness is that  at land ports (and possibly airports and seaports), the collection of  departure forms is vulnerable to manipulation\u2014in other words, visitors  could make it appear that they had left when they had not. To illustrate, on  bridges where toll collectors accept Form I-94 at the southwestern border,  a person departing the United States by land could hand in someone else\u2019s  form.", "Because of these weaknesses, DHS has no accurate list of overstays to  send to consular officials or DHS inspectors. This limits DHS\u2019s ability to  consider past overstaying when issuing new visas or allowing visitors to  reenter. More generally, the lack of an accurate list limits prevention and  enforcement. For example, accurate data on overstays and other visitors  might help define patterns for better differentiating visa applicants with  higher overstay risk. And without an accurate list and updated addresses,  it is not possible to identify and locate new overstays to remind them of  penalties for not departing. Such efforts fall under the category of interior  enforcement. As we previously reported, \u201chistorically . . . over five times  more resources in terms of staff and budget  border  enforcement than . . .  interior enforcement.\u201d", "Despite large numbers of overstays, current efforts to deport them are  generally limited to (1) criminals and smugglers, (2) employees identified  as illegal workers at airports and other critical infrastructure locations,  and (3) persons included in special control efforts such as the 2003  domestic registration (or \u201ccall in\u201d component) of the NSEERS program  (the National Security Entry and Exit Registration System). DHS  statisticians told us that for fiscal year 2002, the risk of arrest for all  overstays was less than 2 percent. For most other overstays (that is, for  persons not in targeted groups), the risk of deportation is considerably  lower. DHS told us that because of limited resources, it has focused  enforcement on high-priority illegal alien groups.", "The effect that weaknesses in the overstay tracking system has on  overstay data is illustrated by the inaccurate\u2014and, according to DHS,  inflated\u2014lists of what it has termed \u201capparent overstays.\u201d For fiscal year  2001 arrivals, the system yielded    a list of 6.5 million \u201capparent overstays\u201d for which DHS had no departure  record that matched the arrivals and   an additional list of a half million other visits that ended after the visitors\u2019  initial periods of admission expired. (For data on specific countries or country groups, see app. V, table 5.)", "However, DHS has no way of knowing which of these are real cases of  overstaying and which are false, because in all likelihood, some of these  visitors departed or legally changed their status\u2014or legally extended their  periods of admission.", "In the past, we made a number of recommendations that directly or  indirectly addressed some of these system weaknesses, but these  recommendations have not been implemented or have been only partially  implemented.

(See app. VII for more complete Operation Tarmac nationality  data.)", "The illegal immigrant workers with access to secure airport areas were  employed by airlines (for example, at Washington Dulles International  Airport and Washington Reagan National Airport, these included  American, Atlantic Coast, Delta, Northwest, and United Airlines, as well as  SwissAir and British Airways) and by a variety of other companies (for  example, Federal Express and Ogden Services). Job descriptions included,  among others, aircraft maintenance technician, airline agent, airline cabin  service attendant, airplane fueler, baggage handler, cargo operations  manager, electrician, janitorial supervisor, member of a cleaning crew,  predeparture screener, ramp agent, and skycap. One overstay was  employed in an airport badging office.", "Without fraud or counterfeit documents, illegal workers would not have  been able to obtain these jobs and badges, allowing them access to secure  areas. In the large majority of these cases, illegal immigrants had misused  Social Security numbers and identity documents to illegally obtain airport  jobs and security badges. A much smaller number of airport employees  had misrepresented their criminal histories in order to obtain their jobs  and badges. One DHS official emphasized that these were all serious  security breaches because there was no way to know who these people  actually were. Moreover, another DHS official told us that Operation  Tarmac is likely not to have identified all illegal aliens working in secure  areas of airports. Of the 4,918 unauthorized workers identified, 1,054 have  been arrested, and the 3,864 others have left their airport jobs and eluded  arrest.", "Sweeps similar to Operation Tarmac were subsequently initiated for a  broad range of critical infrastructure components and special events, such  as the Super Bowl (see table 3).", "The employees checked in these sweeps ranged from workers at nuclear  power plants, military bases, pipelines, and special national events such as  the Super Bowl to security officers for the Federal Protective Services,  which guards federal buildings, and workers at sensitive national  landmarks. Illegal immigrants committing identity fraud were found to be  working at every one of these locations. Overstays were found to be  working at two-thirds of these facilities and represented 20.7 percent of  the unauthorized workers found by investigators of critical infrastructure  sites.", "We asked DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials why  there were more than 4,900 security breaches at airports, most of which  involved illegal aliens. They stated that airport badging authorities did not  routinely make rigorous checks. They stated that while badging  authorities were able to check the FBI databases for criminal histories and  terrorists on watch lists, they had no protocol for checking Social Security  numbers and only a limited ability to verify immigration status. In  contrast, Operation Tarmac and related critical infrastructure sweeps  were joint federal operations that were able to do more rigorous, but still  limited, checks because they had full access to DHS and Social Security  Administration (SSA) data.", "We asked if this problem had been corrected as a result of Operation  Tarmac. DHS officials stated that it had not. They stated that airport  badging authorities still could not make these positive identification  checks. They stated that, in effect, the airports knew who was not working  there (that is, airports had checked for known terrorists and criminals) but  not who was. Officials we interviewed from the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Inspector General\u2019s office and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  office have also expressed their concern about this problem.", "With respect to the other security breaches at critical infrastructure sites,  DHS officials told us that in many cases, the situation was similar to that  described for airport badging authorities.", "Last, officials from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  recently testified before the House Aviation subcommittee that persons  employed at airports will not be subject to the CAPPS II screening that  airline passengers will undergo\u2014and are not now subject to physical  screening\u2014because TSA relies on employees\u2019 rigorous background checks  instead. It differs by airport, but the legislative requirement is that workers  must be screened, and TSA policy is that screening can consist of  background checks and credentialing procedures rather than physical  screening.", "Operation Tarmac found airport background checks to have failed more  than 4,900 times.

Using data from the decennial census  (long form), DHS estimated the number of total foreign-born noncitizens  residing here as of January 2000 who had arrived in each year from   1990 up to 2000.", "From this, DHS subtracted an estimate of legally resident foreign-born  noncitizens, based on annual DHS administrative data\u2014for example, the  number of green cards issued each year, adjusted downward to account  for deaths and return migration. Also subtracted were an estimate of the  number of (1) residents who had applied for and would eventually receive  legal status (estimated at 200,000) and (2) asylees, parolees, and persons  with temporary protected status (TPS) who had received work  authorization but not permanent resident status (377,000).", "These subtraction procedures yielded a \u201cresidual\u201d estimate of illegal  residents.

In this estimation process, DHS adjusted for various factors, such as  census undercounts.", "According to the INS paper presenting the estimate of 7 million, the  second component in this estimate\u2014the estimate of 1.5 million illegal  residents who had arrived before 1990\u2014was derived from    an estimate of 3.5 million illegal residents here in January 1990 and   DHS\u2019s estimate that, of the 3.5 million, 1.5 million had survived and  remained here until 2000\u2014without adjusting to legal status.", "To derive estimates for various countries or regions of origin (for example,  Mexico or Asia), these procedures were carried out separately for   75 countries and for each region of origin.", "The component estimate of 5.5 million illegal residents who arrived in the  past decade is based on residual estimation, which is a generally accepted  demographic procedure; DHS also attempts to compensate for potential  weaknesses in the source data\u2014for example, compensating for some  illegal immigrants\u2019 avoidance of the decennial census.", "The other (second) component estimate\u20141.5 million illegal residents who  had arrived before 1990\u2014is based, in part, on the estimate of 3.5 million  illegal residents (as of 1990). The methods and procedures used to make  the 3.5 million estimate have not been described in any DHS publication.  However, the 3.5 million estimate can be compared with another  published estimate of the illegal immigrant population, derived from  residual-based estimates, calculated with data from the 1990 census: 3.5  million for 1990. We have not evaluated this other published estimate;  however, it is based on the generally accepted residual approach and was  prepared by an expert in immigration statistics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: How DHS Estimated Overstays", "paragraphs": ["DHS estimates that overstays constituted one-third of 7 million illegal  immigrants residing in the United States as of January 2000. DHS\u2019s one- third estimate is the result of a series of estimation procedures, described  in this appendix.", "In 1994, INS published estimates of overstays for October 1992, using data  from the Form I-94 overstay tracking system we describe in this report.  The overstay tracking system generally does not include Mexican visitors  entering the United States with a BCC at the Southwest land border who  state that their intention is to limit their stay to 72 hours and not to travel  beyond a set perimeter, generally 25 miles from the border. (See fig. 6.)  The overstay tracking system also does not monitor Canadians admitted  for up to 6 months, and there is no perimeter restriction for them. Such  visitors who overstayed would not be included in an overstay estimate  based on the I-94 data. Thus, from the very start, INS excluded some  Mexican and Canadian overstays from its estimate.", "In using the I-94 data, INS recognized that many departure forms were  missing (even when visitors had actually departed). Therefore, INS  devised a way to estimate this missing-data factor, which was termed  \u201csystem error.\u201d As we explained in an earlier report.", "INS first identified as \u201cindex\u201d countries those whose citizens were very  unlikely to immigrate illegally to the United States\u2014Sweden and  Switzerland, among others. Then, using I-94 index-country data for a  specific time period (that is, all index-country arrivals in a specific year,  checked about 9 months after their initially required departure date), INS  calculated the percentage of visitors from each index country who were  \u201capparent overstays\u201d\u2014visitors for whom no matching record of departure  could be found. Averaging this percentage across 12 index countries  yielded a percentage figure (for example, 8 percent). Assuming that  virtually no visitors from those 12 countries actually overstayed, INS took  its calculated percentage (for example, 8 percent), plus a small margin of  error, to represent a global level of \u201csystem error.\u201d", "INS then calculated the percentage of apparent overstays for each  nonindex country\u2014Korea, Mexico, Poland, and so on\u2014as of October  1992. From a particular country\u2019s percentage of apparent overstays (for  example, 12 percent), INS subtracted its global system error estimate   (10 percent), yielding an estimated overstay rate for that country (for  example, 2 percent). Any overstaying above the global \u201csystem error\u201d was  taken as an overstay flow estimate. Multiplied by the number of arrivals  from a specific country in the designated year, this yielded the number of  new overstays from that country.", "Estimation was limited to overstays remaining here for about a year or  more.", "These data and procedures are the basis for all subsequent DHS overstay  estimates. In our earlier report, we indicated a number of reasons why  these overstay estimation procedures needed improvement.", "INS combined these estimates with estimates for total illegal residents\u2014to  address the question of what percentage of total illegal alien residents  overstays represented as of October 1992. Importantly, this step was  carried out separately for 99 countries, with the remaining countries  grouped together in their respective continents of origin\u2014for example, the  rest of Asia.", "INS then applied the country-by-country October 1992 overstay  percentages to project a later, October 1996 overstay estimate. Assuming  no change between 1992 and 1996 in percentages of illegals estimated to  be overstays in each country, INS multiplied the 1992 overstay percentages  by newly estimated (1996) per-country estimates of numbers of total illegal  immigrants.", "The same procedures (based on 1992 data) were carried out to yield  country-by-country overstay estimates for January 2000. Summing the  results across all country categories yielded an estimate of overstays\u2014  2.3 million, or one-third of all illegal aliens residing here as of January  2000.", "Although we believe that the DHS estimation procedures contain several  weak points, we were able to identify or develop three small-sample  comparisons of illegal immigrants, as detailed in this report. These three  \u201crough checks\u201d indicated varying results\u2014that 27 percent,   31 percent, and 57 percent of the illegal immigrants \u201csampled\u201d were  overstays. But taken together, they clearly suggest that some substantial  percentage of illegal residents are overstays.", "With respect to possible trends, we do not believe that a reliable estimate  of change in the overstay population can be based on DHS estimates. The  estimate of overstays for 2000 is not based on any new overstay data;  rather, it is based on (1) new data on the \u201ctotal illegal population\u201d as of  January 2000 and (2) old data on what percentage of immigrants from each  country or continent of origin are overstays.

We recommended that to improve the collection of departure  forms, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization  Service should ensure that INS examine the quality control of the  Nonimmigrant Information System database and determine why  departure forms are not being recorded. This could involve, for  example, examining a sample of the passenger manifest lists of  flights with foreign destinations to determine the extent of airline  compliance and, possibly, developing penalties to be levied on  airlines for noncompliance. Discovery of the incidence of various  causes of departure loss could allow a more precise estimation of  their occurrence and the development of possible remedies. (U.S.  General Accounting Office, Illegal Aliens: Despite Data  Limitations, Current Methods Provide Better Population  Estimates, GAO/PEMD-93-25 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 5, 1993).)", "INS agreed in principle with our recommendation and fielded a pilot  project to study why departure forms were not being collected. In 2002,  INS discontinued the pilot because it was not yielding results INS had  hoped for and because INS was in the process of designing an automated  entry-exit system, which is now part of DHS\u2019s US-VISIT program. If  successfully implemented, US-VISIT could help identify overstays. We are  monitoring the design and implementation of the US-VISIT program.  2.  We recommended that the Commissioner of INS have new  overstay estimates prepared for air arrivals from all countries,  using improved estimation procedures such as those discussed in  the report, including, as appropriate, the potential improvements  suggested by INS or by reviewers of the report. (U.S. General  Accounting Office, Illegal Immigration: INS Overstay Estimation  Methods Need Improvement, GAO/PEMD-95-20 (Washington, D.C.:  Sept. 26, 1995).)", "INS initially concurred and produced revised estimates as part of its  comments on our report. However, in our response to INS\u2019s comments, we  described the new estimates as a \u201cfirst step\u201d and identified concerns about  INS\u2019s methodological procedures that we said needed further study.  Recently, DHS told us that it has not further studied making overstay  estimates for air arrivals. Valid estimation of overstays is extremely  difficult, given current tracking system weaknesses.  3.  We recommended that to promote compliance with the change of  address notification requirements through publicity and  enforcement and to improve the reliability of its alien address data,  the Attorney General should direct the INS Commissioner to  identify and implement an effective means of publicizing the  change of address notification requirement nationwide. INS should  make sure, in its publicity effort, that aliens are given information  on how to comply with this requirement, including information on  where change of address forms and other information may be  available. (U.S. General Accounting Office, Homeland Security:  INS Cannot Locate Many Aliens Because It Lacks Reliable  Address Information, GAO-03-188 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 21,  2002).)", "DHS concurred with this recommendation and has identified it as a long- term strategy that will require 2 years to fully implement. Since we made  this recommendation less than 2 years ago, DHS has not had sufficient  time to implement it fully.  4.  We recommended that to provide better information on H-1B  workers and their status changes, the Secretary of DHS take action  to ensure that information on prior visa status and occupations for  permanent residents and other employment-related visa holders is  consistently entered into current tracking systems and that such  information become integrated with entry and departure  information when planned tracking systems are complete.
