USDA's actions to reduce these pathogens include, for example, tightening existing standards limiting the allowable amount of Salmonella contamination in young poultry carcasses, implementing the first standards limiting Campylobacter contamination in young poultry carcasses in 2011, and developing an action plan detailing a priority list of actions, such as developing new enforcement strategies, to reduce Salmonella . More recently, in August 2014, USDA published its final rule to modernize poultry slaughter inspections, which according to the agency, will play a role in reducing Salmonella and other poultry pathogen contamination by allowing better use of agency resources, among other things.", "To help assess the effects of these actions on the incidence of human illness from Salmonella and Campylobacter , USDA conducted research on the effects of agency actions to reduce these pathogens and developed performance measures for certain poultry products to help monitor progress toward agency goals. For example, USDA developed a measure to indicate whether agency actions to ensure compliance with the standard for Salmonella contamination in young chicken carcasses are helping the agency achieve its goal of maximizing domestic compliance with food safety policies. However, USDA has not developed measures for Salmonella contamination in ground poultry or young turkey carcasses, even though standards for such contamination have been in place since 1996 and 2005, respectively, or for Campylobacter contamination in young poultry carcasses. USDA believes it is not appropriate to establish measures for ground poultry until the agency has revised standards, or for Campylobacte r contamination until the agency has obtained more information on compliance levels\u2014both of which the agency expects to do by the end of 2014. USDA officials stated that they will review the agency's strategic plan to determine what performance measures, if any, are needed. USDA does not believe a measure for young turkey carcasses is needed since historically data have shown that plants are meeting the standard but, in calendar year 2013, two plants did not meet it; USDA officials told GAO that these plants are no longer noncompliant. Without performance measures for these standards, USDA is not publicly reporting performance information and cannot assess the effects of its actions related to these standards in meeting the goal of maximizing domestic compliance with food safety policies and, ultimately, protecting public health.", "GAO identified several challenges\u2014based, in part, on the views of 11 stakeholder groups\u2014that could hinder USDA's ability to reduce contamination in poultry products. For example, contamination of poultry products can be affected by practices on poultry farms. To help overcome this challenge, the agency developed guidelines in 2010 on practices for controlling Salmonella and Campylobacter on farms, but the guidelines did not include information on the effectiveness of each of these practices, consistent with a recommendation from an agency advisory committee. USDA did not confirm that it plans to include this information in future guidelines. Without providing this information in future guidelines, USDA is not fully informing the poultry industry of the potential benefits of adopting these practices and encouraging their implementation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Salmonella and Campylobacter on farms include information on the effectiveness of each practice.

Under FSIS  regulations, all plants must also have site-specific standard operating  procedures for sanitation. FSIS inspectors at slaughter plants routinely  check records to verify a plant\u2019s compliance with those procedures. FSIS  also has a verification testing program in which FSIS inspectors at  slaughter plants collect samples of poultry products to determine whether  a pathogen is present (known as positive rate).

The  agency will publish Campylobacter categories before December 31, 2014,  according to FSIS\u2019s fiscal year 2014 annual performance plan. FSIS  officials told us that the agency has not developed a performance  measure for determining the agency\u2019s success in controlling Salmonella  in young turkey carcasses because testing data have shown that young  turkey plants where the agency has routinely collected and reviewed data  are meeting the standard. However, FSIS stated in its fourth quarter  calendar year 2013 report on pathogen testing that 2 out of 35 (about 6  percent) of the turkey slaughter plants were in Category 3, meaning these  plants did not meet the standard. In July 2014, FSIS officials told us these  plants are no longer in Category 3 based on recent testing. However,  without performance measures and targets for compliance with standards  for these pathogens in commonly consumed poultry products, FSIS  cannot quantitatively gauge its progress in assessing the effects of its  actions related to these standards toward meeting the agency\u2019s goal of  maximizing domestic compliance with food safety policies and, ultimately,  protecting public health. Performance measures and targets are  reported in the agency\u2019s strategic and annual plans but, in the absence of  such measures and targets, performance information such as the trends  supplied to FSIS leadership, is not being publicly reported. Without  publicly reporting such information, FSIS loses the opportunity to enhance  transparency by providing this information to the public and Congress  about its progress in meeting this important goal, potentially limiting  oversight and accountability.", "In addition to the performance measure for young chicken carcasses,  FSIS established, in 2009, an \u201call-illness\u201d performance measure to  evaluate its efforts to reduce foodborne human illness resulting from  consumption of FSIS-regulated products contaminated with Salmonella  and two other pathogens. According to FSIS officials, the all-illness  measure is an estimate of the number of illnesses from these pathogens  resulting from the consumption of all FSIS-regulated products\u2014including  meat, poultry, and processed egg products. The officials said FSIS  develops this estimate using CDC laboratory-confirmed illness data, CDC  outbreak data, U.S. census data, and foodborne illness estimation data  from a CDC peer-reviewed publication. The all-illness measure has an  associated target level of performance, set by the agency, for the  maximum number of human illnesses from these pathogens attributed to  FSIS-regulated products. For example, FSIS set the fiscal year 2013  target at 394,770 human illnesses from the three pathogens, including  Salmonella. USDA reported in 2013 that FSIS did not meet its target;  there were 427,171 human illnesses. As part of the all-illness measure,  FSIS also set individual targets for the maximum number of human  illnesses from each of the three pathogens attributed to FSIS-regulated  products, including a Salmonella target. The annual report did not break  out the results for each of the three pathogens, but the agency\u2019s fiscal  year 2013 year-in-review report showed that FSIS did not meet the  Salmonella target specifically. According to FSIS officials, historically the  agency has not met the Salmonella target for the all-illness measure.  However, recent actions FSIS has taken and plans to take are intended to  address human illnesses from Salmonella attributed to FSIS regulated  products, according to the agency\u2019s Salmonella Action Plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSIS Has Relied on Data with Limitations That Affect Their Usefulness", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Microbiological  Criteria for Foods, which provides impartial, scientific advice to federal  food safety agencies, the impact of FSIS\u2019s regulatory activities on the  incidence of human illnesses from pathogens cannot be measured  directly because of limitations in the foodborne illness attribution data the  agency uses.", "For example, the outbreak data available from CDC  depend on voluntary reporting of illnesses and do not always identify the  food product that caused an outbreak; we have previously found  limitations in these data, including delayed reporting and  incompleteness.

In  commenting on this report, USDA agreed that there are limitations in the  data but stated the agency uses the best available data. FSIS is  considering including Campylobacter in the all-illness measure as well,  but there is no broadly accepted estimate for the proportion of illnesses  attributed to Campylobacter, according to FSIS officials.", "In 2011, FSIS, CDC, and FDA formed an interagency group to improve  food safety data and coordinate analyses.

According to  FSIS officials, this effort will assist in better estimating the proportion of  Salmonella illnesses associated with poultry products, and the agencies  plan to present results from ongoing projects in 2015.", "For example, FSIS, CDC, and FDA  In addition to performance measures, FSIS conducted research to assess  the effects of its actions on the incidence of human illnesses from the  consumption of poultry products, but this research also has data  limitations. For example, in February 2012, after revising its Salmonella  standards for young chicken carcasses, FSIS completed research  evaluating whether reductions of Salmonella contamination from young  chicken carcasses across the industry would offer public benefits, in the  form of reduced human illness rates. However, in attempting to evaluate  the effect of reductions of Salmonella contamination across the industry,  FSIS relied on its verification testing data from individual plants, which the  agency later concluded in April 2012 cannot be used to estimate  prevalence across the industry because the agency does not randomly  select plants for verification testing, among other things. FSIS also used  CDC outbreak and individual illness case data in its research to identify  the number of human illness from Salmonella contamination but, as we  mentioned above, these data do not always distinguish illnesses derived  from poultry products specifically.", "While FSIS\u2019s research efforts are a positive step, data limitations make it  difficult to directly correlate agency actions to reductions in the rates of  human illness from poultry products contaminated with Salmonella. To  help address these limitations, FSIS has taken steps, such as developing  a statistical model in 2012, to estimate the reduction in human illnesses  from revised Salmonella and newly created Campylobacter standards.  More importantly, in 2013, FSIS created a new testing approach for  ground poultry to estimate prevalence of Salmonella, among other things.  According to FSIS officials, the new verification testing program includes  continuous weekly sampling and testing at all poultry slaughter plants  producing raw ground poultry and increases the sensitivity of analysis so  that lower levels of contamination can be detected. FSIS officials told us  that the agency plans to expand this approach to other poultry products.  According to FSIS\u2019s working group on prevalence estimates, testing for  prevalence is necessary in order for the agency to effectively measure or  understand how contamination rates change over time; set standards;  develop targeted interventions; and measure the agency\u2019s performance  toward meeting FSIS long-term strategic goals.

According to FSIS officials, they would like to address on-the- farm problems, but the agency is limited in its activities related to farms  because its jurisdiction starts when products enter slaughter plants. In  2010, FSIS published updated compliance guidelines that detail, among  other things, several on-farm practices to reduce Salmonella and  Campylobacter in live poultry.

FSIS officials  told us that the agency is currently working with stakeholders such as  FDA and APHIS to gather information about on-farm practices.

A federal appeals court  upheld the decision in 2001. Subsequently, the agency adopted the  position that the court ruling did not affect its ability to use the standards  as part of verifying a plant\u2019s sanitation and HACCP plans. For example,  after a plant fails Salmonella testing for its first sample set, FSIS can  require a reassessment of the plant\u2019s HACCP plan and then conduct a  food safety assessment (evaluation of a plant\u2019s food safety system);  conduct additional sampling; or issue a \u201cNotice of Intended Enforcement\u201d  action, according to FSIS officials. FSIS can also condemn products that  are contaminated with filth (or otherwise adulterated) or mislabeled, or it  can condemn parts of products, and detain them so they cannot  progress down the marketing chain. Even with these tools,  representatives from four out of six consumer groups we interviewed told  us that the agency does not have sufficient authority to ensure plants  comply with FSIS\u2019s standards because FSIS cannot shut down plants  when they fail Salmonella standards alone. Representatives of all four  industry groups we interviewed disagreed and stated that FSIS has  sufficient authority to ensure plants comply with standards because the  agency has broad statutory authority and oversight.", "Second, because FSIS has not classified Salmonella as an adulterant in  raw poultry products, products contaminated with this pathogen generally  are permitted to enter commerce. However, according to FSIS officials,  the agency can consider raw poultry products contaminated with  Salmonella as adulterated on a case-by-case basis\u2014for example, during  a voluntary recall, as discussed later in this report. Representatives from  five out of six of the consumer groups we interviewed said they believe  that some serotypes of Salmonella should be declared an adulterant,  such as those with specific antibiotic-resistance patterns. According to  CDC officials, antibiotic resistance can be associated with a higher risk of  hospitalization in infected individuals. For example, in two of the four  Salmonella outbreaks we reviewed, ill persons were hospitalized twice as  frequently as is normally seen in Salmonella outbreaks, according to CDC  officials. Since 2013, more than a dozen consumer groups have  supported a petition for FSIS to declare specific antibiotic-resistant  serotypes of Salmonella as adulterants when found in poultry. In July  2014, FSIS denied one of the consumer group\u2019s petitions to have  antibiotic-resistant Salmonella declared an adulterant. FSIS officials told  us that they have found no conclusive scientific evidence that antibiotic- resistant strains of Salmonella or Campylobacter have a greater  resistance to interventions currently used in FSIS-inspected poultry  plants, but the agency continues to review the relevant scientific evidence  to identify any potential challenges that these serotypes may present to  public health.", "Representatives from a government employee stakeholder group we  interviewed said that rather than classifying all of Salmonella an  adulterant in raw poultry products, FSIS should consider the top  Salmonella serotypes causing most human illnesses. For example, the  representatives said that FSIS should consider declaring a narrow range  of Salmonella serotypes in select raw poultry products as adulterants  similar to the classification of E. coli O157:H7 as an adulterant in beef.  CDC has identified three Salmonella serotypes in poultry associated with  causing the highest number of human illnesses: Salmonella Enteritidis,  Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Heidelberg. According to  FSIS\u2019s risk-based inspection protocols, FSIS considers the top  Salmonella serotypes identified through CDC data when ranking plants to  determine the frequency of verification testing and inspections. Moreover,  according to FSIS documents, the agency provides plants with data on  which Salmonella serotypes were identified through verification testing.  FSIS officials told us prior court cases have set a precedent that the  presence of Salmonella in raw poultry products is not sufficient to declare  the pathogen an adulterant because Salmonella can be killed through  proper cooking.", "Representatives from all four industry groups we interviewed disagreed  that any serotypes of Salmonella should be classified as adulterants for  several reasons. Representatives from two industry groups told us rapid  identification of the serotype is not available and that it can take several  weeks for FSIS to identify specific serotypes from positive Salmonella  verification test results. Representatives from another industry group we  spoke with said Salmonella is already classified as an adulterant in fully  cooked poultry products and that, for raw poultry products, FSIS includes  instructions on proper handling and thorough cooking to prevent cross- contamination and eliminate the pathogen.

In 2011, Congress passed the  FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, giving FDA mandatory recall  authority. We recommended in October 2004 that Congress should  consider legislation to increase FSIS\u2019s authority to include mandatory  recalls, but the agency continues not to have such enforcement  authority. Instead, FSIS can issue public health alerts or request  voluntary recalls, among other actions, to protect human health from  potentially contaminated meat and poultry products. Before requesting a  voluntary recall, FSIS must gather sufficient evidence through its  investigation and determine that a product is adulterated or mislabeled,  among other things. According to FSIS officials, the agency requests a  voluntary recall when the agency links a product to an ill person and  obtains specific information on the source of the product (plant), product  type, production date, and product distribution. In the five outbreaks we  reviewed, three of the five companies voluntarily recalled or stopped  distributing poultry products implicated in outbreaks before FSIS  requested a recall. For the fourth outbreak, in July 2014, FSIS requested  that Foster Farms conduct a voluntary recall of select chicken parts  involved in an outbreak, which had been ongoing since March 2013, after  definitively linking the product to an ill person; the company recalled the  products. By contrast, in the fifth outbreak, CDC reported that  collaborative investigative efforts by local, state, and federal officials  indicated that Foster Farms chicken products were the most likely source  of an outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg that took place from June 2012  until May 2013. However, FSIS did not request, and Foster Farms did not  conduct, a voluntary recall because the agency was unable to definitively  link the company\u2019s product to an ill person (see app. II). FSIS officials told  us that, rather than focusing on the lack of mandatory recall authority, it is  more productive to work aggressively with the tools they have.

For example, chicken meat sold as  parts, such as wings and breasts, was a small  component of the domestic U.S. market.  Chicken meat retailed as parts came about  largely as a consequence of the inspection  process at slaughter plants; that is, the  carcass of a whole raw chicken that failed  inspection would be cut to remove the part of  the whole bird that caused inspection failure.  The remainder of the bird was then further  broken down and marketed as chicken parts.  Market changes began to indicate to  processors that consumers preferred  particular chicken parts rather than whole  birds. To satisfy consumers, processors  began to break whole chickens into parts for  retail sale.

USDA  also stated that it is committed to decreasing the number of Salmonella  and Campylobacter illnesses associated with its regulated products,  including poultry products, and to using performance standards and  performance measures to achieve that reduction. Concerning the  agency\u2019s compliance guidelines on controlling Salmonella and  Campylobacter, USDA said that it is currently revising the guidelines to  address the reduction of Salmonella and Campylobacter in live poultry  and will include all available scientific information on the effectiveness of  each recommended farm practice to reduce Salmonella in live poultry.", "USDA also provided technical comments, as did the Department of  Health and Human Services, and we incorporated those comments as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Our  objectives for this report were to: (1) describe actions USDA has taken  since 2006 to reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination in  poultry products that it regulates; (2) evaluate USDA\u2019s efforts to assess  the effects of these actions on the incidence of human illnesses from  Salmonella and Campylobacter in poultry products; and (3) determine  what challenges, if any, USDA faces in reducing these pathogens in  poultry products.", "To describe actions USDA has taken since 2006 to reduce Salmonella  and Campylobacter contamination in poultry products that it regulates, we  reviewed USDA regulations and documentation on actions taken from  February 2006 to June 2014, including Federal Register notices, USDA\u2019s  Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) notices, directives, and the  December 2013 Salmonella Action Plan. We chose the time frame  because FSIS introduced several initiatives in 2006 to reduce Salmonella.  We also reviewed FSIS budget documents from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal  year 2015, including the agency\u2019s budget explanatory notes. It is not clear  how much FSIS has spent or will continue to spend on these actions  because our review of FSIS budget documents from fiscal year 2006 to  fiscal year 2015 found that the agency does not provide cost data on  specific poultry pathogen reduction actions, and the agency was unable  to provide such data other than $2.5 million spent on poultry-related  sampling programs. We interviewed officials at FSIS headquarters and  district offices about recent actions taken to directly address Salmonella  and Campylobacter contamination of poultry products including actions  identified in Federal Register notices.", "To evaluate USDA\u2019s efforts to assess the effects of actions taken on the  incidence of human illnesses from Salmonella and Campylobacter in  poultry products, we reviewed USDA and FSIS strategic plans, as well as  USDA annual performance reports to identify relevant performance  measures, targets, and goals. We also reviewed FSIS quarterly progress  reports on Salmonella and Campylobacter testing of poultry products. We  evaluated the source data, statistical methodology, and results of FSIS  research articles and a study to determine whether the conclusions drawn  on the effects of agency actions were adequately supported by the  evidence. We interviewed FSIS headquarters officials about the effects of  actions taken on the incidence of human illnesses from these pathogens.  We reviewed FSIS, Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC),  and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interagency group (Interagency  Food Safety Analytics Collaboration) documentation to describe the  purpose of the group, as well as completed and planned analytic projects.  We also interviewed FSIS and CDC officials about the group\u2019s projects to  improve food attribution data.", "To determine any challenges USDA faces to reduce Salmonella and  Campylobacter in poultry products it regulates, we reviewed FSIS, USDA  Office of Inspector General, and National Academy of Sciences reports  on FSIS\u2019s inspections and management challenges. We also interviewed  officials from USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS),USDA. Additionally, we conducted interviews with stakeholder groups.", "FSIS, and CDC to identify and describe any challenges facing  We conducted a two-stage interview process with industry, consumer,  and government employee stakeholder groups. We selected an initial set  of 12 stakeholder groups identified based on our previous experience with  large national groups with food safety and slaughter inspection  knowledge from our August 2013 report on poultry and hog inspections.", "These stakeholder groups were the American Meat Institute, the Center  for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention, the Center for Science in  the Public Interest, the Consumer Federation of American, Food and  Water Watch, the Government Accountability Project, the National  Association of Federal Veterinarians, the National Chicken Council, the  National Turkey Federation, the North American Meat Association and  the Pew Charitable Trusts. We conducted an initial interview with the  American Federation of Government Employees/National Joint Council of  Food Inspection Locals to identify potential challenges, but we were  unsuccessful in obtaining a subsequent structured interview. The sample  captures a broad range of major stakeholder groups but, because it is a  nongeneralizable sample, it is possible that this group did not include  opinions that some experts on the topic may have. During the first round,  we conducted exploratory interviews. We analyzed the results by  identifying common challenges. During the second round, we conducted  structured interviews using questions that covered the most common  potential challenges cited in the exploratory interviews.", "We list the five key structured interview questions we are reporting on that  stakeholders previously identified as challenges and potential challenges  during exploratory interviews. For questions listed below, respondents  had the following choices as responses: definitely yes, probably yes,  definitely no, probably no, or don\u2019t know. There were several questions  that would have required respondents to have in-depth information about  FSIS, such as details about the technology the agency uses for  identifying specific serotypes or specifics about how the agency would  implement actions from its Salmonella Action Plan. Lacking this  information, many respondents were only able to give us qualified  answers with caveats. Therefore, we concluded that these responses  were not standardized to be reported, and we excluded them from our  report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "List of Selected Structured Interview Questions", "paragraphs": ["FSIS sets performance standards for Salmonella and Campylobacter.

Do you think it is necessary for FSIS to declare some strains of  Salmonella, particularly strains more likely to cause severe illness, as  adulterants in order to meet its Salmonella public health goal?", "Currently, poultry plants decide whether Salmonella and  Campylobacter are hazards reasonably likely to occur in their  HACCP. Do you think this approach is adequate to keep  contamination at FSIS regulated plants within FSIS performance  standards?", "Verification Testing and Sampling  FSIS recently evaluated its pathogen sampling program and assessed  that it could not measure prevalence of Salmonella in poultry products  over time, in part because it does not conduct random sampling. Do  you think FSIS needs estimates of prevalence of Salmonella in poultry  products to set its Salmonella public health goal?", "Salmonella is known to be ubiquitous and persistent in the natural  environment. Do you think these traits make it difficult to control  Salmonella in poultry products FSIS regulates?", "To make sure that our results were presented in an accurate and  balanced manner, we evaluated responses in terms of the extent of  agreement among the three stakeholder groups. Where there was stark  disagreement among the groups, we presented the results separately.  Where there was general agreement, we reported overall results. We  conducted 11 structured phone interviews from March 2014 to May 2014.  We selected 4 of the 11 stakeholder groups and pretested the initial  structured interview questions to ensure that the questions were relevant  and clearly stated; based on those results, we made adjustments to the  structured interview as necessary. Apart from the stakeholder interviews,  we also spoke with two academic food safety researchers we identified  based on academic work and participation in a 2014 food safety  conference and discussed challenges related to controlling Salmonella  and Campylobacter in poultry products.", "Additionally, we reviewed five Salmonella and Campylobacter outbreaks  attributed to poultry products with the highest number of illnesses to  better understand any challenges that may have contributed to the  outbreaks; these outbreaks started during the time period from fiscal year  2011 through fiscal year 2013. The case study included four Salmonella  outbreaks from poultry products and one Campylobacter outbreak from  poultry products. These outbreaks are not generalizeable to all outbreaks  from Salmonella and Campylobacter contaminated poultry products. The  selected outbreaks provided illustrative examples of challenges USDA  faces. To describe the selected outbreaks, we interviewed state officials  from departments of health or agriculture from California, New York,  Texas, Vermont, and Washington. These states had the highest number  of illnesses for each outbreak in our review. We also interviewed CDC  officials with knowledge of the outbreaks and FSIS officials familiar with  each outbreak investigation to learn about any challenges USDA faced  and other challenges related to investigating outbreaks. We also reviewed  states\u2019, CDC, and FSIS documentation on each outbreak to describe  each outbreak.", "For our three objectives, we visited poultry plants in California to gain a  better understanding of poultry plant operations and FSIS inspection  activities. We chose California because the state has a number of small  and large chicken and turkey plants. California also produces a high  volume of chicken and turkey in the United States. We reviewed prior  GAO reports on food safety, surveillance systems, and performance  management.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to September 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, we also  identified one Campylobacter outbreak that occurred within the time  period established for those Salmonella outbreaks included in our review.

FSIS made the request after the agency and CDC  linked a person sickened by an outbreak strain of Salmonella  Heidelberg to chicken produced by that company and collected from  the ill person\u2019s home. According to FSIS officials, FSIS did not request  voluntary recalls during the other outbreaks for several reasons. First,  for two of the Salmonella outbreaks, the companies initiated voluntary  recalls before FSIS could make a formal request. Second, for the  remaining Salmonella outbreak, FSIS did not identify the level of  information necessary to request a voluntary recall. Finally, for the  Campylobacter outbreak, the company voluntarily elected to cease  harvesting and selling of raw chicken livers.", "During the five outbreaks, FSIS issued two public health alerts.", "Specifically, FSIS issued an alert for the outbreak of Salmonella linked  to ground turkey products and another for the outbreak of Salmonella  linked to specific brands of chicken products.", "FSIS found that each of the plants linked to three of the four  Salmonella outbreaks had inadequate Hazard Analysis and Critical  Control Point (HACCP) plans.", "FSIS found that each of the plants linked to three of the four  Salmonella outbreaks failed to maintain sanitary conditions and  comply with the agency\u2019s regulatory requirements for sanitation.", "FSIS determined that each of the plants linked to three of the four  Salmonella outbreaks had not adequately supported parts of their  hazard analyses because they did not identify Salmonella as a food  safety hazard reasonably likely to occur during certain production  processes.", "In response to the Campylobacter outbreak, FSIS conducted a food  safety assessment and found that the plant failed to correctly identify  Campylobacter as a pathogen of concern in its hazard analyses, a  noncompliance with FSIS regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "See comment 5", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) letter dated September 15, 2014.  1.  USDA commented that, throughout our report, we use the terms  \u201cmechanically separated\u201d and \u201cground\u201d when referring to poultry  products and that the agency prefers the term \u201ccomminuted\u201d and its  standard definition.

USDA commented that our use of data from the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) for describing the incidence of  Salmonella and Campylobacter is misleading and provides an  inaccurate assessment of the burden of Salmonella illnesses  specifically attributed to products regulated by USDA\u2019s Food Safety  and Inspection Service (FSIS). The purpose of these data in the  introduction is to provide general context for our review, not to provide  information on illnesses specifically attributed to FSIS-regulated  products, which are discussed later in the report. We modified our  report to note that CDC\u2019s data for describing the incidence of  Salmonella and Campylobacter include illnesses attributed to other  sources in addition to FSIS-regulated products.  3.  USDA commented that it agrees that there are limitations in the data  that it relies upon for measuring illness but stated that the agency  uses the best data that are available. We modified our report to state  that, according to USDA, the agency is using the best data available.  4.  We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and  Human Services, which includes CDC. We incorporated the agency\u2019s  technical comments as appropriate.  5.
