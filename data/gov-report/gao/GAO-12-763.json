SEC has also announced, on several occasions, new target dates for the publication of a final rule. In July 2012, SEC announced that the Commission will hold an open meeting in August 2012 to consider whether to adopt a final rule. According to SEC officials, various factors have caused delays in finalizing the rule beyond the April 2011 deadline stipulated in the act, including the intensity of input from stakeholders and the public; the amount of time required to review this input; and the need to conduct a thorough economic analysis for rule making.", "Various stakeholders have developed initiatives that may help covered companies comply with the anticipated rule, but some initiatives have been hindered by SEC\u0092s delay in issuing a final rule. Industry associations, multilateral organizations, and other stakeholders have developed global and in-region sourcing initiatives, which include the development of guidance documents, audit protocols, and in-region sourcing systems. These initiatives may support companies\u0092 efforts to conduct due diligence and to identify and responsibly source conflict minerals. In the absence of SEC\u0092s final rule, however, stakeholders note that uncertainty regarding SEC\u0092s reporting and due diligence requirements has complicated their efforts to expand and harmonize their initiatives.

Large numbers of civilians in war-torn areas of  the DRC have been the victims of horrific sexual violence, including rape,  mutilation, and sexual slavery carried out by armed groups. In addition, as  we previously reported, illegal armed groups, as well as some units of the  Congolese national military, have continued to commit severe human rights  abuses, including mass killings. The illegal armed groups and units of the  Congolese national military committing these atrocities also profit from the  illegal mining of minerals and the illicit taxation of other trades, such as  charcoal and timber. Citing the continuing urgency of the human rights  situation and the need to take action, in July 2010, Congress included in  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (hereafter in this report referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act, or the Act)  provisions pertaining to the trade of conflict minerals. The Act defines  conflict minerals as columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, wolframite, and  gold ores, or their derivatives. When these ores are processed they yield  the following metals used in industrial and other applications: tantalum, tin,  tungsten, and gold, respectively. Hereafter in this report, the term \u201cconflict  minerals\u201d will refer to either these ores or these metals. Section 1502(b) of  the Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a  conflict minerals disclosure rule (hereafter referred to as a rule) for  \u201cpersons\u201d (hereafter referred to as covered companies) that must file  reports with SEC to disclose whether necessary conflict minerals used in  their products originated in the DRC or in an adjoining country and, if they  did, to provide an additional report with certain disclosures.

Also, exporters may carry  out further processing or upgrading before exporting the materials to a  smelter or refiner. At the most basic level, smelting involves converting a  mineral into a metal and refining involves purifying a metal into a higher- purity metal. Although some smelters of tin, tantalum, and tungsten sell  high-purity metals through traders or exchanges, smelters primarily sell  high-purity tin, tantalum, and tungsten directly to component parts  manufacturers. Component parts manufacturers construct individual  parts\u2014such as capacitors, engine parts, clasps for necklaces, and other  items\u2014that they sell to original equipment manufacturers. Original  equipment manufacturers complete the final assembly of a product and  sell their products to consumers.", "The supply chain for industrially mined gold, which is the dominant form  of mining conducted outside of eastern DRC, is different. Industrially  mined gold is typically shipped from mine sites directly to refiners,  bypassing local traders and exporters. Gold refiners typically sell high- purity gold to banks, for use as a store of value, or to international  exchanges and traders, where gold is bought and sold. Banks and traders  may sell gold to manufacturers, including jewelry or electronics  component parts manufacturers and some gold refiners sell gold directly  to manufacturers.", "According to industry association and company representatives, in  practice, a company\u2019s supply chain for products containing tin, tantalum,  tungsten, and gold can be complex and can vary considerably. For  example, a company\u2019s conflict minerals supply chains may involve  several different entities taking different actions to help develop products  and move them through the supply chain.

Stakeholder-developed initiatives\u2014which  include the development of guidance documents, audit protocols, and in- region sourcing systems\u2014support covered companies\u2019 efforts to (1)  conduct due diligence of their conflict minerals supply chains, (2) identify  the source of conflict minerals within their supply chains, and (3)  responsibly source conflict minerals. Table 2 summarizes global and in- region sourcing initiatives developed by various stakeholders (see app. II  for more details about each of these initiatives).

The guidance establishes a five-step  framework for detailed, risk-based due diligence, which is intended to  promote accountability and transparency in the supply chain of minerals  from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. Covered companies may use  the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to identify appropriate due diligence  actions necessary for obtaining and disclosing conflict mineral sourcing  information in accordance with the anticipated SEC rule. The guidance  may also help U.S. and foreign suppliers put due diligence processes in  place, which may help them generate conflict mineral sourcing  information for those of their customers that are covered companies.", "Other global initiatives may support covered companies\u2019 efforts to identify  the source of conflict minerals. For example, the Conflict-Free Smelter  Program and the LBMA Responsible Gold Guidance are initiatives  designed to ensure that no minerals in the smelter or refiner supply chains  have contributed to conflict through an independent audit process, and  ultimately, the aim of these programs is to enable downstream companies  to source conflict-free minerals. According to company and industry  association representatives, the smelter or refiner represents the \u201cchoke- point\u201d in the conflict minerals supply chain\u2014meaning that after minerals are  processed by the smelter or refiner, the origin of these minerals cannot be  verified. According to GeSI, EICC, and LBMA representatives, companies  that can trace their conflict minerals supply chains back to smelters or  refiners certified through these programs can claim that the minerals in  their products are conflict-free, which may help covered companies and  their suppliers comply with the anticipated rule.", "Finally, in-region sourcing initiatives that rely on chain-of-custody systems  may help covered companies responsibly source conflict minerals from  Central Africa. For example, to support the responsible sourcing of tin,  tantalum, and tungsten from Central Africa, ITRI, a tin industry association,  developed the ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi). The initiative is  currently operating in Katanga\u2014a province in southern DRC\u2014and  Rwanda, and through iTSCi ITRI and its partners created a physical chain- of-custody system for tracking and monitoring minerals from the mine to the  smelter. Figure 5 shows the particular segments of the conflict minerals  supply chains that specific stakeholder-developed initiatives support to  ensure that the minerals are conflict-free (see app. II for more details  concerning each initiative). According to ITRI and NGO representatives,  iTSCi is a traceability and due diligence program that creates auditable and  verifiable chains of custody for tin, tantalum, and tungsten through the (1)  tagging of bagged materials and the collection of tagging data and (2)  regular incident reporting and the continuous monitoring of mines and  companies participating in the program. iTSCi\u2019s traceability and due  diligence program results in mineral chain-of-custody information that  covered companies and their suppliers may use to meet due diligence  requirements; smelters may also use the information in their efforts to  comply with the Conflict-Free Smelter Program.", "Some stakeholders\u2019 efforts to improve their initiatives through expansion  and harmonization have been hindered by the uncertainty regarding  potential due diligence and disclosure requirements stemming from  SEC\u2019s delay in issuing a final rule. For example, while 12 of the  approximately 25 tantalum smelting companies world-wide have been  certified as conflict-free through the Conflict-Free Smelter Program to  date (see fig. 6), company representatives said GeSI and the EICC are  facing challenges engaging tin and tungsten smelters in the absence of a  final rule.", "According to company representatives, GeSI and EICC representatives  are finding it difficult to convince Asian\u2014particularly Chinese\u2014smelters to  participate in the program because the electronics industry has limited  leverage over Chinese smelters in the absence of a final SEC rule. In  addition, according to one EICC member company representative,  Chinese smelters and the Chinese government are not concerned with  improving the transparency of supply chains in the absence of any  business incentives. The limited participation by Chinese smelters may  affect the scalability of the Conflict-Free Smelter Program as Chinese  smelters processed an estimated 43 to 48 percent of the global tin supply  between 2006 and 2009, and Chinese companies mined and processed  an estimated 77 to 84 percent of the global tungsten supply between  2006 and 2009. To address this issue, GeSI and the EICC are working  with representatives from other industries that use more tin and tungsten  to expand GeSI and the EICC\u2019s leverage over and outreach efforts to tin  and tungsten smelters. In addition, according to company  representatives, the issuance of SEC\u2019s final rule may provide business  incentives to Chinese smelters. Specifically, the issuance of a final SEC  rule may result in covered companies\u2019 widespread demand for conflict  mineral sourcing information from their suppliers, and the leverage  applied by all impacted covered companies may create the necessary  business incentives for Chinese and other foreign companies to  participate in initiatives such as the Conflict-Free Smelter Program.", "Some stakeholders have discussed efforts to harmonize their initiatives to  further improve them, but some of these efforts have been hindered by the  absence of SEC\u2019s final rule. For example, according to an industry  association representative, iTSCi may experience difficulty attracting  additional customers, such as smelters, and expanding the initiative until  it is successfully harmonized with the Conflict-Free Smelter Program.  Although GeSI, EICC, and ITRI representatives said their organizations  are working together to harmonize the documentation and audit systems  for the Conflict-Free Smelter Program and iTSCi, the absence of a final  rule has hindered discussions to harmonize the two initiatives. As of June  2012, only one smelter purchased tin through the program, four smelters  purchased tantalum, and no smelters purchased tungsten. While ITRI and  its partners intend to expand iTSCi into eastern DRC, without additional  customers and the resulting funding from customers, it may be  challenging to implement this expansion. In addition, according to an  industry association representative, the unstable security situation in  eastern DRC contributes to ITRI and its partners\u2019 delay in expanding  iTSCi to the region.Smelter Program are allowed to accept conflict-free minerals from the  DRC, an ITRI representative said that some smelters have been unwilling  to purchase minerals through iTSCi\u2019s traceability and due diligence  program, because the initiative has not been harmonized with the  Conflict-Free Smelter Program. iTSCi is closely aligned with the OECD  Due Diligence Guidance and supports continuous trading and the  implementation of risk mitigation efforts when certain risks at a supplier\u2019s  mine site are identified through the program. However, the Conflict-Free  Smelter Program may require smelters to disengage from that supplier if  the same risks are identified at the mine site, because according to GeSI  and EICC representatives, the program\u2019s requirements were developed to  be consistent with section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

One  representative from the OECD Secretariat opined that, although this is  still a nascent effort, SAVE ACT MINE/DRC represents a significant  development because the private sector in the DRC has begun to  recognize that they are responsible for their supply chains and should  take ownership over the implementation of international standards. In  addition, some original equipment manufacturers participating in the  project are putting pressure on other companies within their own conflict  minerals supply chains to implement due diligence standards through  contractual clauses, which will support the companies\u2019 efforts to collect  sourcing information from suppliers.", "United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution 1896 (2009) called on  UNGoE to provide recommendations for due diligence guidelines for  importers, processors, and consumers of minerals originating from the  DRC.

In  December 2010, the first tantalum smelter was certified conflict-free  through the program after successfully completing an audit, and as of July  2012, 12 of approximately 25 tantalum smelting companies had been  certified as conflict-free. As of July 2012, two tin smelting companies had  been certified as conflict-free, five tungsten smelting companies had  begun discussions with representatives of the program, and five gold  refining companies had been certified as conflict-free through the  program.", "Representing top gold mining companies, the World Gold Council (WGC)  is developing a global initiative to help support gold mining companies in  their efforts to responsibly mine gold worldwide. For this initiative, WGC is  creating the Conflict-Free Gold Standard, an assurance framework, and a  toolkit, with the input from mining companies, refiners, and other relevant  stakeholders. The Conflict-Free Gold Standard establishes a common  approach for gold mining companies to demonstrate that the gold they  extract does not fuel conflict or human rights abuses. The standard is  aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, and covers the industrial mining supply chain from the mine to the refiner. However, the  standard does not cover gold from recycled sources or gold mined by  artisanal miners. WGC is also developing an assurance framework, which  can be used by third-party auditors to monitor mining companies\u2019  compliance with the standard, and tools to support mining companies  through the audit process. According to WGC representatives, WGC  plans to release the final standard, the assurance framework, and other  tools before the end of 2012. Although the standard only covers gold  mining companies, it may support certification programs at the refiner  level. For example, according to gold industry representatives, the  standard was developed with input from the London Bullion Market  Association (LBMA), and it will support the efforts of those refiners  purchasing gold from mining companies in compliance with the WGC  Conflict-Free Gold Standard to comply with the LBMA Responsible Gold  Guidance.", "Distinct from WGC, whose standard covers the gold supply chain from  mine to refiner, the LBMA has developed its own Responsible Gold  Guidance to ensure that the gold refiners it accredits only purchase  conflict-free gold. In January 2012, LBMA finalized and published its  guidance, which is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, and  plans to develop and finalize audit protocols and other tools for use with  the standard by July 2012. According to an LBMA representative, by  December 2013 LBMA gold refiners will need to comply with the LBMA  guidance and pass a third-party audit verifying their compliance to  maintain their accreditation. Similar to the Conflict-Free Smelter Program,  the goal of the LBMA initiative is to enable companies to say that the gold  in their products is conflict-free if they can trace their gold supply chains  to an LBMA accredited gold refiner (see fig. 7).

First, certification under RJC\u2019s program is voluntary and  companies may determine which parts of their business and which  materials they want to certify. Second, companies certified under RJC\u2019s  program are not prevented from sourcing from mining entities outside the  program; gold purchased from a mine outside the program simply has to  be segregated from gold from certified suppliers.

For example, ITRI representatives reported a number of  problems with the iTSCi system, including duplicate tags, tags appearing  in the wrong places, and bag weights increasing between check points in  the supply chain. ITRI began addressing these concerns in 2011 through  the development of an incident reporting template that staff are using to  record and report incidents. According to an iTSCi document, the new  protocol will ensure a timely and consistent identification and response to  incidents. According to an iTSCi report, incidents have been reported, but  at a low frequency in comparison to the amount of material bagged and  tagged.", "According to BGR representatives, since 2008 the German government\u2019s  Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) and its  partners have helped build capacity within the DRC and Rwandan  governments through several initiatives, including a certified trading  chains program and the development of a national certification and  traceability system. BGR and its partners have developed and piloted the  certified trading chains program in eastern DRC and Rwanda to help the  governments formalize the artisanal mining sectors (see fig. 8). BGR and  its partners work with the host government and other stakeholders to  develop standards by which mines are independently assessed, and the  organization provides technical support for the host government to  implement the program. According to BGR representatives, BGR and its  partners are currently conducting a pilot program for the certification of  four mine sites in South Kivu, in eastern DRC. In Rwanda, three of the  five mine sites audited between November 2008 and June 2011 have  been certified through the program.

As part of the governments\u2019 efforts to  develop the system, BGR and its partners are working with  representatives from the DRC government and others to inspect mine  sites in eastern DRC. Specifically, the mine site validation missions are  joint missions supported by BGR and include representatives from the  local and national governments, civil society, industry, the United Nations  Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo (MONUSCO), and ITRI. According to BGR officials, the goal is to  regularly monitor the security situation at the mine sites, as part of the  government\u2019s efforts to map mining sites and armed group locations. In  June 2011 and August 2011, the mine site validation teams conducted  some mine site qualification reviews; however, the DRC government  published the results of the mine site qualification reviews over 8 months  after the mine site validation missions occurred, limiting the public\u2019s  access to timely information concerning the security situation at the  mines.", "According to BGR officials, BGR and its partners\u2019 in-region sourcing  initiatives provide companies that purchase minerals through the program  with assurances that artisanal miners participating in the initiative produce  and trade minerals in accordance with accepted standards. BGR and its  partners provide these assurances by certifying mine sites and helping to  build the capacity of Congolese and Rwandan government officials. In  addition, the maps being developed by the DRC government, in  conjunction with BGR and other groups, may serve as a tool for  companies to determine the conflict status of a mine site when conducting  due diligence.", "With technical support from several NGO partners, ICGLR designed a  regional chain-of-custody tracking system and standards to ensure that  conflict minerals are fully traceable from the mine site to the point of  export; however, the implementation of the system is only in the nascent  stages and is dependent on the actions of the participating national  governments. In December 2006, the heads of the 11 African states that  form the ICGLR signed the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in  the Great Lakes Region, which included the Protocol Against the Illegal  Exploitation of Natural Resources. In accordance with the protocol,  ICGLR member states agreed to put in place regional rules and  monitoring mechanisms for combating the illegal exploitation of natural  resources. To curb the financing of rebel groups through the illegal  exploitation of natural resources, ICGLR developed and approved six  tools for implementation in the Great Lakes Region. ICGLR worked with  Partnership Africa Canada to develop one of the tools, a regional  certification mechanism, which was approved by the ICGLR member  states in December 2010. ICGLR\u2019s regional certification mechanism may  enable member countries and their mining companies to demonstrate  where and under what conditions minerals were produced; through the  regional certification mechanism, individual member governments are to  issue ICGLR regional certificates for those mineral shipments that are in  compliance with the standards of the mechanism.", "Several partners support ICGLR and member countries\u2019 efforts to  implement the mechanism.

According to an ICGLR representative, a report by  GeSI and the EICC, and a report by the International Peace Information  Service, the DRC government incorporated the ICGLR Regional  Certification Manual into the national legal framework in February 2012,  and Rwanda is expected to adopt similar legislation shortly. BGR\u2019s and  ITRI\u2019s initiatives support the implementation of the regional certification  mechanism at the national level, because all activities undertaken through  these initiatives are incorporated into the DRC and Rwandan national  efforts to develop national certification and traceability systems.
