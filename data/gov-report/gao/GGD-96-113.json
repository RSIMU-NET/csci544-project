Every commemorative coin program is authorized by an act of Congress. Congress authorizes commemorative coins as a means of honoring certain events and individuals and to raise funds for the coins\u2019 sponsors and on occasion apply the proceeds from commemorative coin sales to the national debt. Authorizing legislation for commemorative coin programs earmarked for 1982 through 1995 states that the Mint shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the issuance of coins shall result in no net cost to the government. Although commemorative coins are legal tender at their face value, they are not used as a medium of exchange, but are purchased and retained by collectors. According to the Mint, over 90 percent of commemorative coins are bought by coin collectors.", "Commemorative coins are manufactured at the Mint\u2019s facilities in San Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Philadelphia, PA; and West Point, NY. They typically are manufactured in half-dollar, 1-dollar, 5-dollar, and 10-dollar denominations and are produced as clad materials, silver, and gold. The coins are sold mainly though the Mint\u2019s mail-order service, but some are also sold through retail outlets.", "Congress also authorizes the Mint to manufacture medals to honor historical events or individuals. In contrast to commemorative coins, medals are not legal tender.", "For 19 of the 22 commemorative coin programs for 1982 through 1995, Congress directed that a portion of the coins\u2019 sales proceeds, namely the surcharges that were specific amounts added to the price of coins, be paid to the sponsoring organizations. For four programs, Congress directed that the surcharges be applied to reducing the national debt. The sponsors were paid the surcharges regardless of whether the program was profitable to the Mint, and the sponsors did not pay for any of the Mint\u2019s costs associated with producing and selling the coins. Surcharges for the 1995 commemorative coins ranged from $2 to $3 for half-dollar coins, $7 to $10 for 1-dollar coins, and $35 to $50 for 5-dollar coins."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Perspective", "paragraphs": ["In 1892, Congress approved legislation authorizing the first commemorative coin, which commemorated the Columbian Exposition. Congress authorized 157 commemorative coins that were issued from 1892 through 1954. Until 1954, commemorative coins were sold to sponsoring organizations, who then resold them to the public at higher prices as a means of fundraising. Over the years, the program experienced several problems, including the congressional authorization of more commemorative coins than the market could absorb, the sponsors\u2019 charging of prices substantially above the coins\u2019 face value, and the commemoration of events of local or minor significance.", "During this period, Presidents Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman expressed disapproval over the use of commemorative coins. In 1930, President Hoover said that selling commemorative coins for a profit and as a means to provide funding for celebrations was a misuse of the coinage system, and because the coins did not circulate, they did not serve the real function of coins. Similarly, in 1935, President Roosevelt said that \u201cstriking special coins in commemoration of historical events and permitting the sponsoring organizations to sell them at a profit is a misuse of our coinage system, which is assuming increasingly dangerous proportions.\u201d In 1937, President Roosevelt expressed concern about the \u201calarming increase\u201d in the demand for commemorative coin legislation, indicating that many of the coins had no more than local significance. In 1947, President Truman vetoed legislation authorizing coins commemorating the state of Wisconsin\u2019s entry into the Union, saying that if the legislation were approved, it was not apparent on what grounds similar measures, no matter how numerous, could be rejected. According to the Mint, because of these concerns, no commemorative coins were authorized for 1955 through 1981.", "In late 1981, Congress reactivated the commemorative coin program by authorizing the George Washington commemorative coin. In authorizing this program, Congress acted in response to support expressed by coin collectors for issuing commemorative coins with popular themes and required that the profits from the sales of the George Washington coin be applied to the national debt. Commemorative coin programs beginning in 1982 were restructured so that the Mint sold the coins directly to the public, rather than through the sponsors. Starting in 1984, Congress authorized a commemorative coin sponsor to receive surcharges on coin prices. Congress has authorized an additional six commemorative coin programs from 1996 through 2002 and authorized that all surcharges be provided to the sponsors.", "Dissatisfaction with the commemorative coin program has prompted some coin collectors to advocate a boycott on purchasing the coins. One collector who is advocating the boycott said that a call for a boycott began in the late 1980s, when some coin collectors became dissatisfied with the themes selected and high prices.", "In 1992, Congress expressed concern over the proliferation of commemorative coins and authorized the establishment of the Citizens\u2019 Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee (CCCAC) to make annual recommendations to Congress on commemorative coin themes and designs, with the objective of reducing the proliferation of commemorative coins.", "In addition, Congress passed a resolution in December 1993 indicating that the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs (now House Committee on Banking and Financial Affairs) and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs should not approve more than two commemorative coin programs per year unless they determined, on the basis of the CCCAC\u2019s recommendations, that \u201cextraordinary merit\u201d existed for an additional commemorative coin program, without defining \u201cextraordinary merit.\u201d The law containing that resolution authorized three new commemorative coin programs for 1994.", "In August 1994, Treasury Secretary Bentsen wrote the Chairmen of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Banking Subcommittee on Consumer Credit and Insurance, asking for a moratorium on the authorization of any additional commemorative coins until the CCCAC issued its recommendations. According to the Mint, Secretary Bentsen called for the moratorium because five new commemorative coin programs were included in a conference report of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act bill, which was enacted in September 1994.", "A more detailed historical perspective on commemorative coins is provided in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In July 1995, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee asked us to review the U.S. Mint\u2019s commemorative coin program.

The Chairman asked us to (1) report on how much the sponsors and the government have lost and gained from the program in recent years, and (2) determine what options are available to ensure that the commemorative coin program does not result in a loss to the government and what specific mechanisms would be effective in controlling the proliferation of programs.", "To address both of these issues, we first reviewed the legislative history of the commemorative coin program since its inception in 1892. We focused on commemorative coins that were issued since 1982. We obtained and analyzed information from the Mint on the themes, denominations, prices, surcharges, number of coins authorized, number of coins sold, profits and losses to the government, surcharges paid to sponsoring organizations, and marketing efforts. In addition, we interviewed officials involved in the commemorative coin program at the Mint, including the Mint\u2019s Director, Deputy Director, Deputy Chief Counsel, Marketing Director, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and accounting officials.", "To review the workings and recommendations of CCCAC, we reviewed CCCAC reports and committee meeting minutes and interviewed two committee members, including its chairman, who is also the Director of the U.S. Mint. We also compared the programs that CCCAC recommended to ones that Congress authorized and the number of commemorative coin programs authorized since CCCAC was established. In addition, we interviewed the program officer for the Citizens\u2019 Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) about the workings of CSAC. We compared and contrasted the two committees\u2019 operating procedures and the commemorative coin and stamp selection criteria. We did not evaluate the profitability of the commemorative stamp program.", "We obtained the numismatic community\u2019s views about reforming the commemorative coin program by interviewing officials from the American Numismatic Association (ANA), which is the world\u2019s largest numismatic organization, with 26,000 members. We also interviewed an advocate of a recent boycott of commemorative coins and reviewed the numismatic trade press. We also attended hearings held in July 1995 by the House Banking Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy regarding the commemorative coin program and reviewed witnesses\u2019 testimony. Witnesses who testified at this hearing included the CCCAC Chairman, the ANA President, the editor of a numismatic publication, and a New York coin dealer. We also reviewed a survey that ANA conducted in July 1993 of its members\u2019 views concerning commemorative coins.", "At our request, the Royal Canadian Mint provided us with information about its circulating commemorative coin program, including the number of circulating commemorative coins produced.", "The U.S. Mint also provided data on its 1976 circulating commemorative coins, including the number minted and production costs. For comparison purposes, at our request, the Mint also provided circulating coin production data from 1971 through 1981.", "We also toured the Mint\u2019s facility in Philadelphia, PA, one of the Mint\u2019s facilities where commemorative coins are designed and made.", "To estimate seigniorage on a circulating commemorative quarter, we subtracted the cost of producing a quarter in 1995 ($.036) from the coin\u2019s face value ($.25), and multiplied this difference ($.214) by the number of quarters produced in 1995 (2,100,000,000), plus an expected volume increase of 50 percent, which equaled $224,700,000. We estimated the 50 percent volume increase on the basis of the U.S. experience with the 1976 Bicentennial quarter production and recent Canadian experience with circulating commemorative coins.", "During the course of our review, we raised issues relating to the Mint\u2019s cost accounting system. We reviewed a report issued in June 1995 by the Treasury Department Inspector General\u2019s Office indicating that the Mint\u2019s fund structure was inadequate and fragmented (see ch. 2).

The Mint provided information regarding the 1993 World War II commemorative coin program, which consisted of clad, silver, and gold coins. As shown in figures 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, the surcharges ranged from 19 to 30 percent of the pre-issue prices, marketing costs ranged from 13 to 25 percent, and packaging costs ranged from 3 to 26 percent for these coins. The combination of surcharges, marketing, and packaging represented 73 percent of the clad coin\u2019s price, 64 percent of the silver coin\u2019s price, and 35 percent of the gold coin\u2019s price. Metal costs were about 1 percent of the clad coin price, 12 percent of the silver coin price, and 45 percent of the gold coin price.", "The ratio of price to face value was 18 to 1 for the clad coin, 27 to 1 for the silver coin, and 37 to 1 for the gold coin.

Similarly, the Mint Director, who approves commemorative coin prices, said the surcharges are making the coins too expensive. He added that commemorative coin prices are determined largely through the authorizing legislation, which specifies the amount of the surcharges.", "ANA officials said they favored eliminating the surcharges. They said that while the average coin collector spends $2,500 per year on coin collecting, it now costs about $3,500 to purchase all commemorative coins offered each year. The officials added that commemorative coin prices are too high to allow typical collectors to afford them.

Moreover, he said that the Mint often has very little time to conduct market research before a commemorative coin program is launched, sometimes only a month or two. The Marketing Director said that it would be helpful if the commemorative coin program operated under a 5-year plan, which would help give the program some continuity.", "From 1982 to 1989, average sales revenues were $186 million per program, compared to $32.8 million per program from 1990 to 1995. Several contributing factors could account for higher sales revenues for some programs during the 1980s, compared to the 1990s, including the types of themes and the number of competing coins on the market. From 1982 through 1995, the two programs with the highest sales revenues had themes with broad appeal to the commemorative coin market, such as the Olympic Games and the Centennial of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and occurred during years when no competing commemorative coin programs were started. By contrast, the two programs with the least sales revenues\u2014the Special Olympics and the United Service Organization coins\u2014had competition from at least one other commemorative coin on the market, and the themes of those programs had seemingly narrower appeal to the commemorative coin market.", "In June 1993, ANA conducted a survey of its members on their level of satisfaction with commemorative coin themes and the number of programs. The survey indicated that 50 percent of the respondents were somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with commemorative coin theme selections, compared to 35 percent who were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied. Fifteen percent had no opinion or did not respond to the question. With regard to the number of programs, the survey indicated that 33 percent said commemorative coins should be issued every few years, 30 percent said that one or two coins should be issued each year, 19 percent said that more than two coins should be issued every year, 5 percent said that commemorative coins should not be issued, and 15 percent had no opinion or did not respond to the question.", "The Mint, rather than the sponsors, pays all of the marketing costs of commemorative coins. Outside contractors assist the Mint with the technical and creative aspects of advertising and direct mail. The Mint\u2019s primary marketing tool is direct mail, and it has about 1 million people on its mailing lists. It also advertises in numismatic and specialized publications and uses telemarketing, international marketing, and bulk and retail sales to market the coins.

However, from 1990 through 1995, the Mint realized an average profit of $3.3 million per program, including losses totaling $4.9 million for four closed programs from 1994 to 1995.", "Because the sponsors do not bear any of the costs associated with the production and selling of coins, sponsors received millions of dollars in recent years, while the Mint paid for all production and marketing costs and incurred financial risk on those programs. Mint officials said that if a coin program is too small, start-up costs could absorb all of the revenues, resulting in no profits.", "For 1994, the Mint reported losing $4.1 million on the World Cup program, which is now closed to further sales, while the sponsor received $9.3 million. Also for 1994, the Mint reported losing $100,000 on the Capitol program, while the sponsor received $5.2 million. In 1995, the Mint had three commemorative coin programs, two of which are closed to further sales (Special Olympics and Civil War). For the Special Olympics program, the Mint reported that it lost $300,000 as of September 30, 1995, while the sponsor received $4.4 million as of March 31, 1996. For the Civil War program, as of March 31, 1996, the Mint reported that it lost $400,000, while the sponsor received $6 million. The third 1995 program is a 2-year program commemorating the 1996 Olympics. As of March 31, 1996, the Mint reported a loss of $3.2 million for the 1996 Olympic program, while the sponsor had received $18 million. The Mint attributed the loss to high start-up costs incurred in 1995, which it expected to recover from 1996 sales stimulated by the Olympic summer games in Atlanta, GA, which will end in August 1996.", "In its June 21, 1996, comments on a draft of this report, the Mint indicated that at that time the 1996 Olympic program showed a $2.7 million loss and had absorbed $14 million in fixed overhead for the Mint, generated $13.8 million in revenues for the Treasury from the sales of gold and silver from the nation\u2019s stockpiles, and generated $25 million in surcharges for the 1996 Olympics. The Mint also indicated that the revenue figures included cash-in-hand receipts and excluded $28 million in sales of Olympic coins for which it had contracts.

Recent losses on some programs have been offset by profits on others, but such losses have reduced funds available for transfer from PEF to the Treasury. If the Mint experiences losses on programs that are not offset by profits on others and the fund is depleted, the Mint would have to ask Congress for an appropriation to cover the loss or authority to borrow funds from the Treasury.", "While the Mint experienced losses on some programs, the sales benefited the government through the receipt of surcharges to the Treasury designated for debt reduction. For example, while the 1990 Eisenhower coin showed a $1.1 million loss to the Mint, the Treasury benefited from $9.7 million that was received in surcharges. Similarly, the 1991 United Service Organization program broke even for the Mint, but the Treasury received $1.6 million in surcharges.", "In addition to the surcharges applied against the national debt, the Mint believes that the commemorative coin program also benefits the government in other ways. During July 1995 testimony before the House Banking Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, the Mint Director said that PEF and ultimately the U.S. Treasury benefited from commemorative coin programs that showed a loss because they helped cover the overhead expenses of other Mint programs. For example, the 1994 World Cup program lost $4.1 million. However, the Mint reported that if there had been no World Cup program, $6.1 million in the Mint\u2019s overhead expenses would have been borne by other Mint programs, such as circulating coins.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Mint estimated that since 1982, commemorative coin programs have resulted in the absorption of $180 million in overhead costs. We asked the Mint how its overhead expenses are allocated and whether commemorative coin programs cause additional overhead costs. The Mint indicated that commemorative coin programs do generate some overhead costs that would otherwise be avoided if the programs were not undertaken. However, the Mint believes that commemorative coin programs absorb more overhead expenses than they generate, but it was not able to quantify the amount generated by the commemorative programs.", "Further, the Mint indicated in its comments on a draft of this report that since 1982, the sale of clad commemorative coins generated an additional $6 million in seigniorage. This represents an average seigniorage of about $273,000 per program for the 22 commemorative coin programs from 1982 to 1995. Starting in 1996, the Mint is no longer recording seigniorage from commemorative coins because the Mint\u2019s new revolving fund does not recognize seigniorage, according to a Mint official.", "The Mint in its comments also indicated that commemorative coin programs have generated $157 million in proceeds from the sale of silver from the nation\u2019s stockpiles over the past decade and $375 million in revenue from the sale of gold since 1984.", "The Mint indicated that despite the controversy associated with the practice of adding surcharges to the price of commemorative coins, considerable good has come from the funds raised for philanthropic purposes, including providing support for training U.S. Olympic hopefuls, to preserve national landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, and for a visitors center at the U.S. Capitol.", "In June 1995, a Treasury Department Inspector General report on the Mint\u2019s fiscal year 1994 financial statement indicated that the Mint had an inadequate and fragmented fund structure, including weaknesses in the cost accounting system for numismatic programs. As a result, the report stated, \u201cthe risk that controls will not detect potential misstatements is greatly increased, accounting was complicated, and the Mint\u2019s true operating cost could be understated.\u201d Although our review was not designed to verify the accuracy of the Mint\u2019s cost accounting system, we asked Mint officials about the status of the agency\u2019s efforts to resolve the problems cited by the Inspector General. A Mint official said that problems associated with a fragmented fund structure were resolved when legislation was enacted in November 1995 amending the revolving fund statute to include receipts and expenditures of circulating coins.

If adopted, these recommendations could help reduce the number of commemorative coins and prevent the payment of surcharges to sponsors while the Mint lost money.

He said that demand for new programs has increased as more organizations have discovered that coin programs produce revenues more quickly and reliably than the congressional appropriations process. The Director added that as long as funds for private purposes are raised through commemorative coin programs and their approval remains with Congress, the risk of continued proliferation remains high regardless of any reform measures adopted.

Under CCCAC\u2019s recommendation, the Secretary of the Treasury would select the denomination, when to issue the coin, and its design. Congress has not adopted this recommendation.

We estimated seigniorage by subtracting the cost of producing a quarter in 1995 ($.036) from the coin\u2019s face value ($.25). We then calculated the additional seigniorage by multiplying the number of quarters produced in 1995 (2,100,000,000) by the volume increase (.50), times the seigniorage on each quarter ($.214), which equals $224,700,000.", "A 50-percent increase in the production of quarters would appear to be a conservative estimate, based on the experience involving the production of Bicentennial circulating commemorative quarters issued in the United States in 1976, which was 83 percent higher than the average quarter production of the previous 5 years and the subsequent 5 years. Further, our 50-percent estimate of increased production is considerably less than the 156-percent increase in quarter production that Canada experienced when it issued a commemorative quarter in 1992, compared to the average of the previous 5 years.", "A circulating commemorative quarter, as opposed to other denominations, may generate the most savings because quarters are the most widely circulated coins; are the largest size of the widely circulating coins and could thus better accommodate a commemorative design on the reverse side; and would be likely to generate the most seigniorage and, thus, interest savings. Although seigniorage itself has no impact on the size of the current budget deficit under budget rules, it does substitute for borrowing from the public and thus lowers interest costs to the government. At current 30-year annual borrowing rates of about 7 percent, generating $225 million in seigniorage would reduce interest costs by about $16 million annually.", "In recent history, the U.S. Mint has not attempted to issue commemorative coins that would circulate over several consecutive years.

However, instead of using proceeds for debt reduction, the primary intent of most of the recent programs has been to raise funds for coin program sponsors.", "To help minimize the potential for future losses, Congress could guard against (1) the selection of themes that are unlikely to have broad appeal to the commemorative coin market, (2) the production of more commemorative coins than the market can absorb, (3) higher prices than the market can bear, and (4) the payment of surcharges to sponsors when the government is losing money. CCCAC\u2019s recommendations to reform the commemorative program appear to address some of these issues. For example, limiting the number of programs and coins to be minted could help reduce the number of coins offered. In addition, authorizing the Mint to implement a profit-sharing arrangement between the Mint and sponsors could prevent the payment of surcharges to sponsors when the government is losing money.", "However, even if these recommendations were adopted, they would not ensure that commemorative coin themes and prices would be determined on the basis of market research. We believe that to be successful, commemorative coin prices need to be at levels that make them attractive to coin collectors and have themes that are selected on the basis of market research. The costs of such research would have to be considered as well as the benefits.

A circulating coin program would lower commemorative coin prices by removing the surcharges, marketing, and packaging costs. It also has the potential to generate $225 million per year in seigniorage. If this recommendation were implemented, a circulating commemorative quarter, as opposed to other denominations, might be the best coin to use because quarters are the most widely circulated coins, are the largest size of the widely circulating coins and could thus better accommodate a commemorative design on the reverse side, and would be likely to generate the most seigniorage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress may want to further consider its intent regarding the commemorative coin program\u2014specifically in terms of whether it wants the program to serve as a means of providing funds to the coins\u2019 sponsors, or reducing the national debt, or both.", "For those situations where Congress wants the commemorative coin program to be used as a means of supporting a sponsoring group, it could consider reforming the program by making changes aimed at reducing proliferation and preventing losses, such as limiting the number of programs to one per year, restricting maximum authorized mintage levels, requiring that the selection of themes be based on market research, implementing a profit-sharing arrangement between the Mint and the sponsors, requiring that all of the Mint\u2019s costs be recovered before the sponsors receive financial benefits, and requiring that the prices of commemorative coins be set at levels where the market research indicates the greatest potential for sales.", "If Congress would like to increase government profitability on all commemorative coins or for those situations where it would like to apply the proceeds of a commemorative coin program to debt reduction, it could authorize a circulating commemorative coin program.

By contrast, during the 1990s, the Mint has sold an average of 2.8 million coins per year.", "The Mint also noted what it believed to be an implication in the report that Congress ignored a call by the Secretary of the Treasury in August 1994 for a moratorium on the authorization of any additional commemorative coin programs until CCCAC issued its recommendations by authorizing five additional programs the following month. According to the Mint, the Treasury Secretary called for the moratorium because these five programs were already included in the conference report of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act bill. We added this information on page 16.", "The Mint also indicated that CCCAC played an instrumental role in restraining the proliferation of commemorative coin programs by requesting a moratorium on additional programs in a letter to the House and Senate Banking Committees in August 1994. As evidence, the Mint stated that since that time, only one commemorative coin program, which was recommended by CCCAC, has been passed by Congress. While CCCAC may have played a role in persuading Congress to not pass more than one commemorative coin program since August 1994, we note that other contributing factors could also have been involved. For example, during the 104th Congress, the House Banking and Financial Services Committee adopted a new rule requiring that before hearings may be held on proposed commemorative coin legislation, the bill must be cosponsored by at least two-thirds of the House of Representatives, and it must be recommended by CCCAC. Similarly, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee adopted a new rule requiring that at least two-fifths of the Senate cosponsor any commemorative coin legislation before it will be considered. In addition, Senate Banking Committee staff indicated to us that the Committee did not consider any commemorative coin legislation in 1996 pending receipt of this report.", "The Mint also expressed concern over the draft report\u2019s statement that as of May 1996, Congress had adopted only 1 of the 11 themes that CCCAC recommended for 1995 through 2002. According to the Mint, this statement could be read to suggest that CCCAC was not being effective in its advisory role to Congress and that themes other than those recommended by CCCAC have been adopted by Congress. We added to p. 36 that, according to the Mint, the fact that the Smithsonian coin program has been the only commemorative coin bill to be enacted since the moratorium request in August 1994 demonstrates that CCCAC is now being heard by Congress, considering that CCCAC stated in its two reports to Congress that the Committee\u2019s first priority was to restrain the proliferation of commemorative coin programs.", "The Mint also asked us to consider including reducing the authorized mintage levels, rather than the number of programs per year, as a reform option. We included reducing mintage levels as an additional reform option, but believe it should be coupled with a limit on the number of programs per year. When we stated that prices of commemorative coins should be set at levels where market research indicates the highest sales potential, we were suggesting that authorized mintages be set at reasonable levels. Even if mintage levels for numerous commemorative coin programs were low, coin collectors may not be able to afford to purchase coins offered from multiple programs. As discussed on p. 35, past history shows that the programs that sold the most coins did not compete with any other concurrent programs. Thus, we believe that to be most effective, both mintage levels and the number of programs should be lower than in the past several years.", "The Mint also asked us to delete a statement in the draft that because the Mint does not produce all commemorative coins authorized, higher authorizations than sales do not seem to be an operational problem.

The 157 commemorative coins included 1 quarter, 142 half-dollars, 1 silver dollar, 9 gold dollars, 2 $2.50 gold pieces, and 2 $50 gold pieces.", "Congress was urged to approve legislation authorizing these commemorative coins by private groups who sponsored specific celebrations or events. After the coins were minted, the Mint sold them at face value to the sponsoring organizations, who then resold the coins to the public.

It is not apparent on what grounds similar measures, no matter how numerous, may be rejected. Yet their enactment in such numbers must bring further confusion to our monetary system.\u201d \u201cThese coins do not have a wide circulation as a medium of exchange, and, because of the multiplicity of designs arising from the issuance of such coins, they jeopardize the integrity of our coins and cause confusion.

A congressional report accompanying the repeal legislation indicated that the number of commemorative coin programs had exploded and no controls existed over what dealers could charge for the coins, resulting in increased possibilities for counterfeiting and detracting from the fundamental purpose for which money is issued, namely, to provide a medium of exchange. Further, the report indicated that \u201cno country in the world permits such abuse of its coinage as has been permitted in this country.\u201d The report also cited the 1890 law barring the change in coinage more than every 25 years, saying that it had been \u201c . . . honored in the breach more than in the observance.\u201d \u201c . . . fully cognizant of, and in general accord with, the attitude of the Treasury Department regarding the too promiscuous issuance of commemorative coins in commemoration of events of local or minor importance and the resultant abuses possible or attendant thereto.
