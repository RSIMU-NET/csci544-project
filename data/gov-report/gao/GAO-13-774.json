For example, based on estimates from a 2011 study using national assessment data, in 4th grade, BIE students on average scored 22 points lower for reading and 14 points lower for math than Indian students attending public schools. The gap in scores is even wider when the average for BIE students is compared to the national average for non-Indian students. Additionally, the high school graduation rate for BIE students in 2011 was 61 percent, placing BIE in the bottom half among graduation rates for Indian students attending public schools in states where BIE schools are located.", "BIE's administrative weaknesses have resulted in it experiencing difficulty assessing the academic progress of its students and adequate yearly progress (AYP) for its schools as required by federal law. Department of the Interior (Interior) regulations generally require BIE schools to administer the same academic assessments used by the 23 respective states where the schools are located. However, in the 2011-12 school year, at the direction of BIE officials, 21 schools did not administer their state assessment. These schools administered an alternative assessment that had not been approved for assessing AYP. BIE made this critical decision without the appropriate level of review at Interior or the Department of Education (Education) because it does not have procedures specifying who should be involved in making key decisions. Further, BIE did not provide its schools their AYP status for the 2011-12 school year prior to the start of the next school year, hindering school officials' ability to develop appropriate strategies to improve student performance. Unless BIE provides schools information that affects student instruction in a timely and consistent manner, it will be difficult for BIE to be well-positioned to improve student academic performance in the future.", "Fragmented administrative services and a lack of clear roles for BIE and Indian Affairs' Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management (DAS-M)--that until July 2013 was responsible for BIE's administrative functions--contributed to delays in schools acquiring needed materials, such as textbooks. In July, Indian Affairs underwent a realignment, which assigned another office in Indian Affairs the responsibility for most of BIE's administrative functions. The realignment is intended to improve efficiency in delivering services to Indian Affairs stakeholders, including BIE schools. However, it is unclear to what extent, if at all, the changes will result in improved services for BIE schools. For example, Indian Affairs had not conducted a recent analysis before implementing the realignment to determine if it has the right people in place with the right skills doing the right jobs. Such workforce planning is critical given Indian Affairs' recent realignment and employee buy-out and early-out initiatives. Similarly, Indian Affairs has not developed a strategic plan with specific goals and measures for itself or BIE, or a strategy for communicating with stakeholders. Such a strategic workforce plan and performance measures could help improve operations and align the organization's human capital program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that Indian Affairs develop and implement decision-making procedures and a communications protocol to ensure that BIE has effective management controls and comports with federal laws and regulations.

These schools serve about  41,000 Indian students living on or near reservations, representing about  7 percent of the Indian student population. BIE\u2019s mission is to provide  quality education opportunities to Indian students. However, poor student  outcomes raise questions about how well BIE is achieving its mission. For  example, a recent BIE-funded study found the achievement levels of BIE  students much lower than the general population of students.  Accordingly, you asked us to study aspects of BIE\u2019s mission. Specifically,  this report examines: (1) how student performance at BIE schools  compares to that of public school students, (2) the challenges, if any, BIE  schools face assessing student performance, and (3) what management  challenges, if any, affect BIE and its mission of educating Indian students.  We intend to issue a second report that will compare funding and  expenditures for BIE schools to those of nearby public schools.", "We used multiple data collection methods to address these issues. To  determine how student performance at BIE schools compares to that of  public school students, we reviewed data on student performance for 4th  and 8th grades at BIE and public schools for 2005 to 2011 using data  from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a project  of Education. In addition, we analyzed student performance data for 3rd  and 7th grades from BIE and selected state educational agencies in three  of the four states we visited (selection described below) for school years  2009-10, 2010-11, and 2011-12, the most recent 3 years for which data  were available.

We assessed the reliability of the student performance and graduation  rate data used in our study by reviewing related documentation and  interviewing officials who are knowledgeable about the data. We found  the data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

In addition, we interviewed  officials in Education and in Interior\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Indian Affairs\u2019 Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management,  BIE, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Further, we interviewed  administrators and teachers at public schools in close proximity to the BIE  schools we visited to obtain their perspectives on issues relating to  student performance. We also reviewed agency documents including  budget justifications, guidance, internal correspondences, and agency- sponsored management studies, and we reviewed relevant federal laws  and regulations. We selected site visit locations to reflect an array of BIE  schools that varied in administration type, school and tribal size, and  location. Specifically, we visited 16 BIE schools that serve the Oglala  Sioux Tribe in Pine Ridge, South Dakota; the Mississippi Band of the  Choctaw Indians; the Navajo Nation in New Mexico and Arizona; and  various Pueblo Indians in New Mexico.

Organizationally,  BIE is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, and its  director reports to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs.  The BIE director is responsible for the direction and management of  education functions, including the formation of policies and procedures,  supervision of all program activities, and approval of the expenditure of  funds for education functions. BIE is composed of a central office in  Washington, D.C.; a major field service center in Albuquerque, New  Mexico; 3 associate deputy directors\u2019 offices located regionally (1 in the  east and 2 in the west); 22 education line offices located on or near Indian  reservations; and schools in 23 states. Of the 185 elementary and  secondary schools BIE administers, 59 are directly operated by BIE (BIE- operated), and 126 are operated by tribes (tribally-operated) through  federal contracts or grants. BIE provides funding on the same terms to  tribally-operated schools as it does to BIE-operated schools based on the  number of students attending the schools, among other factors. A local  education line office manages the BIE-operated schools, functioning like  a public school district superintendent\u2019s office. It also provides technical  assistance to tribally-operated as well as BIE-operated schools.", "While BIE schools are primarily funded through Interior, they receive  annual formula grants from Education, similar to public schools. Like state  educational agencies that oversee public schools in their respective  states, BIE administers and monitors the operation of these Education  grants. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, as  amended, holds recipient schools accountable for improving their  students\u2019 academic performance, using Education program funds they  receive through BIE. Specifically, under ESEA, schools must be  measured to determine whether they are making adequate yearly  progress (AYP) in meeting standards in math, reading, and science. In  turn, the performance information must be reported to parents. Interior  determined that, to measure AYP, each BIE school would use the  definitions used by the state in which the school was located.", "BIE and its predecessor, the Office of Indian Education Programs, have  been through a number of restructuring efforts. Before 1999, BIA\u2019s  regional offices were responsible for most administrative functions for  Indian schools. In 1999, the National Academy of Public Administration  (NAPA) issued a report, commissioned by the Assistant Secretary of  Indian Affairs, which identified management challenges within BIA. The  report concluded that BIA\u2019s management structure was not adequate to  operate an effective and efficient agency. The report recommended  centralization of some administrative functions. According to BIE officials,  for a brief period from 2002 to 2003, BIE was responsible for its own  administrative functions. However, in 2004, in response to the NAPA  study, its administrative functions were centralized under the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Management (DAS-M).", "More recently, in 2011, Indian Affairs commissioned another study\u2014 known as the Bronner report\u2014to evaluate the administrative support  structure for BIE and BIA. The report, issued in March 2012, found that  organizations within Indian Affairs, including DAS-M, BIA, and BIE, do not  coordinate effectively and communication among them is poor.

In 2008, we reported that BIE  officials told us that, given the work involved, it was challenging to  calculate and report proficiency levels to schools before the start of the  subsequent school year. Further complicating their efforts, BIE officials  noted that state calculations of AYP are not crafted with BIE schools in  mind. BIE officials cited Arizona as an example. According to these  officials, based on Arizona\u2019s formula for calculating AYP, BIE schools  typically do not have enough students in each grade to be able to use the  state\u2019s formula. Additionally, BIE officials said that the varied locations of  BIE schools make it difficult to compare academic achievement across  states, address student achievement issues, and provide technical  assistance. BIE officials told us they found it especially challenging in  calculating AYP results for the 2011-12 school year because Education  granted waivers to several states\u2014including states where BIE schools  are located\u2014that allowed these states to change the performance targets  used to assess their schools\u2019 yearly progress (accountability systems).

To accomplish this, Interior must first change its  regulation that generally requires BIE schools to use the assessments of  the states in which they are located. Interior has begun the process for  making this change, but the process could take several months to a year,  according to a BIE official. This process requires Interior to undertake a  negotiated rulemaking, which includes the formation of a negotiated  rulemaking committee with members from the federal government and  tribes served by BIE schools.

For instance, the tenure of acting and  permanent assistant secretaries in Indian Affairs has ranged from 16 days  to 3 years, and the post was vacant from August 2003 through February  2004 (see fig. 4). In previous reports about other agencies, we found that  frequent changes in leadership may complicate efforts to improve student  achievement, and that lack of leadership negatively affects an  organization\u2019s ability to function effectively and to sustain focus on key  initiatives.", "Indian Affairs underwent an administrative structural realignment on July  1, 2013, and DAS-M administrative staff responsible for BIE  administrative functions have been detailed to BIA\u2019s regional offices  based on their current geographical duty station. These DAS-M staff will  now be reporting to BIA regional directors, who will have authority over  most of BIE\u2019s administrative functions, including acquisitions, budget,  facilities management, financial management, and property. DAS-M will  continue to be responsible for information technology and human  resource functions. In addition, DAS-M will continue its responsibilities  overseeing and monitoring BIE activities, including updating its policies  and procedures and providing technical assistance to administrative staff  in the field.", "Indian Affairs\u2019 recent realignment\u2014approved by the cognizant  congressional committees in late May 2013\u2014is intended to improve  efficiency in the delivery of services to Indian Affairs stakeholders,  including BIE schools. According to information we received from Indian  Affairs in June 2013, the provision of administrative functions by BIA  regional offices would be governed by service-level agreements  specifying the services provided to BIE and the responsible parties based  on BIE\u2019s needs. However, although Indian Affairs officials told us these  agreements would be signed and in place before the realignment took  effect, the agreements were not in place as of late July 2013.", "The process Indian Affairs followed to develop the realignment plan is  unclear and Indian Affairs did not consult BIE officials on the specific  changes outlined in the realignment request it submitted to Congress. For  example, it did not consult with BIE on transferring the responsibilities for  most of BIE\u2019s administrative functions to BIA regional offices. Additionally,  although Indian Affairs informed Congress that the realignment would be  overseen by an Executive Implementation Oversight Board, several  senior BIE officials, including an acting BIE Director, reported that they  were not asked for input into the new plan. Indian Affairs officials  acknowledged that their office had not consulted with BIE officials on  potential organizational changes since before the Bronner report was  issued in March 2012. The Bronner report recommended that Indian  Affairs, among other things, develop new policies and procedures and  increase decentralization, but does not address the specific changes  entailed in the realignment. Key practices for organizational  transformation include employee involvement in organizational change to  help create the opportunity to increase employees\u2019 understanding and  acceptance of organizational goals and objectives, and gain ownership  for new policies and procedures. Such involvement also allows  employees to share their experiences and shape policies. In addition,  while Indian Affairs conducted tribal consultations in April and May 2012  on the findings of the Bronner report, Indian Affairs did not formally  consult with tribes on the specific changes entailed in the realignment  before it took effect on July 1, 2013. Indian Affairs\u2019 main method of  obtaining information from tribes is through tribal consultations.", "In addition to implementing its realignment without seeking input from key  stakeholders, Indian Affairs\u2019 leadership does not appear to have broadly  communicated information about the realignment to BIE schools or BIE  officials in the field. For example, although the realignment was already in  effect, two BIE school administrators and the director of a BIE education  line office with responsibility for a large number of schools told us on July  8, 2013 that they had no knowledge of the realignment. Another BIE  school administrator said she had just recently found out about it. As a  result, these school administrators were unaware that BIA regional  offices, rather than DAS-M, would be responsible for carrying out their  administrative functions, including acquisitions, budget, and financial  management. This information is important to school administrators to  have because they have experienced problems with administrative  services, such as acquisition of textbooks. According to one high-ranking  BIE official, improvements under the realignment are not likely, in part,  because there is little communication between BIE and BIA regional office  officials. These reactions may stem from the insufficient involvement of  BIE and school officials in planning for the realignment and could  undermine support for the change.", "Indian Affairs officials acknowledged that the office has not established a  strategic plan with specific goals and measures for itself or for BIE or a  strategy for communicating with stakeholders. Key practices for  organizational transformation suggest that effective implementation of a  results-oriented framework, such as a strategic plan, requires agencies to  clearly establish performance goals for which they will be held  accountable, measure progress towards those goals, determine  strategies and resources to effectively accomplish the goals, and use  performance information to make the decisions necessary to improve  performance. In addition, communicating information early and often  helps to build an understanding of the purpose of planned changes and  builds trust among employees and stakeholders. Although Interior as a  whole has a strategic plan, BIE\u2019s inclusion in the Interior plan consists of  two performance measures to improve Indian education, but it does not  detail how BIE will achieve these goals. Indian Affairs and BIE officials  were unable to provide us with a more specific plan articulating the  strategies they will use to achieve BIE\u2019s mission of improving education  for Indian students. BIE officials commented that a strategic plan would  help BIE leadership and staff pursue goals in a consistent manner and  collaborate to achieve them.", "Key practices for organizational transformation also suggest that  performance goals and measures are an important part of the strategic  planning process. Specifically, performance measures allow an  organization to demonstrate its progress toward meeting performance  goals. Performance goals and measures are part of a broader system  that creates a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing how team, unit, and individual  performance can contribute to overall organizational results. Interior\u2019s  fiscal year 2008 Performance and Accountability Report lists two  performance measures that relate to BIE school construction and nine  measures for BIE relating to individual student performance, cost per  student, and teacher qualifications. However, there are no measures for  how internal departments, such as DAS-M and BIA, are fulfilling their  responsibilities to provide administrative and facilities support to BIE  schools. In a response to questions from Congress, Interior stated that its  realignment plan requires the development and execution of performance  measures for the delivery of administrative support functions, but it is not  yet clear what specific measures will be adopted because the service  level agreements between BIE and BIA regional offices have not yet been  negotiated. Without such performance measures, BIE and BIA staff  cannot be held accountable for meeting agency goals.", "According to key principles for workforce planning, another element of an  effective strategic plan is a clear strategy for maintaining and improving   Key principles for effective strategic workforce  an agency\u2019s workforce. planning include: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital program  with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals and (2)  developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining  staff to achieve programmatic goals. The appropriate geographic and  organizational deployment of employees can further support  organizational goals and strategies. Effective deployment strategies can  enable an organization to have the right people, with the right skills, doing  the right jobs, in the right place, at the right time.", "While Indian Affairs\u2019 most current workforce plan is for 2008-2013, it was  based on workforce data from fiscal years 2003-2007. Therefore, the data  in the plan would not reflect recent changes in the workforce or current  workforce needs. As a result, Indian Affairs\u2019 recent realignment may result  in an imbalance in BIA regions\u2019 workload in supporting BIE schools. For  example, under the realignment, 11 of the 12 BIA regional directors are  responsible for providing administrative support to BIE schools in their   However, BIE schools are unevenly distributed among the 11  regions. BIA regions, with the regions containing between 2 and 65 schools (see  table 2). Therefore, it is important to ensure that each BIA regional office  has an appropriate number of staff who are familiar with education laws  and regulations and school-related needs to be prepared to support the  schools in that region.", "In addition, DAS-M records show that almost 250 employees in BIE and  BIA left the agency in recent months using the Voluntary Early Retirement  Authority and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments offered by  Interior, which agency officials told us were prompted by the  sequestration. Indian Affairs recent realignment as well as its employee  early-out and buy-out efforts in the first half of 2013 highlights the  importance of workforce planning. Staff departures can affect  organizational capacity, and in this instance, may affect implementation of  the realignment. Current information on attrition rates and geographic and  demographic trends could be used to estimate the number of employees  with specific skills and competencies and the bureau\u2019s staffing needs  going forward. Further, a revised workforce plan could focus on the  strategic deployment of staff with educational expertise to regions with a  large number of BIE schools and education-specific training for DAS-M  and BIA staff with responsibilities in support of Indian education.", "Further, some tribes are planning to convert BIE-operated schools to  tribally-operated schools in the future. For example, the Navajo Nation  intends to convert its remaining 31 BIE-operated schools to tribally- operated schools. Should this occur, only 15 percent of BIE schools  would remain BIE-operated. While such a shift would decrease BIE\u2019s  administrative responsibilities, BIE\u2019s oversight, monitoring and technical  assistance responsibilities would remain. We have previously reported  that it is essential that agencies determine the skills and competencies  that are critical to achieving their missions and goals, especially when  factors change the environment within which agencies operate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government, through the Department of the Interior, has a  trust responsibility for the education of Indian students. However, the  extent to which Interior is effectively meeting its responsibilities is  questionable considering students\u2019 relatively poor academic performance  and BIE\u2019s myriad administrative and management challenges. BIE lacks  clear procedures for decision-making, which has resulted in it acting  outside the scope of its authority, undermining school officials\u2019 ability to  assess student performance under ESEA and potentially affecting their  compliance with federal regulations. Further, while Indian Affairs has  reported the benchmark for the quality of education BIE provides to its  students is whether its schools meet AYP goals, BIE\u2019s ongoing  challenges calculating AYP and reporting this information to schools may  exacerbate poor school performance. Also, given the significant  challenges BIE and Indian schools face in improving student academic  performance, it is critical that Interior leverage existing resources and  opportunities to improve communication. For example, as of late July  2013, Interior had not yet appointed members to the BIE-Education  Committee. Unless BIE collaborates with partner agencies and provides  schools information that affects student instruction in a timely and  consistent manner, it will be difficult for BIE to be well-positioned to  improve student academic performance in the future.", "While Indian Affairs has undertaken another realignment of its  administrative functions, it is unclear to what extent, if at all, the changes  will result in improved services for BIE and schools. For instance, Indian  Affairs implemented the realignment without seeking input from a broad  range of stakeholders. Further, it did not develop a strategic plan with  specific goals and measures for itself or BIE or strategies to achieve  these goals. In addition, it has not updated its workforce plan or assessed  Indian Affairs\u2019 realignment and its impact on BIE to ensure it has the right  people in place with the right skills to effectively meet the needs of BIE  schools. In addition, BIE did not develop a strategy for communicating  key decisions to stakeholders, including schools. Rather than contribute  to improved administrative functions, the lack of planning and  communication efforts may ultimately undermine them. Therefore,  undertaking these steps as well as developing a comprehensive,  systematic approach to providing technical assistance would help  improve school officials\u2019 administrative capacity and technical expertise,  especially related to BIE compliance with Education requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Assistant  Secretary-Indian Affairs to take the following five actions:", "Develop and implement decision-making procedures for BIE that  specify who should be involved in the decision-making process for key  decisions that affect BIE and its schools to ensure that BIE has  effective management controls, is accountable for the use of federal  funds, and comports with federal laws and regulations.

To reflect changes in the roles of BIE and BIA  as a result of the realignment, Interior acknowledged the importance of  updating its policy documents, such as departmental manuals.
