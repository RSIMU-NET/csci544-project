Traditionally, power plants have withdrawn water from rivers and other water sources to cool the steam used to produce electricity, so that it may be reused to produce more electricity. Some of this water is consumed, and some is discharged back to a water source. In the context of growing demands for both water and electricity, this report discusses (1) approaches to reduce freshwater use by power plants and their drawbacks, (2) states' consideration of water use when reviewing proposals to build power plants, and (3) the usefulness of federal water data to experts and state regulators. GAO reviewed federal water data and studies on cooling technologies. GAO interviewed federal officials, as well as officials from seven selected states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Advanced cooling technologies that rely on air to cool part or all of the steam used in generating electricity and alternative water sources such as treated effluent can reduce freshwater use by thermoelectric power plants. Use of such approaches may lead to environmental benefits from reduced freshwater use, as well as increase developer flexibility in locating a plant. However, these approaches also present certain drawbacks. For example, the use of advanced cooling technologies may result in energy production penalties and higher costs. Similarly, the use of alternative water sources may result in adverse effects on cooling equipment or regulatory compliance issues. Power plant developers must weigh these drawbacks with the benefits of reduced freshwater use when determining which approaches to pursue. Consideration of water use by proposed power plants varies in the states GAO contacted, but the extent of state oversight is influenced by state water laws, related state regulatory policies, and additional layers of state regulatory review. For example, California and Arizona--states that historically faced constrained water supplies, have taken formal steps aimed at minimizing freshwater use at power plants. In contrast, officials in five other states GAO contacted said that their states had not developed official policies regarding water use by power plants and, in some cases, did not require a state permit for water use by new power plants. Federal agencies collect national data on water availability and water use; however, of these data, state water agencies rely on federal water availability data when evaluating power plants' proposals to use freshwater more than federal water use data. Water availability data are collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) through stream flow gauges, groundwater studies, and monitoring stations. In contrast, federal data on water use are primarily used by experts, federal agencies, and others to identify industry trends. However, these data users identified limitations with the federal water use data that make them less useful for conducting trend analyses and tracking industry changes. For example, the Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA) does not systematically collect information on the use of advanced cooling technologies and other data it collects are incomplete. Similarly, USGS discontinued distribution of data on water consumption by power plants and now only provides information on water withdrawals. Finally, neither EIA nor USGS collect data on power plant developers' use of alternative water sources, which some experts believe is a growing trend in the industry. Because federal data sources are a primary source of national data on water use by various sectors, data users told GAO that without improvements to these data, it becomes more difficult for them to conduct comprehensive analyses of industry trends and limits understanding of changes in the industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Water and electricity are inexorably linked and mutually dependent, with  each affecting the other\u2019s availability. Electricity is required to supply,  purify, distribute, and treat water and wastewater; water is needed to  generate electricity and to extract and process fuels used to generate  electricity. Freshwater and electricity are important to our health, quality  of life, and economic growth, and demand for both of these resources is  rising. Freshwater is increasingly in demand to meet the needs of the  public in growing cities and suburbs, farms, industries, and for recreation  and wildlife. At the same time, electricity demand is projected to continue  to grow in the United States, with the Department of Energy (DOE)  estimating that U.S. electricity consumption will increase by an average of  about 1 percent each year from 2007 through 2030. Limited availability of  freshwater may make it more difficult to build new power plants,  particularly in communities concerned about the adequacy of their water  supply and maintaining the quality of aquatic environments. Periodic  water shortages may also make it difficult for existing plants to satisfy  demand for electricity. In recent years, water shortages and high water  temperatures have caused reductions in electricity production at power  plants in the United States and abroad, according to news reports.", "In 2007, around three-fourths of the United States\u2019 electricity generating  capacity consisted of thermoelectric power plants, which rely heavily on  water for cooling. Thermoelectric power plants use a fuel source\u2014for  example, coal, natural gas, nuclear material such as uranium, or the sun\u2014 to boil water (boiler water) to produce steam. The steam turns a turbine  connected to a generator that produces electricity. The steam is then  cooled back into boiler water, a process which traditionally involves  transferring heat from the steam to a separate water source (cooling  water) and reusing it. Because the cooling water takes on the heat of the  boiler water, some of it may evaporate, and the amount that evaporates  varies, depending on the type of cooling technology that is used. In recent  years, the majority of new thermoelectric power generating units have  been combined cycle units, which use two processes to produce  electricity, one of which is thermoelectric. In this type of plant, electricity  is first generated by a simple cycle turbine that turns a generator directly  as a result of burning fuel in the turbine\u2014similar to jet engines used in  aircraft. The heat produced by the simple cycle turbine that would  otherwise be released to the atmosphere is used to produce steam which  turns a steam turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.  Because some of the electricity is generated via the simple cycle turbine\u2014 a non-thermoelectric process\u2014combined cycle plants use less water for  cooling than similarly sized plants using only steam to produce electricity.  Non-thermoelectric power plants, which accounted for the other one- quarter of 2007 U.S. electricity generating capacity, do not use water for  cooling but still require water for other plant purposes, such as water for  improving turbine performance on non-thermoelectric natural gas plants,  as well as water for housekeeping activities.", "Water use by thermoelectric power plants can be generally characterized  as withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. Water withdrawals refer to  water removed from the ground or diverted from a surface water source\u2014 for example, an ocean, river, or lake\u2014for use by the plant. In 2000, the  most recent USGS data available, thermoelectric power plants accounted  for 39 percent of total U.S. freshwater withdrawals. Water consumption  refers to the portion of the water withdrawn that is no longer available to  be returned to a water source, such as when it has evaporated. In 1995, the  most recent USGS data available, thermoelectric power plants accounted  for 3 percent of freshwater consumption in the United States. Discharge  refers to the return of water to its original source or a new source and  represents the difference between withdrawals and consumption. For  many thermoelectric power plants, much of the water they withdraw is  later discharged, although often at higher temperatures. The amount of  water discharged from a thermoelectric power plant depends on a number  of factors, including the type of cooling technology used, plant economics,  and environmental regulations.", "Decisions to build a new power plant may be made independently by the  power plant developer or with the consent of a state public utility  commission. In either case, power plant developers must obtain approval  from a number of state and local officials, generally by obtaining  preconstruction and operating permits, before they can proceed with  building their plant in a particular location. This process is meant to  balance any adverse impacts a power plant may have on nearby  communities and environments with the benefits it provides, such as  energy supply and jobs. This regulation of the electricity industry\u2019s water  use is complex and involves both state and federal laws. States are  primarily responsible for managing the allocation and use of freshwater  supplies. However, federal laws provide for control over the use of water  in specific cases, such as on federal lands or in interstate commerce. In  addition to the water power plants may withdraw, for which developers  have to seek permits or purchase a water right, power plants may have to  obtain permits to discharge water, since water discharged from a plant is  regulated by the federal government and the states to ensure that it meets  certain quality standards and does not harm protected species. In some  cases, plants may design their operations so they discharge no water into  sources outside the plant boundaries, known as zero-liquid discharge.", "Two federal agencies\u2014the Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological  Survey (USGS) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the  independent statistical and analytical agency within DOE\u2014collect key  data that address how power plants use water. In addition, Congress  recently passed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which  included provisions known as the Secure Water Act. The law authorizes,  among other things, additional funding for the Department of the Interior  to report water data to Congress, including thermoelectric power plant  withdrawal data. Congress is also considering pending legislation related  to energy and water. The Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009, among  other things, calls for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an  analysis of the impact of energy development and production on U.S.  water resources, including an assessment of water used in electricity  production. Similarly, the Energy and Water Research Integration Act  directs DOE to take such steps as advancing energy and energy efficiency  technologies that minimize freshwater use, increase water use efficiency,  and utilize alternative water sources. It also provides for the creation of a  council to enhance energy and water resource data collection, including  improving data on trends in power plant water use, among other things.", "Because of the importance of freshwater to the public and society at large,  the environment, and many industries, information about the country\u2019s  current and expected use of freshwater and electricity is critical to making  appropriate decisions about how these resources are managed. In this  context, you asked us to provide information about the relationship  between water and energy, which we will be addressing in several  reports. This report discusses water use in electricity production. More  specifically, this report (1) describes technologies and other approaches to  help reduce freshwater use by power plants and what, if any, drawbacks  there are to using them, (2) describes the extent to which selected states  consider water impacts of power plants when reviewing power plant  development proposals, and (3) evaluates the usefulness of federal water  data to experts and state regulators who evaluate power plant  development proposals. We focused our evaluation on thermoelectric  power plants, such as nuclear, coal, and certain natural gas plants. We did  not consider the water supply issues associated with hydroelectric power,  since the process through which hydroelectric plants use water is  substantially different from that of thermoelectric plants and water is used  to generate hydroelectric power without being directly consumed. We also  limited our review to water used during the production of electricity at  power plants and did not include water issues associated with extracting  fuels used to produce electricity.", "To understand technologies or other approaches to help reduce  freshwater use by power plants and what, if any, drawbacks there are to  using them, we reviewed industry, federal, and academic studies on  alternative water sources and advanced cooling technologies that  discussed these alternatives\u2019 benefits, as well as their drawbacks. We  discussed the trade-offs associated with the use of these alternatives with  power plant and cooling system manufacturers, U.S. national laboratory  staff, academics, and other industry experts. To determine the extent to  which selected states consider water impacts of power plants when  reviewing power plant development proposals, we conducted case study  reviews of three states: Arizona, California, and Georgia. We selected these  states because of their differences in water availability and water law, high  energy production, and large population centers. For each of these states,  we met with state water regulators and siting authorities, power plant  developers, water research institutions, and other subject matter experts.  We also reviewed state water laws and policies for power plant water use.  To supplement our case studies, we spoke with water regulators from four  additional states: Nevada and Alabama, which shared watersheds with the  case study states, and Illinois and Texas, which are large electricity  producing states with sizable population centers. We did not attempt to  determine whether states\u2019 efforts were reasonable or effective, rather, we  only describe what states do to consider water impacts when making  power plant siting decisions. To understand the usefulness of federal  water data to experts and state regulators who evaluate power plant  development proposals, we reviewed data and analysis from USGS and  DOE\u2019s EIA and National Energy Technology Laboratory. We also  conducted interviews about the usefulness of federal data with data users,  including federal agencies; regulators from state departments of water  resources and public utility commissions; and experts from environmental  and water organizations, industry, and academia. A more detailed  description of our scope and methodology is presented in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 to October 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Thermoelectric power plants use a heat source to make steam, which is  used to turn a turbine connected to a generator that makes electricity. As  shown in figure 1, the water used to make steam (boiler water) circulates  in a closed loop. This means the same water used to make steam is also  converted back to liquid water \u2014referred to as condensing\u2014in a device  called a condenser and, finally, moved back to the heat source to again  make steam. In typical thermoelectric plants, water from a separate  source, known as cooling water, flows through the condenser to cool and  condense the steam in the closed loop after it has turned the turbine.", "Consideration of water availability during the power plant siting process  can pose different challenges in different parts of the country because  precipitation and, relatedly, water availability varies substantially across  the United States. Figure 2 shows the total amount of freshwater  withdrawn in the United States as a percentage of available precipitation.  Areas where the percentage is greater than 100\u2014where more water is  withdrawn than locally renewed through precipitation\u2014are indicative of  basins using other water sources transported by natural rivers and  manmade flow structures, or may indicate unsustainable groundwater use.", "Power plants can use various types of water for cooling\u2014such as  freshwater or saline water\u2014and different water sources, including surface  water, groundwater, and alternative water sources. An example of  alternative water sources is reclaimed water such as treated effluent from  sewage treatment plants. To make siting decisions, power plant  developers typically consider the water sources that are available and lea costly to use. Fresh surface water is the most common water source for  power plants nationally, as shown in table 1."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cooling Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Power plant developers must also consider what cooling technologies they  plan to use in the plant. There are four general types of cooling  technologies. Traditional cooling technologies that have been used for  decades include once-through and wet recirculating cooling systems.  Advanced cooling technologies that have focused on reducing the amount  of cooling water used are relatively newer in the United States and include  dry cooling and hybrid cooling. Specifically:  Once-through cooling systems. In once-through cooling systems, large  amounts of cooling water are withdrawn from a water body such as a la river, or ocean, and used in the cooling loop. As shown in figure 3, the  cooling water passes through the tubes of a condenser. As steam in the  boiler water loop exits the turbine, it passes over the condenser tubes.  This contact with the condenser tubes cools and condenses the steam  back into boiler water for reuse. After the cooling water passes through  the condenser tubes, it is discharged back into the water body warmer  than it was when it was withdrawn. Once-through cooling systems  withdraw a significant amount of water but directly consume almost no  water. However, because the water discharged back into the wate warmer, experts believe that once-through systems may increase  evaporation from the receiving water body. Furthermore, because of  r body is  concerns about the harm withdrawal for once-through systems can have  on aquatic life\u2014when aquatic organisms are pulled into cooling systems,  trapped against water intake screens, or their habitat is adversely affected  by warm water discharges\u2014these systems are rarely installed at new  plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["Although a number of federal agencies collect data on water, two collect  key data that are used to analyze the impacts of thermoelectric power  plants and water availability: USGS and EIA.", "USGS\u2019s mission is to provide reliable scientific information to manage  water, energy and other resources, among other things.

In general, water rights in  riparian states may not be bought or sold. Landowners may, at any time,  use water flowing past the land, even if they have never done so before. All  landowners have an equal right to use the water, and no one gains a  greater right through prior use. In some riparian states, water use is  closely tracked by requiring users to apply for permits to withdraw water.  In other states, where water has traditionally not been scarce, water use is  not closely tracked. When there is a water shortage, water users share the  shortage in proportion to their rights, or the amount they are permitted to  withdraw, to the extent that it is possible to determine.", "Under the prior appropriation doctrine, water rights are not linked with  land ownership. Instead, water rights are property rights that can be  owned independent of land and are linked to priority and beneficial water  use. A water right establishes a property right claim to a specific amount  of water\u2014called an allotment. Because water rights are not tied to land,  water rights can be bought and sold without any ownership of land,  although the rights to water may have specific geographic limitations. For  example, a water right generally provides the ability to use water in a  specific river basin taken from a specific area of the river. Water rights are  also prioritized\u2014water rights established first generally have seniority for  the use of water over water rights established later\u2014commonly described  as \u201cfirst in time, first in right.\u201d As a result, once established, water rights  retain their priority for as long as they remain valid. For example, a water  right to 100 acre feet of Colorado River water established in 1885 would  retain that 1885 priority and allotment, even if the right was sold by the  original party who established it. Water rights also must be exercised in  order to remain valid, meaning rights holders must put the water to  beneficial use or their right can be deemed abandoned and terminated\u2014 commonly referred to as \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d When there is a water shortage  in prior appropriation states, shortages fall on those who last obtained a  legal right to use the water. As a result, a shortage can result in junior  water rights holders losing all access to water, while senior rights holders  have access to their entire allotment.", "For some states, the legal framework for groundwater is similar to that of  surface water as they use variants of either the riparian or prior  appropriation doctrine to allocate water rights. However, in other states,  the allocation of groundwater rights follows other legal doctrines,  including the rule of capture doctrine and the doctrine of reasonable use.  Under the rule of capture doctrine, landowners have the right to all the  water they can capture under their land for any use, regardless of the  effect on other water users. The doctrine of reasonable use similarly  affords landowners the right to water underneath their land, provided the  use is restricted to an amount necessary for reasonable use.

A variety of additional  factors may also affect the availability of water for electricity generation  and other uses, as well as the amount of water used to produce electricity.  Some studies indicate that climate change will result in changes in local  temperatures and more seasonal variations, both of which could cause  increased levels of water consumption from thermoelectric power plant  generation. Climate change may also result in changes in local  precipitation and water availability, as well as more and longer droughts in  some areas of the country.

A 2001 EPA study estimated that for a combined cycle plant,  energy requirements to operate a once-through system (pumps) are 0.15  percent of plant output, 0.39 percent of plant output for a wet recirculating  system with cooling towers (pumps and fans), and 0.81 percent of plant  output for a dry cooled system (fans).", "Plant operating efficiency and cooling system performance. Plants using  a dry cooling component, whether entirely dry cooled or in a hybrid  cooled configuration, may face reduced operating efficiency under certain  conditions. A power plant\u2019s operating efficiency is affected by the  performance of the cooling system, among other things, and power plants  with systems that cool more effectively produce electricity more  efficiently. A cooling system\u2019s effectiveness is influenced both by the  design of the cooling system and ambient conditions that determine the  temperature of that system\u2019s cooling medium\u2014water in once-through and  wet recirculating systems and air in dry cooling systems. In general, the  effectiveness of a cooling system decreases as the temperature of the  cooling medium increases, since a warmer medium can absorb less heat  from the steam. Once-through systems cool steam using water being  withdrawn from the river, lake, or ocean. Wet recirculating systems with  cooling towers, on the other hand, use the process of evaporation to cool  the steam to a temperature that approaches the \u201cwet-bulb temperature\u201d\u2014 an alternate measure of temperature that incorporates both the ambient  air temperature and relative humidity. In contrast, dry cooled systems  transfer heat only to the ambient air, without evaporation. As a result, dry  cooled systems can cool steam only to a temperature that approaches the  \u201cdry-bulb temperature\u201d\u2014the measure of ambient air temperature  measured by a standard thermometer and with which most people are  familiar. In general, once-through systems tend to cool most effectively  because the temperature of the body of water from which cooling water is  drawn is, on average, lower than the wet- or dry-bulb temperature.  Moreover, wet-bulb temperatures are generally lower than dry-bulb  temperatures, often making recirculating systems more effective at  cooling than dry cooled systems. Further, according to one report that we  reviewed, greater fluctuations in dry-bulb temperatures seasonally and  throughout the day can make dry cooled systems harder to design. Dry  bulb temperatures can be especially high in hot, dry parts of the country,  such as the Southwest, leading to significant plant efficiency losses during  periods of high temperatures, particularly during the summer. According  to experts and power plant developers we spoke with, plant efficiencies  may witness smaller reductions during other parts of the year when  temperatures are lower or in cooler climates. Nevertheless, in practice,  lower cooling system performance can result in reduced plant net  electricity output or greater fuel use if more fuel is burned to produce  electricity to offset efficiency losses. Plant developers can take steps to  reduce efficiency losses such as by installing a larger dry cooling system  with additional cooling capability, but such a system will result in higher  capital costs.", "A plant\u2019s total energy penalty will be a combination of both effects  described\u2014energy needed for cooling system equipment and the impact of  cooling system performance on plant operating efficiency. Energy  penalties may result in lost revenue for the plant due to the net loss in  electricity produced for a given unit of fuel, especially during the summer  when electricity demand and prices are often the highest. Energy penalties  may also affect the price consumers pay for electricity in a regulated  market, if the cost of the additional fuel needed to produce lost electricity  is passed on to consumers by regulators. Finally, energy penalties may  affect emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide if lost output is made up  for by an emissions producing power plant, such as a coal- or natural gas- fueled power plant. This is because additional fuel is burned to produce  electricity that offsets what was lost as a result of the energy penalty, and,  thus, additional carbon dioxide and other pollutants are released.", "Recent studies comparing total energy penalties between cooling systems  have used differing methodologies to estimate energy penalties and have  reached varying conclusions. For example, a 2001 EPA study estimates  the national average, mean annual energy penalties\u2014lower electricity  output\u2014for plants operating at two-thirds capacity with dry cooling to be  larger than those with wet recirculating systems with cooling towers. In  this study, EPA estimated penalties of 1.7 percent lower output for a  combined cycle plant with a dry system compared to a wet recirculating  system with a cooling tower, and 6.9 percent lower output for a fossil  fueled plant run fully on steam, such as a coal plant. Similarly, a separate  study conducted by two DOE national labs in 2002 estimated larger annual  energy penalties for hypothetical 400 megawatt coal plants in multiple  regions of the country retrofitted to dry cooling\u2014these penalties ranged  between 3 to 7 percent lower output on average for a plant retrofitted with  a dry cooled system compared to a plant retrofitted with a wet  recirculating system with a cooling tower. On the hottest 1 percent of  temperature conditions during the year, this energy penalty rose to  between 6 and 10 percent lower output for plants retrofitted to dry cooling  compared with those retrofitted to a wet recirculating system with cooling  towers. However, some experts we spoke with told us energy penalties  are higher in retrofitted plants than when a dry cooled system is designed  according to the unique specifications of a newly built plant.", "A 2006 study conducted for the California Energy Commission estimated  electricity output and other characteristics for new, theoretical combined  cycle natural gas plants in four climatic zones of California using different  cooling systems. The study found that dry cooling systems result in  significant water savings, but that plants using wet cooling systems  generally experience higher annual net electricity output, as shown in  table 3, and lower fuel consumption. Furthermore, while the study  estimates that plant capacity to produce electricity is limited on hot days  for both types of cooling systems, the hot day capacity of the dry cooled  plant to produce electricity is up to 6 percent lower than the wet  recirculating plant with cooling tower.", "Power plant developers can take steps to address the energy penalties  associated with dry cooling technology by designing their plants with  larger dry cooled systems capable of performing better during periods of  high ambient temperatures. Alternatively, they can use a hybrid  technology that supplements the dry system with a wet recirculating  system with a cooling tower during the hottest times of the year. However,  in making this decision, developers must weigh the trade-offs between the  costs associated with building and operating a larger dry cooled system or  a hybrid system and the benefits of lowering their energy penalties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Higher Costs", "paragraphs": ["According to some power plant developers and experts we spoke with,  another drawback to using dry and hybrid cooling technologies is that  these technologies typically have higher capital costs. Experts, power  plant developers, and studies indicated that while capital costs for each  system can vary significantly, as a general rule, capital costs are lowest for  once-through systems, higher for wet recirculating systems, and highest  for dry cooling. Some told us the capital costs of hybrid systems\u2014as a  combination of wet recirculating and dry cooling systems\u2014generally fall  in between these two systems. Furthermore, according to some of the  experts we spoke with and studies we reviewed, the capital costs of a  plant\u2019s cooling system vary based on the specific characteristics of a given  plant, such as the costs of the cooling towers, the circulating water lines to  transport water to and around the plant, pumps, fans, as well as the extent  to which a dry cooled system is sized larger to offset energy penalties. As  with energy penalties, studies estimating capital costs for dry and hybrid  systems have used differing methodologies and provide varying estimates  of capital costs. One study by the Electric Power Research Institute  estimated dry cooling system capital costs for theoretical 500 megawatt  combined cycle plants in 5 climatic locations to be 3.6 to 4.0 times that of  wet recirculating systems with cooling towers. Experts from an  engineering firm we spoke with also explained that capital costs for dry  and hybrid cooled systems can be many times that of a wet recirculating  system with cooling towers. They estimated that, in general, installing a  dry system on a 500 megawatt combined cycle plant instead of a wet  recirculating system with a cooling tower could increase baseline capital  costs by $9 to $24 million, depending on location\u2014an increase in baseline  capital costs that is 2.0 to 5.1 times higher than if a wet recirculating  system with a cooling tower were used. They estimated dry cooling to be  more costly on a 500 megawatt coal plant, with dry cooling resulting in an  increase in baseline capital costs that was 2.6 to 7.0 times higher than if a  wet recirculating system with a cooling tower were used.", "With respect to annual costs, according to experts we spoke with and  studies we reviewed, annual cost differences between alternative cooling  technologies and traditional cooling technologies are variable and may  depend on such factors as the costliness of obtaining and treating water,  the extent to which cooling water is reused within the system, the need for  maintenance, the extent to which energy penalties result in lost revenue,  and the extent to which a cooling system is sized larger to offset energy  penalties. Estimates from four reports we reviewed calculated varying  cooling system annual costs for a range of plant types and locations using  different methodologies, and found annual costs of dry systems to  generally range from one and a half to four times those of wet  recirculating systems with cooling towers. One of these studies, however,  in examining the potential for higher water costs, found that dry cooling  could be more economical on an annual basis in some areas of the country  with expensive water or become more economical in the future if water  costs were to rise. Furthermore, an expert from an engineering firm we  spoke with explained that cooling system costs are only one component of  total plant costs, and that while one cooling system may be expensive  relative to another, its impact on total plant costs may not be as significant  in a relative sense if the plant\u2019s total costs are high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Space, Noise, and Suitability Issues", "paragraphs": ["There may be other drawbacks to dry cooled technology, including space  and noise considerations. Towers, pumps, and piping for both dry cooled  and wet cooled systems with cooling towers require substantial space, but  according to experts we spoke with, dry cooled systems tend to be larger.  For example, according to one expert we spoke with, a dry cooled system  for a natural gas combined cycle plant that derives one-third of its  electricity from the steam cycle could be almost as large as two football  fields. Moreover, according to others, the large size of dry cooling systems  needed for plants that derive all of their electricity production from the  steam cycle\u2014for example, nuclear and coal plants\u2014may make the use of  dry cooling systems less suitable for these kinds of power plants. Experts  we spoke with explained that because full steam plants produce all of  their electricity by heating water to make steam, they require larger  cooling systems to condense the steam back into usable liquid water. As a  result, the size of a dry cooling system for a full steam plant could be three  times that of a dry cooling system for a similarly-sized combined cycle  plant that only produces one-third of its electricity from the steam cycle.", "Furthermore, according to one expert we spoke with, the most efficient  type of dry cooled technology may not be approved for use with certain  nuclear reactors, because of safety concerns. Finally, the motors, fans, and  water of both dry cooled and wet recirculating systems with cooling  towers may create noise that disturbs plant employees, nearby residents,  and wildlife.

While some of these drawbacks are similar to those faced by power plants  that use freshwater, they may be exacerbated by the lower quality of  alternative water sources.

While  freshwater can also cause adverse effects, the generally lower quality of  alternative water sources make them more likely to result in these effects.  For example, effluent from a sewage treatment plant may be higher in  ammonia than freshwater, which can cause damage to copper alloys and  other metals. High levels of ammonia and phosphates can also lead to  excessive biological growth on certain cooling tower structures. Chemical  treatment is used to mitigate such adverse effects of alternative water  sources when they occur, but this treatment results in additional costs.

For example, reclaimed  water from sewage treatment plants is treated to eliminate bacteria and  other contaminants that can be harmful to humans. Similarly, water  associated with minerals extraction may contain higher total dissolved and  suspended solids and other constituents, which could adversely affect the  environment if discharged. Addressing these issues through the following  actions entail additional costs to the power plant operators: (1) chemical  treatment prior to discharging water to another water source, (2)  discharging water to a holding pond unconnected to another water source  for evaporation, or (3) eliminating all liquid discharges by, for example,  evaporating all the water used at the plant and disposing of the resulting  solid waste into a facility such as a landfill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Alternative Water Sources", "paragraphs": ["As with freshwater sources, the proximity of an alternative water source  may be a drawback that power plant developers have to consider when  pursuing this option.

However, power plant developers we spoke with told us that  when considering the viability of an advanced cooling technology or  alternative water source, they must weigh the trade-offs between the  water savings and other benefits these alternatives offer with the  drawbacks to their use. For example, in a water-scarce region of the  country where water costs are high and there is much regulatory scrutiny  of water use, a power plant developer may determine that, despite the  drawbacks associated with the use of advanced cooling technologies or  alternative water sources, these alternatives still offer the best option for  getting a potentially profitable plant built in a specific area. Furthermore,  according to power plant developers we spoke with, these decisions have  to be made on a project by project basis because the magnitude of benefits  and drawbacks will vary depending on a plant\u2019s type, location, and the  related climate. For example, dry cooling has been installed in regions of  the country where water is relatively plentiful, such as the Northeast, to  help shorten regulatory approval times and avoid concerns about the  adverse impacts that other cooling technologies might have on aquatic life.  In making a determination about what cooling technology to use, power  plant developers evaluate the net economic costs of alternatives like dry  cooling or an alternative water source\u2014its savings compared to its costs\u2014 over the life of a proposed plant, as well as the regulatory climate. Experts  we spoke with told us this involves consideration of both capital and  annual costs, including how expected water savings compare to costs  related to energy penalties and other factors. Anticipated future increases  in water-related costs could prompt a developer to use a water-saving  alternative. For example, a recent report by the Electric Power Research  Institute estimates that a power plant\u2019s economic trade-offs vary  considerably depending on its location and that high water costs could  make dry cooling less expensive annually than wet cooling.", "The National Energy Technology Laboratory is funding research and  development projects aimed at minimizing the drawbacks of advanced  cooling technologies and alternative water sources.

Table 4 shows the differences in water  laws and water permitting for the seven states we contacted.", "With regard to surface water\u2014the source of water most often used for  power plant cooling nationally\u2014of the seven states we contacted, all but  Alabama required power plant developers to obtain water permits through  the state agency that regulates the water supply. However, the states  requiring permits varied in how the permits were obtained and under what  circumstances. For example, in general, under Illinois law, water supply  permits are only necessary if the surface water is defined as a public water  body, which covers most major navigable lakes, rivers, streams, and  waterways as defined by the Illinois Office of Water Resources. However,  for any other surface water body, such as smaller rivers and streams, no  such permit is required. To obtain a permit to use water in a power plant  in Illinois, developers must file an application with the Illinois Office of  Water Resources. In determining whether to issue a permit, the Office of  Water Resources requires the applicant to address public comments and  evaluates USGS streamflow data to determine whether restrictions on  water use are needed. In some instances, such as to support fish and other  wildlife, the state may designate a minimum level of flow required for a  river or stream and restrict the amount of water that can be used by a  power plant or other water user when that minimum level is reached. The  Director of the Office of Water Resources told us that the office has  sometimes encouraged power plant operators to establish backup water  sources, such as onsite reservoirs, for use when minimum streamflow  levels are reached and water use is restricted. In contrast, under Georgia  and Alabama riparian law, landowners have the right to the water on and  adjacent to their land, and both states require users who have the capacity  to withdraw (Alabama) or actually withdraw (Georgia) an average of more  than 100,000 gallons per day to provide information to the state  concerning their usage and legal rights to the water. However, this  requirement is applied differently in the two states. Alabama requires that  water users register their planned water use for informational purposes  with the Alabama Office of Water Resources but does not require users to  obtain a permit for the water withdrawal or conduct analysis of the impact  of the proposed water use. In contrast, Georgia requires water users to  apply for and receive a water permit from the Georgia Environmental  Protection Division. In determining whether to issue a permit for water  use, this Georgia agency analyzes the potential effect of the water use on  downstream users and others in the watershed. State water regulators in  Georgia told us they have never denied an application for water use in a  power plant due to water supply issues since there has historically been  adequate available water in the state. For more details on Georgia\u2019s  process for approving water use in power plants, see appendix IV.", "Groundwater laws in the selected states we reviewed also varied and  affected the extent to which state regulators provided oversight over  power plant water use. In four of the seven states\u2013\u2013Alabama, California,  Illinois, and Texas\u2013\u2013groundwater is largely unregulated at the state level,  and landowners may generally freely drill new wells and use groundwater  as they wish unless restricted by local entities, such as groundwater  conservation districts. However, in three of the seven states we  contacted\u2014Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada\u2014state-issued water permits are  required for water withdrawals for some or all regions of the state. For  example, in Nevada, which has 256 separate groundwater basins, and in  which most of the in-state power generation uses groundwater for cooling,  state water law follows the doctrine of prior appropriation. A power plant  developer or other entity wanting to acquire a new water right for  groundwater must apply for a water permit with the Nevada Division of  Water Resources. In evaluating the application for a water permit, the  Division determines if water is available\u2014referred to as unappropriated;  whether the proposed use will conflict with existing water rights or  domestic wells; and whether the use of the water is in the public interest.  In determining whether groundwater is available, if the Division of Water  Resources determines that the amount of water that replenishes the  groundwater basin annually is greater than the existing committed ground  water rights in a given basin, unappropriated water may be available for  appropriation. In two cases where groundwater was being considered for  possible power plants, the State Engineer, the official in the Division of  Water Resources who approves permits, either denied the application or  expressed reservations over the use of groundwater for cooling. For  example, in one case, the State Engineer noted that large amounts of water  should not be used in a dry state like Nevada when an alternative, like dry  cooling, that is less water intensive was available.", "In contrast, in Texas, where 8 percent of in state electricity capacity uses  groundwater for cooling, state regulators do not issue groundwater use  permits or routinely review a power plant or other users\u2019 proposed use of  the groundwater.

Landowners can pump  any amount of water from their land, subject to certain restrictions,  regardless of the effect on other wells located on adjacent or other  property. Although Texas state water regulators do not issue water  permits for the use of groundwater, in more than half the counties in  Texas, groundwater is managed locally through groundwater conservation  districts which are generally authorized by the Texas Legislature and  ratified at the local level to protect groundwater.

With respect to regulatory policies, of the 7 states,  California and Arizona have established formal policies or requirements to  encourage power plant developers to consider alternative cooling methods  and reduce the amount of freshwater used in a proposed power plant.  Specifically:    California, a state that has faced constrained water supplies for many  years, established a formal policy in 1975 that requires applicants seeking  to use water in power plants to consider alternative water sources before  proposing the use of freshwater. More recently, the California Energy  Commission, the state agency that is to review and approve power plant  developer applications, reiterated in its 2003 Integrated Energy Policy  Report, the 1975 policy that the commission would only approve power  plants using freshwater for cooling in limited circumstances.  Furthermore, state regulators at the Commission told us that in discussing  potential new power plant developer applications, commission staff  encourage power plant developers to consider using advanced cooling  technologies, such as dry cooling or alternative water sources, such as  effluent from sewage treatment plants. Between January 2004 and April  2009, California regulators approved 10 thermoelectric power plants\u20143  that will use dry cooling; 6 that will use an alternative water source, such  as reclaimed water; and 2 that will use freshwater purchased from a water  supplier, such as a municipal water district, for power plant cooling. Of  20 additional thermoelectric power plant applications pending California  Energy Commission approval, developers have proposed 11 plants that  plan to use dry cooling, 8 plants that plan to use an alternative water  source, and 1 that plans to use freshwater for cooling.

Plants must cycle water through the cooling loop at least  15 times before discharging it, whereas, according to an Arizona public  utility official, outside of Active Management Areas plants would generally  cycle water 3 to 7 times. These additional cycles result in water savings,  since less water must be withdrawn from ground or surface water sources  to replace discharges, but can require plant operators to undertake more  costly and extensive treatment of the cooling water and to more carefully  manage the plant cooling equipment to avoid mineral buildup. Arizona  officials also told us they encourage the use of alternative water sources  for cooling and have informally encouraged developers to consider dry  cooling. According to Arizona state officials, no plants with dry cooling  have been approved to date in the state and, due mostly to climatic  conditions, dry cooling is probably too inefficient and costly to currently  be a viable option.

Additionally, the state does not require that power plant  developers and other proposed water users seek a water use permit; rather  power plant operators are only required to register their maximum and  average expected water use with the state and report annual usage.

Officials from the state\u2019s Public Service Commission,  responsible for certifying the development of power plants, said their  office does not have authority to regulate a utility\u2019s water use and,  therefore, generally does not analyze how a proposed power plant will  affect the water supply.

Most state water  regulators we contacted explained that they rely upon federal data on  water availability, particularly streamflow and groundwater data collected  by USGS, for permitting decisions and said these data helped promote  more informed water planning. For example, water regulatory officials  from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\u2014the agency that  evaluates surface water rights applications from prospective water users  in Texas\u2014told us that streamflow data collected by USGS are a primary  data source for their water model that predicts how water use by power  plants and others applying for water rights will impact state water supplies  and existing rights holders.", "USGS\u2019s network of streamflow gauges and groundwater monitoring  stations provide the only national data of their kind on water availability  over long periods. As a result, state officials told us that these data are  instrumental in predicting how much water is likely to be available in a  river under a variety of weather conditions, such as droughts. For  example, state regulators in Georgia and Illinois told us that they rely on  USGS streamflow data to determine whether or not to establish special  conditions on water withdrawal permits, such as minimum river flow  requirements that affect the amount of cooling water a power plant can  withdraw during periods when water levels in the river are low. State  water regulators in Nevada also told us they rely on a number of data  sources, including USGS groundwater studies, to determine the amount of  time necessary for water to naturally refill a groundwater basin. This  information helps them ensure that water withdrawals for power plants  and others are sustainable and do not risk depleting a groundwater basin.", "State regulators told us that while federal water availability data is a key  input into their decisionmaking process for power plant permits, they also  rely on a number of other sources of data, as shown in table 5. These  include data that they themselves collect and data collected by  universities; private industry, such as power plant developers; and various  other water experts.", "Some state regulators and water experts we spoke with expressed concern  about streamflow gauges being discontinued, which they said may make  evaluating trends in water availability and water planning more difficult in  the future. Without accurate data on water availability, decisions about  water planning and allocation of water resources\u2014including power plant  permitting decisions\u2014may be less informed, according to regulators and  experts. For example, an official from Arizona told us that a reduction in  streamflow gauges would adversely impact the quality of the states\u2019 water  programs and that state budget constraints have made it increasingly  difficult to allocate the necessary state funds to ensure cooperatively- funded streamflow gauges remain operational. Similarly, an official from  the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told us that if particular  streamflow gauges were discontinued, water availability records would be  unavailable to update existing data for their water availability models\u2014 which are relied upon for water planning and permitting decisions\u2014and  alternative data would be needed to replace these missing data. USGS  officials told us that the cumulative number of streamflow gauges with 30  or more years of record that have been discontinued has increased, as  seen in figure 8, due to budget constraints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Experts, Federal Agencies, and Others Value Federal Data on Water Use for Analyzing Industry Trends but Identified Limitations In These Data", "paragraphs": ["Unlike federal data on water availability, federal data on water use is not  routinely relied upon by state officials we spoke with to make regulatory  decisions; but, instead is used by a variety of data users to identify trends  in the industry. Specifically, data users we spoke with, including water  experts, representatives of an environmental group, and federal agency  officials, identified the following benefits of the water use data collected  by USGS and EIA:    USGS Data on Water Use. A number of users of federal water data we  spoke with told us that USGS\u2019s 5-year data on thermoelectric power plant  water use are the only centralized source of long-term, national data for  comparing water use trends across sectors, including for thermoelectric  power plants. As a result, they are valuable data for informing  policymakers and the public about the state of water resources, including  changes to water use among power plants and other sectors. For example,  one utility representative we spoke with said that USGS data are important  for educating the public about how power plants use water and the fact  that while thermoelectric power plants withdraw large amounts of water  overall\u201439 percent of U.S. freshwater withdrawals in 2000\u2013\u2013their water  consumption as an industry has been low\u20143 percent of U.S. freshwater  consumption in 1995. Furthermore, some state water regulators told us  that USGS\u2019s water use data allow them to compare their state\u2019s water use  to that of other states and better evaluate and plan around their state\u2019s  water conditions. An Arizona Department of Water Resources official, for  example, told us that USGS\u2019s water use data are essential for  understanding how water is used in certain parts of the state where the  Department has no ability to collect such data.", "EIA Data on Water Use. EIA\u2019s annual data are the only federally-collected,  national data available on water use and cooling technologies at individual  power plants; and data users noted that EIA\u2019s national data were useful for  analyzing the water use characteristics of individual plants, as well as for  comparing water use across different cooling technologies. For example,  officials at USGS and the National Energy Technology Laboratory told us  that they use EIA data to research trends in current and future  thermoelectric power plant and other categories of water use. Specifically,  USGS utilizes EIA\u2019s data on individual plant water use, in addition to data  from state water regulators and individual power plants, to develop county  and national estimates of thermoelectric power plant water use. USGS  officials explained that in some of their state offices, such as California  and Texas, agency staff primarily use EIA and other federal data to  develop USGS\u2019s 5-year thermoelectric power plant water use estimates.  Officials from USGS also explained that other USGS state offices use EIA  data on water use to corroborate their estimates of thermoelectric power  plant water withdrawals and to identify the cooling technology utilized by  power plants. Similarly, officials at the National Energy Technology  Laboratory have extensively used EIA\u2019s data on individual power plant  water withdrawals and consumption to develop estimates of how  freshwater use by thermoelectric power plants will change from 2005 to  2030.", "However, data users we spoke with also identified a number of  shortcomings in the federal data on water use, collected by USGS and EIA,  that limits their ability to conduct certain types of industry analyses and  understanding of industry trends. Specifically, they identified the following  issues, along with others that are detailed in appendix V.", "Lack of comprehensive data on the use of advanced cooling technologies.", "Currently, EIA does not systematically collect information on power  plants\u2019 use of advanced cooling technologies. In the EIA database, for  example, data on power plants\u2019 use of advanced cooling technologies is  incomplete and inconsistent\u2014not all power plants report information on  their use of advanced cooling technologies or do so in a consistent way.  Lacking these national data, it is not possible without significant additional  work to comprehensively identify how many power plants are using  advanced cooling technologies, where they are located, and to what extent  the use of these technologies has reduced the use of freshwater. According  to a study by the Electric Power Research Institute, although the total  number of dry cooled plants is still small relative to plants using  traditional cooling systems, the use of advanced cooling technologies is  becoming increasingly common. As these technologies become more  prevalent, we believe that information about their adoption would help  policymakers better understand the extent to which advanced cooling  technologies have been successful in reducing freshwater use by power  plants and identify those areas of the country where further adoption of  these technologies could be encouraged. EIA officials told us they formally  coordinate with a group of selected stakeholders every 3 years to  determine what changes are needed to EIA data collection forms. They  told us they have not previously collected data on advanced cooling  technologies because EIA\u2019s stakeholder consultation process had not  identified these as needed data. However, these officials acknowledged  that EIA has not included USGS as a stakeholder during this consultation  process and were unaware of USGS\u2019 extensive use of their data. In  discussing these concerns, EIA officials also said that they did not expect  that collecting this information would be too difficult and agreed that such  data could benefit various environmental and efficiency analyses  conducted by other federal agencies and water and industry experts.  Furthermore, in discussing our preliminary findings, EIA officials also said  they believed that EIA could collect these data during its triennial review  process by, for example, adding a reporting code for these types of cooling  systems. However, they noted that they would have to begin the process  soon to incorporate it into their ongoing review.", "Lack of comprehensive data on the use of alternative water sources. Our  review of federal data sources indicates that they cannot be used to  comprehensively identify plants using alternative water sources. EIA  routinely reports data on individual plant water sources, but we found that  these data do not always identify whether the source of water is an  alternative source or not. Similarly, while the USGS data identify  thermoelectric power plants using ground, surface, fresh, and saline water,  they do not identify those using alternative water sources, such as  reclaimed water. While a goal of USGS\u2019s water use program is to  document trends in U.S. water use and provide information needed to  understand the nation\u2019s water resources, USGS officials said budget  constraints have limited the water use data the agency can provide, and  has led to USGS discontinuing distribution of data on one alternative  water source\u2014reclaimed water. According to two studies we reviewed,  use of some alternative water sources is becoming more common and,  based on our discussions with regulators and power plant developers,  there is much interest in this nonfreshwater option, particularly in areas  where freshwater is constrained. As use of these alternative water sources  becomes more prevalent, we believe that information about how many  plants are using these resources and in what locations, could help  policymakers better understand how the use of alternative water sources  by power plants can replace freshwater use and help identify those areas  of the country where such substitution could be further encouraged.", "Incomplete water and cooling system data. Though part of EIA\u2019s mission  is to provide data that promote public understanding of energy\u2019s  interaction with the environment, EIA does not collect data on the water  use and cooling systems of two significant components of the  thermoelectric power plant sector. First, in 2002, EIA discontinued its  reporting of water use and cooling technology information for nuclear  plants. According to data users we spoke with, this is a significant  limitation in the federal data on water use and makes it more difficult for  them to monitor trends in the industry. For example, USGS officials said  that the lack of these data make developing their estimates for  thermoelectric power plant water use more difficult because they either  have to use older data or call plants directly for this information, which is  resource intensive. EIA officials told us they discontinued collection of  data from nuclear plants due to priorities stemming from budget  limitations. Second, EIA does not collect water use and cooling system  data from operators of some combined cycle thermoelectric power plants.  Combined cycle plants represented about 25 percent of thermoelectric  capacity in 2007, and constituted the majority of thermoelectric generating  units built from 2000 to 2007. According to EIA officials, water use and  cooling technology data are not collected from operators of combined  cycle plants that are not equipped with duct burning technology\u2014a  technology that injects fuel into the exhaust stream from the combustion  turbine to provide supplemental heat to the steam component of the plant.  However, these plants use a cooling system and water, as do other  combined cycle and thermoelectric power plants whose operators are  required to report to the agency. As a result, data EIA currently collects on  water use and cooling systems for thermoelectric power plants is  incomplete. EIA officials acknowledged that not collecting these data  results in an incomplete understanding of water use by these  thermoelectric power plants; however, budget limitations have thus far  precluded collection of such data.  According to a senior EIA staff in the  Electric Power Division, since speaking with GAO, the agency has begun  exploring options for collecting these data as part of its current data  review process.", "Discontinued distribution of thermoelectric power plant water  consumption data. One of the stated goals of USGS\u2019s water use program  is to document trends in U.S. water use, but officials told us that a lack of  funding has prompted the agency to discontinue distribution of data on  water consumption for thermoelectric power plants and other water  users. These USGS officials told us they would like to restart distribution  of the data on water consumption by thermoelectric power plants and  other water users if additional funding were made available, because such  data can be used to determine the amount of water available for reuse by  others. Similarly, some users of federal water data told us that not having  USGS data on consumption limits their and the public\u2019s understanding of  how power plant water consumption is changing over time, in comparison  to other sectors. They said that the increased use of wet recirculating  technologies, which directly consume more water but withdraw  significantly less than once-through cooling systems, has changed  thermoelectric power plant water use patterns.", "In a 2002 report, the National Research Council recommended that USGS\u2019s  water use program be elevated from one of water use accounting to water  science\u2013\u2013research and analysis to improve understanding of how human  behavior affects patterns of water use. Furthermore, the council\u2019s report  concluded that statistical analysis of explanatory variables, like cooling  system type or water law, is a promising technique for helping determine  patterns in thermoelectric power plant water use. The report suggested  these and other approaches could help USGS improve the quality of its  water use estimates and the value of the water data it reports. USGS has  proposed a national water assessment with the goal of, among other  things, addressing some of the recommendations made by the National  Research Council report. USGS officials also told us such an initiative  would make addressing some of the limitations in USGS water use data  identified by water experts and others possible, such as reporting data on  water consumption and by hydrologic code."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While much of the authority for regulating water use resides at the state  level, the federal government plays an important role in collecting and  distributing information about water availability and water use across the  country that can help promote more effective management of water  resources.

Without this comprehensive  information, policymakers have an incomplete picture of the impact that  thermoelectric power plants will have on water resources in different  regions of the country and will be less able to determine what additional  activities they should encourage for water conservation in these areas.  Moreover, although both EIA and USGS seek to provide timely and  accurate information about the electricity sector\u2019s water use, they have  not routinely coordinated their efforts in a consistent and formal way.

We focused our evaluation on thermoelectric power plants,  such as nuclear, coal, and natural gas plants using a steam cycle. We did  not consider the water supply issues associated with hydroelectric power,  since the process through which these plants use water is substantially  different from that of thermoelectric plants (e.g., water is used as it passes  through a dam but is not directly consumed in the process). We also  focused the review on water used during the production of electricity at  power plants, and did not include water issues associated with extracting  fuels used to produce electricity.", "To understand technologies and other approaches that can help reduce  freshwater use by power plants and their drawbacks, we reviewed  industry, federal, and academic studies on advanced cooling technologies  and alternative water sources that discussed their benefits, such as  reduced freshwater use, and what, if any, drawbacks their implementation  entails. These included studies with information on power plants\u2019 use of  water and the drawbacks of nonfreshwater alternatives conducted by the  Electric Power Research Institute, the Department of Energy\u2019s National  Energy Technology Laboratory, and others. We discussed these trade-offs  with various experts, including power plant and cooling system  manufacturers, such as GEA Power Cooling Inc., General Electric,  Siemens, and SPX Cooling Technologies; other industry groups and  consultants, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, Maulbetsch  Consulting, Nalco, and Tetra Tech; an engineering firm, Black & Veatch;  and federal, national laboratory, and academic sources.

We did not attempt to determine whether states\u2019  efforts were reasonable or effective, rather we only described what states  do to consider water impacts when making power plant siting decisions.  For each of these case study states, we met with state water regulators  and power plant developers to understand how water planning and  permitting decisions are approached from both a regulatory and private  industry perspective. We also met with water research institutions and  other subject matter experts to understand current and future research  related to water impacts of power plants and the extent to which these  research endeavors help inform power plant development proposals and  regulatory water permitting decisions.

In addition, we reviewed state water laws  and policies for thermoelectric power plant water use, selected power  plant operator proposals to use water, and state water regulators\u2019 water  permitting decisions. We also reviewed selected public utility commission  dockets and testimonies describing various power plant siting decisions to  understand what, if any, water issues were addressed.
