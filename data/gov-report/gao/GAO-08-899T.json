These factors led to a June 2006 decision to restructure the program thereby decreasing its complexity, increasing its estimated cost to $12.5 billion, and delaying the first two satellites by 3 to 5 years. GAO was asked to summarize a report being released today that evaluates progress in restructuring the acquisition, assesses the status of key program components and risks, and assesses the agencies' plans for obtaining the data originally planned to be collected by NPOESS sensors, but eliminated by the restructuring."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The NPOESS program office has completed most of the major activities associated with restructuring the acquisition, but key activities remain to be completed. In the past year, the program redefined the program's deliverables, costs, and schedules, and renegotiated the NPOESS contract. However, agency executives have not yet finalized selected acquisition documents. Without executive approval, the program lacks the underlying commitment needed to effectively manage a tri-agency program. In addition, given that DOD has stated it would not release fiscal year 2009 funds to the NPOESS program if key acquisition documents are not completed by August 2008, delays in completing these documents could affect the program's funding and schedule. In the past year, the NPOESS program has made progress in completing development and testing activities associated with the spacecraft, sensors, and ground systems. However, key milestones have been delayed and multiple risks remain. Specifically, poor workmanship and testing delays caused an 8-month slip in the delivery of a complex imaging sensor called the Visible/infrared imager radiometer suite. This late delivery caused a corresponding 8-month delay in the expected launch date of the NPOESS Preparatory Project demonstration satellite, moving it from late September 2009 to early June 2010. Moving forward, risks remain in completing the testing of key sensors and integrating them on the spacecraft, resolving interagency disagreements about the appropriate level of system security, and revising outdated operations and support cost estimates--which program officials say could increase the lifecycle cost by about $1 billion. The program office is aware of these risks and is working to mitigate them, but these issues could affect the program's overall schedule and cost. When the NPOESS restructuring agreement removed four climate and space environment sensors from the program and degraded four others, it led NASA, NOAA, and DOD to reassess their priorities and options for obtaining climate and space environment data. Since the June 2006 restructuring decision, the three agencies have taken preliminary steps to restore the capabilities of selected climate and space weather sensors that were removed from the NPOESS program by prioritizing the sensors, assessing options for restoring them, and making decisions to mitigate near-term data continuity needs by restoring two sensors to the demonstration satellite and one sensor to the first NPOESS satellite. However, the agencies have not yet developed plans on whether and how to replace sensors on a long-term basis as no plans have been made for sensors or satellites after the first satellite of the program. Until such a plan is developed, the agencies may lose their windows of opportunity for selecting cost-effective options or they may resort to an ad hoc approach to restoring these sensors. Almost 2 years have passed since key sensors were removed from the NPOESS program; further delays in establishing a plan could result in gaps in the continuity of climate and space data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This  is  a  work  of  the  U.S.  government  and  is  not  subject  to  copyright  protection  in  the  United  States.

NOAA and DOD share the costs of  funding NPOESS, while NASA funds specific technology projects  and studies. The NPOESS program office is overseen by an  Executive Committee, which is made up of the Administrators of  NOAA and NASA and the Under Secretary of the Air Force.", "NPOESS is a major system acquisition that was originally estimated  to cost about $6.5 billion over the 24-year life of the program from  its inception in 1995 through 2018. The program is to provide  satellite development, satellite launch and operation, and ground- based satellite data processing. These deliverables are grouped into  four main categories: (1) the space segment, which includes the  satellites and sensors; (2) the integrated data processing segment,  which is the system for transforming raw data into environmental  data records (EDR) and is to be located at four data processing  centers; (3) the command, control, and communications segment,  which includes the equipment and services needed to support  satellite operations; and (4) the launch segment, which includes  launch vehicle services.", "When the NPOESS engineering, manufacturing, and development  contract was awarded in August 2002, the cost estimate was  adjusted to $7 billion. Acquisition plans called for the procurement  and launch of six satellites over the life of the program, as well as  the integration of 13 instruments\u2014consisting of 10 environmental  sensors and 3 subsystems. Together, the sensors were to receive  and transmit data on atmospheric, cloud cover, environmental,  climatic, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical observations. The  subsystems were to support non-environmental search and rescue  efforts, sensor survivability, and environmental data collection  activities. The program office considered 4 of the sensors to be  critical because they provide data for key weather products; these  sensors are in bold in table 1, which describes each of the expected  NPOESS instruments.", "In addition, a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS  Preparatory Project (NPP), was planned to be launched several  years before the first NPOESS satellite in order to reduce the risk  associated with launching new sensor technologies and to ensure  continuity of climate data with NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System  satellites. NPP was to host three of the four critical NPOESS  sensors, as well as one other noncritical sensor and to provide the  program office and the processing centers an early opportunity to  work with the sensors, ground control, and data processing  systems.", "When the NPOESS development contract was awarded, the  schedule for launching the satellites was driven by a requirement  that the satellites be available to back up the final POES and DMSP  satellites should anything go wrong during the planned launches of  these satellites. Early program milestones included (1) launching  NPP by May 2006, (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to  back up the final POES satellite launch in March 2008, and (3)  having the second NPOESS satellite available to back up the final  DMSP satellite launch in October 2009.

By November 2005, we estimated that the cost of the  program had grown from $7 billion to over $10 billion. In addition,  the program was experiencing major technical problems with the  VIIRS sensor and expected to delay the launch date of the first  satellite by almost 2 years. These issues ultimately required difficult  decisions to be made about the program\u2019s direction and capabilities.  The Nunn-McCurdy law requires DOD to take specific actions when  a major defense acquisition program cost growth exceeds certain  thresholds. The law requires the Secretary of Defense to notify  Congress when a major defense acquisition is expected to overrun  its current baseline by 15 percent or more and to certify the current  program to Congress when it is expected to overrun its baseline by  25 percent or more. In November 2005, NPOESS exceeded the 25  percent threshold, and DOD was required to certify the program.  Certifying a program entails providing a determination that (1) the  program is essential to national security, (2) there are no  alternatives to the program that will provide equal or greater  military capability at less cost, (3) the new estimates of the  program\u2019s cost are reasonable, and (4) the management structure  for the program is adequate to manage and control costs.

This decision approved a cost  increase of $4 billion over the prior approved baseline cost and  delayed the launch of NPP and the first 2 satellites by roughly 3 to 5  years. The new program also entailed reducing the number of  satellites to be produced and launched from 6 to 4, and reducing the  number of instruments on the satellites from 13 to 9\u2014consisting of 7  environmental sensors and 2 subsystems. It also entailed using  NPOESS satellites in the early morning and afternoon orbits and  relying on European satellites for midmorning orbit data. Table 2  summarizes the major program changes made under the Nunn- McCurdy certification decision.", "The Nunn-McCurdy certification decision established new  milestones for the delivery of key program elements, including  launching NPP by January 2010, launching the first NPOESS satellite  by January 2013, and launching the second NPOESS satellite by  January 2016. These revised milestones deviated from prior plans to  have the first NPOESS satellite available to back up the final POES  satellite should anything go wrong during that launch.", "Delaying the launch of the first NPOESS satellite meant that if the  final POES satellite fails on launch, satellite data users would need  to rely on the existing constellation of environmental satellites until  NPP data becomes available\u2014almost 2 years later. Although NPP  was not intended to be an operational asset, NASA agreed to move  NPP to a different orbit so that its data would be available in the  event of a premature failure of the final POES satellite. If the health  of the existing constellation of satellites diminishes\u2014or if NPP data  is not available, timely, and reliable\u2014there could be a gap in  environmental satellite data.", "In order to reduce program complexity, the Nunn-McCurdy  certification decision decreased the number of NPOESS sensors  from 13 to 9 and reduced the functionality of 4 sensors. Specifically,  of the 13 original sensors, 5 sensors remain unchanged (but 2 are on  a reduced number of satellites), 3 were replaced with older or less  capable sensors, 1 was modified to provide less functionality, and 4  were canceled. The certification decision also made allowances for  the reintegration of the cancelled sensors. Specifically, the program  was directed to build each NPOESS spacecraft with enough room  and power to accommodate the sensors that were removed from the  program and to fund the integration and testing of any sensors that  are later restored. Agency sponsors external to the program would  be responsible for justifying and funding the sensor\u2019s development,  while the NPOESS Executive Committee would have the final  decision on whether to include the sensor on a specific satellite.   Table 3 identifies the changes to the NPOESS instruments.", "The changes in NPOESS sensors affected the number and quality of  the resulting weather and environmental products, called  environmental data records (EDR). In selecting sensors for the  restructured program during the Nunn-McCurdy process, decision  makers placed the highest priority on continuing current operational  weather capabilities and a lower priority on obtaining selected  environmental and climate measuring capabilities. As a result, the  revised NPOESS system has significantly less capability for  providing global climate measures than was originally planned.  Specifically, the number of EDRs was decreased from 55 to 39, of  which 6 are of a reduced quality. The 39 EDRs that remain include  cloud base height, land surface temperature, precipitation type and  rate, and sea surface winds. The 16 EDRs that were removed include  cloud particle size and distribution, sea surface height, net solar  radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and products to depict the  electric fields in the space environment.

For example, NASA and NOAA estimated that they would need to  make a decision on whether to build another satellite to obtain  ocean altimeter data in 2008. Also, the NPOESS program office  estimated that if any sensors are to be restored to an NPOESS  satellite, it would need a decision about 6 years in advance of the  planned satellite launch. Specifically, for a sensor to be included on  the second NPOESS satellite, the sponsoring agency would need to  commit to do so by January 2010.", "Without a timely decision on a plan for restoring satellite data on a  long-term basis, NASA, NOAA, and DOD risk losing their windows  of opportunity on selected options and restoring sensors in an ad  hoc manner. Ultimately, the agencies risk a break in the continuity  of climate and space environment data. As national and  international concerns about climate change and global warming  grow, these data are more important than ever to try to understand  long-term climate trends and impacts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Made Recommendations To Ensure That Future Climate Needs are Addressed and to Complete Restructuring Activities", "paragraphs": ["Because of the importance of effectively managing the NPOESS  program to ensure that there are no gaps in the continuity of critical  weather, environmental, and climate observations, in our  accompanying report we made recommendations to the Secretaries  of Commerce and Defense and to the Administrator of NASA to  establish plans on whether and how to restore the climate and space  sensors removed from the NPOESS program by June 2009, in cases  where the sensors are warranted and justified. In their comments on  the report, all three agencies concurred with our recommendations.  In addition, both the Department of Commerce and NASA reiterated  that they are working with their partner agencies to finalize plans  for restoring sensors.", "In addition, we also reemphasized a recommendation made in our  prior report that the appropriate NASA, NOAA, and DOD executives  immediately finalize key acquisition documents. All three agencies  also concurred with this recommendation. Further, Commerce  noted that DOD and NASA executives need to weigh in to resolve  issues at, or immediately below, their levels in order to ensure  prompt completion of the key acquisition documents. NASA noted  that difficulties in gaining consensus across all three NPOESS  agencies have delayed the signature of key acquisition documents,  and reported that they are committed to moving these documents  through the signature cycle once all of the issues and concerns are  resolved.", "In summary, over the past year, program officials have completed  major activities associated with restructuring the NPOESS program  and have made progress in developing and testing sensors, ground  systems, and the NPP spacecraft. However, multiple risks remain.  Agency executives have still not signed off on key acquisition  documents that were originally to be completed in September 2006,  and now DOD is threatening to withhold funding if the documents  are not completed by August 2008\u2014even though DOD has  contributed to the delays in completing these documents. Also, one  critical sensor has experienced technical problems and schedule  delays that have led program officials to delay the NPP launch date  by about 8 months. Any delay in the NPP launch date shortens the  time available for incorporating lessons learned from NPP onto  future NPOESS missions and could also lead to gaps in critical  climate and weather data. In addition, risks to the program remain  in resolving interagency disagreements on the appropriate level of  system security and in revising estimated costs for satellite  operations and support. The program office is aware of these risks  and is working to mitigate them, but continued problems could  affect the program\u2019s overall schedule and cost.", "When selected climate and space weather sensors were removed  from the NPOESS program during its restructuring, NASA, NOAA,  and DOD became responsible for determining what environmental  data to restore and how to restore them. This responsibility includes  justifying the additional funding needed to develop these sensors  within their respective agency\u2019s investment decision processes. In  the 2 years since the restructuring, the agencies have identified their  priorities and assessed their options for restoring sensor  capabilities. In addition, the agencies made decisions to restore two  sensors to the NPP satellite and one to the first NPOESS satellite in  order to mitigate near-term data gaps. However, the agencies lack  plans for restoring sensor capabilities on a long-term basis. Without  a timely decision on a long-term plan for restoring satellite data, the  agencies risk a break in the continuity of climate and space  environment data. With the increased concern about climate change  and global warming, these data are more important than ever to try  to understand long-term climate trends and impacts.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
