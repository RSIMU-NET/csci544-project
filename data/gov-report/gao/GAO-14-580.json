GAO was asked to review the effects of the PPACA MLR requirements on insurers and enrollees and how rebates would change if agent and broker payments were excluded from the MLR formula. This report examines (1) the extent to which insurers met the PPACA MLR standards, and how much they spent on the MLR components of claims, quality improvement activities, and non-claims costs; (2) the amount of rebates insurers paid and how this amount would have changed with agents' and brokers' commissions and fees excluded from the MLR; and (3) the perspectives of insurers on the effects of the MLR requirements on their business practices.", "To do this work, GAO analyzed the MLR data that insurers reported to CMS for 2011 and 2012 (the most recent data available) at the national level for each insurance market\u2014large group, small group, and individual.

Insurers report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) annually on their PPACA MLRs. More than three quarters of insurers met or exceeded the standards in 2011 and in 2012, and the median MLRs among all insurers were 88 percent. Insurers' MLRs and their spending on claims and non-claims costs varied across different insurance markets. Specifically, insurers in the large group market had higher median MLRs and spent a higher share of their premiums on enrollees' claims and less on non-claims costs, compared to insurers in the individual and small group markets.", "Insurers that did not meet or exceed the PPACA MLR standards in 2011 and 2012 paid rebates in the amounts of $1.1 billion and $520 million (respectively) back to enrollees and policyholders who paid premiums in those years. These amounts would have decreased by about 75 percent had the commissions and fees insurers paid to agents and brokers been excluded from the MLRs. Agents and brokers sell insurance products and provide various services to consumers and groups related to their insurance needs and the commissions and fees charged for these services are included in the MLRs. Insurers in the large group market paid the highest rebate amount ($405 million) across insurance markets in 2011 and insurers in the small group market paid the highest amount ($207 million) in 2012. Insurers in the individual market were more likely to pay rebates than insurers in the small and large group markets. GAO found that rebates would have fallen from $1.1 billion to $272 million in 2011 if the commissions and fees insurers paid to agents and brokers had been excluded from the MLRs, and rebates would have similarly fallen from $520 million to $135 million in 2012. GAO's calculations assumed that insurers did not make other changes in their business practices in response to a different method for calculating MLRs.", "GAO found that most of the eight insurers it interviewed reported that factors other than the PPACA MLR requirements affected their business practices since 2011. All eight insurers reported that they increased their premium rates since 2011 and that they based these decisions on a variety of factors, such as trends in medical care claims, competition with other insurers, and other requirements. Three of the eight insurers stated that the MLR requirements were one among several factors that influenced their decisions about premium rates. Four of the eight insurers stated they had recently made changes to their payments to agents and brokers, and one reported the MLR requirements were a primary driver behind its business decision.

An MLR serves as a basic financial indicator, expressing the percent of  premiums that insurers spend on their enrollees\u2019 medical claims and  quality initiatives, as opposed to administrative expenses or \u201cnon-claims\u201d  costs. The greater the share of enrollees\u2019 premiums spent on medical  claims and quality initiatives, the higher the MLR. These minimum MLR  standards are intended to help ensure that individuals covered under  private health insurance plans (enrollees) receive adequate value for their  premiums and to create incentives for insurers to become more efficient  in their operations. If minimum PPACA MLR standards are not met, then  insurers are required to pay rebates back to their enrollees. Insurers were  required to begin paying rebates under PPACA based on their experience  in 2011. In that year, approximately 80 million individuals were enrolled in  plans sold by insurers that were subject to these PPACA MLR provisions,  according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).", "PPACA MLR provisions require insurers to calculate separate MLRs for  their expenditure of premiums for each market (large group, small group,  and individual) in each state in which they do business, and require  higher minimum MLR standards for plans sold in the large group market  than for plans sold in the small group and individual markets. CMS  oversees the MLR standards and issues regulations to identify insurers\u2019  expenses that are to be counted as claims and quality improvement  activities, as well as non-claims costs.

For  example, while insurance industry representatives have expressed  concern that the requirements could result in insurers leaving certain  markets in some states, causing instability in those markets, consumer  advocates and others have asserted that the requirements have resulted  in greater transparency for enrollees regarding how insurers are using  their premiums. In addition, the agent and broker industry and others  have raised concerns that counting agent and broker compensation as a  non-claims cost in calculating the MLR could cause insurers to decrease  that compensation, which could reduce the availability of agents and  brokers to assist consumers in choosing a health plan to meet their  needs. Some groups advocating for consumers, however, believe that counting agent and broker compensation as a non-claims cost provides  an appropriate incentive for insurers to reduce such costs while not  unduly impacting the ability of agents and brokers to assist consumers.", "You asked us to review the effects of the PPACA MLR requirements on  enrollees and insurers as well as how excluding agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019  commissions and fees from the MLR would affect the rebates that  insurers pay.

None of the insurers we  interviewed reported that the PPACA MLR requirements have generally  influenced their spending on QI activities since 2011, and all eight  insurers reported other influencing factors, such as customer and  employer demand for QI programs, competition among insurers, and the  goal of improving enrollees\u2019 health outcomes, which in turn could lower  the use and costs of health care services.", "Five of the eight insurers we interviewed also commented that the 2013  PPACA MLR calculation, which is based on a 3-year period including  2013 and the prior 2 years, will likely reduce some of the effects in the  MLR formula of year-to-year variability in enrollees\u2019 medical claims.  Variability in medical claims occurs when actual and expected medical  claims differ, and one source of such variability is the effect of large  claims. One insurer, who paid rebates in 2011, noted that it would not  have owed rebates had the MLR formula been based on 3 years of  insurers\u2019 experience. In comparison, another insurer told us that it will  likely owe rebates for 2013 because the MLR data it reported in 2011 and  2012 will be averaged into 2013. The insurer added that over time,  however, it believes the 3-year MLR formula should be beneficial for the  insurer by reducing the likelihood of owing rebates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to HHS for comment.
