Of these properties, 81 are currently being used to provide a range of homeless assistance services nationwide. Such services include transitional housing, referral services, and emergency shelter. However, few of the properties that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has listed as suitable and available since the program's inception received applications from homeless assistance providers. In most cases, the properties may not have actually been practical for homeless service providers to use. For example, in 2013 about 80 percent of these properties were for off-site use only\u2014meaning that a provider would need to physically move the property in order to use it. HUD officials told us that they would prefer that agencies not be required to report certain types of properties at all, such as those for off-site use only. The current statutory requirement for agencies to report all properties that fall within four broad categories\u2014excess, surplus, underutilized, and unutilized\u2014may not be effective for certain types of properties. Such exclusion could allow HUD officials to focus on the suitable and available properties that may be more likely to assist the homeless.", "Of the 11 homeless assistance providers we interviewed, the eight case study providers that acquired property cited benefits from the Title V homeless assistance program, such as expanding services and obtaining real property at no cost. These benefits notwithstanding, the providers identified challenges, such as identifying available properties. These findings are consistent with reports from national homeless advocacy organizations. HUD reports properties in the Federal Register multiple times a year as required. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), which plays a coordination role, provides a link on its website to the HUD reports. Nonetheless, according to national homeless advocates, many homeless assistance providers remain unaware of the availability of properties because the Federal Register is not user-friendly. Further, HUD lists many of the same properties more than once in the Federal Register , as required, even though they may not be useful to homeless assistance providers. In the past, some in Congress and the executive branch have raised issues about reporting requirements; the basic issue has been that some requirements result in reports that may be burdensome to produce, or not very useful. Modifying reporting requirements to reduce the frequency of reporting related to properties that are less likely to be useful to homeless providers could help, while also allowing HUD to continue to fulfill its responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider changing (1) the scope of properties to be reported to HUD with respect to the types of properties that may be less likely to be useful to assist the homeless and (2) the frequency of Federal Register reporting."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Estimates of the homeless population in the United States vary widely.  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  610,042 people in the United States were homeless on a single night in  January 2013, and more than a third of these people were living in  unsheltered locations, such as under bridges, in cars, or in abandoned  buildings. According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and  Poverty, the numbers of Americans experiencing homelessness is  estimated between 1.5 million to 3.5 million in a given year. At the same  time, we have previously reported that federal agencies continue to hold  thousands of unneeded and underutilized properties that annually cost  the government over a billion dollars to operate. As a result of this and  other long-standing problems, we have designated federal real property  as a high-risk area. Title V of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance  Act (the Act), as amended, created a program to assist the homeless, in  part, by using public resources and programs\u2014including unused federal  real property\u2014in a more coordinated manner to meet the needs of  homeless Americans.", "In general, Title V of the Act requires federal landholding agencies to  identify and make available for homeless assistance real property under  their control that they are not fully utilizing or no longer need before  properties are disposed through other means. If a property is published  by HUD as suitable and available, eligible applicants, such as homeless  assistance providers and local governments, may apply to obtain the real  property at no cost for the provision of a broad range of services for the  homeless, including shelter, job training, and storage.", "However, implementing the Title V homeless assistance program  requirements has presented challenges. Our prior work has found that  legal and budgetary challenges continue to hamper agencies\u2019 disposal  efforts. Since much of the unneeded federal real property may have no  remaining useful life, may require extensive environmental remediation,  may be located within secure compounds, or require off-site removal, it,  for example, may not be useful to assist the homeless.determine how this program is performing both in terms of government  operations and for homeless assistance providers. This report addresses  two objectives:  1.  The identification and transfer of federal real properties for homeless  assistance under the Title V homeless assistance program.  2.  The benefits and challenges homeless assistance providers and  national advocacy organizations reported in identifying, acquiring, and  using federal real property, and potential actions that could help  address these challenges.", "To determine what is known about the identification and transfer of  federal real properties for homeless assistance under Title V, we  reviewed the requirements of Title V of the Act as they apply to the  General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), HUD, and the U.S. Interagency Council on  Homelessness (USICH). We obtained estimates from HUD of the number  of underutilized, unutilized, excess, and surplus properties reported by  landholding agencies and the number that HUD determined to be suitable  and published as available for homeless use since the program\u2019s  inception in 1987 through March 31, 2014\u2014the date of the most recently  available information. To assess the reliability of these estimates, we  interviewed officials from HUD about how the estimates were derived and  determined that the information provided by the agency provides a  reasonable basis, with caveats, for reporting the number of properties that  have been screened and found suitable and available. In addition, to  determine the types of properties reported, we analyzed HUD\u2019s annual  reports of suitable/available and suitable/unavailable properties for years  2008 through 2013. This time frame was selected to include the 5 years  prior to this audit. When HUD\u2019s annual report for 2013 became available,  we added it to the analysis to include the most recent information. From  HHS, we also obtained documents and data on the number of notices of  interest and applications it received for properties made available for  homeless assistance from the program\u2019s inception in 1987 through March  31, 2014. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed officials  from HHS about how the data are collected and maintained, and the  importance to the agency of ensuring the completeness of this data, and  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report. To understand how federal landholding agencies identify and  report real property to HUD pursuant to the Act\u2019s requirements, we  selected nine landholding agencies to include a range of size among real  property portfolios of land and buildings, including GSA, HHS, the three  Department of Defense service branches\u2013\u2013the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force,  and U.S. Navy\u2013\u2013the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of the  Interior (DOI) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).from GSA, HHS, HUD, and USICH to understand how they process  properties reported under Title V homeless assistance program   We interviewed agency officials  requirements. We also interviewed agency officials from the nine  landholding agencies to obtain their views on how they meet the Act\u2019s  requirements and their impact on each agency\u2019s disposal process. To  determine the benefits and challenges that homeless assistance  providers and national advocacy organizations report in identifying,  acquiring, and using federal real property and potential actions that could  help address those challenges, we selected eight homeless assistance  organizations that acquired federal real property under the program  based on criteria such as the size of the real property acquired under the  program, the services provided, geographic distribution, range of  experiences, and suggestions from agencies and homeless advocacy  organizations. We interviewed representatives from each of the selected  organizations, reviewed documentation, and conducted site visits to two  properties transferred under the Title V homeless assistance program.  We also convened a virtual discussion panel comprised of  representatives from three homeless assistance organizations whose  applications for federal real property were not approved and interviewed  representatives from two national homelessness-advocacy organizations   We  (see app. 1 for more information on our scope and methodology).conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Among these, the Title V homeless assistance program  requires federal landholding agencies to make available real property that  they identify as excess, surplus, unutilized, or underutilized for possible  use to assist the homeless. Title V of the Act designated GSA, HHS, and  HUD to administer the program. In addition, Title II of the Act created  what is now known as USICH, an independent establishment within the  Executive Branch whose mission is to coordinate the federal response to  homelessness. The mission of USICH is to create a national partnership  to act as a coordinating body between the federal government and the  private sector to end homelessness nationally. Title V specifies a number  of steps that federal landholding agencies, the three federal agency  administrators of the program, and USICH must take to make federal real  property\u2014including land and buildings, or both\u2014available for homeless  assistance. Figure 1 summarizes key steps in the process and the time  frames required to perform those steps.", "HUD canvass: HUD surveys the landholding agencies that must identify  and report to HUD on a quarterly basis real property that is excess,  surplus, underutilized, or unutilized (see table 1).", "Once landholding agencies (currently 25 in total) receive HUD\u2019s quarterly  canvassing letter, they have 25 days to respond. To collect such  information, HUD asks landholding agencies to complete a \u201cTitle V  checklist\u201d for each of the excess, surplus, underutilized, or unutilized  properties that they have identified and are required to report. The  checklist is a HUD document that requires the landholding agency to  provide a variety of summary information about the real property,  including its utilization status, accessibility (e.g., in a remote location or  behind a secure perimeter), environmental condition, agency contacts,  and other information (see app. II for an example of this checklist).", "Suitability determination: HUD assigns each reported real property a  unique identification number and enters the checklist information into an  electronic database. Based on the checklist, HUD must determine the  suitability of each real property for homeless assistance. According to  implementing regulations, all real property\u2013\u2013land, buildings, or both\u2013\u2013are  suitable unless a property\u2019s characteristics include one or more of the  following conditions: national security concerns, meaning a property is located in an area  where the general public is denied access in the interest of national  security;  flammable or explosive materials within 2000 feet of the property;  located in an airport runway clear zone or military airfield clear zone;  located in a floodway; documented deficiencies, meaning a property with a documented and  extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal  physical safety, including structural damage or certain types of  environmental contamination; or  inaccessible, meaning a property is not accessible by road.", "After HUD makes a suitability determination, it is to provide this  information to the reporting landholding agencies for review, as well as for  the Federal Register listing that briefly describes the property\u2019s condition  and status (e.g., underutilized, unutilized, excess, or surplus).  Landholding agencies then have 45 days to make any edits, as noted in  figure 1, such as changes in the property\u2019s status. In addition, landholding  agencies must transmit to HUD a statement of the availability of real  property, declaring for example that a property is available for homeless  assistance or explaining why a property cannot be made available for  homeless assistance, such as in the case of a further compelling federal  need for the property.", "HUD also communicates with GSA, the federal government\u2019s real-  property disposal agent, to identify excess real properties that landholding  agencies have reported to GSA for disposal. If, however, a landholding  agency reports real property to GSA that has not been submitted to HUD  for a Title V suitability determination, GSA is required to create a Title V  checklist and forward it to HUD.", "Publication of properties and holding period: Title V requires HUD to  publish in the Federal Register all properties it reviewed. HUD\u2019s Federal  Register listings typically classify these properties as: 1) suitable and  available for homeless assistance; 2) suitable but unavailable for  homeless assistance; or 3) unsuitable for homeless assistance. Once  published, homeless assistance providers\u2013\u2013including state and local  governments or eligible private non-profit organizations\u2013\u2013have 60 days  to submit a \u201cnotice of interest\u201d for suitable and available properties, and  then 90 days from the date of the \u201cnotice of interest,\u201d to submit an  application to HHS. The real property is not available for any other  purpose during the 60-day or 90-day period or during the period in which  HHS reviews the application. Interested parties also have 20 days to  challenge the suitability determination of real property HUD found  unsuitable for homeless assistance. If a notice of interest is not filed for a  suitable and available real property within 60 days of its listing in the  Federal Register, the disposal agency may then proceed with its routine  disposal process, in accordance with applicable law.", "In addition to publication in the Federal Register, the requirements of Title  V require GSA, HHS, and HUD to make such efforts as are necessary to  ensure the widest possible dissemination of the listing information of  available properties. For example, HUD is required to forward lists of all  real property published in the Federal Register to USICH, which then  must distribute relevant portions of the list to state and regional homeless  coordinators. Also, when HUD determines an excess real property is  suitable and publishes it in the Federal Register as available, the  implementing regulations require GSA to concurrently notify HHS, HUD,  and state and local governments, in addition to homeless assistance  providers that have expressed interest in the particular real property, and  other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable properties.", "Notices of interest and application: HHS is to evaluate applications of  homeless assistance providers on a first-come, first-serve basis using five  criteria defined in HHS implementing regulations.additional criteria for the application package for a given real property if it  deems it necessary.

The court issued an order  in 1993 imposing requirements beyond those mandated by the statute  and implementing regulations, such as more comprehensive reporting  requirements and expanded outreach. Unlike the 1993 District Court  order, a more recent 2013 order does not require widespread changes to  operational administration of the Title V homeless assistance program but  rather seeks to better educate the landholding agencies about canvassing  their real property and improving the quality of data reported by these  agencies for Title V requirements and the Federal Real Property Profile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "122 Properties Transferred Have Provided a Range of Homeless Assistance Services, but Many Properties Reported and Deemed Suitable for Homeless Assistance May Not Be Useful for That Purpose", "paragraphs": ["Under the Title V homeless assistance program, providers have used  over 100 transferred properties since program inception through March  31, 2014, to deliver a range of services across the country.

A landholding  agency may indicate on the Title V checklist, for example, that a property  has extensive deterioration, but according to HUD officials, if the  landholding agency does not provide supporting documentation, HUD  may deem the property suitable for homeless assistance. As a result,  HUD designates many properties as suitable with deficiencies that may  therefore make them less desirable to homeless assistance providers.  The suitability criteria in HUD\u2019s regulation for implementing the Title V  homeless assistance program include provisions for excluding properties  with deficiencies such as contamination, structural damage or extensive  deterioration that are documented, extensive, and considered by HUD as  representing a clear threat to personal safety. For example, while HUD  did not determine conditions to rise to the level of a \u201cdocumented  deficiency,\u201d our analysis of the 630 suitable and available properties  reported in the HUD\u2019s 2013 annual report found properties with conditions  described as \u201cdeteriorated\u201d (35 properties) and in \u201cvery poor condition\u201d  (18 properties).", "Moreover, almost 80 percent of the properties published as suitable and  available in 2013 were for \u201coff-site use only.\u201d These properties refer to  buildings and other removable structures that are located on land that is  not surplus and, therefore, must be removed and relocated. According to  officials from the National Law Center, the costs of moving the building,  preparing the land on which to relocate the building, and making  improvements needed to convert the building to provide services are  often beyond the budget of the homeless-assistance service providers.", "Officials from four of our nine selected landholding agencies told us they  believe that properties for off-site use only are not practical for homeless  assistance services. In addition, although an HHS official with  responsibility for the Title V program told us that four of the 122 properties  transferred under the Title V homeless assistance program were made  available for off-site use only, these properties were trailers, which are  designed to be easily moved, as opposed to other types of off-site  properties described below, which may not be easy to move. For 2013,  the most recent year reported, of the 630 properties HUD listed as  suitable and available in the annual report, 78 percent were for \u201coff-site  use only\u201d (see table 4).", "Since the majority of properties reported as suitable and available in 2013  were for off-site use only, as a result, they may be impractical for  homeless assistance. For example, according to U.S. Army officials,  since most of the Army\u2019s properties reported under Title V are located on  secured installations and do not involve the transfer of land, these  properties are often made available to homeless assistance providers for  \u201coff-site use only.\u201d In addition, because most buildings in the Army\u2019s  inventory consist of masonry and steel, the removal of these properties is  costly. As a result, U.S. Army officials said that very few homeless  assistance providers have expressed interest in Army properties  designated for \u201coff-site use\u201d since the program\u2019s inception. Similarly,  DOI officials told us that because the agency does not relinquish federal  park lands, the buildings published as suitable and available located  within federal parks are also designated for \u201coff-site use only.\u201d Many  federal park lands are in remote areas, and moving a building from those  locations can be costly.", "USICH\u2019s 2011 agency annual report stated that, because of the wide  latitude in the suitability standard, a clear majority of the properties HUD  finds \u201csuitable\u201d are not actually practical for homeless assistance. noted above, HUD considers all property suitable for homeless  assistance unless a property\u2019s characteristics meet one or more of six  conditions, such as national security concerns or location in a floodway.  The relatively large numbers of properties deemed by HUD to be suitable  and that were available may give homeless assistance providers, the  public, and other stakeholders a false impression as to what properties  are of practical use for homeless assistance because they included a  large proportion of properties that have substantial deficiencies.

However, HUD\u2019s database does not have the capability  to generate reports on properties or data for the purpose of analyzing the  properties reported for the Title V homeless assistance program. For  example, when we asked HUD for reports from the database in order to  perform our own analysis, such as the total number of properties  reviewed for suitability and the total number published as suitable and  available since program inception, the agency was unable to provide  these data to us. The database was designed, and is primarily used, to  generate listings of properties for publication in the Federal Register. The  PDF format of the Federal Register reports poses challenges for  automated analysis, and as a result, we had to manually count numbers  of properties in specific categories to ensure the validity of our analysis,  such as those for off-site use only reported in table 4.

In  addition, federal information technology guidance for publicly available  data states that accessible data should be made available in convenient,  modifiable formats that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and  searched. As the database cannot produce reports on the properties,  HUD relies on hard-copy record keeping, which limits HUD\u2019s ability to  make information on properties readily available, requiring labor intensive  use of resources to find needed data. This capability is important because  Title V requires HUD to make available to the public upon request all  information in its possession about all properties reviewed and not  identified as suitable for the homeless\u2014about 30,000 properties  according to HUD\u2019s estimate\u2014including the reasons such properties were  not so identified.litigation, the plaintiffs hired a contractor to make copies of the requested   Moreover, HUD officials told us that during the recent  data from HUD\u2019s hard copy files, and it took three individuals several  weeks to complete the task. Without a comprehensive database that  maintains this information, HUD would need to respond to such a request  on up to 30,000 properties by manually looking through files, which would  not be an efficient use of resources. Because HUD uses the database  primarily for generating listings, it has not assessed the extent to which  the benefits of modifying the database to generate electronic reports for  the purposes of responding to information requests or performing  analysis, or if developing a new database to do so would outweigh the  costs.

For example, DOE  properties typically include radiological contaminants commingled with  other metals and chemicals associated with nuclear research and  production. In our prior work, DOE also told us that the department  understood the need to screen excess real property, but that much of  its portfolio to be disposed had no remaining useful life and was most  often located within a secure compound.", "DOI officials said that they are required to\u2013\u2013and do\u2013\u2013report to HUD  on numerous small, remotely located properties in National Parks that  they have decided to dispose.

Officials also told us that in 2013, 73  properties, mainly small houses on National Park lands were  determined suitable but for off-site use only, yet the majority of these  properties were in such poor condition that they could not be moved.  In addition, DOI officials said that they do not report to HUD real  property that is only used seasonally as unutilized or underutilized  because the agency will use the properties again in the following  season. The Title V homeless assistance program checklist, however,  expressly asks whether an underutilized property is used seasonally  (see app. II: HUD Title V Checklist Submitted to Landholding  Agencies, item 6B).", "EPA officials noted that although some of its laboratories are only  partially used, they do not report these as underutilized real property  for HUD\u2019s Title V canvas because they do not believe they are  required to do so. Rather, EPA\u2019s practice has been to report that it  does not have any underutilized or unutilized properties for each  quarterly canvass because the space is laboratory space that agency  officials do not think is practical for homeless assistance programs.  EPA officials said that they are currently conducting a space utilization  study for laboratories, and after the study is completed, they will  determine whether to report underutilized and unutilized properties  identified through the study.", "GSA officials told us that as a provider of space to other federal  agencies, GSA properties are sometimes temporarily or partially  vacant as the space needs of tenant agencies fluctuate. GSA officials  said that they do not consider these properties to be underutilized and  unutilized because the agency plans to use them to house future  federal tenants. GSA officials said that if they identified underutilized  and unutilized property in the portfolio that was not to be reported as  excess, they would report these to HUD\u2019s canvass. However, GSA  could not identify any such properties that it had reported to HUD in  the 6 years from 2008 through 2013. Nonetheless, even if GSA  identified a future need for temporarily or partially vacant space, it, like  other agencies, has two opportunities to inform HUD as to why  reported properties may not be available: first, the HUD Title V  checklist asks reporting landholding agencies to provide information  on any current or anticipated limitations for using the property to assist  the homeless for a period of one year or more; second, landholding  agencies are required to provide statements to HUD on the availability  of properties determined suitable, including reasons why the property  cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the  homeless.", "HUD officials told us that they review and make a suitability determination  only for those properties reported to them by landholding agencies and  that they do not have a way of knowing how many properties should be,  but are not reported. In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia noted that many landholding agencies appeared to be \u201cfailing to  fairly and accurately\u201d report Title V homeless assistance program-eligible  properties as required under both the statute and Order. Further, the  court noted that there was a significant discrepancy between the numbers  of properties reported to HUD under Title V and the much larger number  of federal properties listed as \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cunderutilized\u201d in other  government reports and surveys. The District Court ordered several steps  to ensure the proper reporting of properties including that GSA and HUD  develop a plan for additional improved training programs for landholding  agencies. To address the court order, GSA and HUD officials told us they  conducted a joint webinar with HHS in November 2013 for landholding  agencies.", "HUD officials told us that they would prefer that agencies not be required  to report certain types of properties at all because they may not be useful  to assist the homeless. Requiring agencies to report all properties that fall  within the four broad categories\u2014excess, surplus, underutilized, and  unutilized\u2014may not be effective for certain types of properties. While  there are discretionary elements in HUD\u2019s suitability criteria that are  applied to properties submitted by the landholding agencies, HUD does  not have the authority to release agencies from their statutorily required  reporting of certain types of properties. Excluding certain types of  properties such as \u201coff-site use only properties\u201d could enable HUD  officials to focus on the suitable and available properties that may be  more likely to assist the homeless and could help address issues of  landholding agencies not reporting certain properties. In 2013, HUD  proposed a revision to the law that would limit some of the types of  properties agencies report, such as those that are located in high security  areas and any building or structure that is made available for off-site use  only.

Thus, due to the lack of available data in a format that allowed  analysis, HUD provided us with estimates of the number of underutilized,  unutilized, excess, and surplus properties reported by landholding  agencies and the number that HUD determined to be suitable and were  available for homeless use from the early 1990s through March 31, 2014.  These estimates are based on the number of properties that were entered  into HUD\u2019s Title V database, developed in the early 1990s, several years  after the McKinney-Vento Act was implemented. Further, HUD officials  are not certain of the extent to which the database includes the Title V  homeless assistance program properties reported prior to its creation.  Due to the lack of available data in a format conducive to analysis, we  could not verify the reliability of these estimates. We interviewed officials  from HUD about how the estimates were derived and could not verify the  reliability of these estimates. To assess the reliability of these estimates,  we interviewed officials from HUD about how the estimates were derived  and determined that the information provided by the agency provides a  reasonable basis, with caveats, for reporting the number of properties that  have been screened and published as suitable and available. In addition,  to determine the number of properties reported in these categories and  the number and percentage of these that were available for \u201coff-site use  only,\u201d we analyzed HUD annual reports of suitable/available and  suitable/unavailable properties for years 2008 through 2013. This time  frame was selected to include the 5 years prior to the audit, and when  HUD\u2019s annual report for 2013 became available we added it to the  analysis to include the most recent information. Our analysis of the  Federal Register notices relied on identifying properties by the unique  Property Identification (ID) number published with each property listing.  We also obtained from HHS documents and data on the number of  notices of interest and applications received for federal real property  made available for homeless assistance and on the number, location, and  use of properties transferred from the program\u2019s inception in 1987  through March 31, 2014\u2014the date of the most recently available  information.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed officials from HHS  about how the data are collected and maintained and the steps taken by  the agency to ensure the completeness of these data. Based on this  discussion, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. In order to assess the number of properties that  received notices of interest and applications from interested providers, we  also manually reviewed data on notices of interest and applications  received to identify potential duplicate properties by GSA number,  property name, location, and description. To understand how federal  landholding agencies identify and report real property to HUD pursuant to  the Act\u2019s requirements, we selected nine landholding agencies to include  a range of size among real property portfolios of land and buildings.  These agencies were GSA; HHS; the Departments of Defense\u2019s U.S.  Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Navy; the Departments of Energy; the  Interior and Veterans Affairs; and the Environmental Protection Agency.  When combined, these nine landholding agencies accounted for almost  90 percent of the buildings held by the federal government in 2012.  We  collected documents from these agencies to understand how each  agency manages and fulfills its reporting requirements under Title V, the  extent to which it collaborates with other agencies, and to obtain views on  how Title V requirements impact the federal real property disposal  process. We interviewed agency officials from the GSA, HHS, and HUD  to understand how they process properties reported under Title V  homeless assistance program requirements, and we interviewed officials  from USICH to understand its role with Title V. We also interviewed  agency officials from the nine landholding agencies to obtain their views  on how they meet the Act\u2019s requirements and the impact of those  requirements on each agencies disposal process.", "To determine the benefits and challenges selected homeless assistance  providers and national advocacy organizations reported in identifying,  acquiring and using federal real property, and the potential actions that  could help address those challenges, we selected eight homeless  assistance organizations that acquired federal real property under the  program. The providers were: the City of Redmond, Washington;  Crossroads Community, Inc.; Samaritan House; The Miami-Dade County  Homeless Trust; Third Way Center; Urban Renewal Corporation;  Veterans Coming Home/New Life Evangelistic Center; and Volunteers of  America, Los Angeles. We made our selection using criteria such as the  size of the real property acquired under the program, the services  provided, geographic distribution, range of experiences with the Title V  program, and suggestions from agencies and homeless advocacy  organizations (GSA, HUD, HHS, USICH, the National Law Center on  Homelessness and Poverty, and the National Coalition for the Homeless).  In addition, to assist the selection, we also used information from news  reports and our literature review to identify high-profile properties. We  interviewed representatives from each of the selected organizations,  reviewed their annual utilization reports, and conducted site visits to two  properties transferred under Title V. While information from case studies  is not generalizable, the perspectives of the homeless service providers  provided us with examples of the benefits and challenges associated with  the program. Further, to gain additional perspectives on experiences with  the federal agencies and the application process, and identify potential  improvements to the process, we convened a virtual discussion panel  comprised of representatives from homeless assistance organizations  whose Title V applications were not approved. We selected and recruited  seven organizations, of which three agreed to participate in the panel.  These organizations were selected from HHS\u2019s Title V homeless  assistance program applicant data from 2006 through 2013 based on  their geographic locations and proposed use of the properties. We  selected the particular time frame to ensure that the information provided  was reasonably up to date. Since the virtual discussion panel was  selected using a non-probability sample of homeless assistance  applicants whose Title V applications were declined by HHS, like the case  studies, their experiences cannot be generalized to all homeless service  providers. In addition, we reviewed the reports and interviewed  representatives of two national advocacy organizations\u2014the National  Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty and the National Coalition for  the Homeless.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to  September 2014 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
