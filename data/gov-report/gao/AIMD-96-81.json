Information is needed to perform functions like deploying troops for wartime, packing and shipping cargo for transport, and drawing plans for ship loading. Because today\u2019s defense strategies use fewer forward deployed troops and equipment, the transportation function and the information systems supporting it have become increasingly important. During fiscal year 1995, the total cost of common-user Defense transportation amounted to about $6 billion. For the same period, USTRANSCOM spent approximately $164.5 million on information technology to support transportation services.", "While transportation is crucial to achieving U.S. military objectives, Defense transportation business operations are very similar or identical, in some cases, to those of the commercial transportation industry. This commonality enables Defense to rely on the commercial transportation industry to meet about 85 percent of its peacetime and wartime transportation needs. Moreover, commercial transportation providers and port management authorities have developed or purchased their own automated information systems to perform many of the same functions as defense transportation performs, such as those for moving passengers, documenting and reporting on cargo, and operating sea and aerial ports. Defense itself recognizes the similarities between itself and the commercial transportation sector in its policies and procedures, which call for using commercial automated information systems when feasible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Widely Recognized Defense Transportation Deficiencies Persist", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, various studies, commissions, and internal DOD reports have noted that military transportation processes are fragmented, outdated, inefficient, and costly. In addition, Defense has long recognized that timely, accurate, and comprehensive information on transportation activities would greatly increase its effectiveness. For example: In 1992, GAO reported serious problems with the services\u2019 deployment data bases during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Inaccurate and incomplete database information resulted in erroneous lift requirements, inefficient use of lift, and revisions to movement routing and scheduling. Defense was forced to rely on informal, personal communication and manual methods to obtain the correct amount of lift and to determine which units were ready to move.", "According to a Defense report on Operation Desert Shield/Storm logistics, military airport facilities became so overloaded with high-priority sustainment cargo that other cargo was hastily repacked into shipping containers with partial documentation or without any documentation and reshipped by surface transport. Because little or no documentation accompanied the cargo, over half of the 40,000 containers sent to Saudi Arabia had to be reopened to determine their contents. In 1993, GAO reported that Defense\u2019s ability to effectively manage its transportation operations was limited, in part, because of redundancy and the lack of standardization among its automated information systems. Specifically, we noted, and Defense agreed, that the Continental United States Freight Management System (CFM) would duplicate functions which are similar or identical to transportation systems concurrently under development by the Air Force, Marine Corps, Army, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). In a 1994 report, Reengineering the Defense Transportation System: The \u201cOught To Be\u201d Defense Transportation System for the Year 2010, Defense recognized that change to transportation business processes is key to realizing large cost savings and performance improvements. Defense further maintained that nothing less than fundamental change would be required to achieve such gains in savings and productivity. In 1995, Defense reported that the lack of visibility over shipments and units entering a theater of operations has been a chronic problem experienced in every major U.S. deployment during the 20th century. The report asserted that acquisition of transportation automated information systems providing more timely, accurate, and complete information would help resolve the problem. In early 1996, GAO reported that Defense common-user transportation costs were two to three times higher than comparable commercial carrier costs. Higher costs were attributed, in part, to fragmented business processes and an inefficient organizational structure.", "The Congress also is concerned about continuing problems in defense transportation and has taken legislative action to reduce its costs. The House Committee on National Security, in its report on the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, estimated that approximately $100 million could be saved each year if commissaries and exchanges are allowed to contract directly, using the most cost-effective carriers to transport products overseas. Subsequently, the Congress approved a provision in the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 authorizing the commissaries and military exchanges to negotiate directly with private carriers for the most cost-effective transportation of commissary and exchange supplies by sea without relying on the Military Sealift Command or the Military Traffic Management Command.", "Although Defense has repeatedly attempted to correct its transportation problems over the years, many of its actions have been directed toward the acquisition of information technology to address problems rather than through a complete analysis of its business processes. Such an analysis would identify the root causes of Defense\u2019s transportation problems. Identification of the root causes helps an organization focus on appropriate means for addressing the problem and serves to direct resources where needed to achieve quality improvements in operations. These process improvements, in turn, provide the basis for the acquisition of technology to support the newly improved processes.

JTCC\u2019s primary objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the DTS by using business process reengineering techniques, designating and implementing migration systems selections, and leading data standardization efforts. By migrating to 28 transportation systems, Defense estimated in February 1996 that it would save $240 million over a 6-year period, primarily through elimination of duplicate legacy systems.

In addition, in November 1993, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence issued criteria requiring that migration systems selection consider a reasonable range of alternatives.", "However, in selecting systems for migration, Defense did not adequately consider alternatives available in other parts of the government and/or the commercial sector. As a result, it has little assurance that the systems it chose are the most cost-effective and appropriate. The degree to which Defense considered alternatives to the systems chosen varies from system to system. However, in all cases, alternatives were not considered to the extent that Defense\u2019s own guidance calls for.

However, JTCC officials could provide no documented analysis to support this conclusion.", "Seven migration systems were selected after considering a narrow range of alternatives.", "The remaining four systems were designated \u201cinterim\u201d systems because Defense believes alternative solutions exist for these systems.

However, this review was inadequate because it did not analyze the degree to which unmodified software could meet unique Defense requirements, identify the expected cost to make necessary software modifications, determine the time required to make modifications, and provide for a hands-on view of the software in operation.", "While the study determined that about 700 commercially available software packages provided some degree of transportation functionality, 24 were selected for a final detailed review. Out of the 24 finalists, JTCC concluded that (1) none would fully support Defense\u2019s transportation requirements without modified software and (2) required modifications could not be made before March 1997 at an acceptable cost. Although Defense asserts that required modifications would be costly, it could not provide documented analysis to support this conclusion. Further, Defense plans to make $13 million worth of software modifications to just five of its in-house selections.", "Also, despite Defense\u2019s conclusion regarding the inability of commercially available software to fully support transportation requirements, a government contractor is making extensive use of one of the rejected products in its development of the Global Transportation Network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Selected Migration Systems Is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["To meet the March 1997 deadline mandated in the Deputy Secretary\u2019s October 1993 memorandum, Defense selected transportation migration systems based on incomplete, unverified cost data without comparing all the benefits of each system. Consequently, there is little assurance that these selected systems will help contain the cost of performing Defense\u2019s transportation mission to any great extent or bring about the benefits envisioned by the migration strategy.", "Defense regulations stress the importance of considering system costs and benefits to ensure that correct, well-informed decisions are made about information systems. DOD Directive 8120.1 and DOD Instruction 7041.3 require preparation of a functional economic analysis to document all costs (both direct and indirect), all quantifiable benefits, and all significant nonquantifiable benefits. Also, the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Transportation Policy identifies conducting objective analyses that show favorable investment returns as the best way to ensure funding for migration systems. To be useful in making fully informed business decisions, such cost information should be complete and verified.", "Instead of preparing the required functional economic analyses and documenting investment returns, Defense selected its transportation migration systems based primarily on a system\u2019s ability to meet current functional requirements. After the selections were made, JTCC continued to analyze savings projections associated with migration systems. This later analysis culminated in a January 1996 study discussed at the end of this section."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "JTCC\u2019s Migration Systems Selection Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Had Defense followed its own regulations and calculated investment returns, it would have found\u2014based on data available when the migration systems were selected\u2014that two of the selected systems would lose money if implemented as migration systems.

At least $18 million in costs were excluded: $16 million for JTCC\u2019s analysis of candidate migration systems and $2 million for maintaining migration system hardware. The magnitude of other exclusions remains unknown. For example, JTCC estimates that, collectively, training on migration systems will be required at nearly 300 sites. However, its analyses did not include estimates of the number of persons to be trained at each site or the cost of productivity losses associated with that training. JTCC also estimates that hardware and off-the-shelf software totaling $10 million will be purchased between fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1999. However, JTCC\u2019s estimates do not include the cost of labor necessary to purchase these items.", "If JTCC had included these costs in its systems selection analyses, it would have found that the overall return on investment would have decreased. For example, as stated above, $16 million in costs related to JTCC\u2019s own work on migration systems was excluded from analysis. JTCC was unable to attribute a specific percentage of these costs to its work on selecting the seven systems for which in-house alternatives competed against one another. However, if just 6.3 percent of this $16 million were factored into the analysis, Defense would barely break even on its investment in those systems. Moreover, as figure 1 shows, Defense would actually lose money on its investment if more than 6.3 percent were included.", "Still, even if recommending migration systems were accomplished for free\u2014the estimated reduced cost associated with the selected alternatives ($1.02 million) would be suspect since JTCC did not verify the system costs used in selecting the migration systems. Unlike the information obtained on each system\u2019s functional and technical capabilities\u2014which JTCC meticulously verified\u2014system cost information was taken at face value. JTCC officials concede that the costs used for its analyses were very rough and resulted in inaccurate, low estimates of migration system costs.", "Further, since JTCC\u2019s migration systems selection methodology emphasized the importance of meeting current functional requirements, JTCC\u2019s analyses of in-house systems excluded the required quantification and comparison of new benefits. Although JTCC officials stated that the benefits of migration systems go beyond meeting current functional requirements, benefits such as operating more easily in remote locations and improving military readiness were not addressed in the migration system decision documents and remain unquantified. These decision documents instead focus on quantifying each system\u2019s current functional and technical merits to the exclusion of new benefits a system may offer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JTCC\u2019s Business Case Justification", "paragraphs": ["Although the transportation migration systems were selected and approved prior to April 1995, Defense continued to prepare justification for its migration systems selections\u2014culminating in a January 1996 study entitled A Business Case Study for Transportation Systems Migration. This case study documents additional projected cost savings and avoidances that were not considered during the migration systems selection process. However, these estimates of cost savings and avoidances are not reliable for a number of reasons.", "In its business case study, JTCC estimates that the transportation migration strategy will produce cost avoidances and savings of $4 billion. However, the validity of this figure is questionable. First, JTCC relied on cost estimates from 13 different sources using a variety of forecasting horizons (from 4 to 17 years) without consistently accounting for the timing of estimated costs and benefits. OMB Circular A-94 and DOD Instruction 7041.3 identify the timing of costs and benefits as an important consideration in deciding whether a government program can be justified on economic principles. These regulations further require that estimated gains and losses occurring in different time periods be converted to a standard unit of measurement that accounts for the time-value of money.", "Second, JTCC did not report estimated savings and avoidances in a constant base-year\u2019s dollars. By mixing base-years, JTCC has failed to show the expected benefits and costs associated with the transportation migration systems in terms of meaningful, actual purchasing power.", "Third, Defense would be expected to realize $3.75 billion (93 percent) of the reported $4 billion in savings and avoidances whether or not the migration strategy was implemented. For example, JTCC estimates that Defense will avoid and/or save $92 million by implementing and operating the TC-AIMS II migration system over a 13-year period. However, the Air Force\u2019s CMOS system, which is now a component of the TC-AIMS II migration system, predates the migration effort and was expected to save $57 million\u2014without being implemented in any service but the Air Force.", "The remaining savings and avoidances that can be attributed directly to migration are comprised of estimates that rely on questionable assumptions. For example, JTCC assumed that each legacy system, if not terminated, would attempt to acquire all the functionality that a fielded migration system would have. Based on this assumption, JTCC calculated that Defense will avoid $101 million in costs for the legacy systems that competed as in-house alternatives. For example, JTCC estimated that by migrating to the TC-AIMS II system, Defense will avoid spending $17.4 million between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2001 to upgrade the unit movement function of the CMOS system. CMOS program officials maintain that this estimate is grossly high\u2014more than double the Air Force approved budget for the entire CMOS program during the same period. Similarly, JTCC estimated that Defense will avoid spending $18 million over the same period to upgrade the Transportation Coordinator - Automated Command and Control Information System (TC-ACCIS) unit movement functionality. This estimate increases by nearly 28 percent prior estimates for the entire TC-ACCIS program that already include system enhancements.", "Another $96 million in migration-related cost avoidances are associated with Defense\u2019s data standardization, functional process improvement, electronic data interchange, and Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) efforts. This estimate may overstate software maintenance costs by as much as $61.7 million, since it does not consider maintenance costs that legacy systems already planned to incur over the next 5 years. JTCC officials stated that preparing a cost analysis that takes into account what each program already planned to spend for software maintenance would require a level of visibility into each system that JTCC does not have."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "System Selections Did Not Consider Potential Impact of Changes to Transportation Operations", "paragraphs": ["In May 1995, Defense launched an effort to reengineer the Department\u2019s transportation processes, focusing first on transportation acquisition and financial payment/billing processes.

Defense expects the reengineering of its remaining transportation processes to be completed within the next 6 years.", "In making its migration system selections, however, Defense did not assess the impact that these changes and other potential significant changes to transportation operations\u2014such as outsourcing\u2014would have on its system selections. Consequently, Defense may end up investing in systems that do not provide positive investment returns before such changes to transportation operations are made.", "For example, Defense plans to spend $63 million from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001 to implement a migration system that will automate and standardize the moving, storing, and managing of personal property for Defense personnel. At the same time, the Department is considering the outsourcing of major components of the personal property function. If outsourced, contractors will perform the management, administrative, and operational duties that Defense now performs for personal property movement and storage. As a result, further spending on the migration system may be questionable since the system may no longer be needed.", "Also, in following its migration strategy, Defense believes that the implementation of migration systems will resolve some of its process problems that may be more appropriately addressed through reengineering. For example, to alleviate water port loading dock congestion during full-scale deployment, Defense has selected a migration system to more quickly develop plans for loading ships. This system, the Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES), is capable of dramatically reducing the time required to plan the load. However, without performing a thorough analysis of the nature of dock congestion, Defense cannot expect its load planning migration system to alleviate the congestion. In fact, according to an ICODES program official, port congestion is not caused by lengthy planning times. Rather, unit commanders load more equipment than necessary since they do not believe that all of it will arrive at the right location when needed. According to the official, this problem was so severe during Operation Desert Storm that unit commanders were typically bringing division-size loads to port."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Defense\u2019s initial approach to selecting and implementing transportation migration systems was systematic, communicated in a written plan, and agreed to by departmentwide transportation process owners and stakeholders.

However, faced with the March 1997 deadline, Defense deviated from this approach and selected systems that may not provide much new savings or, in some cases, will actually lose money.", "We believe Defense\u2019s management approach to implementing its transportation system migration strategy was shortsighted. By not considering alternatives, not relying on complete cost estimates, and by not assessing the potential impact of outsourcing and reengineering on its migration systems, Defense essentially gambled that systems migration would achieve anticipated savings and resolve problems with transportation business processes.

These regulations are designed to ensure that all essential ingredients to making sound business decisions are incorporated into all major technology investment decisions. In particular, DOD 8120.1-M directs that migration system selections be based on functional economic analyses (FEA) and that migration systems follow DOD life cycle management policies and procedures, to include making maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. However, despite these requirements, Defense had just one up-to-date FEA available at the time it made its transportation migration selection decisions. Further, the analyses that Defense conducted in lieu of preparing the required FEAs did not (1) adequately consider alternatives (such as the use of COTS products), (2) rely on complete, verified cost and benefit data, and (3) consider the potential impact of change to transportation operations that reengineering would have on its system selections.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on Military Readiness, House Committee on National Security; the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Transportation Command; and other interested parties.

However, these benefits and returns are relevant to the CMOS system only when it is deployed within the Air Force\u2014but not to any other military service as a migration system. The figures cited in the February 1995 paper are based on a CMOS Functional Economic Analysis that is nearly 4 years old and that predated the migration effort. And although the February 1995 paper included some cost avoidances that were not considered in the CMOS FEA, it did not include an analysis of costs and benefits associated with migrating CMOS to the other military services.
