The act also requires the committee to submit biennial reports to Congress that include certain elements such as an analysis of the effectiveness of the committee's recommendations.", "GAO was asked to review federal efforts to address marine debris. This report examines (1) how the committee coordinates among federal agencies and the process for determining membership, (2) the extent to which the committee's biennial reports contain required elements, and (3) experts' suggestions on actions the federal government could take to most effectively address marine debris.

Within Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) serves as the committee chair. The committee coordinates through sharing information about members' activities to address marine debris, but GAO found that NOAA has not established a process for determining committee membership for agencies not specifically designated in the act. As a result, such agencies may not be included in the biennial reports required by the act which discuss committee members' marine debris activities. NOAA officials said they plan to develop a membership process but have not established a time frame to do so. By establishing a time frame, the committee can more fully benefit from capturing all members' activities.", "The committee's biennial reports provide information on members' activities such as education and cleanup, but they do not contain some information required by the Marine Debris Act. Specifically, the reports do not include (1) an analysis of the effectiveness of the committee's recommendations and strategies to address marine debris and (2) recommendations for priority funding needs. Our past work has shown that collaborative entities can better demonstrate progress if they develop a way to monitor and report the results of their collective efforts and identify and leverage resources. By doing so, the committee would be in a better position to know the extent to which it is effectively addressing marine debris and provide Congress with required information about priority funding needs.", "Experts suggested a range of actions\u2014from research to cleanup\u2014the federal government could take to most effectively address marine debris.

Marine debris  can harm coastal and marine species and habitats, obstruct navigational  waterways, cause economic loss to fishing industries and coastal  communities, and threaten human health and safety. Debris can enter  the aquatic environment directly from domestic or international water- based sources, such as when materials are intentionally dumped in the  water or blown off fishing vessels. Debris can also enter the aquatic  environment indirectly from land-based sources by washing into  waterways that eventually flow to the ocean. Research has shown that a  significant amount of marine debris stems from land-based sources, such  as improperly managed plastic waste.", "Numerous studies show that plastic is a particularly pervasive and  persistent form of marine debris. An estimated 8 million metric tons of  mismanaged plastic waste entered the marine environment in 2010  according to one study, and projections show that by 2025 this number  could increase to 17.5 million metric tons each year. According to a 2018  United Nations report, studies estimate that the total economic damage to  the world\u2019s marine ecosystem caused by plastic amounts to at least $13  billion each year. Although chemicals in plastic provide valuable  properties such as durability, there is growing concern that these  chemicals may be toxic and harmful to marine species. Over time,  through exposure to sunlight and wave action, plastic breaks apart into  increasingly smaller pieces, eventually becoming tiny particles called  microplastics. Marine life may ingest these microplastics, raising concerns  about potential health effects for such marine life and any organisms,  including humans, which may eat them.", "Addressing marine debris is a complex, interdisciplinary issue involving  many sectors and levels of government. Multiple federal agencies, often  in coordination with state and local governments, Indian tribes, industry,  international parties, and nongovernmental agencies, work to prevent,  manage, remove, and raise awareness about marine debris. To help  address marine debris, the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and  Reduction Act (Marine Debris Act) was enacted in 2006 and amended in  2012 and 2018. The purpose of the Marine Debris Act is to address the  adverse impacts of marine debris on the U.S. economy, the marine  environment, and navigation safety through the identification,  determination of sources, assessment, prevention, reduction, and  removal of marine debris.", "Among other things, the Marine Debris Act reactivated the Interagency  Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (interagency committee) to  coordinate a comprehensive program of marine debris research and  activities among federal agencies and in cooperation and coordination  with nonfederal entities, such as nongovernmental organizations,  industry, universities and research institutions, states, Indian tribes, and  other nations, as appropriate. The act designates a senior official from  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the  Department of Commerce, to serve as the chair of the interagency  committee. Other federal agency members designated in the act are the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy,  Department of State, and Department of the Interior.

We also  reviewed the most recently available minutes from quarterly committee  meetings held from November 2012 through April 2019 to determine the  types of topics and activities on which the committee has coordinated and  the federal agencies that have participated. We attended five of the  interagency committee\u2019s quarterly meetings (in May, September, and  December of 2018, and April and July of 2019) to directly observe  committee coordination among agencies during these meetings. We also  reviewed documents from committee member agencies and interviewed and reviewed written responses from those agencies to obtain information  on their coordination efforts. Agencies we included were those agencies  designated as members in the Marine Debris Act as well as additional  agencies identified as members in the committee\u2019s charter.

Specifically, two analysts  independently reviewed each of the five biennial reports to evaluate  information the reports included about (1) the status of implementation of  any recommendations and strategies of the committee, (2) analysis of the  recommendations and strategies\u2019 effectiveness, (3) estimated federal and  nonfederal funding provided for marine debris, and (4) recommendations  for priority funding needs. The analysts then compared and summarized  the results of their analyses. We also interviewed and reviewed written  responses from NOAA officials (in the agency\u2019s capacity as chair of the  interagency committee) and officials from other committee member  agencies about steps to develop the biennial reports, including the  reports\u2019 required elements. In addition, we compared information from the  reports and information we obtained from agency officials to leading  practices we identified in our past work on implementing interagency  collaborative mechanisms.", "To obtain suggestions on actions the federal government could take to  most effectively address marine debris, we conducted structured  interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of 14 experts with expertise in  marine debris-related issues. We selected these experts using factors  such as the individuals\u2019 experience with different types of debris (e.g.,  abandoned fishing gear or consumer debris) or association with various  sectors (e.g., academia or industry). The experts included: (1) academics  with expertise in areas such as sources, prevalence, and transport of  plastic marine debris; (2) officials representing the plastic manufacturing,  food and beverage, and commercial fishing industries; (3) officials from  nonprofit organizations with expertise in marine debris removal from  coastal areas, litter prevention, and recycling management systems and  strategies; and (4) state and local government officials from the District of  Columbia, Florida, and Washington with expertise in local litter prevention  efforts, derelict vessels, and lost and derelict fishing gear.", "We asked the 14 experts to suggest actions the federal government could  take to most effectively address different types of marine debris.  Specifically, we asked that experts identify up to 5 to 10 actions as well as  advantages, disadvantages, and any challenges in potentially  implementing these suggested actions. We then categorized the actions  based on common themes. To do so, two analysts independently  reviewed each expert\u2019s description of each action and identified an  appropriate category using decision rules the team developed. For  reporting purposes, we selected several actions within each of the  categories to provide illustrative examples of the types of actions experts  suggested. Our selection was based on such factors as the number of  experts that suggested similar types of actions, the detail provided by the  experts, and the availability of supporting information, such as  documentation of instances where an action had been taken by state or  local governments. Actions suggested by the 14 experts cannot be  generalized to actions that might be suggested by other experts, but  provide examples of actions federal agencies could take to address  marine debris. We also interviewed and received written responses from  officials from interagency committee agencies regarding issues that would  be important to consider in potentially implementing any of the expert suggested actions.

Instead, plastics slowly break  down into smaller and smaller fragments,  eventually becoming what are known as  microplastics. Microplastics are very small  pieces of plastic that are generally less than 5  millimeters in size (about the size of a sesame  seed). The formation of microplastics occurs  when plastic debris is exposed to sunlight and  the plastic begins to weather and fragment.  Microplastics have been found in the  stomachs of numerous aquatic organisms  including insects, worms, fish, and clams,  according to a 2018 study. A study from 2011  showed that once animals ingest  microplastics, they can be stored in tissues  and cells, providing a possible pathway for the  accumulation of contaminants and potentially  harming the animals. pots, and other recreational or commercial fishing equipment that has  been lost, neglected, or discarded in the marine environment.  According to the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, at least 640,000 tons of  derelict fishing gear enters the ocean each year, a weight equivalent  to two Empire State Buildings. Derelict fishing gear may entrap sea  life, adversely affect marine habitats, present hazards to navigation,  and cause other harmful effects (see fig. 2). For example, according  to a 2015 NOAA report, derelict fishing gear threatens a variety of  fish, turtles, seabirds, whales, and seals, and may be especially  problematic for endangered and protected marine species.", "Abandoned and derelict vessels. Abandoned and derelict vessels  are vessels without identified ownership, in significant disrepair, or  both. There are thousands of such vessels in ports, waterways, and  estuaries around the United States that have been left to deteriorate  by the owner or operator or are the result of a catastrophic weather  event, according to NOAA documents. Abandoned and derelict  vessels can impede marine transportation by blocking navigable  waterways, and, if not visible or well-marked, could pose collision  risks to vessel operators. These vessels may also become sources of  pollution since they may contain fuel oil or other hazardous materials  that can leak into the water as the vessels deteriorate, impacting the  local community, marine life, and nearby habitat.", "Marine debris has garnered increasing interest from the international  community. In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly  unanimously adopted an agenda with a set of global sustainable  development goals through 2030. One of the goals (goal 14) calls for  conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine  resources, and includes a target for prevention and significant reduction  of marine pollution of all kinds, including marine debris, by 2025. In June  2018, five members of the Group of Seven and the European Union  endorsed the Group\u2019s Ocean Plastics Charter, which committed them to  accelerating implementation of the Group of Seven Leaders\u2019 Action Plan  to Combat Marine Litter, previously agreed to in 2015. The United  States and Japan were the two members of the Group of Seven that did  not endorse the charter. Also, in May 2019, the parties to the Basel  Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous  Waste and Their Disposal adopted a decision that would, beginning  January 1, 2021, require parties to take appropriate measures to ensure  that certain plastic waste is reduced to a minimum, taking into account  social, technological and economic aspects, among other things."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Marine Debris Act", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Debris Act governs the activities of the interagency  committee.

The officials said they also  seek opportunities to collaborate on individual projects, but the committee  does not otherwise collaborate on activities, beyond compiling statutorily  required biennial reports. NOAA officials explained that individual  agencies each have a unique set of authorities and missions that largely  determine their role and involvement in marine debris-related issues. For  example, under its Marine Debris Program, NOAA conducts a variety of  education, outreach, research, and other activities to identify sources of  and address marine debris. In recent years, congressional committee  reports accompanying NOAA\u2019s annual appropriations have directed the  agency to spend a certain amount of its appropriations on its marine  debris program. Specifically, these reports directed NOAA to spend $7  million in fiscal year 2018 and $7.5 million in fiscal year 2019 for its  Marine Debris Program.

Rather, the activities these  agencies have conducted generally tie to their authority or agency  mission. For example, EPA officials said they have relied on voluntary  partnerships with states, industry, and other sources and leveraged  existing funds from related programs, such as the agency\u2019s stormwater  and water quality programs, to support its Trash Free Waters Program.  This is a program that encourages collaborative actions by public and  private stakeholders to prevent trash from entering water.

In  reviewing meeting minutes, we found that the meetings were generally  well-attended by representatives from multiple agencies. During the  meetings, officials discussed marine debris issues and some provided  updates on their agencies\u2019 activities.

NOAA officials described their actions in response to  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, which included coordinating  debris removal activities across federal and state agencies, such as EPA  and Florida State\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. U.S. Coast  Guard officials also presented information on their marine debris removal  activities in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. These activities  included coordinating with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and  contractors to remove or mitigate potential environmental impacts from  2,366 damaged or derelict vessels in Florida and the Florida Keys after  Hurricane Irma and 377 vessels in Puerto Rico and the Island of Vieques  after Hurricane Maria, according to U.S. Coast Guard officials.", "The interagency committee has also used its quarterly meetings to  identify opportunities for collaboration among federal agencies and with  nonfederal partners, according to NOAA officials. For example, during  committee meetings in early 2018, NOAA, the National Park Service, and  the Department of State identified an opportunity to collaborate with the  German government to bring the Ocean Plastics Lab to the United States.  This Lab is an international traveling exhibition that explains the role of  science in helping to understand and address plastic pollution in the  ocean. NOAA officials said that to collaborate on this effort, officials from  three federal agencies served on a steering committee, leveraged  volunteers, promoted the Ocean Plastics Lab through outreach efforts to  the public and helped staff the exhibits while they were on display in  Washington, D.C., during the summer of 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Has Not Established a Process for Determining Interagency Committee Membership and Agency Representation", "paragraphs": ["We found that NOAA has not established a process to determine  interagency committee membership.

The interagency  committee\u2019s charter states that the committee will be composed of  \u201cfederal agency managers and technical experts,\u201d but does not define  what is meant by senior official. NOAA officials said that the level of  engagement from agency officials has varied over time and often  depends on the specific officials participating. The officials said they have  had difficulty in the past getting some member agency officials to engage  during quarterly meetings and often those that do participate are not  decision makers. Specifically, for some agencies, participating officials  may not represent the entire agency, but rather a program within the  agency, and they may not have decision-making authority, according to  NOAA officials.

The experts  stressed that there is not one solution to the growing, multi-dimensional  problem of marine debris. Rather, they said that a multitude of actions  involving federal agencies and nonfederal partners\u2014such as  international, state and local governments, Indian tribes, industry, and  environmental groups\u2014will need to be taken to address the issue.", "Experts as well as agency officials we interviewed indicated that there  would be a number of factors to consider in evaluating the suggested  actions. Some of these factors are overarching, applying to most or all of  the actions; others relate to specific actions. For example, several experts  and agency officials said that competing priorities and limited resources  would be important factors to consider related to all of the suggested  actions. Several agency officials also said that their agencies may not  have the authority to take some of the actions suggested by the experts,  and therefore new legislation would need to be enacted before they could  take those actions. Additionally, some actions could result in impacts or  costs to particular industries, underserved communities, or consumer  groups, and understanding and identifying ways to mitigate such impacts  would be important. Moreover, several agency officials said some actions,  such as those related to waste management, may be better suited for  local or state governments and that those entities would be better- equipped to deal with particular aspects of marine debris.", "The following are examples of actions the experts suggested that the  federal government could take. We organized the actions into the  following five categories, which generally correspond to the categories  laid out in the interagency committee\u2019s reports: (1) education and  outreach, (2) establishment of federal requirements or incentives, (3)  cleanup, (4) research and technology development, and (5)  coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education and Outreach", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the 14 experts suggested actions to educate or conduct  outreach to the public or specific consumer or industry groups or  international governments about ways to prevent, reduce, mitigate, or  clean up waste that can become marine debris.

Examples of  education and outreach actions suggested include:", "Domestic education and outreach. Five experts suggested different  types of education or outreach campaigns the federal government  could undertake to target certain domestic groups, such as  consumers. One expert suggested that the federal government  develop a national campaign to educate the public about marine  debris. Such a campaign would develop a single message that  various entities, including federal agencies and nonfederal  stakeholders, could include in advertisements, social media, and other  public awareness efforts. The expert pointed to similar state-led  campaigns, such as \u201cNobody Trashes Tennessee,\u201d a litter campaign  developed by Tennessee\u2019s Department of Transportation. This state  campaign features celebrities, such as athletes and musicians, in  advertisements and involves selling stickers, hats, and other items to  help spread the message. However, the expert said that securing  collaboration and agreement on a single message across federal  agencies and nonfederal stakeholders could pose a challenge and  that a national campaign would need a long-term commitment from all  parties to be successful.", "NOAA officials said that national campaigns can be expensive and  demonstrating results from such efforts can be difficult, especially  when they are broad in nature.

Two experts suggested actions the federal  government could take to conduct outreach internationally to promote  programs, policies, or technologies that can reduce marine debris. For  example, one expert suggested the federal government conduct  outreach to government officials in countries that have limited waste  management infrastructure to demonstrate effective waste  management technologies. The expert said that the federal  government could partner with private sector companies to  demonstrate waste-to-energy technologies, such as gasification and  pyrolysis that can convert plastic waste to fuel. According to the  expert, demonstrating such technologies would provide information on  its benefits, including reducing sources of waste and creating a source  of energy to either use or sell.", "Several agency officials we interviewed agreed that international  outreach efforts are critical to successfully addressing marine debris  and that emphasis should be placed on assisting countries with  improving their waste management practices. However, these officials  said there are many factors to consider with regard to waste-to-energy  technologies. For instance, State Department officials said such  technologies may not be supported by civil organizations because of  environmental concerns. Waste-to-energy technologies could also  entail high upfront capital investments, and waste-to-energy facilities  should adhere to strict environmental standards with monitoring and  enforcement to help ensure the technology is not causing negative  effects, according to agency officials. As a result, they said it may not  be practical for some countries to adopt such technologies. In  addition, USAID officials said that promoting waste-to-energy  technology presupposes that waste is already being collected in  sufficient quantity and quality to serve as a fuel for such technology,  but that in some countries waste is openly dumped or burned and  therefore sufficient waste may not be available. They cautioned that  waste-to-energy technologies can be a part of a response to address  marine debris abroad, but would not be sufficient alone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishment of Federal Requirements or Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Microfibers are a widespread type of  microplastic; they have been found on the  shorelines of six continents and in oceans,  rivers, soils, table salt, and public drinking  water, according to scientific studies.  Microfibers enter the marine environment  through various pathways. For example,  microfibers are shed from synthetic clothing  and other materials made of polyester and  nylon. These microfibers pass through to  waterways because washing machines and  wastewater treatment plants typically do not  have processes sufficiently refined to remove  the fibers. Little is known about other potential  sources of microfibers, such as carpet  manufacturing; the rate of generation, such as  how quickly materials break down and shed  microfibers; and any health impacts to  humans or wildlife. federal requirements for manufacturers to design certain products to  minimize the chances of material becoming marine debris. For  example, two experts suggested the federal government develop  design standards for washing machine manufacturers to ensure filters  are designed to prevent microfibers from entering wastewater  systems and then the marine environment. Three experts suggested  the federal government develop design standards to require or  incentivize manufacturers to use specific amounts of post-consumer  material in developing certain products. For example, one expert  recommended requiring the manufacturers of plastic beverage bottles  to produce bottles using at least a minimum amount of recycled  plastic. According to the expert, this would increase the demand for  recycled plastic as a raw material, which in turn would reduce the  likelihood that such plastic would end up as waste. The expert said  that requiring the use of recycled plastic would likely impose  increased costs on manufacturers because virgin plastic\u2014the raw  material typically used in producing plastic beverage bottles\u2014is  currently less expensive than recycled plastic. Such increases would  likely be short term, however, because the increased demand would  decrease the price after more of the recycled material is used,  according to another expert. Some federal agency officials said that  establishing such proposed federal design standards could be difficult  due to limited existing statutory authorities.", "Requirements for fishing gear. Three experts suggested the federal  government establish requirements to mitigate the impact of lost or  derelict fishing gear in federal waters. For example, one expert  suggested requiring the use of modified fishing gear, such as crab  traps with biodegradable escape mechanisms that allow entrapped  marine life to escape if the trap is lost or abandoned (see fig. 4).  Requiring the use of fishing gear with biodegradable escape  mechanisms would likely impose increased costs to the fishing  industry, according to the expert, but those costs could be minimized  if the federal government offered a subsidy to help purchase required  gear. NOAA officials said that it would be challenging to require the  use of certain types of fishing gear in part because of the cost to the  federal government in ensuring implementation of the requirement.  On the other hand, NOAA officials said they promote innovation and  voluntary use of certain types of fishing gear through various efforts  such as their Fishing for Energy program.", "Restrictions on single-use plastics. Four experts suggested that  the federal government establish restrictions on the manufacturing or  sale of certain single-use plastics. For example, the federal  government could establish restrictions on the manufacturing and  distribution of plastic bags in the form of thickness or material  composition requirements, or production volume limits. Two of these  experts also said that the federal government could review existing  local, state, and international efforts to restrict single-use plastics to  identify best practices so that these types of actions could potentially  be scaled appropriately at the federal level. According to the United  Nations Environmental Programme, 127 countries and two states  have placed various types of restrictions on the retail distribution of  plastic bags as of 2018. One expert pointed to research that shows  that plastic bags are one of the most abundant forms of marine debris  and suggested that banning them would therefore significantly reduce  the amount of debris entering the marine environment.", "NOAA officials agreed that restricting the sale of single-use plastic  bags could help address the marine debris problem, but said that  identifying an agency with sufficient legal authority to be responsible  for implementing and enforcing any restriction would be important and  could be a challenge at the federal level. NOAA and EPA officials said  that it would be important to carefully determine and assess trade-offs  or other potential impacts before considering these types of  restrictions.", "Single-use plastics are any plastic items\u2014 such as plastic soda or water bottles\u2014that are  intended for use only once before they are  thrown away or recycled as defined by the  United Nations Environment Programme.  Single-use plastics can have environmental  impacts when they are left in the marine  environment. For example, single-use plastics  may be ingested by hundreds of species of  marine wildlife, such as turtles and dolphins,  who mistake them for food, potentially  blocking their airways and stomachs,  according to a 2018 report by the United  Nations Environment Programme.", "Incentives for waste management. Four experts suggested actions  the federal government could take to provide incentives to local  governments to help them improve their waste management and  recycling programs. The experts said that waste and water  management is typically the responsibility of local governments, but  that given the scope and scale of the marine debris problem, the  federal government could use its resources to provide incentives to  help local governments make improvements. For example, the federal  government could provide grants or subsidies to help local  governments implement best management practices, such as using  trash traps to help remove debris from waterways and prevent it from  becoming marine debris. In addition, the experts said that the federal  government could provide local governments with resources to help  purchase bins with lids to help prevent inadvertent loss of waste or to  pay for infrastructure such as trucks and recycling facilities to improve  the collection and recycling of waste. According to one expert,  transporting materials from consumers to the appropriate waste  management or recycling facilities is a significant barrier to achieving  better waste management.", "EPA officials agreed with the importance of local waste management  efforts. The officials emphasized that it is the agency\u2019s mission, in  part, to address management of waste to prevent trash, and  management of water that carries the trash to the marine  environment. The officials said that this is particularly critical for  addressing marine debris since an estimated 80 percent of aquatic  trash originates from land-based sources. The officials said the  agency has provided some funding to local governments to implement mechanisms to capture trash before it enters waterways or to remove  trash from water. They added that there is no one size fits all  approach, however, to working with local governments. Rather,  different localities may have differing needs\u2014such as for funding,  information, or technical assistance\u2014and EPA tries to create a  climate where localities can identify and best address those needs,  according to the officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Five of the 14 experts suggested the federal government support marine  debris cleanup and removal activities by providing resources to  organizations that coordinate cleanup projects (see fig. 5).

According to one expert, debris deposited into  the marine environment around the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma in  2017 included construction debris from demolished buildings, household  items such as refrigerators and televisions, cars, and boats, among other  types of debris. The expert suggested the federal government provide  funding and technical assistance to state and local governments to help  locate such debris. According to the expert, after a severe weather event,  the distribution of debris can vary greatly with ocean and wind currents,  and the debris can extend for miles into the ocean. As a result, the expert  suggested that the federal government assist with conducting aerial  flyovers to locate major concentrations of debris. The flyovers would  employ mapping technology, such as global positioning system  equipment and cameras, to locate and map the debris for removal. NOAA  officials agreed with the importance of cleanup activities, particularly after  severe weather events.

Five experts suggested the federal government support research on  identifying and understanding the various sources, pathways, and  location of marine debris. For example, one expert suggested that the  federal government conduct a national study to identify where waste  is generated, through which types of major pathways it enters the  marine environment (such as rivers or stormwater), and where the  waste ends up. This study could include a focus on specific pathways,  such as where illegal dumping occurs, which has not been researched  at the national level, according to the expert. The expert said that  federal agencies and others could use the results of such a study to  help target education for the public, policy makers, and law  enforcement officials on how to prevent and properly dispose of the  types of waste that most commonly end up as marine debris. NOAA  officials said that illegal dumping tends to be localized, so it may be  difficult to carry out research on a national scale, but agreed with the  need to better understand sources and types of marine debris since  many factors contribute to the problem.", "Research on effects of marine debris. Four experts suggested the  federal government support research to determine the effects of  debris on wildlife and the marine environment as well as on human  health. For example, one expert suggested that the federal  government conduct or fund research to determine the effects of  microplastics on human health to help the federal government and  other stakeholders identify the most appropriate solutions. EPA  officials said that this type of research is one among many competing  areas related to marine debris research their agency has targeted.", "Development of technology to address marine debris. Five  experts suggested actions that the federal government could take to  develop new technology to help address marine debris. For example,  one expert suggested that the federal government fund the  development of new technology to recycle hard-to-recycle plastic  materials so that these materials are less likely to end up as waste  and become marine debris. The expert said that, in particular, plastic  materials such as packaging used to preserve food products are not  readily recyclable because the technology to recycle these types of  plastics is not available or is not economically viable. EPA officials  said that even when there is technology to recycle these types of  plastics, food contamination is a problem that may prevent them from  being recycled. In addition, an increased capacity for recycling may  not result in a behavior change on the part of the consumer, which is  another factor to consider in evaluating whether to pursue this type of  action, according to the officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Nine experts suggested that the federal government coordinate with local,  state, federal, and international governments and other nonfederal  partners to address marine debris.

Two experts suggested the federal government coordinate to identify  ways to prevent fishing gear from becoming a source of marine debris  and causing harm to fish and other marine species. One expert  suggested the federal government coordinate with stakeholders to  identify and implement best management practices for responsible  management and use of fishing gear. Specifically, the expert  suggested that the federal government coordinate with state  agencies, gear designers and manufacturers, fishermen, and other  stakeholders to adopt best practices in particular locations such as in  the Chesapeake Bay or Puget Sound where there are extensive  commercial or recreational fisheries. The expert said it would be  important to work with industry stakeholders to avoid the best  practices being perceived as unnecessary government intervention. In  addition, one of the experts said that adoption of best practices could  incur additional costs for activities such as replacing gear, which could  be minimized through government subsidies or other incentives.  NOAA officials said these types of coordination activities align with  current efforts within their Marine Debris Program. For example, in  2016 NOAA partnered with California State University and other  stakeholders to encourage the adoption of best practices to prevent  the loss of gear used to catch spiny lobster in the Channel Islands in  California.", "Coordination with international governments. Four experts  suggested the federal government increase its coordination  internationally such as through developing international agreements  and participating in multinational forums. For example, one expert  suggested that the United States and other countries enter into an  international agreement to prevent further release of plastic into the  ocean. Under such an agreement, each country would set a target to  reduce the amount of plastic released into the ocean, develop  strategies and approaches to meet that target, and measure and  report on progress in meeting the target. The expert said that taking  actions to meet the target would incur costs and that securing  commitments from countries could be difficult. However, the expert  said that allowing countries the flexibility to develop their own  strategies for meeting their targets could help overcome these  difficulties.", "State Department officials said that in addition to coordination with  international governments, coordination is needed with other key  stakeholders such as waste management and marine debris experts,  local leaders, private-sector industry and retail entities, and  nongovernmental organizations. This is in part because so much of  the international marine debris problem stems from waste  management issues at the local level. In some countries, as in the  United States, the government may not have the authority to work on  waste management at the local level and as a result, understanding  this complexity is an important factor to consider in coordinating  internationally, according to the officials.
