GAO found that although social attitudes have changed and medical advancements afford greater opportunities for people with disabilities to work, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs have maintained an outmoded approach that equated disability with inability to work. We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority as part of a continued effort to help policymakers better understand the extent of support provided by federal programs to people with disabilities and to assist them in determining how these programs could be better aligned to more effectively meet the needs of individuals with disabilities in the 21st century. This report identifies (1) the wide array of federal programs that serve people with disabilities, and (2) the major challenges these federal programs face in the 21st century.

About half of these programs serve only people with disabilities while the rest serve people both with and without disabilities. In fiscal year 2003, more than $120 billion in federal funds was spent on programs that only serve people with disabilities, with over 80 percent of these funds spent on monetary support. In addition, considerable funds are spent on people with disabilities by programs that also serve people without disabilities, like Medicare and Medicaid. The program challenges cited most frequently in our recent survey of nearly 200 programs serving people with disabilities are largely consistent with several of the key findings from past reports that led GAO to place federal programs supporting people with disabilities on its high-risk list. Both our recent survey and our past work have identified challenges in (1) ensuring timely and consistent processing of applications; (2) ensuring timely provision of services and benefits; (3) interpreting complex eligibility requirements;( 4) planning for growth in the demand for benefits and services; (5) making beneficiaries or clients aware of benefits and services; and (6) communicating or coordinating with other federal disability programs. In light of the vital role federal programs play in providing assistance to people with disabilities and in helping to ensure an adequate national labor force, we have identified a number of factors that are important to consider in assessing the need for, and nature of, program transformations including (1) program design issues; (2) fiscal implications of proposed program changes; and (3) feasibility of implementing program changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, GAO designated modernizing federal disability programs as a  high-risk area\u2014one that requires urgent attention and organizational  transformation to ensure that programs function in the most economical,  efficient, and effective manner possible. This designation was based on  more than a decade of research focusing primarily on the nation\u2019s largest  disability programs, which are administered by the Social Security  Administration (SSA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). GAO\u2019s  work has found that these programs are neither well aligned with 21st  century realities nor are they well-positioned to provide meaningful and  timely support for Americans with disabilities. For example, despite  opportunities afforded by medical and technological advancements and  the growing expectations that people with disabilities can and want to  work, federal disability programs remain grounded in an approach that  equates medical conditions with the incapacity to work. Given the  projected slowdown in the growth of the nation\u2019s labor force, it is  imperative that those who can work are supported in their efforts to do so.  Yet federal disability programs are not well-positioned to provide this  support. Solutions to these problems are likely to require fundamental  changes, including regulatory and legislative action.", "In addition to disability programs operated within SSA and VA, there are a  number of other federal programs that provide various levels of support to  individuals with disabilities.

In this report, we (1) identify the many  federal programs that play a role in supporting people with disabilities and  (2) identify some of the major challenges that federal programs face in  supporting people with disabilities in the 21st century. We also present  factors that we believe are important for programs to consider in assessing  whether, and how, they could be transformed to better meet 21st century  challenges.

For example,  over the past several decades, the economy has shifted towards service-  and knowledge-based jobs that may allow greater participation for some  persons with physical limitations. Also, advances in medicine and assistive  technologies\u2014such as improved treatments for mental illnesses and  advanced wheelchair design\u2014afford greater opportunities for some  people with disabilities. In addition, social and legal changes have  promoted the goal of greater inclusion of people with disabilities in the  mainstream of society, including adults at work. For example, the  Americans with Disabilities Act supports the full participation of people  with disabilities in society and fosters the expectation that people with  disabilities can work and have the right to work. More recently, the  President announced the New Freedom Initiative, a set of guiding  principles and initiatives aimed at improving the integration of people with  disabilities in all aspects of society, including employment.", "Public concern and congressional action have produced a broad array of  federal programs designed to help people with disabilities. However, our  prior reviews of the largest federal disability programs indicate that such  programs have not evolved in line with these larger societal changes and  therefore, are poorly positioned to provide meaningful and timely support  for people with disabilities. Furthermore, program enrollment and costs  for the largest federal disability programs have been growing and are  poised to grow even more rapidly in the future, further contributing to the  federal government\u2019s large and growing long-term structural deficit. For  example, from 1982 to 2002, the number of disabled workers receiving  benefits under SSA\u2019s Disability Insurance (DI) program doubled from 2.6  million to 5.5 million, while payments quadrupled from about $14.8 billion  to $60 billion. Moreover, these disability programs are poised to grow even  more as baby boomers reach their disability-prone years. This program  growth is exacerbated by the low rate of return to work for individuals  with disabilities receiving cash and medical benefits. In addition, the  projected slowdown in the growth of the nation\u2019s labor force has made it  more imperative that those who can work are supported in their efforts to  do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Over 20 Different Agencies Administer Almost 200 Programs That Provide a Wide Range of Assistance", "paragraphs": ["We identified over 20 federal agencies and almost 200 federal programs  that are either wholly or partially targeted to serving people with  disabilities.

Similarly, in our prior work we reported that  despite VA\u2019s recent progress in reducing its disability claims workload, it  will be difficult for the agency to cope with future workload increases due  to several factors, including increased demand for services as a result of  military conflicts and legislative mandates. Our survey of federal disability  programs indicates that planning for growth in the demand for benefits or  services is also a challenge for other programs that support people with  disabilities. For example, 54 percent of the programs that provide medical  care and almost half of the programs that provide employment-related  assistance reported that planning for growth in the demand for assistance  was a challenge. Our discussions with responsible agency officials  reinforced the challenges posed by potential growth in demand for  program services or benefits.

In identifying the wide range of federal programs serving  individuals with disabilities and some of the major challenges these  programs face, this report raises several questions about whether other  federal disability programs may also need to be reoriented and  transformed. In particular, are the nearly two hundred programs that  provide assistance to people with disabilities well-suited to address these  challenges, and are they structured in a manner that collectively allows  them to provide coherent and seamless support to people with  disabilities? Also, in light of the nation\u2019s large and growing structural  deficit, do these programs represent the most cost-effective approaches to  serving individuals with disabilities?", "On the basis of more than a decade of research focusing on the nation\u2019s  largest disability programs and our review of prior GAO reports examining  efforts to reform federal programs and transform agencies, we have  identified several key factors that are important to consider in assessing  the need for, and nature of, program transformations. In particular, our  prior work identifying shortcomings in the work incentives and supports  provided by the largest federal disability programs indicates that these  basic program design issues need to be addressed. Second, given the tight  fiscal constraints facing both federal and state governments, programs will  need to carefully consider the sustainability of current costs and the  potential costs associated with transformation initiatives. Finally,  programs will need to evaluate the feasibility of any transformation  efforts, considering whether appropriate processes and systems\u2014 including those related to the planning and management of human capital  and information technology\u2014are in place to effectively carry out current  operations or proposed changes. Figure 6 presents a list of questions that  may serve as a guide for addressing these factors.", "In addition to addressing these questions, which will provide a basic  framework for individually assessing existing programs and proposals for  transforming them, it is also important that some mechanism be  established for looking across programs to assess their overall  effectiveness and integration and whether they are designed to achieve  similar or complimentary goals. The diffusion of responsibility for federal  programs serving people with disabilities across multiple agencies and the  absence of any clear central authority for guiding a fundamental  reassessment of federal disability policy will likely pose significant  impediments to such action. However, a reexamination could serve to  identify programs and policies that are outdated or ineffective while  improving the targeting and efficiency of remaining programs through  such actions as redesigning allocation and cost-sharing provisions and  consolidating facilities and programs. Our recently issued report  concerning \u201c21st Century Challenges\u201d identifies approaches\u2014such as the  use of special temporary commissions to develop policy proposals and the  exercise of congressional oversight through hearings on the activities of  federal agencies\u2014that may be used for such a reexamination should the  Congress choose to pursue this course of action.

We defined the scope of our review to include those federal programs  meeting one of more of the following criteria: (1) people with disabilities  are specifically mentioned in a program\u2019s authorizing legislation as a  targeted group, (2) people are eligible for the program wholly because of a  disability, (3) people are eligible for the program partially because of a  disability, (4) people with disabilities are given special consideration in  eligibility determinations, or (5) people with disabilities are given priority  in being served. Programs that serve individuals without respect to  disability (i.e., disability is not an explicit criteria for program eligibility)  but that serve some individuals with disabilities (such as Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families) are beyond the scope of our review. In  addition, we excluded programs whose principal focus is research,  demonstrations, training for professionals who work with people with  disabilities, technical assistance, or special transportation, as well as  disability retirement programs for federal workers.", "To develop a list of programs that met these criteria, we first conducted a  systematic search in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)  to identify programs that have some role in serving people with disabilities  and the respective agencies responsible for administering each of these  programs. In addition, we reviewed federal agency Web sites to identify  additional programs that were not included in the CFDA. We then  submitted the list of programs administered by each agency to that agency  for verification. (The final list of programs along with some descriptive  information on each program can be found in app. II.) In developing our  list, we included federal programs regardless of how the benefit, service,  or assistance is ultimately delivered to the individual (e.g., directly by the  federal agency or indirectly by another entity, such as a state agency).", "To obtain information on federal programs supporting people with  disabilities and the challenges they face, we conducted a Web-based  survey, which collected basic information on each program, including the  types of assistance provided, whether the assistance is provided directly to  beneficiaries or indirectly through other entities, whether the program is  partially or wholly targeted to people with disabilities, the number of  beneficiaries served, program spending, and the challenges faced by these  programs (i.e., obstacles that hindered a program\u2019s ability to effectively  and efficiently support people with disabilities). (A more complete  tabulation of the survey results related to program challenges is available  on the GAO Web site at www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-695SP.) To  identify the appropriate program officials to respond to the survey, we  submitted the list of programs that we compiled to liaisons at each agency.  These liaisons then identified the appropriate respondents at their  respective agencies. We pretested the content and format of our survey  with officials from eight programs to determine if it was understandable  and if the information was feasible to collect, and we refined the survey as  appropriate. We then sent e-mail notifications to the identified officials of  299 programs beginning on June 15, 2004, asking them to complete the  survey by June 28, 2004. To encourage respondents to complete the  survey, we sent e-mail messages to prompt each nonrespondent 1 and 2  weeks after the initial e-mail message. We closed the survey on August 16,  2004. We obtained survey responses from 258 programs, for an overall  response rate of 86 percent. In addition, for 11 of the 41 programs that did  not submit survey responses, we obtained descriptive information from  the CFDA to answer a limited number of survey questions to the extent  that such information was available. Based on responses to survey  questions asking programs to identify the criteria they apply in serving  people with disabilities and the primary type of assistance they provide,  we identified 192 programs (comprising 64 percent of all programs  surveyed) that met our criteria for defining programs as either wholly or  partially targeted towards serving individuals with disabilities.", "Although our survey asked programs to provide spending data, because of  limitations or inconsistencies in the spending information reported by  survey respondents, we obtained spending data from the Consolidated  Federal Funds Report (CFFR)\u2014a database compiled by the Bureau of the  Census\u2014for all of the relevant programs listed in this database. For  programs that did not have data reported in the CFFR, we used spending  information from the survey data. In a few cases where spending data was  not available from either the CFFR or survey data, we obtained this  information from the CFDA. To verify the spending data that we present in  this report, we sent each program an e-mail message asking them to  confirm the amounts we had identified. While many programs confirmed  the spending amounts that we listed in our message, others identified  different amounts. The spending data we present in this report are based  on the final verified spending amounts identified by programs in their  response to our e-mail. These data are not entirely consistent across  programs. For example, while most of these data represent spending for  fiscal year 2003, some programs instead provided data for other fiscal  years. Also, some programs included administrative costs in their spending  figures while others did not include such costs. In addition, while the  majority of the spending data we report represent program obligations,  some of the data instead represent outlays. Of the 95 wholly targeted  programs in our analysis, we were able to obtain some type of spending  data for 85 programs. However, many partially targeted programs were  unable to provide us with data pertaining to their programs\u2019 spending on  people with disabilities because they do not separately track or collect  such data for these individuals. As a result, we do not present spending  data in this report for partially targeted programs except for three  programs (Supplemental Security Income, Medicare, and Medicaid) for  which we were able to obtain a breakdown of spending on people with  disabilities from agency documents.", "Because we relied extensively on program spending data derived from the  2003 CFFR data that are available on-line from the CFFR Web site  (http://www.census.gov/govs/www/cffr.html), we conducted limited tests  of the reliability of these data, including frequency analyses of critical data  fields. We restricted our reliability assessment to the specific variables  that were pertinent to our analysis. These tests indicated that the critical  data fields were sufficiently complete and accurate for the purposes of our  analysis.", "To obtain additional information on the challenges faced by programs, we  conducted interviews with federal agency officials and officials from  disability advocacy organizations, and reviewed pertinent agency  documents, GAO reports, and academic research on disability issues.", "To identify questions that should be addressed in transforming federal  disability programs, we reviewed the major findings and recommendations  that have resulted from the substantial body of GAO research on federal  disability programs over the past decade. We also examined past GAO  reports on program reform and organizational transformation throughout  the federal government.", "Because our questionnaire was not a sample survey, there are no sampling  errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the  data are entered into a database or were analyzed, can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the  development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For example, social  science survey specialists designed the questionnaire in collaboration with  GAO staff with subject matter expertise. Then, as mentioned earlier, the  draft questionnaire was pretested with program officials to ensure that the  questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. When the  data were analyzed, a second, independent analyst checked all computer  programs.

The information  presented in this table is based mostly on the programs\u2019 survey responses,  although it also presents data obtained from other sources. In particular,  the spending information is derived from multiple sources, including  programs\u2019 survey responses and federal government reports on program  spending. The spending data we present below represent either  obligations, expenditures, or appropriations, as indicated by the table  notes accompanying each reported amount. Due to the various sources  that we used to identify program spending and possible inconsistencies in  these data (e.g., differences in the fiscal years for which spending was  reported by programs), we advise caution in efforts to compare or sum  spending figures across programs. Also, given the significant limitations in  the spending data available for partially targeted programs, we do not  present such data in this table.
