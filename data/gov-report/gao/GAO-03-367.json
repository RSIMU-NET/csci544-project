It conducted and evaluated several pilot program studies aimed at fixing its problem-plagued program and, in 2002, issued a report to Congress with three recommendations. The 1997 Defense Appropriations Act Conference Report directed GAO to validate the results achieved by the pilot programs. In response, GAO examined the extent to which DOD's recommendations to Congress (1) offer solutions to long-standing problems in the current program and (2) are supported by the evaluation's findings and should be implemented. GAO also assessed the soundness of methodologies used by DOD to develop cost estimates to implement the recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The recommendations in DOD's report to Congress have the potential to resolve several long-standing problems found in the current personal property program, which manages the transportation and storage of household goods. The recommendations, if implemented, would (1) reengineer the claims process to reduce the length of time it currently takes to resolve claims for lost, destroyed, or damaged household goods and increase the reimbursement rates that military personnel currently receive for their losses; (2) use performance-based service contracts to improve the generally low quality of service that DOD currently gets from the moving industry; and (3) put in place new information technology with interface capabilities to enable program managers and users to monitor in-transit shipments and track the number and cost of shipments processed each year. The recommendations in DOD's report to Congress are supported by the Transportation Command's evaluation of the pilot programs' findings and should be implemented within budget constraints. DOD's approach in conducting the evaluation was methodologically sound: It developed an evaluation plan to guide its work and adjusted the plan when necessary to address differences in the pilot programs' approaches. While the shipments included in the evaluation do not represent all shipment types managed annually by DOD, GAO believes that the evaluation results provide sufficient information to allow DOD to initiate actions to improve its current personal property program. GAO found that the soundness of methodologies used to develop DOD's cost estimates varied. Therefore, DOD's ability to implement changes to the existing program within the cost estimates DOD reported to Congress is uncertain. GAO found that the estimate to implement the information technology recommendation was $7 million rather than the $4 million to $6 million estimate DOD reported to Congress. In developing cost estimates for the remaining recommendations, DOD did not provide the same level of evidentiary support for one of the three adjustments it used to align the pilot programs' costs to current program costs. As a result, GAO questions the extent to which these recommendations can be implemented within DOD's estimated 13 percent increase over current program costs. While DOD believes it used a conservative approach in developing this 13 percent estimate, it has not quantified the risk associated with the projection, which could provide the military services and Congress information needed to develop and review future budget requests for this program. Without providing the range of possible cost increases and the risk regarding the likelihood of achieving this 13 percent projection within that range, DOD may find a repeat of what occurred during the pilots, where the military services terminated participation in one of the pilot programs due to costs exceeding projections. GAO also found that without carefully monitoring costs during the implementation phase and assessing costs and benefits from a period succeeding full implementation of the recommendations, DOD would not have the information needed to determine if anticipated improvements in the program are being achieved at a reasonable cost."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Military personnel and their families can expect to relocate many times  during a service member\u2019s career. As the moving industry\u2019s single largest  customer, the Department of Defense (DOD) spends more than $1.7 billion  annually for its personal property program, which provides household  goods transportation and storage services for military personnel and their  families when they relocate. The program manages more than 600,000  personal property shipments each year. DOD has experienced long- standing problems with its current personal property program, including  excessive loss or damage to property, high claims costs incurred by the  government, and poor quality of service from moving companies.  Moreover, the program\u2019s data management system does not provide  reliable information on the status of individual shipments or on the types  of shipments and their costs.", "In an effort to test alternative approaches and improve the quality of its  personal property program, DOD has carried out several initiatives over  the past 8 years. In 2000, the U.S. Transportation Command began to  collect data from one of the three pilot programs to evaluate alternative  approaches for improving the current program. The Transportation  Command compared the features of the current program with those of the  three pilot programs, and in June 2002 it submitted a report to the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics) outlining its evaluation strategy,  findings, and recommendations. In its November 12, 2002, report to  Congress, DOD included the three recommendations resulting from the  evaluation and the estimated additional costs required to implement  program improvements based on a subsequent assessment of pilot and  current programs\u2019 operations.", "Our involvement in this issue stems from the conference report on the  1997 Defense Appropriations Act, which directed us to review the data  collected from the pilot programs and validate the results before DOD  expands any of the pilot programs, and a subsequent request from the  Subcommittee on Readiness of the House Committee on Armed Services.  This report supplements our previous testimony on DOD\u2019s efforts to  enhance its current program, as well as our status report and status  briefings to Congress on DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a methodologically  sound evaluation of the pilot programs. As agreed with your offices, for  this report we assessed the extent to which the recommendations in  DOD\u2019s November 2002 report (1) offer solutions to long-standing problems  in the personal property program and (2) are supported by the evaluation\u2019s  findings and should be implemented. In addition, we assessed the  soundness of the methodology used by DOD to develop the cost estimates  for implementing the recommendations.", "To conduct our assessment of DOD\u2019s three recommendations to Congress,  we reviewed DOD and GAO prior reports on the personal property  program, interviewed DOD officials and private-sector contractors  involved in the current and pilot personal property programs and the  Transportation Command\u2019s evaluation, examined the methodology and  findings of the Transportation Command\u2019s evaluation of the three pilot  programs, reviewed the methodology and data generated by each of the  three pilot programs, and assessed the methodologies used to develop the  cost estimates for implementing DOD\u2019s recommendations.

The program relies on more than 1,200 domestic commercial  carriers and 150 freight forwarders for international shipments to provide  household goods transportation and storage services for military  personnel and their families when they relocate. The military services pay  shipment and storage-related costs from their military personnel accounts  and loss and damage claims and personal property shipment office  expenses through their operations and maintenance accounts. The  program has remained virtually unchanged for nearly 40 years. It involves  a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing  moves, evaluating transportation providers\u2019 performance, paying invoices,  and settling claims. Among the program\u2019s many challenges is ensuring that  the moving industry provides adequate year-round capacity, especially  during the summer peak-moving season when most service members, as  well as the general public, schedule their moves.", "In prior reports, both DOD and GAO have identified problems related to  the loss and damage claims process and the low quality of service from  movers. In designing and implementing its evaluation plan, the  Transportation Command also noted that weaknesses in the current  program\u2019s data management system precluded DOD from being able to  track shipments in transit and from being able to extract reliable data on  the number and types of shipments managed annually and their associated  costs.", "In response to the long-standing problems, DOD has undertaken a number  of pilot program studies to find ways to improve the process of shipping  service members\u2019 household goods. In August 1996, the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Logistics) tasked the Transportation Command with  evaluating alternative approaches to the current program and  recommending changes in the program based on the results of its  evaluation. The Transportation Command identified three ongoing or  planned pilot programs to include in its evaluation and began to collect  data for its analysis from one of them in 2000. These three pilot programs  shared some common features, such as testing performance-based service  contracts and providing full replacement (rather than depreciated) value  for loss or damage. Each one also had some distinctive features, such as  allowing service members to participate in selecting their movers and  contracting out installation personal property shipment office functions to  private-sector move manager companies.", "The three pilot programs are summarized below. Further information on  each program, as well as DOD\u2019s current personal property program, is  provided in appendix II.", "The Military Traffic Management Command\u2019s Reengineered Personal  Property Program operated from the military services\u2019 and the Coast  Guard\u2019s installations located in North Carolina, South Carolina, and  Florida. It used military installation personal property shipment office  personnel, as the current program does, and developed a new data  management system that tracked both the movement of individual  shipments and information on the number and cost of shipments.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s Full Service Moving Project operated  from the military services\u2019 and the Coast Guard\u2019s installations located  in the National Capital Region (the Washington, D.C., metropolitan  area), Georgia, and North Dakota.

After reviewing the results and  receiving comments from the military services, DOD submitted its report,  dated November 12, 2002, to Congress. DOD\u2019s report contained the same  three recommendations contained in the Transportation Command\u2019s  report. DOD also provided cost estimates for implementing the  recommendations. The three recommendations were to  reengineer the liability/claims process by adopting commercial  practices of minimum valuation, simplifying the filing of claims, and  providing direct settlement with the carrier;    change the acquisition process to implement performance-based  implement information technology improvements, which could  interface functions across such areas as personnel, transportation,  financial, and claims.", "In its report to Congress, DOD estimated that reengineering the  liability/claims process and changing the acquisition process to implement  performance-based service contracts would increase the current  program\u2019s estimated $1.7 billion cost by 13 percent. Implementing the  information technology improvements to enhance its data management  capabilities and to provide training to users was estimated at an additional  $4 million to $6 million.", "DOD also estimated that efforts to implement the changes to the current  program would be completed by the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. DOD  has developed a plan of action and milestones for designing the new  personal property program. This initial effort identifies several teams,  which are exploring the following issues: the acquisition/solicitation  process, quality assurance, the liability/claims process, information  systems technology, and electronic billing and payment. Four of these  issues address the recommendations included in DOD\u2019s November 2002  report to Congress. The plan identifies a list of essential activities needed  to carry out the responsibilities required to build the future personal  property program. It also includes time lines and identifies a process to  monitor problems and delays. However, it does not include monitoring  costs and benefits during the implementation phase and the extent the  proposed changes are being achieved within an acceptable and a  predefined range.

The inability to monitor  shipments and shipping information has been long recognized and was  highlighted as an additional problem during DOD\u2019s evaluation. If  implemented, the first recommendation (i.e., reengineering the  liability/claims process by adopting commercial practices of minimum  valuation, simplifying the filing of claims, and providing direct settlement  with the carrier) has the potential to help reduce the length of time it  currently takes to resolve claims for lost, destroyed, or damaged  household goods because the carrier recovery time would be eliminated  for most moves, increase the reimbursement rates military personnel  receive for their losses, and reduce DOD\u2019s claims-related costs.

Under each pilot program, military  personnel settled claims directly with the carriers. Service members who  were not satisfied with offers made by the carriers could file their  unresolved claims directly with DOD.

Personnel receive only  the depreciated value of lost, destroyed, or damaged items, up to a  maximum of $40,000 per move. When arranging their moves under the  current program, military personnel can buy increased insurance coverage  from their carrier, up to a full replacement value limit of $3.50 per pound  times the shipment weight, at a cost of 85 cents per $100 of the stated  value of the shipment. However, only military personnel making moves  within the continental United States can buy this additional coverage; it is  not available to those moving to or from overseas posts. Another option  that military personnel have to increase their protection for loss and  damage is to buy additional coverage from private-sector sources.", "Unlike the current program, the pilot programs provided full replacement  value for lost and destroyed goods, with maximum amounts ranging from  $63,000 to $75,000. Damaged items were repaired. Two of the three pilot  programs reported that their cost per pound times the shipment weight  rates were $3.50 for $63,000 maximum coverage and $6.00 for $75,000  maximum coverage, respectively.

DOD pays approximately $100 million a year in claims but recovers  only 60 to 65 percent of the amounts paid to military personnel from the  moving industry. These figures understate the actual loss and damage,  since all military personnel do not file claims, apparently because the  process takes a long time and reimbursement rates do not always cover  the losses. DOD incurs these losses due to the structure of its current  program. The military claims offices assist service members by arranging  to pay their claims and then submitting the claims to the respective  movers for reimbursement.

According to the two  pre-evaluation surveys cited in the Transportation Command\u2019s evaluation,  around 55 to 65 percent of respondents reported suffering some loss or  damage of household goods during a recent move. Moreover, in the   pre-evaluation survey conducted by the Transportation Command, the top  four factors identified by service members as being of greatest importance  to them in the moving process were the quality of packing, the care in  handling personal property, the condition of their property upon receipt at  the end of the move, and the receipt of fair payment for any losses or  damages they suffered. In individual comments obtained during the   pre-evaluation survey, the Transportation Command reported that some  service members also cited the lack of professionalism and quality of  customer service on behalf of moving crews as a concern.", "The problem stems primarily from the current program placing greater  emphasis on costs (i.e., the lowest bids) than on the quality of service that  carriers provide when moving shipments of military household goods.  While the current program established its Total Quality Assurance  Program to measure quality, data collected to develop scores for each  carrier includes three measures (timeliness of pickup, timeliness of  delivery, and reported loss and damage), which are not collected for all  household goods shipments. The best indication of quality, customer  satisfaction, is not measured in the current program. The problem of  quality is further exacerbated by the program\u2019s use of a 20 year-old tariff  schedule that carriers use in developing their bids. This tariff contains  lower rates than the current commercial tariff used during the pilot  programs.", "Unlike the current program, the pilot programs screened carriers that  wanted to participate in their programs by emphasizing the quality of  carriers\u2019 prior performance rather than the amount of their bids. For  example, the Full Service Moving Project contracted a financial services  company to conduct a financial and performance assessment of potential  movers. The pilot program emphasized best value and placed more  emphasis on performance (70 percent) than cost (30 percent) in  determining which providers were awarded shipments. The pilot programs  showed that these types of contracts could allow the government to   pre-screen carriers for financial viability and, more importantly, to  institute and maintain a quality assurance process to reduce losses and  improve service.", "In addition to prescreening carriers for quality control purposes, the pilot  programs also surveyed military personnel who participated in the  programs and used the results to distribute future shipments to carriers  that received the best performance scores. To address concerns about the  obsolete tariff schedule, the pilot programs adopted current commercial  tariffs for carriers to use in establishing their bids.", "The pilot programs also showed that the solicitation process could be  streamlined by eliminating detailed statements of work and that the pilot  programs could place responsibility for successful performance on  carriers, allowing the government to focus on outcomes, rather than  processes. Finally, the pilot programs demonstrated that using these types  of performance-based service contracts did not have an adverse effect on  small business participation, a major concern of the moving industry. On  the basis of the total dollar value of shipments, each pilot program  exceeded the Small Business Administration\u2019s goal of 23 percent  participation for the industry. Specifically, 48 percent of the Military  Traffic Management Command\u2019s Reengineered Personal Property  Program\u2019s revenues, 74 percent of the Full Service Moving Project\u2019s  revenues, and 100 percent of the Navy\u2019s Service Member Arranged Move\u2019s  revenues went to small businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Information Technology Improvements to Address Data Reliability Problems", "paragraphs": ["Another ongoing problem with the current personal property program is  its inability to provide reliable data on the status of in-transit shipments or  on the number and associated costs of shipments managed by DOD each  year.

In addition, they have no access to real-time  tracking data that they could use to manage transportation and storage  costs and to help cut down on the need for temporary storage by reducing  the number of failed deliveries.", "Two of the pilot programs included features to address the problems  associated with the current program\u2019s stand-alone data management  system. The pilot programs each developed a Web-based data management  system to enhance the visibility of individual shipments and provide more  reliable data on shipments and costs. For example, the Military Traffic  Management Command\u2019s Reengineered Personal Property Program\u2019s data  management system provided in-transit visibility. This made it possible to  track the status of individual shipments and gave real-time access to those  sections of the shipment records that various parties involved in the  relocation process needed for data entry or status review.

Before it started the evaluation process, the  Transportation Command considered some lessons learned that had  emerged from our review of the Hunter Pilot Program in 1999, and it  followed through with several of them. For example, it obtained assistance  from a contractor to design an evaluation plan that met professional  standards. The Transportation Command identified four aspects, or  factors, of the property program that served as the focus of its evaluation  (i.e., quality of life, total costs, small business participation, and process  improvements). The evaluation plan also prescribed that only one quality  of life survey be administered to each participating service member in  order to avoid survey \u201cfatigue\u201d that can result from subjecting a person to  multiple surveys, and thus avoid the resulting potential for questionable  results. In designing the evaluation plan, the Transportation Command  incorporated a number of important evaluation features. These features  included assessing the four factors consistently across all three pilot  programs, ensuring that the evaluation received data from the pilot  programs during the same time period to avoid the need to make  adjustments due to potential changes in carrier operations and costs,  conducting a survey of service members using the current program to  establish a baseline from which to measure the pilot program results, and  developing a method to provide estimates of what DOD would have paid  for comparable shipments under the current program for those shipments  completed under the pilot programs.", "The Transportation Command made appropriate adjustments to the  evaluation plan when it learned that the three pilot programs would not be  underway at the same time and that they would not provide all of the  information originally outlined in the plan.

The Transportation Command included  qualitative analytical techniques so that it could include as much  information on each pilot program as possible in its evaluation while also  dealing appropriately with data limitations.

Survey results indicated that full replacement (rather than  depreciated) value, direct claims settlements, and anticipated  improvements in the claims process accounted for the highest increases in  satisfaction.

The first two adjustments (i.e., reducing  the average weight of shipments and reducing costs to adjust for a mix of  small and large businesses) were made to offset differences between the  pilot programs\u2019 shipments and those more typically managed across DOD.  The third adjustment was made to reduce the pilot programs\u2019 costs to  reflect anticipated savings based on economies of scale. In developing  these adjustments, the Military Traffic Management Command worked  with a contractor and consulted with officials from the military services  and moving industry associations.", "While we believe that the shipment weight and small business mix  adjustments are reasonable, we question the extent to which the  economies of scale or program efficiencies adjustment may be achieved.  For the weight adjustment, the Military Traffic Management Command  determined that the average weights of moves in the two pilot program  areas were higher than those experienced in typical departmentwide  moves. As a result, the Military Traffic Management Command reduced the  pilot programs\u2019 average weights to reflect the lower, more typical weights  to be used in calculating a total cost for a departmentwide program. This  adjustment resulted in a 12 percent drop in average costs. We found the  approach of using historical data to more accurately reflect the typical  shipment weights to be reasonable.", "Next, the Military Traffic Management Command further lowered the pilot  programs\u2019 average costs because the pilot programs had higher small  business participation rates than the departmentwide average, and small  businesses are typically more expensive than large businesses. Small  businesses accounted for 48 percent of the cost of all moves under the  Reengineered Personal Property Program and 73 percent under the Full  Service Moving Project. In addition, small businesses were 14 percent  more expensive per shipment in the Reengineered Personal Property  Program and 74 percent more expensive in the Full Service Moving Project  than what each pilot program paid to large businesses. In developing its  departmentwide estimate, the Military Traffic Management Command  used a small business participation target rate of 30 percent. This               30 percent target rate is higher than the Small Business Administration\u2019s  23 percent goal for government agencies conducting business with this  industry. On the basis of this lower participation rate, the Military Traffic  Management Command reduced the pilot programs\u2019 average costs further  by 8 percent. We agree that this adjustment in costs based on differences  in the pilot programs\u2019 small business participation rate and the new           30 percent goal is a reasonable way to reflect the differences between the  pilot programs\u2019 costs and the departmentwide-projected costs.", "We found that the third adjustment that the Military Traffic Management  Command made\u2014to reduce the cost of departmentwide shipments  because of economies of scale or program efficiencies\u2014was not  adequately supported based on either historical experience or data that  DOD later provided. The Military Traffic Management Command reduced  the pilot programs\u2019 average costs by 5 percent on the assumption that  the pilot programs\u2019 shipments involved only a limited number of  providers;  the pilot programs only included a limited number of shipments while  the current program manages over 600,000 shipments annually;   more accurate and timely management data that includes service   member counseling, reduced losses, and storage and indirect costs will  result in a more efficient program; and    overhead and operating costs will be spread due to a larger volume of  shipments.", "While recognizing that some changes may result from these anticipated  program efficiencies, the effect of these changes on potential cost savings  is uncertain at this time.

The need for this type of information  is further supported based on the long-standing problems associated with  the current program and the fact that shipment and storage costs under  the pilot programs were significantly higher than those that DOD  estimated it would have paid under its current program in the same  geographical areas.

For the first of these recommendations, DOD  stated that it is developing a plan to implement those recommendations it  reported to Congress and anticipates its recommendations will be  implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, assuming  the military services receive the additional funds needed to fund program  enhancements. In response to our recommendation to monitor costs  during the implementation phase, DOD stated that rolling out the new  program will require monitoring of costs to determine if the moving  industry partners are submitting bids that will allow DOD to enhance this  program within the projected 13 percent cost increase. Further, DOD plans  to include a process to conduct a rate reasonableness analysis upon  receipt of the rates. For rates found to be outside the range of  reasonableness, carriers will be given one opportunity to resubmit their  rates. DOD plans to only use those rates determined to be reasonable in  the new program. DOD also plans to include metrics, target/benchmark  performance indicators, and a methodology for data collection in an  updated program of action and milestone plan. For our recommendation,  i.e., assess the effects of the three DOD recommendations on the personal  property program to determine whether the anticipated improvements in  the program are being achieved at a reasonable cost, DOD plans to collect  data needed to determine if anticipated improvements have been achieved  on a continuing basis. DOD plans to use customer satisfaction surveys in  developing carrier performance ratings, which will be established  quarterly, with the exception of the peak season, when performance  ratings will be established monthly.

DOD continues to believe that the 5 percent reduction it made  to pilot programs\u2019 average costs to adjust for economies of scale/program  efficiencies was reasonable and very conservative and that the program  can be implemented within the projected 13 percent increase over current  program costs. DOD also reported that one of the military services  validated the 13 percent cost increase following our audit. Further, DOD  stated that it did not see value added in providing the military services or  Congress a formal risk assessment but will continue to work with the  military services as execution progresses to make sure they have all  information required for budget purposes. Additionally, while not part of  this recommendation, DOD also said it did not concur with our finding  that the cost estimate for implementing its information technology  improvements recommendation would be $7 million.", "In reviewing the response, we found that DOD still did not provide any  data to support its assumption of a 5 percent cost savings from economies  of scale/program efficiencies. DOD stated that the new program will be  about 200 times larger than the pilot programs and that the resulting  increase in volume will lower the cost per unit, a standard and accepted  law of economics. While we agree that the cost may decrease, it may also  increase or remain unchanged. Moreover, the cost may decrease by less  than 5 percent. Without specific data showing the per move costs will  decrease as the scale of operations increase, we continue to question the  basis for DOD\u2019s assumption of a 5 percent reduction.", "We believe that the validation effort completed by one of the military  services, along with the calculations and assumptions DOD used in  developing the 13 percent cost estimate, does not provide the military  services and Congress with information needed to reliably develop and  review budget requests to fund enhancements to the current program. We  continue to believe that DOD needs to qualify this estimate with a measure  of the risk associated with implementing its recommendations. Without  providing the range of possible cost increases and the risk regarding the  likelihood of achieving this 13 percent projection within that range, DOD  may encounter a repetition of its experience with one of the pilot  programs, which had to be terminated because actual costs exceeded  projected costs. Absent this risk information, the military services will  have to wait until after the transportation providers submit their bids in  order to learn whether the recommendations can be implemented within  the 13 percent projection. Should the bids result in costs that exceed this  estimate, DOD and the military services will need to make adjustments to  ensure that the recommendations are implemented within funding limits.  Therefore, we continue to believe that our recommendation has merit.", "Our finding that the implementation of the information technology  improvements recommendation would likely cost $7 million rather than  the $4 million to $6 million that DOD projected was based on information  we received from DOD during the audit. Specifically, we calculated that  the costs to develop and implement the new system would be about          $5 million and that training for users of the enhanced system would cost  an additional $1 million. DOD had identified the need for this training  during its evaluation of the pilot programs. After DOD submitted its report  to Congress, it identified another potential cost\u2014an additional $1 million  for independent verification and validation testing of the system. Our        $7 million estimated included all three of these cost elements. In its  response to a draft of this report, DOD maintained that its costs estimate  would fall within its initial cost estimate of $4 million to $6 million,  including $5 million for system development and implementation and an  additional $500,000 each for user training and system verification and  validation testing. At a minimum, based on these projected cost estimates,  the initial cost to implement the information technology improvements  recommendation would more likely be $6 million.  However, since we did  not originally assess the sufficiency of the $1 million estimates for training  and testing, we are unable to assess what impact DOD\u2019s reduction for  these costs to $500,000 would have on the implementation of the system  across DOD.
