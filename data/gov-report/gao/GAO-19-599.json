These facilities  include nursing homes, which provide skilled nursing and rehabilitative  care to elderly and disabled individuals, and assisted living facilities,  which provide a residential alternative to nursing home care for  individuals who may prefer to live independently but need assistance with  daily activities. Residents of both types of facilities often have physical  and cognitive limitations that can make them particularly vulnerable to  abuse. Abuse, which can be committed by facility staff, residents, or  others, is a serious occurrence and could result in potentially devastating  consequences for the victim, including lasting mental anguish, serious  injury, or death. While abuse is a concern for both elderly and nonelderly  individuals in long-term care facilities, this report focuses on federal  oversight to protect elderly residents of these facilities from abuse, more  specifically known as elder abuse.", "Federal law mandates that nursing homes receiving Medicare and  Medicaid payment must ensure that residents are free from abuse,  neglect, and exploitation. Nursing homes must meet a comprehensive  set of federal statutory and regulatory requirements in order to receive  such payments. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014 the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014is responsible for  implementing these requirements. In 2016, nursing homes provided care  to approximately 1.4 million individuals.", "In contrast to nursing homes, assisted living facilities are primarily  overseen at the state level through state licensing and regulatory  requirements. States that provide Medicaid coverage of assisted living  facility services for older adults typically do so through a home and  community-based service (HCBS) waiver under section 1915(c) of the  Social Security Act (SSA). Under these waivers, states are responsible  for developing adequate standards to protect the health and safety of  beneficiaries receiving services under the waiver and must demonstrate  to CMS that these standards are met. In 2016, Medicaid covered assisted  living facility services for an estimated 125,000 elderly beneficiaries.", "In recent reports, we have found that improved federal oversight of the  health and welfare of residents is needed in both nursing homes and  assisted living facilities. For example, as we reported in our June 2019  report, we found that the incidence of abuse in nursing homes as  identified by state survey agencies increased between 2013 and 2017,  and in January 2018, we found that little is known about the incidence of  abuse in assisted living facilities. In CMS\u2019s oversight of both settings, we  found a lack of clear federal guidance on reporting and consequently, a  lack of key information necessary for monitoring incidents that may cause  harm to a beneficiary\u2019s health or welfare, such as abuse. Additionally, the  HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) and state auditors have also  examined how elder abuse is reported and investigated and  recommended improvements at both the federal and state level.", "You asked us to review federal oversight of the reporting, investigation,  and notification of law enforcement about elder abuse in nursing homes  and assisted living facilities. In this report, we describe federal  requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement  about elder abuse in both types of facilities.

We selected a non-generalizable sample of three  states\u2014Connecticut, Oklahoma, and South Dakota\u2014that have  implemented HCBS waivers and vary in HCBS waiver program size and  geography. In each state, we reviewed their waiver agreements and  spoke with officials from the state survey agency, state Medicaid agency,  and the state agency responsible for licensing assisted living facilities and  investigating complaints. We also interviewed CMS officials, including  regional office officials, about their oversight of state survey agencies and  HCBS waivers in our selected states. We interviewed representatives  from national stakeholder groups representing consumers, facilities,  Medicaid directors, and investigators to obtain their perspectives on elder  abuse in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. We also reviewed  related audits issued by the HHS-OIG and state auditors between 2014  and 2018 related to reporting and investigating elder abuse in nursing  homes and assisted living facilities and included them with a discussion of  related GAO reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2018 to August 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Specifically, nursing homes provide care to elderly and disabled  individuals, many of whom have physical and cognitive limitations  requiring skilled nursing care. Assisted living facilities provide a residential  alternative to nursing home care for individuals who prefer to live  independently but need assistance to maintain their independence. Like  nursing homes, they may provide residents with a variety of services to  assist with activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing, but the  facilities are generally not licensed to provide 24-hour skilled nursing care  and typically offer a more limited range of medical care. As we reported in  our January 2018 report on CMS\u2019s oversight of assisted living facilities  under the Medicaid program, the demand for assisted living services,  which offer the benefit of community living, is expected to increase as a  result of the aging of the nation\u2019s population, increased life expectancy,  and older adults\u2019 desire to remain in the community. Additionally, the  cost of nursing home care for an individual generally exceeds the cost of  assisted living facility services, further incentivizing a shift among  consumers and payers to assisted living for elderly individuals, including  those with increasingly complex health needs who would otherwise need  nursing home care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Care Facility Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Oversight of nursing homes is a shared federal-state responsibility.  Federal law imposes both a comprehensive set of quality standards that  nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, and federal and state oversight responsibilities to enforce  these standards. CMS, which is charged with implementing these  standards and conducting federal oversight, contracts with state survey  agencies to perform both routine inspections\u2014known as standard  surveys\u2014and conduct investigations of elder abuse incidents, including  complaints and facility-reported incidents. CMS provides guidance  implementing statutory and regulatory requirements to protect residents  from elder abuse in its State Operations Manual, which specifies  requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement  about elder abuse in nursing homes. CMS regional offices monitor state  compliance with federal requirements for nursing home oversight.", "Generally, states establish their own oversight requirements for assisted  living facilities. These facilities are largely overseen by state agencies  within, for example, the state health or aging departments; however,  when assisted living facilities provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries,  they are also indirectly subject to CMS oversight through the agency\u2019s  oversight of state Medicaid agencies. As we have previously reported,  states can provide Medicaid coverage for assisted living services under  multiple authorities, but most commonly states use an HCBS waiver  under section 1915(c) of the SSA. Under these waivers, CMS requires  states to develop a quality assurance system that monitors beneficiary  health and welfare\u2014including tracking and responding to incidents that  may cause harm to a beneficiary\u2019s health and welfare, such as elder  abuse. States must demonstrate to CMS that they are meeting these  quality assurance obligations in their waiver renewal reports, typically  submitted about 2 years before an HCBS waiver is scheduled to end.  States must also report summary information annually to CMS on any  health and welfare deficiencies occurring under their HCBS waivers. CMS  regional offices oversee state compliance with waiver requirements.", "In addition to state survey agencies, state Medicaid agencies, and the  agencies that license and regulate assisted living facilities, there are other  entities charged with protecting nursing home and assisted living facility  residents from elder abuse. These agencies\u2019 roles and missions can vary  by state. For example, Adult Protective Services (APS) programs in each  state are generally responsible for identifying, investigating, resolving,  and preventing abuse of older adults, and such programs may investigate  complaints of elder abuse in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  Additionally, Medicaid Fraud Control Units and local law enforcement can  also play a role in investigating elder abuse. Consequently, incident  management may be coordinated among multiple separate agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Requirements Specify Elder Abuse Reporting, Investigation, and Notification in Nursing Homes and Direct States to Establish Assisted Living Facility Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal requirements include those for nursing homes and state survey  agencies specific to reporting, investigating, and notifying law  enforcement of elder abuse in nursing homes. For example, federal  requirements specify the time frames within which nursing homes must  report alleged elder abuse to state survey agencies and, similarly, specify  time frames for state survey agencies to report elder abuse to CMS. In  contrast, there are no similar requirements for assisted living facilities  and, instead, states must establish their own policies to ensure the  reporting and investigation of elder abuse in assisted living facilities  covered by Medicaid. (See fig. 1 for federal requirements for reporting,  investigating, and notifying law enforcement about elder abuse in nursing  homes and assisted living facilities.)", "As illustrated in figure 1, there are key differences between federal  requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement  about elder abuse occurring in nursing homes compared to assisted living  facilities. CMS officials told us that the difference in requirements between  nursing homes and assisted living facilities reflects the different regulatory  relationship between the agency and the two facility types. According to  CMS officials, CMS has direct regulatory authority over nursing homes,  but does not have direct authority over assisted living facilities. As noted,  states are largely responsible for establishing their own policies for  overseeing the reporting and investigation of abuse in assisted living  facilities. (See app. I for profiles of selected states with HCBS waivers  regarding elder abuse reporting, investigating, and notification.)  Differences in federal requirements include the following:  Reporting. Federal law and CMS policy define specific time  frames for nursing home staff and state survey agencies to report  incidents of abuse that occur in nursing homes, respectively, and  CMS requires states to establish their own reporting time frames  for assisted living facilities serving HCBS waiver participants.  Nursing homes must ensure that allegations of elder abuse are  reported to the state survey agency immediately, but no later than  2 hours after the allegation is made if the incident involves serious  bodily injuries and within 24 hours if it does not. In addition, state  survey agencies must report to CMS all complaints and certain  facility-reported incidents of abuse through a computer-based  complaint and incident tracking system and immediately alert  CMS regional offices when an especially significant or sensitive  incident occurs that attracts public or broad media attention. In  contrast, CMS requires state Medicaid agencies that pay for care  in assisted living facilities through HCBS waivers to establish their  own required time frames for reporting incidents. Consequently,  reporting time frames and processes for assisted living facilities  can vary by state. For example, Connecticut requires incidents to  be reported to the state Medicaid agency and Adult Protective  Services within 2 business days, while Oklahoma requires that  initial incident reports are submitted within 1 business day.", "Investigation. CMS prescribes investigation time frames and  priority categories for incidents occurring in nursing homes and  requires states to establish their own time frames and priority  categories for incidents in assisted living facilities. CMS requires  state survey agencies to assess reports of elder abuse in nursing  homes and assign a priority investigation status based on the  seriousness of the allegations. The required investigation time  frames are tied to the priority status. For example, if the allegation  indicates that there continues to be an immediate risk of serious  injury, harm, impairment, or death of a resident unless immediate  corrective action is taken, the survey agency must initiate an  onsite investigation within 2 business days of receiving the  report. CMS also requires nursing homes to have written policies  and procedures for conducting internal investigations of suspected  elder abuse and to submit findings from these investigations to the  state survey agency within 5 business days of the incident. In  contrast, CMS does not prescribe investigation time frames or  define priorities for incidents occurring in assisted living facilities;  instead, CMS requires that state Medicaid agencies with HCBS  waivers establish their own policies for prioritizing reports of abuse  and initiating investigations in assisted living facilities.  Consequently, investigation time frames and prioritization can vary  by state. For example, Connecticut does not specify a process for  prioritizing incident investigations in its HCBS waiver, but officials  told us the state requires the Medicaid program to initiate an  investigation immediately; whereas South Dakota requires face-to- face contact with a victim within 24 hours if the incident is life or  health-threatening.", "Family or Legal Guardian Notification  Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) requires facilities to notify a  resident\u2019s representative of a deterioration in  the resident\u2019s condition, CMS does not require  nursing homes, assisted living facilities, state  survey agencies, or state Medicaid agencies  to notify a victim\u2019s family or legal guardian of  alleged elder abuse. However, CMS\u2019s  guidance for nursing homes notes the  importance of family or legal guardian  notification. Specifically, CMS guidance  requires facilities to take actions to prevent  further harm from occurring to a victim of  alleged elder abuse and cites law  enforcement notification, as well as family or  legal guardian notification as examples of  protective measures facilities may take to  comply with that requirement. In addition,  CMS requires states to develop a policy for  notifying participants, family, or legal  guardians of the findings of any critical  incident investigations under its home and  community-based services waiver program.  CMS officials told us family or legal guardian  notification is generally a state responsibility,  and state officials told us that it is largely a  facility responsibility governed by the facility\u2019s  policies. Some states include family or  guardian notification requirements in state  guidance on mandatory reporting of elder  abuse. In interviews with stakeholders  representing consumers and elder abuse  investigators we learned that family  notification can both help but also pose some  privacy challenges.", "Law enforcement notification. Although federal law requires  nursing homes to establish policies for ensuring that law  enforcement is notified of elder abuse that occurs in their facilities,  and CMS policy requires state survey agencies to notify law  enforcement of substantiated findings of elder abuse that occur in  nursing homes, these actions are not required when a similar  incident occurs in an assisted living facility. Furthermore, CMS  also does not require state Medicaid agencies to establish their  own law enforcement notification requirements for assisted living  facilities as part of the state\u2019s HCBS waiver agreements. CMS and  state officials told us that, generally, state agencies coordinate  with law enforcement regardless of where the abuse occurs.  Some states also require law enforcement notification as part of  their state mandatory reporter laws. (See app. I for descriptions  of selected state mandatory reporter laws.) For example,  Connecticut requires Medicaid waiver program staff members to  inform law enforcement of all suspected crimes, including abuse.  Both GAO and HHS-OIG have identified, among other things,  gaps in notifying law enforcement about abuse in nursing homes  and recommended that CMS make changes to help ensure that  nursing homes and state survey agencies notify law  enforcement.", "In the course of our review, we found states may align certain  requirements for investigating, reporting, and notifying law enforcement  about elder abuse in assisted living facilities with federal requirements for  nursing homes. Officials from all three selected states in our review told  us they apply certain federal nursing home requirements and time frames  to assisted living facilities when overseeing reports and investigations of  alleged elder abuse. For example, officials from Oklahoma and South  Dakota told us they align or are in the process of aligning time frames  within which assisted living facilities are required to report incidents of  elder abuse to state authorities with the time frames federally required for  nursing homes, and said that alignment reduces confusion, especially  among facilities that offer both types of residential care.", "Given its attenuated role in overseeing the reporting, investigation, and  law enforcement notification of elder abuse in assisted living facilities,  CMS officials told us the agency is taking steps to gather and disseminate  best practices to help states better manage their response to elder abuse  incidents in assisted living facilities. Specifically, officials told us that CMS  has initiated an effort to more closely examine how states operate their  incident management systems, which are used to track reports and  investigations of elder abuse in assisted living facilities covered by their  HCBS waivers. In May 2018, CMS surveyed states requesting  information on how those states operate an incident management system  for their HCBS waiver programs to track reports and investigations of  elder abuse. CMS officials said they will take information learned  through the survey as well as through on-site reviews that the agency has  been conducting in five states since June 2019, to develop best practices  and technical guidance on collecting and reporting critical incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.

Reports often included  key recommendations. (See table 1.)", "In addition to GAO\u2019s audits of federal oversight of nursing homes and  assisted living facilities, the Office of Inspector General within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG) routinely audits a  broad range of both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019  (CMS) and states\u2019 oversight activities related to long-term care facilities.

(See table 2.) Although the specific scope of these  reports varied, common findings included gaps in notifying law  enforcement. For example, HHS-OIG examined Medicare claims data to  identify cases where hospital staff had identified potential abuse and  found that nursing homes failed to report many of these incidents to state  survey agencies or notify law enforcement despite federal and state  requirements and recommended that CMS provide training, clarify  guidance, and track referrals to law enforcement.", "State auditors may also audit their states\u2019 oversight of nursing homes and  assisted living facilities.
