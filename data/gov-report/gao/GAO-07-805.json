The weaknesses GAO identified during its tests of the fiscal year 2006 CFS preparation process involved the following areas: reconciling and reporting undistributed offsetting receipts (component of the budget deficit); directly linking audited federal agencies' financial statements to the CFS; reporting unexpended budget balances; reporting operating cash; reporting and disclosing legal contingencies; reconciling intragovernmental activity and balances; preparing and auditing certain information in federal agencies' closing packages; conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and various other internal control weaknesses that were identified in previous years' audits but remained in fiscal year 2006.

The budget deficit is calculated by subtracting actual  budget outlays from actual budget receipts. Budget outlays consist of  federal agencies\u2019 outlay amounts and undistributed offsetting receipts.", "For several years, we have been reporting material unreconciled  differences between the total net outlays reported in selected federal  agencies\u2019 Statements of Budgetary Resources (SBR) and Treasury\u2019s central  accounting records used to compute the budget deficit reported in the  CFS. OMB and Treasury have been working with federal agencies to  reduce these material unreconciled differences. Such efforts have resulted  in significantly reducing the net outlay differences in fiscal year 2006.  However, billions of dollars of differences still exist in this and other  components of the budget deficit because the federal government does not  have effective processes and procedures for identifying and either  resolving or explaining material differences in the components of the  budget deficit between Treasury\u2019s central accounting records and  information reported in agency financial statements and underlying  agency financial information and records. For example, during our audit of  the 2006 CFS, we found that undistributed offsetting receipts related to  two intragovernmental activities: both (1) federal employers\u2019  contributions to their employees\u2019 retirement and (2) interest received by  federal trust funds did not always link to related amounts reported in  federal agencies\u2019 financial statements.

However, neither Treasury nor the respective federal agencies had  identified that differences existed. In addition, we were not able to link the  remainder of these undistributed offsetting receipts, $175.5 billion, to  related information in other federal agencies\u2019 financial statements because  the information was not separately disclosed in such statements.

As noted above, for fiscal year 2006, Treasury\u2019s  central accounting records reflected $169.3 billion of intragovernmental  interest received by certain federal agencies\u2019 trust funds. Treasury\u2019s  central accounting records also reflected outlays by Treasury to such trust  funds for intragovernmental interest of $187.4 billion.

Specifically, in the supplemental information section of  the fiscal year 2006 CFS, Treasury noted that because the President\u2019s  Budget with fiscal year 2006 actual amounts would not be published until  February 2007, it used the estimated fiscal year 2006 amounts from the  previous fiscal year\u2019s President\u2019s Budget, which was issued in February  2006, to report unobligated and obligated budget balances for fiscal year  2006.
