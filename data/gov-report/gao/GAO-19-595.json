Established in 2007, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program forgives federal student loans for borrowers who work for certain public service employers for at least 10 years while making 120 payments via eligible repayment plans, among other requirements. In 2018, Congress funded TEPSLF to help borrowers who faced barriers obtaining PSLF loan forgiveness because they were on repayment plans that were ineligible for PSLF. Congress also required Education to develop a simple method for borrowers to apply for TEPSLF. Education established a process for borrowers to initiate their TEPSLF requests via e-mail. The agency also required TESPLF applicants to submit a separate PSLF application before it would consider their TEPSLF request. Agency officials said they established this process to quickly implement TEPSLF and obtain the information needed to determine borrower eligibility. However, the process can be confusing for borrowers who do not understand why they must apply separately for PSLF\u2014a program they are ineligible for\u2014to be eligible for TEPSLF. Requiring borrowers to submit a separate PSLF application to pursue TEPSLF, rather than having an integrated request such as by including a checkbox on the PSLF application for interested borrowers, is not aligned with Education's strategic goal to improve customer service to borrowers. As a result, some eligible borrowers may miss the opportunity to have their loans forgiven.", "As of May 2019, Education had processed about 54,000 requests for TEPSLF loan forgiveness since May 2018, and approved 1 percent of these requests, totaling about $26.9 million in loan forgiveness (see figure). Most denied requests (71 percent) were denied because the borrower had not submitted a PSLF application. Others were denied because the borrower had not yet made 120 qualifying payments (4 percent) or had no qualifying federal loans (3 percent).", "More than a year after Congress initially funded TEPSLF, some of Education's key online resources for borrowers do not include information on TEPSLF. Education reported that it has conducted a variety of PSLF and TEPSLF outreach activities such as emails to borrowers, social media posts, and new website content. However, Education does not require all federal loan servicers (who may serve borrowers interested in public service loan forgiveness) to include TEPSLF information on their websites. Further, Education's Online Help Tool for borrowers\u2014which provides information on PSLF eligibility\u2014does not include any information on TEPSLF. Requiring all loan servicers to include TEPSLF information on their websites and including TEPSLF information in its online tool for borrowers would increase the likelihood that borrowers are able to obtain the loan forgiveness for which they may qualify."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that Education integrate the TEPSLF request into the PSLF application, require all loan servicers to include TEPSLF information on their websites, and include TEPSLF information in its PSLF Online Help Tool.

After concerns were raised about high PSLF denial rates  and some borrowers facing barriers to pursuing PSLF loan forgiveness,  Congress appropriated $700 million in 2018 to temporarily expand the  PSLF program to forgive the loans of certain borrowers who did not  initially qualify.", "Referred to as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness  (TEPSLF), this new forgiveness is for borrowers who would have been  eligible for the PSLF program, except that they were repaying their loans  in a type of repayment plan that is not eligible for PSLF.

We  examined the process for obtaining TEPSLF loan forgiveness by  reviewing: Education\u2019s TEPSLF website, the TEPSLF servicer\u2019s  internal handbook for processing TEPSLF requests, and Education\u2019s  guidance and instructions to the TEPSLF servicer, including the  servicing contract, contract modifications, and emails. To understand  the borrower experience, we looked at why TEPSLF requests were  denied using data from the TEPSLF loan servicer; spoke with  Education officials, loan servicer staff, and organizations that work  with borrowers about their experiences assisting borrowers interested  in TEPSLF loan forgiveness; and reviewed borrower complaint data.  To identify relevant borrower organizations, we conducted research  on organizations representing student borrowers and emailed them to  ask if they had any experience assisting borrowers with the process  for obtaining TEPSLF loan forgiveness. We interviewed three  organizations that responded to our email inquiry. We reviewed the  112 borrower complaints related to TEPSLF that were received  through Education\u2019s consumer complaint system and the Office of  Federal Student Aid\u2019s (FSA) Ombudsmen from the inception of the  program through March 2019. In addition, we reviewed the 22  complaints related to TEPSLF published in the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau online database over the same time period.  Information from our review of borrower complaints and interviews  with borrower organizations are not representative of and cannot be  generalized to all borrower experiences. We assessed Education\u2019s  TEPSLF process against the department\u2019s objective in its strategic  plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 to improve the quality of  service for customers across the entire student aid life cycle.", "To examine what is known about TEPSLF loan forgiveness approvals  and denials, we analyzed the most recent available data from  Education\u2019s TEPSLF loan servicer on the number of borrower  requests from the beginning of the program in May 2018 through May  2019. Specifically, we analyzed data on the number of TEPSLF  requests and how many were approved and denied. We also  analyzed data on the reasons why requests were denied and on the  total amount of TEPSLF loan forgiveness granted through May 2019.  We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing data system  documentation from the TEPSLF servicer and interviewing  knowledgeable officials, and we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes. To determine how  Education communicates with borrowers about denials, we  interviewed Education and TEPSLF loan servicer officials and  reviewed TEPSLF denial letters and information on Education\u2019s  website about options for borrowers who want to contest the  determinations made on their TEPSLF requests.", "To assess the extent to which Education has conducted outreach to  increase borrower awareness of TEPSLF, we asked Education for  documentation describing their outreach activities, reviewed  Education\u2019s and the TEPSLF servicer\u2019s outreach communications to  individual borrowers, and their online outreach information. We  reviewed Education\u2019s and all federal student loan servicers\u2019 websites  to determine what TEPSLF information was available to borrowers  online. We interviewed Education officials and the TEPSLF loan  servicer\u2019s management staff about their outreach efforts. We  assessed Education\u2019s outreach efforts against the department\u2019s  strategic plan objective for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 to improve  the quality of service for customers across the entire student aid life  cycle, and federal internal control standards for communication with  external stakeholders.", "For all objectives, we also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations.  In addition, at the time of our review, there was ongoing litigation related  to TEPSLF. Therefore, we scoped our study to minimize overlap with issues pending in that litigation. As a result of this approach, our findings  do not draw any conclusions about how individual borrowers may have  been affected by any of the issues addressed in this report. Shortly before  issuing this report, additional lawsuits related to TEPSLF were filed in July  2019.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Education currently contracts with nine loan servicers that each  handle the billing and other services for a portion of the over $1 trillion in  outstanding student loans provided through the Direct Loan program.  These servicers track and manage day-to-day servicing activities.  Education contracts with a single loan servicer to implement PSLF and  TEPSLF, which includes responding to borrower inquiries, reviewing  requests for loan forgiveness, and processing loan forgiveness for  qualifying borrowers. Borrowers interested in pursuing loan forgiveness  under either PSLF or TEPSLF must have their loans transferred to this  loan servicer in order to proceed.", "TEPSLF is a temporary expansion of the PSLF program and the eligibility  requirements for TEPSLF are largely the same as those of the PSLF  program with a few key exceptions. Both provide eligible borrowers with  forgiveness on the remaining balance of their Direct Loans after they  have met all program requirements. To receive forgiveness for a loan  under either PSLF or TEPSLF, borrowers are required to be employed in  a public service job for 10 years when making 120 qualifying payments, at  the time they apply for forgiveness, and at the time they receive  forgiveness for their loans. Specifically, borrowers are generally required  to:", "Work full-time for at least 10 years at a public service organization, a government organization, agency, or entity at any level (federal,  state, local, or Tribal); a nonprofit, tax exempt organization (under section 501(c)(3) of  the Internal Revenue Code); or another private nonprofit organization that provides certain public  services.", "Not be in default on their loans.", "Make 120 on-time monthly loan payments for the full amount due on  their bill. These monthly payments do not need to be consecutive.", "Key differences between PSLF and TEPSLF include:", "Qualifying repayment plans. PSLF generally requires borrowers to  repay their loans through one of the eligible income-driven repayment  plans or the Standard repayment plan. TEPSLF allows borrowers to  qualify for loan forgiveness through several additional types of  repayment plans that do not qualify for PSLF, including the Graduated  repayment plan, Extended repayment plan, Consolidated Standard  repayment plan, and Consolidated Graduated repayment plan.", "Funding. TEPSLF loan forgiveness is temporarily available to  borrowers on a first-come, first-served basis until the $700 million is  expended. The PSLF program will continue unless repealed by  Congress.", "Specific payment requirements. For TEPSLF, the following two  payments generally must be at least as much as the borrower would  have paid under an income-driven repayment plan: (1) the payment  made immediately prior to applying for TEPSLF, and (2) the payment  made 12 months prior to applying for TEPSLF.", "In the context of high denial rates in the PSLF program and evidence that  some borrowers were being misinformed by loan servicers about which  repayment plans would qualify for PSLF, Congress appropriated $4.6  million for Education to conduct outreach on PSLF and TEPSLF. The  legislation called for this outreach to be targeted to, among others,  borrowers who would qualify for PSLF loan forgiveness except that they  have made some or all of their payments through plans that do not  qualify."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Temporary Expanded Loan Forgiveness Process Is Not Clear to Borrowers", "paragraphs": ["Congress directed Education to implement a simple method for borrowers  to apply for TEPSLF within 60 days after the legislation funding the  program was enacted. In response, Education established a process in  which borrowers send an email to the TEPSLF loan servicer with their  name and date of birth to initiate their TEPSLF review and establish their  place in line for TEPSLF funds. In addition to sending an email to initiate  a TEPSLF request, Education requires that a borrower has submitted a  PSLF application before they can be considered for TEPSLF (see fig. 1).  While a PLSF application is not explicitly required by statute for a  borrower to be considered for TEPSLF loan forgiveness, Education  officials said that the department added this step to the process because  the PSLF application form captures information the TEPSLF loan servicer  needs to determine a borrower\u2019s eligibility for TEPSLF. Education  officials said that they added this step in order to roll out the TEPSLF  program within the required 60 days.", "Education\u2019s TEPSLF website states that borrowers interested in this  temporary expanded loan forgiveness option must submit a PSLF  application in order to be considered for TEPSLF. Even with this  information, our review of TEPSLF loan servicer data found that 71  percent of denied TEPSLF requests were denied because the borrower  had not submitted a PSLF application. Education officials said that they  believed that many borrowers send a TEPSLF request without submitting  a PSLF application because TEPSLF funding is temporary and borrowers  know that sending the email request will hold their place in line for the  limited funds. However, borrowers who have not submitted the PSLF  application are sent a denial letter from the TEPSLF loan servicer.  According to Education officials, these borrowers would lose their place in  line and have to reapply if they want to be reconsidered for TEPSLF.", "Officials from Education, the TEPSLF loan servicer, and representatives  from selected organizations representing student borrowers all said that  the requirement to submit a PSLF application to be eligible for TEPSLF  loan forgiveness can confuse borrowers. For example, Education officials  acknowledged that the majority of TEPSLF requests come from  borrowers who have not first submitted a PSLF application, and officials  from the TEPSLF loan servicer said that borrowers who called were  frequently confused when they received a TEPSLF denial based on the  fact that they had not first submitted the PSLF application. In addition,  representatives from the three student borrower groups we interviewed  said that having to apply for PSLF before requesting TEPSLF often  confuses borrowers and, in the opinion of officials from two of the three  groups, leads directly to large numbers of TEPSLF denials. We also  found some examples of borrower confusion about the PSLF application  requirement in our review of borrower complaints. In three TEPSLF  borrower complaints filed with Education that we reviewed, the borrowers  expressed confusion and frustration about why they were being asked to  submit an application for a program\u2014PSLF\u2014they knew they did not  qualify for in order to receive TEPSLF loan forgiveness.", "Education\u2019s policy of requiring all borrowers requesting TEPSLF to first  submit a PSLF application has created a confusing process for  borrowers. Education officials said that integrating the TEPSLF request  into the PSLF application\u2014for example, by including a checkbox that  borrowers could use to request a TEPSLF review if the loan servicer finds  they are ineligible for PSLF\u2014would eliminate the need for borrowers to  take multiple steps, reduce the number of borrowers who are denied, and  improve service to borrowers. Education officials estimated that  integrating the TEPSLF request into the existing PSLF process would  require roughly a year in order to revise the PSLF application form,  borrower communications, and program procedures, and to work with the  loan servicer to implement new contractual requirements. Education  officials told us that they will be implementing a new online portal in fall  2019 to provide better overall service to borrowers. They also stated that  the new portal could incorporate an online integrated PSLF and TEPSLF  application if they had sufficient resources and time, but that there were  currently no specific plans to do so.", "While Education rolled out the process for requesting TEPSLF loan  forgiveness in 2 months, it has not created a borrower-friendly TEPSLF  process. This does not align with Education\u2019s strategic plan objective to  improve the quality of service to customers across the student aid life  cycle. Further, Congress created the temporary expansion to the PSLF  program to help certain borrowers who faced barriers obtaining PSLF  loan forgiveness and required Education to develop a simple method for  borrowers to apply for TEPSLF. While initiating a TEPSLF request  through an email is straightforward, requiring borrowers to have submitted  a PSLF application to successfully pursue TEPSLF loan forgiveness is  confusing and inefficient for borrowers because borrowers must take  multiple steps and complete an application for a program they do not  qualify for. If Education were to allow borrowers to request TEPSLF loan  forgiveness through an integrated application form, it would improve  service to borrowers, reduce borrower confusion about how to obtain loan  forgiveness, and better align with its strategic plan objective to improve  service to borrowers. Further, although TEPSLF is a temporary  opportunity, it could be years before the $700 million appropriation is  exhausted, and it is therefore worthwhile for Education to invest  resources in improving the process now."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ninety-nine Percent of Borrowers\u2019 TEPSLF Requests Have Been Denied and Certain Denial Letters Do Not Include Important Information", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Has Approved 1 Percent of TEPSLF Loan Forgiveness Requests and Spent 4 Percent of TEPSLF Loan Forgiveness Funds in a Year", "paragraphs": ["From May 2018 through May 2019, about 40,000 borrowers submitted  TEPSLF requests for loan forgiveness and Education has approved or  denied about 54,000 separate TEPSLF requests.

Of the remaining denied requests, about 15,000 were denied  because they did not meet other program requirements (see fig. 3).", "As we previously noted, under the current TEPSLF review process, the  loan servicer first checks to see if the borrower requesting TEPSLF has  submitted a PSLF application.

Without the loan servicer conducting any further review of a borrower\u2019s  request, it is impossible to know how many of the roughly 38,000  requests that were denied because the borrower had not yet submitted a  PSLF application would have otherwise met all other program  requirements and been approved for TEPSLF loan forgiveness. The large  number of TEPSLF requests denied for not submitting a PSLF application  provides further evidence that many borrowers may be confused about  the process for obtaining TEPSLF loan forgiveness.

An FSA official told us that while there is no formal  process for borrowers who are dissatisfied with their TEPSLF or PSLF  determinations to contest them, borrowers do have additional options for  addressing concerns, such as an additional review by the TEPSLF  servicer, or a complaint to the FSA Feedback System or Ombudsmen  (see fig. 5).", "According to Education officials, when a borrower is denied loan  forgiveness, they can call the TEPSLF loan servicer\u2019s customer service  number with questions about the denial.

Education and  TEPSLF loan servicer officials said that borrowers who are not able to  resolve their issues with the loan servicer can bring their issues directly to  Education.

Education officials also stressed the importance of borrowers resolving  their concerns first with their loan servicer directly before pursuing other  avenues, and said that this is part of the reason why they do not include  this information in letters sent to borrowers. All TEPSLF denial letters  include a statement at the bottom of the letter indicating that if borrowers  had questions about the information in their denial letter, they should call  the general customer service number at the TEPSLF loan servicer for  assistance. The letters did not explain how the servicer could potentially  do a second review or subsequently refer the matter to Education.  Information about the potential for a second review at the loan servicer  and the option to raise an issue with Education directly would help  borrowers who are unable to resolve their concerns by calling the general  customer service number at the loan servicer.", "Additional information on options for contesting decisions is not  necessary for all TEPSLF borrowers who are denied. For example, it may  not be appropriate to include this information in denial letters sent to  borrowers who do not meet basic program requirements\u2014for example,  those who have no federal Direct Loans. However, borrowers who are  denied for reasons that are more prone to error, such as having fewer  than 120 qualifying payments, are not made aware of all the available  options so they can make informed decisions about how to best resolve  their concerns. We previously reported that Education does not ensure  that the loan servicer responsible for PSLF and TEPSLF is receiving  consistent loan payment history information from other loan servicers,  increasing the risk of inaccurate qualifying payment counts. This also  raises the risk of inappropriate denials for TEPSLF. Our review of  TEPSLF complaints made to Education from borrowers found eight  examples of borrowers contesting the loan servicer\u2019s determination of the  number of qualifying payments. In six of these instances, the TEPSLF  servicer determined that the borrowers were correct and had met  requirements for loan forgiveness.

The large number of requests denied  because borrowers had not submitted a PSLF application suggests that  borrowers are confused about this requirement. In some cases, these  borrowers may have been working in public service jobs for years  believing they were on track for loan forgiveness, only to find out later that  they did not qualify.

TEPSLF was created to provide relief to a group of borrowers who were  ineligible because they were repaying their loans on repayment plans that  were not eligible for the original PSLF program.
