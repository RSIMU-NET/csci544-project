Instead, they must seek to recover their losses from the railroads under the provisions of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, injured workers must either negotiate a settlement with the railroad or file a lawsuit against the railroad to recover their losses. FELA allows injured workers to recover noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, in addition to economic damages, such as medical expenses and lost wages. In contrast, the benefits paid under no-fault workers\u2019 compensation systems are largely limited to medical expenses and lost wages. Under FELA, if a lawsuit is filed, workers must show negligence on the part of the employer; under no-fault systems, issues of negligence are not a factor.", "Railroad management\u2019s and labor\u2019s opinions differ over how well FELA is working. Management, which favors replacing FELA, believes that FELA creates an adversarial environment between the railroads and their employees and is unnecessarily costly.

There are also two federally administered no-fault workers\u2019 compensation systems.

Prior to the act\u2019s passage, injured railroad workers had difficulty recovering losses resulting from workplace injuries. Under the common-law doctrine of negligence, railroads often avoided paying compensation for on-the-job injuries by arguing, for example, that employees assumed the risk of injury at the time they accepted employment or that an injury had been caused by a fellow employee. At about the same time, efforts were underway in various states and at the federal level to enact employers\u2019 liability legislation that would limit these defenses and increase employers\u2019 liability for workplace injuries. In an effort to better protect workers against financial loss and to make the railroads more accountable and responsible for work-related injuries, FELA limited the railroads\u2019 defenses against liability for compensating injured workers. As such, it provided railroad workers with more protection than other employer liability laws of the time.", "FELA covers virtually all railroads operating in interstate service, including the freight railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and most commuter railroads. Under the act, injured workers can seek recovery of all their losses, including economic losses, such as actual and future wage losses, and noneconomic losses, such as pain and suffering. If negotiations between a railroad and an employee do not produce a settlement, employees can seek recovery of their losses in a state or federal court. Should a lawsuit be filed, an employee must show that the railroad was negligent in order to recover damages. However, an employee\u2019s recovery for losses might be reduced to the extent that the employee\u2019s own negligence caused an injury, and in some instances, the employee could receive nothing. As a result, injured workers may not recover all of their losses, and some workers might not recover any. In addition to compensation under FELA, injured employees may also be eligible for retirement benefits, sickness benefits, and disability annuities from the Railroad Retirement Board.", "In 1994, the railroads paid about $1.2 billion in FELA costs, and nearly 75 percent of all FELA injury claims for the large railroads (excluding the occupational illnesses of hearing loss and asbestosis) were settled between the railroads and the injured employees without a lawsuit. While the total number of injury claims has declined since 1990, the number of lawsuits has remained relatively stable at about 3,100 cases per year. (See table 1.1.) Over the same period, railroad employment declined from 296,000 to 267,000. The average payout per negotiated claim increased from about $24,000 in 1990 to about $34,000 in 1994, while the average payout per lawsuit remained relatively stable at about $160,000. (See table 1.2.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Workers in Other Industries Are Covered Under No-Fault Injury Compensation Systems", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to railroad workers, workers in most other industries are covered by state no-fault compensation systems. Workers\u2019 compensation legislation was initially enacted by most state legislatures in the early 20th Century. One of the principal goals of this legislation was to provide injured workers with adequate benefits while limiting employers\u2019 liability to compensating workers only for their lost wages and medical costs. Payments were to be prompt and predetermined to relieve employees and employers of uncertainty and eliminate the need to litigate the claims.", "The benefits available under no-fault compensation programs depend on the nature and extent of an injury. For less serious injuries, only medical benefits might be paid. For more serious injuries or illnesses, in addition to medical benefits, an employee might receive wage-loss benefits, vocational rehabilitation, or \u201cscheduled\u201d benefits\u2014for injuries resulting in permanent impairments, such as the loss of a limb or a bodily function. Each state sets its own benefit levels, and benefits vary considerably from state to state.", "Two groups of employees are covered by federally administered no-fault systems. The Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) covers federal civilian employees, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) covers those in the maritime industry. Enacted in 1916, FECA covers more than 3 million federal civilian employees and authorizes the federal government to compensate employees when they are temporarily or permanently disabled as a result of an injury or illness sustained while performing their duties. The Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs administers this program. Disputes may be handled in one of the Labor Department\u2019s district offices or by the Branch of Hearings and Review. Appeals can also be made to the Department\u2019s Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. FECA cases cannot be appealed to a court. Enacted in 1927, LHWCA covers about 500,000 longshore workers for disability due to a job-related injury or occupational disease occurring on the navigable waters of the United States or in adjoining shore areas.The Department of Labor also administers this program. Disputes are handled informally in one of the Labor Department\u2019s district offices or before the Department\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges or the Benefits Review Board. Unlike FECA cases, LHWCA cases may be appealed to a federal appeals court.", "There are important differences between FELA and no-fault compensation systems. First, both state and federal workers\u2019 compensation systems cover an employee\u2019s work-related injury regardless of negligence on the part of the employer or employee by imposing strict liability on an employer for compensating most economic damages suffered by injured workers. However, they do not allow compensation for noneconomic damages. Second, benefits under no-fault systems are generally paid as losses occur, rather than in a lump sum as they are under FELA. While some states permit lump-sum payments, at least one state\u2014Texas\u2014has essentially banned them. Under FECA and LHWCA, compensation continues as long as a disability continues. Both FECA and LHWCA authorize higher benefit levels than most state workers\u2019 compensation systems.", "While many no-fault claims are handled directly between employees and their employers or insurance companies, no-fault systems are not free from dispute or litigation. As the National Research Council reported in 1994, disputes may arise over issues such as eligibility for benefits, the level of benefits, and the readiness of workers to return to work. Disputes may also arise over the permanency of injuries. For the most part, adjudicative bodies within a state (or the Labor Department, in the case of FECA and LHWCA) and the judicial system handle the resolution of these disputes. In recent years, litigiousness has tended to increase in no-fault compensation systems. Some states have also been concerned about increasing medical costs in workers\u2019 compensation claims, and some (such as California and Texas) have made efforts to control these costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Railroad Management and Labor Differ Over Continued Need for FELA", "paragraphs": ["Railroad management and labor disagree over how well FELA is working and whether it should be replaced or changed.

In general, railroad management is dissatisfied with FELA and believes it should be replaced or substantially changed. In particular, management believes that because FELA involves issues of negligence, it creates an adversarial environment between railroads and their employees. Management also believes that FELA is unnecessarily costly. In addition, management sees little reason why railroads should be treated differently from other industries in terms of workers\u2019 compensation. Railroad labor, on the other hand, believes that FELA is working well and should not be replaced or changed. In labor\u2019s view, FELA is a model system that fairly compensates injured workers and provides an incentive for railroads to operate safely.

That report included data showing that, as railroad employment has declined and the number of injuries has fallen since 1981, FELA payouts have increased. In 1994, railroads paid about $4,200 per employee in FELA costs, up from about $2,250 per employee in 1985. AAR believes that FELA needs to be replaced.", "Many in railroad management believe that FELA is no longer appropriate to the modern railroad operating environment. Among the problems with FELA cited by railroad management are (1) the adversarial environment created between employers and employees because FELA requires the parties to establish fault, (2) the high degree of involvement by attorneys in FELA cases, (3) the unpredictability of FELA costs, (4) the practice of filing FELA lawsuits in court jurisdictions that have historically rendered judgments favorable to the plaintiffs, and (5) the high administrative costs. In general, railroad management questions why the rail industry must be treated differently from other industries regarding injury compensation.", "The National Association of Railroad Trial Counsel, an organization of 1,200 lawyers who provide legal services to railroads, believes that because both the right to recover and the amount of the recovery depend on assigning fault, FELA not only inhibits good employer-employee relations but also frustrates attempts to determine the causes of accidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Railroad Labor Believes That FELA Is Working Well and Should Not Be Replaced or Changed", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to management\u2019s view, railroad labor believes that FELA is effective and should not be replaced or modified.

For example, railroad labor points out that FELA is not a particularly litigious system because over 75 percent of the FELA cases are settled without any third-party intervention. Moreover, in labor\u2019s view, FELA provides the railroads with an incentive to operate safely and if they do so, they could lower their injury compensation costs. Attorneys representing railroad labor also took issue with railroad management\u2019s belief that FELA lawsuits are filed in jurisdictions favorable to plaintiffs.

We were also asked to assess how FELA particularly affects the small railroads and determine the availability and affordability of insurance to protect against large FELA payouts. As agreed with the requester\u2019s office, we focused our analysis on comparisons between FELA, FECA, and LHWCA. This approach was taken to avoid duplicating work previously reported by the National Research Council that compared FELA with state workers\u2019 compensation programs.", "To identify the cost and other effects of replacing FELA with a no-fault system with FECA- and LHWCA-level benefits, we used a computerized cost model developed by Mercer Management, Inc., for AAR. This model and the assumptions we used in performing our cost analysis are described in appendix I. As input for our analysis, we obtained information on all of the FELA claims closed in 1994 by four large railroads\u2014Burlington Northern, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. These railroads employed about 60 percent of all employees at large railroads in 1994 and also had previously participated in a 1991 unpublished study of FELA by AAR. To examine how the administrative and dispute resolution mechanisms of no-fault compensation systems compare with those of FELA, we reviewed data from the Department of Labor on the FECA and LHWCA programs. We reviewed similar information on the California, Illinois, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Texas workers\u2019 compensation systems. We selected these states because they had the largest number of freight railroad employees as of March 1995. Finally, we analyzed information from the Federal Railroad Administration to determine the number of lost workdays resulting from on-the-job injuries by the type of railroad.", "To evaluate the cost and other impacts of modifying FELA, we examined a number of proposals selected on the basis of discussions with officials at AAR and with the requester\u2019s office. We used data on claims closed under FELA in 1994 provided by the four railroads mentioned in the above paragraph to evaluate the financial impact of capping noneconomic damages under FELA. This information identified the number of claims that could have been affected by a cap and the dollar value of these claims. To analyze the impact of placing a cap on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees under FELA, we interviewed officials at selected railroads and obtained the views of railroad labor organizations. We also reviewed reports prepared by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Research Institute\u2014a nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization that conducts research on workers\u2019 compensation issues. To assess the use of arbitration, we interviewed officials from selected railroads and obtained information from the Federal Judicial Center on the use of arbitration in FELA cases in federal courts. The National Center for State Courts provided us with information on the use of arbitration in state courts. To evaluate the proposal to limit the jurisdictions where FELA cases might be tried, we reviewed state venue provisions in the 10 states with the most railroad employees in 1995, interviewed officials at selected railroads and attorneys who handle FELA cases, and obtained written comments from railroad labor organizations.", "To assess how FELA affects the small railroads compared with the large railroads, we designed a questionnaire to obtain cost and other information from the small railroads. After pretesting the questionnaire with officials from seven railroads, we surveyed 560 small railroads operating in the United States and asked them about their experience with FELA in 1994. To determine the universe, we used AAR\u2019s Profiles of U.S. Railroads, 1994 Edition and Supplement, a compilation of information on all railroads offering freight service in 1993, and the July 1995 membership list of the American Short Line Railroad Association. We received 437 responses, for a response rate of 78 percent. The employee hours of the respondents to our survey represented 93 percent of the employee hours worked on the small railroads in 1994. The results of our survey of the small freight railroads are presented in appendix II. We also requested information on 1994 FELA claims and costs from 16 railroads identified by the American Public Transit Association as offering commuter service as well as from Amtrak. We received data from 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak. Information on these railroads\u2019 FELA settlements and costs can be found in appendix III.", "The organizations we contacted in the course of our review are listed in appendix IV.

Whether replacing FELA with a nationwide no-fault system with FECA- or LHWCA-level benefits would reduce railroads\u2019 injury compensation costs depends on many factors. Prime among these is the number of railroad workers who are permanently disabled and are unable to return to work at their preinjury wages. Some injured railroad workers leave the railroad after receiving their FELA settlement, but railroad management believes that some of these workers are capable of returning to work and, therefore, would not receive permanent disability payments under a no-fault compensation system. However, the number of such workers is not known. The higher the proportion of this group of injured workers that can return to work at their preinjury wages, the higher the probability that railroads\u2019 injury compensation costs would be reduced under a no-fault system. A no-fault system could reduce railroads\u2019 administrative costs by eliminating the need to investigate negligence and to assess noneconomic damages.

On the basis of our analysis of FELA claims at four large railroads, the lower this number is, the greater the likelihood that the railroads\u2019 compensation costs would be reduced under a no-fault compensation system. Under no-fault compensation systems, when injured workers recover and return to work at their preinjury pay level, their wage compensation benefits cease. In addition, under a no-fault compensation system, those workers who return to work would likely receive less than they would have under FELA because they would be compensated only for economic damages and not for noneconomic damages as they could have been under FELA. Finally, while it is difficult to estimate precisely the impact on death benefits of replacing FELA with a no-fault system, the cost difference would likely be small because death benefits are a relatively small portion of the total compensation outlays."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Changes in Railroads\u2019 Injury Compensation Costs Are Directly Related to Levels of Permanent Disability", "paragraphs": ["Replacing FELA with a no-fault system with FECA- or LHWCA-level benefits would reduce the railroads\u2019 injury compensation costs only if many of the workers who currently leave a railroad after receiving their FELA settlement are physically capable of returning to work. Under a no-fault compensation system, benefits end or are reduced once an injured worker returns to work or takes another job. If those injured railroad workers who did not return to work under FELA were so severely injured that they could not return to any work, then under the no-fault alternative, they would receive permanent total disability payments as long as their total disability continued. The present value of this amount could be considerably greater than the lump-sum payment that a worker actually accepted under FELA. Officials from several railroads told us that once a settlement is made and an employee leaves a railroad, they do not keep information on any subsequent employment of these individuals. However, officials from several railroads believe that at least some of the workers who accept a FELA settlement and leave a railroad are physically able to return to the workforce.", "For the four large railroads in our analysis, we estimate that if all of the workers injured on the job who left the railroad after taking a FELA settlement were able to return to work, the railroads\u2019 overall injury compensation costs in 1994 under either FECA- or LHWCA-level benefits would have been about one-third what they were under FELA. (See fig. 2.1.)Under FECA, we estimate that injury compensation costs would have been $168 million and that under LHWCA, they would have been $149 million, instead of the $479 million actually paid. But if all of these workers were permanently and totally disabled, we estimate that these railroads\u2019 injury compensation costs would have been about one-third higher than they were under FELA\u2014$650 million under FECA and $609 million under LHWCA. As the number of injured railroad workers who are permanently disabled declines, the estimated total compensation costs decline. Conversely, as the number of railroad workers who are permanently disabled increases, estimated compensation costs increase under the no-fault alternatives.", "As figure 2.1 shows, the estimated compensation costs with FECA-level benefits would have been the same as they were under FELA if 65 percent of the workers who left the railroad after their FELA settlement were actually permanently and totally disabled.

In contrast, we estimate they would have paid $50 million and $42 million under the provisions of FECA and LHWCA, respectively\u2014about a $100 million difference. The benefits paid under both FECA and LHWCA would be limited to lost wages and possibly some scheduled benefits (for the loss of, or the loss of the use of, a body part), which are usually calculated as some number of weeks\u2019 wages. Because most economic losses were probably also compensated in the FELA settlement, the difference can likely be attributed to payments for noneconomic damages. Therefore, for those workers who return to work, moving to a no-fault system that does not include noneconomic damages would have saved these railroads about 20 percent of their total compensation costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in the Overall Cost of Death Claims Are Difficult to Project but Are Probably Small", "paragraphs": ["Changes in the cost of death claims as a result of replacing FELA with a no-fault system with FECA- or LHWCA-level benefits would likely be small.

First, the railroads\u2019 data files we examined for our analysis did not identify clearly whether or not some death claims were work-related. Some of the death claims closed in 1994 for the four railroads involved heart attacks and resulted in no payment under FELA. Given this information, it is likely that these deaths were not work-related. However, so as not to underestimate the cost of death claims under the no-fault alternatives, we assumed that all of the death cases reported, whether compensated under FELA or not, were work-related, and we included their costs in our analysis. Second, all federal and state workers\u2019 compensation statutes authorize death benefits to the surviving spouse and dependents of an employee whose death results from a job-related injury or illness. Because the railroads do not necessarily need to record information on spouses and dependents for FELA settlements, we do not know the extent to which this missing information affected the estimates of the FECA and LHWCA death benefits. As a result, death benefits could also be underestimated in our analysis, especially for employees with relatively young surviving spouses and/or dependents. Nevertheless, because death benefits are a relatively small portion of the total FELA costs, it is unlikely that the net effect of any over- or underestimates would significantly affect our estimate of total compensation payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Administrative Costs Under a No-Fault System Might Be Less Than Under FELA, but Costs for Rehabilitation Could Be Higher", "paragraphs": ["Replacing FELA with a nationwide no-fault compensation system could reduce the railroads\u2019 administrative costs for handling claims. Currently, the large railroads generally handle all of the administrative tasks of negotiating and settling FELA injury claims, including processing claims, investigating injury claims, negotiating settlements, litigating claims, and making payments. Claims for medical benefits are processed within the railroads\u2019 overall employee health insurance programs. AAR estimates that railroads paid about $169 million in 1994 in administrative costs under FELA. Under the no-fault alternatives, administrative costs would likely be less because claims administration would be simplified. Railroad claims staff would be primarily concerned with determining how extensive and severe the injury is, whether the injury was job-related, and whether continuing impairment exists. They would not be involved in investigating negligence or negotiating the value of noneconomic losses. As a result, the administrative time and cost required per claim would likely be less than they are under FELA.", "However, the costs for employee rehabilitation programs might increase under a no-fault system. Rehabilitation does not appear to receive much emphasis under FELA. Although rehabilitation expenses can be compensated under FELA, it appears that not many employees elect to undergo rehabilitation. According to an official from one railroad, most railroads offer rehabilitation programs to injured employees. However, he said that few employees take advantage of such programs, in part because doing so could jeopardize their FELA settlements. Rehabilitation plays a much larger role in no-fault compensation systems. As we recently reported, both federal and state workers\u2019 compensation programs emphasize returning employees to work with their original employer.Under FECA, federal employees who refuse to cooperate in vocational rehabilitation programs or to make a good faith effort to be reemployed could potentially lose benefits. The impact on railroad costs of changing to a no-fault system that emphasizes rehabilitation is difficult to forecast.

Because the railroads do not specifically identify the proportions of FELA awards that are for economic and noneconomic damages, we could not estimate precisely the impact of such a cap on FELA costs.

AAR estimates that in 1994, attorneys representing injured workers at large railroads received between $182 million and $240 million in fees. Whether the railroads\u2019 FELA costs would decline as the result of a cap depends to a large extent on what cap was established and the relationship between a cap and a FELA settlement. The railroads\u2019 FELA costs could decline if a cap was set at less than the 25 percent that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys receive from a FELA award, assuming that a lower attorneys\u2019 fee would lead to a lower settlement amount. On the other hand, a cap on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees might have little impact on FELA costs if settlement amounts stay the same or increase as attorneys push for higher settlements to compensate for the lower percentage allocated to legal fees. A cap on what the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could receive might also benefit injured workers to the extent that lower legal fees might allow workers to keep a larger share of a settlement. Railroad officials with whom we spoke were split on the possible effects of a cap on costs, and some suggested that a sliding scale could be a better way to control legal fees. Under a sliding scale, the percentage of an award payable as attorneys\u2019 fees would either decline as the size of the award increases or increase if a case is settled quickly.", "Other workers\u2019 compensation systems limit attorneys\u2019 fees. While FECA and LHWCA do not necessarily limit the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee, they do require that such a fee be approved before being paid and that the fee be reasonable. In particular, FECA requires that approval of attorneys\u2019 fees be based on the actual necessary work performed. In making this determination, such factors as the complexity of a claim and the amount of time spent actually developing and presenting the claim are assessed. State workers\u2019 compensation systems also limit attorneys\u2019 fees. In four of the five state workers\u2019 compensation systems we reviewed\u2014in the states that employed the most railroad workers in 1995\u2014attorneys\u2019 fees are in some way limited. In general, attorneys\u2019 fees in these four states are limited to between 9 and 25 percent of a worker\u2019s compensation award.

This appears to have happened in some state workers\u2019 compensation systems. For example, Texas revamped its state workers\u2019 compensation program in 1991 and set limits on attorneys\u2019 fees. In April 1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Research Institute reported that initial indications were that the limits placed by Texas on the fees for plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had caused a number of attorneys who previously had practiced workers\u2019 compensation law to leave the field. The institute\u2019s report concluded that at a minimum, it was more difficult for claimants with low-value claims to find attorneys to handle their cases. The institute noted similar problems in California, reporting in December 1992 that California\u2019s typical 9- to 12-percent limit on attorneys\u2019 fees may have contributed to the devolution of work to paralegals and to the refusal by some attorneys of cases that were more complicated and time-consuming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arbitration Offers Time and Cost Benefits but May Be Difficult to Adapt to FELA", "paragraphs": ["Arbitration is a mechanism typically used in contract and other commercial disputes to resolve issues quickly and at low cost.

The court system has also looked to arbitration and other approaches to resolve disputes quickly and to reduce backlogs in court dockets.", "The use of arbitration to resolve workplace injury cases has varied. It does not appear to be widely used in the rail industry.

The remaining cases either went on to trial or were resolved in some other manner. In all of the courts, arbitration was nonbinding, and a trial could be requested following an arbitration decision. In October 1993, the National Center for State Courts reported that over half of the states had experimented with arbitration programs associated with courts since they were introduced in 1952. However, no information was available on the arbitration of FELA cases at the state level. According to the center, the characteristics of state arbitration programs varied, but typically, arbitration was based on the amount of money at stake\u2014frequently $50,000 or less. Finally, three of the five state workers\u2019 compensation programs we reviewed\u2014in California, Illinois, and Texas\u2014had arbitration programs.

Railroad officials and their attorneys agreed that so far, arbitration has not been very effective in resolving FELA cases. One railroad official told us that arbitration is not useful when a serious disagreement exists between the parties, such as a dispute about negligence. The National Association of Railroad Trial Counsel commented that without fundamental change to FELA itself, arbitration would merely transfer FELA\u2019s negative aspects to an arbitration setting. Some attorneys representing injured workers also do not support arbitration in FELA cases. In their view, for arbitration to be successful, the parties must be able to agree on liability.

Because of the increased competition, premiums have declined over the past 5 years. Insurance industry officials estimated that in 1995, small railroads\u2019 annual premiums for liability insurance with FELA coverage generally ranged from $25,000 to $50,000. One official described an average policy as costing $50,000 for $5 million in coverage with a deductible of $50,000 per claim.", "Our survey results for the small freight railroads generally support the estimates of the insurance providers. Of the 264 railroads that provided us with information on their insurance costs, 54 percent paid less than $50,000 for a liability policy that included FELA coverage. Most of these railroads\u2019 deductible levels ranged from $25,000 to $100,000, and just over half of the railroads had annual premium costs that were 10 percent or less of their payroll. Many of the railroads with annual premiums of $200,000 or more had more employees and higher payrolls. The cost of premiums for half of these latter railroads was also in the 10-percent-of-payroll-or-less range."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance Purchasing Groups Are Not Widely Used", "paragraphs": ["A small railroad could reduce its liability insurance costs by pooling its resources with other small railroads and obtaining a group policy. Such purchasing groups were authorized for FELA purposes by the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986. A purchasing group would spread all or any portion of its members\u2019 liability exposure and costs. While 10 percent of the railroads in our survey reported that they were part of purchasing groups, upon further review, we found that most of these railroads were technically not in such groups. Rather, these railroads were subsidiaries of railroad management companies and other entities that owned more than one railroad and had group insurance for their railroads. Like a purchasing group, this arrangement serves to spread the railroads\u2019 liability exposure and costs.", "Most of the railroads that responded to our survey reported very little interest in participating in a purchasing group, and only 16 percent indicated that they had ever seriously considered entering into such an arrangement. For the railroads that had not considered a purchasing group, the most common reason given was that no other railroad had suggested it. Another leading reason was that these railroads did not want to depend on the safety records of other railroads in the underwriting process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["FELA does not appear to be any more burdensome for passenger and small freight railroads than it is for the large freight railroads. Our review suggests that compared with the large freight railroads, passenger and small freight railroads are less burdened by FELA and that they currently can insure against catastrophic losses. Therefore, we found no reason, at least on the basis of financial considerations, that these railroads need to be treated differently in any deliberations about whether to either modify FELA or replace it with a no-fault compensation system."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
