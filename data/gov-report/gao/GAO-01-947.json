But staff raised other issues that warrant attention, including limited opportunities for advancement, the amount of uncompensated overtime, and the quality of administrative support services. In response to the high turnover rates, SEC has placed greater emphasis on compensation-based human capital programs, including compensation-based flexibilities and performance awards. Although SEC uses compensation-based flexibilities to a greater extent than do other government agencies, the Office of Personnel Management believes it could do more. SEC has taken several steps to focus more attention on strategic human capital management but faces continuing challenges. In April 2001, SEC integrated its human capital strategies with it's core business practices by adding a human capital goal to its 2002 Annual Performance Plan. SEC has also developed an extensive recruiting program for attorneys."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 1,000 employees, or about one-third of the staff, left the U.S Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 1998 to 2000. Of these, more than  500 were attorneys. Overall, SEC\u2019s turnover rates for attorneys,  accountants, and examiners averaged 15 percent in 2000, more than twice  the rates for comparable positions governmentwide.  Furthermore, 280  available positions remained unfilled in 2001.  According to the former  acting SEC Chairman, SEC has been experiencing a staffing crisis that is  adversely affecting its ability to protect investors and promote the integrity  and efficiency of U.S. securities markets.", "SEC officials attributed this staffing crisis largely to SEC\u2019s compensation  levels, which are lower than those in the private sector and at other federal  financial regulators.  However, pay may not be the only factor affecting  staff decisions to leave SEC; SEC\u2019s organizational culture and human  capital policies and practices may also have influenced employee retention.   As you requested, we focused our study on SEC\u2019s management of its human  capital.  Specifically, our objectives were to (1) determine the factors that  influence employee turnover and morale; (2) assess the extent of SEC\u2019s use  of human capital policies and practices to recruit, motivate, and retain  staff; and (3) assess SEC\u2019s strategic management of its human capital.", "To determine the factors that influenced turnover, satisfaction, and morale  among SEC staff, we conducted a survey of current and former SEC  attorneys, accountants, and examiners.  We received a total of 1, 380  responses from current staff, for a response rate of 72 percent, and 336  from former staff, for a response rate of 69 percent.  Our survey results can  be generalized to all current and former SEC staff populations.  We also  reviewed SEC\u2019s policies, interviewed relevant SEC officials in various  divisions and offices, and compared SEC\u2019s practices with those of other federal financial regulators.  In addition, we met with officials from the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM).  Finally, we reviewed SEC\u2019s strategic human capital  management initiatives and compared them with strategies at other high- performing organizations.  For more information on our scope and  methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s primary mission is to protect investors and maintain the integrity of  the securities markets.  To meet its goals, SEC requires public companies to  disclose meaningful financial and other information to the public.  SEC is  also responsible for conducting investigations of potential securities law  violations and overseeing self-regulatory organizations such as securities  exchanges, as well as broker-dealers, mutual funds, investment advisors,  and public utility holding companies.  SEC\u2019s mission has become  increasingly important as retail investors have become more directly  involved in the securities markets\u2014through on-line trading, for example\u2014  and as the markets themselves have begun to change, because of the  increased use of alternative trading systems and the potential privatization  of securities exchanges.  According to SEC officials, such changes and  innovations have resulted in an increasingly heavy and complex workload  for SEC staff.", "To carry out its mission, as of December 31, 2000, SEC had 3,235 staff  working in 4 divisions and 18 offices in Washington, D.C. and in 11 regional  and district offices.  Of these, approximately 39 percent were attorneys, 17  percent were accountants or financial analysts, and 6 percent were  compliance examiners or investigators.", "High turnover among attorneys, accountants, and compliance examiners is  a concern because these employees carry out tasks that are essential to  accomplishing SEC\u2019s mission.  Attorneys at SEC perform a variety of duties  in most of the divisions and offices, ranging from litigation to rule writing,  and deal with securities laws as well as international and administrative  issues.  For example, attorneys in SEC\u2019s regulatory divisions provide  guidance to self-regulatory organizations and the mutual fund industry,  while attorneys in SEC\u2019s enforcement and oversight divisions identify and  prosecute violations of securities laws.  Accountants at SEC work primarily  in the Division of Corporation Finance, the Division of Enforcement, and  the Office of the Chief Accountant, reviewing and commenting on financial  statements, providing guidance on accounting standards and practices, and  participating in investigations.  Compliance examiners at SEC work in the  Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations as well as in regional  and district offices, reviewing the financial records and activities of entities  such as broker-dealers and mutual fund operators to determine compliance  with securities laws and other requirements.", "SEC officials believe that the high turnover rate is due largely to salary  restrictions that have resulted in increasing pay disparity between SEC and  other federal financial regulators and the private sector.  Currently, SEC  employees are paid according to the civil service pay scale used at most  other government agencies, known as general schedule (GS) pay scales.   SEC officials said that while SEC cannot hope to approach private sector  salaries, the disparity in pay between SEC and other federal financial  regulators that are exempted from federal pay restrictions is significant.   SEC studies indicate that certain staff positions at SEC pay significantly  less than similar positions at other federal financial regulators.  SEC  officials said that this disparity will become increasingly problematic as the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) brings SEC staff together with  staff from other financial regulators in the coordinated regulatory activities  GBLA mandates.  SEC therefore believes that pay parity with other  financial regulators is critically needed to respond to its current staffing  crisis and has sought legislation that would allow it to narrow the pay gap  between it and other federal financial regulators.", "In March 2001, the U.S. Senate approved S. 143, the Competitive Market  Supervision Act of 2001, and in June 2001, the U.S. House of  Representatives approved H.R. 1088, the Investor and Capital Markets Fee  Relief Act.  Along with reducing the fees SEC collects, these bills would  exempt SEC from federal pay restrictions and provide it with the authority  necessary to bring salaries in line with those of other federal financial  regulators.  As of September 10, 2001, no further action had been taken on  this legislation.", "In July 2000, SEC employees voted to join the National Treasury Employees  Union (NTEU).  NTEU officials said that the primary grievances were  unpaid overtime, low pay, and lack of flexible work arrangements.   Although NTEU currently cannot negotiate pay with SEC, it can negotiate  virtually all other human capital policies, including benefits, work  arrangements, awards, and promotions.  As of September 10, 2001, SEC  and NTEU were negotiating their collective bargaining agreement.   According to SEC officials, until this agreement is negotiated and agreed to  by both parties, SEC management cannot implement any new human  capital programs without NTEU\u2019s agreement and approval.  Once the  collective bargaining agreement is approved, SEC will have to negotiate  any subsequent additions or changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compensation Was the Primary Factor in Employee Turnover, but Other Issues Were Also Important", "paragraphs": ["By an overwhelming majority, the current and former SEC attorneys,  accountants, and examiners we surveyed cited compensation as their  primary reason for leaving SEC.

She said that first-year associates at top  law firms can make twice the salary of staff attorneys in comparable  positions at SEC and that accountants with the experience SEC requires  are highly prized in the private sector and thus difficult to recruit.

Therefore, once a staff member has  been promoted to a GS-14, opportunities for advancement to the GS-15  level are limited, which restricts pay.  This situation makes it difficult for  staff to separate opportunities for advancement from pay, as illustrated by  the following survey comments. A current staff member wrote, \u201cMany of  the raises and promotions are given automatically within the first few years  of employment and after that, longer term employees have few if any  opportunities.\u201d A former staff member wrote, \u201cA flatter management  structure with more non-supervisory GS-15 slots would help a lot.\u201d", "SEC officials acknowledge that the need for greater opportunities for  advancement is an issue.  For example, officials in the Division of  Enforcement said that they would like to promote more attorneys who do  investigations to the GS-15 level but they cannot because GS-15 positions  are reserved primarily for trial and supervisory attorneys.  Similarly,  officials in the Office of General Counsel commented that they have an  insufficient number of nonsupervisory GS-15 positions for attorneys and  that they did not expect to receive any more in the near future.

Compared with other government  agencies, SEC has more actively used compensation-based flexibilities  such as recruitment bonuses, retention allowances, superior qualification  appointments, and special pay rates (see fig. 7).  SEC also actively uses  performance awards such as cash, quality step increases, and time off.  In  addition to these compensation-based programs, SEC offers a number of  human capital programs aimed at improving the quality of work life.  However, SEC management has only recently increased its focus on  providing greater flexibilities through other human capital programs such  compressed work schedules and telecommuting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SEC Actively Uses Most Compensation-Based Flexibilities and Performance Awards", "paragraphs": ["Under federal statutes, SEC has the authority to implement a variety of  compensation-based flexibilities, including recruitment bonuses, retention  allowances, superior qualification appointments, and special pay rates.   Specifically, SEC can provide up to a 25-percent increase in basic pay to  employees who would otherwise be likely to leave SEC.   Since 1993, SEC  employees have received retention allowances that range from 5 to 21  percent of their basic pay.   SEC uses retention allowances at a rate of 1.32  per 100 employees, or almost 7 times the governmentwide rate.", "SEC also uses recruitment bonuses more frequently than other government  agencies.   These bonuses can help agencies compete for top-quality  candidates who are in demand, attract candidates with special  qualifications quickly, and replace staff when turnover is high.   Since 1992,  SEC has provided recruitment bonuses ranging from 3.5 to 21 percent of  basic pay, with an average of 10 percent of basic pay.  SEC uses recruitment  bonuses at a rate of 12.97 per 100 employees, or about 5 times the  governmentwide rate.", "Superior qualification appointments allow SEC to set pay for new  appointments or reappointments of individuals to GS positions above step  1 of the grade based on superior qualifications of the candidate.  In the last  few years, SEC has used superior qualifications appointments to hire  examiners who meet specific scholastic achievement and grade-point  average requirements.  SEC uses superior qualification appointments at a  rate of 32.97 per 100 employees, or more than 20 times the governmentwide  rate. Finally, SEC uses special pay rates to address staffing problems  among attorneys, accountants, and examiners. These special rates are not  based on a set percentage of basic pay but on the equivalent of several  steps on the basic pay scale.   In March 2001, SEC received OPM approval  to update the special rates for attorneys and accountants and added  examiners to the special rate category. However, since OPM regulations do  not allow staff who receive special pay to receive locality pay, special pay  becomes less valuable over time.In addition, under SEC\u2019s program, only  employees who are GS-13 to 15 attorneys, GS-12 to 15 accountants, or GS- 11 to 15 examiners with at least 2 years of securities-related experience are  eligible.  SEC uses special pay rates at a rate of 57.25 per 100 employees, or  more than 6 times the governmentwide rate.", "Along with the compensation-based flexibilities, SEC uses performance  awards to motivate employees and reward them for high performance.    SEC uses rating-based awards to reward employees for performance  exceeding expectations, as defined by their formal performance appraisal.   SEC has the authority to grant performance awards of up to 10 percent of  an employee\u2019s basic pay and cash awards of up to $10,000 without external  approval. The average award in 1999 was $1,642. SEC uses rating-based  performance awards at a rate of 44 per 100 employees\u2014almost twice the  governmentwide rate. However, only 17 percent of current staff and 18  percent of former staff surveyed indicated that they were generally or very  satisfied with the ability of SEC\u2019s performance incentive system to motivate  them to perform well.  Moreover, 47 percent of current staff and 53 percent  of former staff indicated that they were generally or very dissatisfied with  the performance incentive system.", "SEC also uses special act awards, which are one-time lump-sum monetary  awards for specific accomplishments that exceed performance  expectations during the course of a year.  Special act awards are the only  performance-based awards SEC uses less frequently than the other  government agencies\u20149.52 per 100 employees, compared with 47.71.  An  SEC official said that SEC managers generally prefer to use their incentive  award funds for year-end performance-based awards, rather than for  special act awards throughout the year.  Moreover, SEC employees have  come to expect annual performance awards as an entitlement similar to the  year-end bonuses offered at law firms. SEC also uses time-off awards,  which grant employees additional leave with pay and do not affect annual leave. SEC\u2019s time-off award rate of 18.09 per 100 staff was comparable to  the governmentwide rate.", "Finally, SEC uses quality step increases to motivate and retain staff.  A  quality step increase allows employees to progress through the GS pay  scales faster than usual and, unlike bonuses, represents a permanent  increase in basic pay.  Although OPM rules allow a quality step increase  every 52 weeks, SEC officials said that SEC awards quality step increases  only every 2 years because quality step increases have long term budgetary  implications.  But the rate at which  SEC uses quality step increases\u201420.02  per 100 hundred employees\u2014was still more than 4 times the  governmentwide rate.", "Although on average SEC uses compensation-related programs at a higher  rate than other government agencies, OPM officials said that SEC could do  more to address its retention problems.  For example, SEC could offer  higher rating-based performance awards.  As mentioned earlier, in 1999 the  average cash award was $1,642, but according to OPM regulations,  agencies can grant awards of up to $10,000, without external approval.  While OPM officials believe that there is room for SEC to offer higher  amounts, SEC officials said that such action would require additional  budgetary resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Only Recently Increased Its Focus on Noncompensation Flexibilities and Work-Life Programs", "paragraphs": ["Only recently has SEC begun to increase its focus on work-life programs to  recruit, motivate, and retain staff.  In general, these programs help  employees balance their work and family lives and include compressed  work schedules, alternate work schedules, telecommuting, and part-time  work arrangements. SEC officials said that they had not placed enough  emphasis on work-life programs in the past and plan to place greater  attention on them in the future.", "On February 26, 2001, SEC authorized an agencywide compressed work  schedule program, although this flexibility had been available throughout  most of the federal government for years. According to SEC officials, SEC  had previously piloted compressed work schedules only on a limited basis  in certain divisions because of concerns that a compressed schedule could  adversely affect the agency\u2019s mission.  Our survey, which was conducted  prior to the agencywide implementation of this program, revealed that only  27 percent of the current staff and 13 percent of the former staff were  generally or very satisfied with their ability to use flexible work schedules.   Although some SEC officials said the program would serve only to boost  employee morale and participation would be low, as of May 30, 2001, about  37 percent of SEC\u2019s attorneys, accountants, and examiners had opted to  work a compressed work schedule.  This figure represents the lowest  particpation rate among comparable groups at other financial regulators,  where participants ranged from 44 to 93 percent.  Overall, SEC officials  said that their experience with compressed work schedules had been  positive.", "SEC also allows employees to work alternate work schedules.  This type of  schedule permits employees to establish daily start times within a flexible  band of up to 2 hours before SEC\u2019s official business hours. As with the  other flexibities, SEC officials said that they make every attempt to  accommodate employees\u2019 requests for alternate work schedules.  The only  requirements are that the work schedules still allow for adequate office  coverage and that the employee\u2019s ability to carry out SEC\u2019s mission is not  affected.", "SEC also allows temporary, short-term work-at-home arrangements such as  telecommuting, but only within certain parameters. For example, SEC  allows \u201cad hoc\u201d or occasional telecommuting in connection with a  particular project for up to 2 days if a supervisor believes the alternate  worksite will allow the employee to complete the assignment with fewer  distractions.  SEC also allows limited telecommuting to accommodate  temporary medical conditions or to allow employees to care for family  members.  However, SEC has begun to explore the possibility of allowing  more employees to telecommute by using secured remote workstation  access. A more liberal use of telecommuting would be consistent with the  approach taken by other financial regulators that are also faced with high  turnover levels among examiners, who often leave because of the extensive  travel requirements.  Thus, for example, regulators such as Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) use  telecommuting more broadly than SEC and view it as an inducement to  retain examiners that helps offset extensive travel requirements.  These  regulators generally allow their examiners to work from home when not  conducting examinations as a concession for extensive travel.  In contrast,  SEC officials generally expect examiners who are not conducting  examinations to come into the office.  Financial regulatory officials said  that because they could not compete on the basis of pay, they must fully  use these other flexibilities.", "Although SEC has several part-time employees, it does not have a formal  part-time policy.  As of May 30, 2001, some 4 percent of SEC\u2019s attorneys,  accountants, and examiners worked part time.  SEC officials said that they  try to accommodate every staff request for part-time work and have  generally been able to do so.  However, some divisions and offices are more  receptive to part-time work arrangements than others.  For example, SEC  has allowed temporary part-time work for new parents and ill and  recuperating employees.  SEC also has disabled employees that work part- time schedules.  SEC\u2019s use of part-time work was generally comparable to  that of other financial regulators.", "Although SEC has begun to focus on these work-life programs, our survey  suggests that there are other flexibilities that warrant management  attention, including expanded flexibility in earning credit hours, reductions  in \u201cdonated\u201d overtime, and increased use of overtime pay and  compensatory time off.  First, SEC\u2019s current policy on earning credit hours  allows employees to earn and use only 6 hours per pay period, with no  carryover allowed. That is, if an employee earns 6 credit hours in pay  period one, he or she must also use those hours in pay period 1.  In  contrast, OPM regulations allow employees to accrue up to a total of 24  hours that can be carried over and used in subsequent pay periods.", "Second, SEC expects staff to \u201cdonate\u201d a certain amount of overtime  without receiving pay or time off in order to complete tasks and keep up  with their workload.  SEC policy states that \u201cemployees occupying  professional or supervisory positions are expected to have a sufficient  interest in completing their work assignments on a timely basis or in  keeping their workload reasonably current by performing voluntary work  outside of regular work hours, on their own initiative, whenever it is  necessary.\u201d An SEC official said that this policy is unique to SEC and that  senior management embraces the sentiment of \u201cdonated\u201d time. Our survey  revealed that 57 percent of current staff and 51 percent of former staff felt  that this policy had a negative effect on morale, and many complained  specifically about the requirement. Moreover, as a general rule, SEC does  not allow overtime pay for most of its professional staff, nor does it  provide compensatory time off to employees.  According to OPM, SEC  could make greater use of overtime pay and compensatory time. SEC  officials indicated that their budget was an important factor in limiting the  use of these flexibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Taken Steps to Address Strategic Human Capital Management but Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The high turnover rate among attorneys, accountants, and examiners has  forced SEC management to focus greater attention on strategic human  capital management issues.  SEC has taken several positive steps to  strategically align its core mission with its ability to recruit and retain  qualified employees, including improving its recruitment program and  adding a new human capital goal to its performance plan.  However,  because of the high turnover rate and the recent unionization, SEC faces a  number of challenges in its efforts to meet employees\u2019 needs, including  creating an organizational culture that gives priority to human capital  issues and establishing a constructive working relationship with the union."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SEC Has Begun to Focus on Strategic Human Capital Management, but Some Gaps Remain", "paragraphs": ["High turnover rates among attorneys, accountants, and examiners at SEC  have been a growing problem for the past several years and have prompted  SEC to begin addressing its staffing challenges from a strategic  perspective. For example, SEC officials said that in late 1999 they finalized  several human capital programs designed to offer employees more  flexibilities, including a comprehensive compressed work schedule  program, student loan repayment program, and formal part-time policy.   However, SEC officials said that these programs could not be implemented  at that time because of the impending vote on joining NTEU. After the  vote to unionize, these programs had to be deferred so that they could be  negotiated as part of the collective bargaining process. Although SEC and  NTEU reached an interim agreement on the compressed work schedule  program, the other programs are part of the ongoing negotiation process.", "As part of its new focus on strategic human capital management, SEC has  taken two other steps.  First, it has improved its recruiting efforts. SEC  officials said that to improve the recruiting process, they developed a  formal centralized recruiting program to coordinate the agency\u2019s recruiting  effort for attorneys, accountants, and examiners\u2014which traditionally had  been carried out within divisions and regional offices. In 1999, SEC hired a  chief recruiter, formed a hiring committee that is chaired by the General  Counsel, created a systematic program that makes use of recruiting  strategies such as campus visits and internships, and developed updated  recruiting materials and brochures directed at law students and attorneys.  Further, SEC sends attorneys, usually branch chiefs or office managers  who have attended SEC\u2019s internal recruiter briefing, to conduct on-campus  interviews and attend recruiting events.  In addition, SEC\u2019s enhanced  recruiting program included gathering suggestions for improvement from  hiring officials, recent recruits, and summer legal interns, and studying  recruitment programs in law and public accounting firms to identify best  practices. Second, and more significantly, in April 2001 SEC added a new  goal, \u201csustain and improve organizational excellence,\u201d to its 2002 annual  performance plan. Under this goal, the plan lists specific objectives,  strategies, and performance goals for human capital management and links  the importance of recruiting and retaining employees to SEC\u2019s ability to  accomplish its mission.", "Despite these positive developments, SEC has not addressed several  important human capital management issues. In general, the objectives and  strategies in the annual performance plan address many of the aspects of a  comprehensive strategic human capital plan.  However, they do not  specifically address succession planning.  An earlier GAO report noted that  high-performing organizations consider continuity of leadership through  succession planning and executive development a critical success factor in  effective human capital management and ultimately, in achieving an  organization\u2019s missions and goals. Although our survey results revealed  that only 2 percent of former employees and 4 percent of current  employees cited their eligibility to retire as a somewhat or very important  reason to leave SEC, SEC\u2019s turnover rate makes succession planning  critical.", "SEC officials said that the agency has always had relatively high turnover  but recent high turnover in mid- and entry-level staff could result in a  shortage of experienced staff to assume management roles.  For example,  the average tenure of attorneys leaving SEC declined from 3.4 years in 1992  to 2.5 years in 1999.  Among examiners, the average tenure also declined  from 2.9 years to 1.9 years over the same period. In addition, 47 percent of  current employees that responded to our survey indicated that when they  first began working at SEC, they planned to work at the agency for 5 years  or less. SEC statistics showed that many are not even staying that long. As  of February 2001, 76 percent of SEC examiners had worked at SEC for  fewer than 3 years. In the Division of Enforcement, 11 of 35 branch chiefs  had been in their positions fewer than 10 months. Although SEC has  provided general strategies in its annual performance plan to address  recruiting and retaining staff, SEC officials have not articulated the details  of how the agency plans to carry out these strategies and address this  aspect of their staffing crisis.", "Further, while SEC\u2019s plan mentions broad strategies for evaluating the  effectiveness of its recruitment efforts and regularly reviewing employee  complaints, SEC currently has no formal mechanism to gauge the impact of  these initiatives.  Most high-performing organizations that we have studied  evaluate the effects of their human capital policies and make fact-based  decisions on their effectiveness, often through employee satisfaction  surveys and focus groups. SEC has used neither of these strategies, and  while the 2002 plan recognizes the importance of exit interviews as a  strategy to gauge overall employee satisfaction, SEC has yet to implement a  formal process to collect and analyze data from exit interviews. Similarly,  SEC has not taken a formal approach to analyzing quantifiable data such as  the number, size, and costs of bonuses, awards, and other incentives, and  their distribution among segments of the workforce\u2014measures that would  help show whether the agency\u2019s incentive programs are effectively  motivating its employees. These types of evaluations would do more than  simply measure the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s human capital strategies;  they would also help identify staffing issues before they become major  problems. Although SEC receives an OPM oversight review every 4 years  that could provide some insight into issues of use to management, periodic  employee satisfaction surveys could supplement the information gathered  from OPM oversight reviews.", "Finally, SEC officials said that the Office of Administrative and Personnel  Management (OAPM) would be reorganized to increase its focus on  recruiting and strategic goals for the workplace. Currently, OAPM staff  provide traditional personnel administration services, such as  administering the payroll, processing and maintaining employee records,  overseeing contract and lease administration, as well as enhancing overall  human resources customer service within SEC. The strategic role of human  capital staff is vital if SEC is to increase the effectiveness of its current  human capital management practices. However, nothing in the agency\u2019s  performance plan suggests that the human capital function would be  elevated in stature within SEC and hold \u201ca place at the table\u201d among senior  management in decisionmaking.  In the high-performing organizations that  we studied, human capital staff participated as full members of  management teams and ensured that those teams proactively addressed  human capital issues.  For example, several organizations we studied told  us that they involved their human capital staff as decisionmakers and  internal consultants by having leaders or members of their human capital  staff serve on senior executive planning committees, consult directly with  line managers regarding specific human capital strategies, and offer expert  advice via centralized human capital offices or Intranet sites.  Although  SEC currently has no plans to implement most of these steps, it has  addressed at least one issue.  SEC plans to revise its Intranet home page to  provide employees information on the various benefits and programs SEC  offers.  In addition, the revised home page will allow employees to ask  questions and make suggestions via E-mail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Faces Challenges as It Enhances Its Human Capital Management", "paragraphs": ["SEC has begun to recognize the importance of human capital management  in accomplishing its mission and has taken steps to make it a priority  within the organization and a part of its key planning efforts. But the  agency still faces a number of human capital challenges that will require  the sustained attention and commitment of its leaders.  These challenges  might have contributed to the employees\u2019 concerns identified in our survey.", "First, SEC has not created an organizational culture that ensures ongoing  attention to human capital issues.  Our survey revealed that while current  employees are satisfied with many aspects of their jobs, many areas for  improvement remain (fig. 8).", "The high-performing organizations that we studied focus on valuing and  investing in their employees and on aligning their \u201cpeople policies\u201d to  support organizational performance goals. In contrast, SEC has not made  these principles an important part of its human capital management  strategies. As discussed earlier, some of the agency\u2019s policies concerning  overtime, telecommuting, compressed work schedules, and the use of  credit hours could be improved in order to raise employee morale.  In  addition, our survey results collectively indicate that SEC staff believed  SEC\u2019s organizational culture did not sufficiently value and motivate  employees. For example, 38 percent of current employees were dissatisfied  with the extent to which upper-level management was committed to  making SEC the \u201cbest place it can\u201d be within the constraints of pay and  benefit plans and the extent to which upper management demonstrated  through daily actions and decisions that employees\u2019 well-being and morale  were important. In high-performing organizations, management views  people as a strategic asset. Further, these organizations demonstrate that  effective strategic human capital management requires the sustained  commitment and attention of senior leaders and managers at all levels.  Strategic human capital management practices require that management  continually monitor and refine SEC\u2019s human capital approaches to ensure  their ongoing effectiveness in addressing employees\u2019 needs.", "A second challenge is for SEC management to successfully negotiate a  collective bargaining agreement with the union.  Such an agreement will  create the policies that will guide management\u2019s interaction with the union  and set the tone for the future.  Ultimately it will affect SEC\u2019s ability to  implement human capital policies. Negotiating this contract is a major  challenge for SEC because its management is unfamiliar with the collective  bargaining process and union practices and there are dozens of issues to be  negotiated, including the use of compensatory time and compensatory pay,  credit hours and \u201cdonated\u201d time policies, the promotion process, and the  student loan repayment program. Other agencies we spoke with said that  developing a cooperative relationship with a union is vital if the union is to  benefit the employees. Better communication and coordination between  SEC management and the union could reduce potential conflict and  enhance resolutions.  In addition, training SEC managers and supervisors  to work in a unionized environment would be beneficial.  SEC has  recognized the need for greater expertise in labor relations and has set  aside funding in its 2002 budget for two staff positions to develop and  operate a newly created labor relations unit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s human capital management practices have been shaped largely by  the need to confront a growing staffing crisis that threatens to impair the  agency\u2019s ability to carry out its mission. Our survey results showed that  inadequate compensation is the primary reason that employees leave the  agency. SEC has sought legislation that would allow it to offer salaries  commensurate with those of other financial regulators.  While the  legislation is pending, SEC actively uses compensation flexibilities to retain  and recruit staff.  SEC\u2019s efforts appear to be appropriate, but increasing  compensation by itself cannot solve SEC\u2019s retention challenge and enhance  employee satisfaction and commitment to the agency, because SEC  employees can still opt for higher private sector pay.  Other financial  regulators face similar private sector competition and have accepted that  they will never be able to compete on the basis of pay alone.  Therefore,  even as SEC is moving toward pay parity, efforts to enhance its human  capital programs as a means to recruit and retain employees will remain  important.", "Our survey results provide useful information that can help SEC  management identify key opportunities to improve employee job  satisfaction and morale.  The survey results identified various nonpay  issues that are important to employees, in particular opportunities for  advancement and the quality of administrative support services.  Other  areas that management should evaluate to address employees\u2019 concerns  include the effectiveness of the performance incentive system, the quality  of supervision, the appraisal process, and the work review process.  These  survey results provide a baseline for future employee surveys that measure  job satisfaction and morale and help identify employee concerns and issues  that SEC needs to address.", "Strategic human capital management is a pervasive challenge in the federal  government; SEC is no exception. GAO has identified focusing on people as  a strategic asset as the first step for improving federal agencies\u2019 human  capital management. By including a goal on human capital in its annual  performance plan, SEC has taken a useful first step toward aligning human  capital management with its core mission.  Although SEC has addressed  many aspects of strategic human capital planning, more remains to be  done\u2014for example, in the areas of succession planning and evaluation of  human capital programs.

We closed the survey on March 23, 2001, having  received a total of 1,380 responses, for an overall response rate of 72  percent.  The survey of 487 former SEC staff was conducted by mail. We  sent one follow-up mailing containing the full survey instrument to  nonrespondents approximately 4 weeks after the initial mailing and a  second follow-up containing an abbreviated survey to all remaining  nonrespondents approximately 4 weeks later.

Although SEC agrees that the agency has not addressed succession  planning in its annual performance plan, SEC commented that  succession planning has been part of its human resources effort since  the mid-1980\u2019s.   We do not question whether SEC recognizes the  importance of succession planning, but its actions have not been  documented through detailed goals, objectives, and strategies in its  annual performance plan.", "3.", "In addressing our finding that SEC has yet to implement a formal  process to collect and analyze data from exit interviews, SEC stated  that since late 1998, they had been collecting data from exit surveys  completed by departing employees as part of the checkout process.

SEC officials said that they  generally do not receive meaningful responses on these forms.   However, exit interviews would allow SEC to collect a much richer  body of information and would also allow SEC officials to explore  human capital issues beyond those related to compensation.  4. SEC commented that it is also important to acknowledge that its Office  of Administrative and Personnel Management (OAPM) has taken  measures to enhance overall Human Resource customer service within  the agency.  By stating that OAPM offers traditional personnel  administrative services, we did not intend to imply that the office has  made no effort to explore ways to improve customer service, which is  an important part of the service OAPM provides.
