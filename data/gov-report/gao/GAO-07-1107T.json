In addition, the State Department's data on Iraq's oil production may be overstated since data from the U.S. Department of Energy show lower production levels--between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels less per day. Inadequate metering, re-injection, corruption, theft, and sabotage account for the discrepancy, which amounts to about $1.8 to $5.5 billion per year. Comprehensive metering of Iraq's oil production has been a long-standing problem and continuing need. Poor security, corruption, and funding constraints continue to impede reconstruction of Iraq's oil sector. The deteriorating security environment places workers and infrastructure at risk while protection efforts have been insufficient. Widespread corruption and smuggling reduce oil revenues. Moreover, Iraq's needs are significant and future funding for the oil sector is uncertain as nearly 80 percent of U.S. funds for the oil sector have been spent. Iraq's contribution has been minimal with the government spending less than 3 percent of the $3.5 billion it approved for oil reconstruction projects in 2006. Iraq has yet to enact and implement hydrocarbon legislation that defines the distribution of oil revenues and the rights of foreign investors. Until this legislation is enacted and implemented, it will be difficult for Iraq to attract the billions of dollars in foreign investment it needs to modernize the sector. As of July 13, 2007, Iraq's cabinet has approved only one of four separate but interrelated pieces of legislation--a framework that establishes the structure, management, and oversight. Another part is in draft and two others are not yet drafted. Poor security, corruption, and the lack of national unity will likely impede the implementation of this legislation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss U.S. efforts to rebuild Iraq\u2019s oil  sector and Iraq\u2019s efforts to enact hydrocarbon legislation.", "The oil sector is critical to Iraq\u2019s economy, accounting for over half of  Iraq\u2019s gross domestic product and over 90 percent of its revenues.

The Gulf War began the following year when Iraq invaded Kuwait. In  January 1991, the United States and coalition partners began a counter- offensive (Operation Desert Storm). Crude oil production once again  dropped precipitously and remained relatively low from 1990 to 1996,  while Iraq was under UN sanctions. Under the UN Oil for Food program,  Iraqi crude oil production began to rebound, peaking at an annual average  of 2.6 mbpd in 2000. In the 5 years preceding the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq,  crude oil production averaged 2.3 mbpd.

U.S. goals for the oil sector include reaching an  average crude oil production capacity of 3 million barrels per day (mbpd)  and crude oil export levels of 2.2 mbpd. However, in 2006, actual crude oil  production and exports averaged, respectively, about 2.1 mbpd and 1.5  mbpd. Figure 3 compares Iraq\u2019s oil production and exports with U.S. goals  (the data for this figure are presented in appendix I). As the figure shows,  production and exports for the first five months of 2007 were still below  U.S. goals. In August 2003, the CPA established a U.S. program goal to  increase crude oil production to about 1.3 mbpd.

These CPA goals were to increase production capacity of natural gas to  800 million standard cubic feet per day (mscfd); increase production  capacity of LPG to 3,000 tons per day (tpd); and meet demand for benzene  (gasoline), diesel, kerosene, and LPG by building and maintaining their  stock levels at a 15-day supply.", "However, the 2006 averages did not meet these goals. To increase the  stocks of petroleum products and their availability to consumers, Iraq  legalized the importation of petroleum products by private companies to  supplement its own production and state-owned company imports. For  2006, the IMF estimated that Iraq\u2019s state-owned companies imported about  $2.6 billion of petroleum products. At the recommendation of the IMF, the  Iraqi government has been reducing subsidies for refined oil products,  which raises the prices consumers pay. In the past, refined oil products in  Iraq had been highly subsidized, which led to increased demand.

The State Department\u2019s data are  reported daily in real time, while EIA produces monthly data that have  been reviewed and corroborated from several sources. This lag in  reporting and longer time period may allow analysts to address  inconsistencies such a double counting and reinjection. In addition, the  State Department regularly reports on sabotage and interdictions to crude  oil pipelines and other disruptions in the crude oil production process.

However, the oil metering contract  was not completed due to security and technical issues. In June 2006,  IAMB reported that the Iraqi government had entered into an agreement  with Shell Oil Company to serve as a consultant for the Ministry of Oil.  Shell would advise the ministry on the establishment of a system to  measure the flow of oil, gas, and related products within Iraq and in export  and import operations.

Moreover, looting and vandalism have continued since 2003. U.S.  officials reported that major oil pipelines in the north continue to be  sabotaged, shutting down oil exports and resulting in lost revenues. For  example, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, although eight gas oil  separation plants in northern Iraq have been refurbished, many are not  running due to interdictions on the Iraq-Turkey pipeline and new  stabilization plant. The Corps noted that if the lines and plant were in  operation today, an additional 500,000 barrels per day could be produced  in northern Iraq.", "The U.S. government has developed a number of initiatives to protect the  oil infrastructure and transfer this responsibility to the Iraqi government.  Such efforts include fortifying the infrastructure and improving the  capabilities of rapid repair teams and protection security forces such as  the Oil Protection Force and the Strategic Infrastructure Battalions (SIB).  The U.S. government has paired these security forces with coalition  partners and has trained and equipped the SIBs. However, U.S. officials  stated that the capability and loyalty of some of these units are  questionable. According to Department of Defense (DOD) and Center for  Strategic and International Studies reports, these security forces have  been underpaid, underequipped, and poorly led, and are sometimes  suspected of being complicit in interdiction and smuggling.

According to State Department officials and reports, about 10  percent to 30 percent of refined fuels are diverted to the black market or  are smuggled out of Iraq and sold for a profit. According to State  Department reporting, Iraqi government officials may have profited from  these activities. The insurgency has been partly funded by corrupt  activities within Iraq and by skimming profits from black marketers,  according to U.S. embassy documents. According to a June 2007 DOD  report, a variety of criminal, insurgent, and militia groups engage in the  theft and illicit sale of oil to fund their activities. For example, DOD  reported that as much as 70 percent of the fuel processed at Bayji was lost  to the black market\u2014possibly as much as $2 billion a year. As a result, the  Iraqi Army assumed control of the entire Bayji refinery, and equipment is  being installed to prevent siphoning.", "One factor that had stimulated black market activities and fuel smuggling  to neighboring countries was Iraq\u2019s low domestic fuel prices, which were  subsidized by the government. However, under the IMF\u2019s Stand-by  Arrangement with Iraq, the government has already increased domestic  fuel prices several times, significantly reducing the subsidy for many fuel  products.

While Iraq\u2019s inability to spend its capital budget may not directly  affect U.S.-funded projects, U.S. investment alone is not adequate for the  full reconstruction and expansion of the oil sector. Therefore, Iraq\u2019s  continued difficulties in spending its capital budget could hamper efforts  to attain its current reconstruction goals.", "According to U.S. officials, Iraq lacks the clearly defined and consistently  applied budget and procurement rules needed to effectively implement  capital projects. For example, the Iraqi ministries are guided by complex  laws and regulations, including those implemented under Saddam  Hussein, the CPA, and the current government. According to State  Department officials, the lack of agreed-upon procurement and budgeting  rules causes confusion among ministry officials and creates opportunities  for corruption and mismanagement. Additionally, according to the State  Department and DOD, personnel turnover within the ministries, fear of  corruption charges, and an onerous contract approval process have  caused delays in contract approval and capital improvement expenditures.", "Furthermore, the Iraqi government has not made full use of potential  international loans, and future donor funding for the oil sector remains  uncertain. Donors other than the United States have not provided any  grants to develop the oil sector, and the Iraqi government had not taken  advantage of $467 million in loans from Japan to develop a crude oil  export facility and upgrade a refinery.
