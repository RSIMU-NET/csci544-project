For example, agencies\u2019 plans and reports  contain important information such as agency priority goals, evaluations  of program effectiveness, financial statements, and data to track  economic growth. Over time, Congress has updated reporting  requirements to meet its informational needs.", "The federal government produces thousands of plans and reports each  year to meet the informational needs of Congress. While there will always  be a need for information, at times, both Congress and the executive  branch have raised questions about whether some reports may be  duplicative or outdated.

Among other things, GPRAMA provisions establish  a process to reexamine the usefulness of certain existing reporting  requirements. Specifically, GPRAMA requires an annual review, based  on Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, of all agencies\u2019  reporting requirements, and requires OMB to provide Congress with  agencies\u2019 proposals to eliminate or modify plans and reports that may no  longer be necessary. The Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014  eliminated or modified 51 reporting requirements, of which, 34 were  identified through the GPRAMA process. Most recently, in April 2017,  OMB issued a government-wide memorandum confirming the  administration\u2019s intent to follow the GPRAMA provision to regularly review  reporting requirements. The memorandum also called for a review to  streamline other agency reporting not required in statute.", "You requested that we review federal agencies\u2019 compliance with  GPRAMA\u2019s provisions to propose eliminating or modifying unnecessary  reports, and to describe the process being used to generate report  modification proposals.

We  analyzed agencies\u2019 report modification proposals to determine the  number of proposals submitted from each agency and to categorize the  justifications provided by agencies. We assessed the reliability of  information included in agencies\u2019 report modification proposals by  ensuring the completeness of information on modification proposals  provided by agencies, and by reviewing internal controls used by selected  agencies when validating information provided to OMB. Based on this  assessment we determined this information was sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our objective.", "To assess the extent to which OMB and agencies are implementing  GPRAMA requirements, we reviewed relevant agency documents  including OMB guidance, all agencies\u2019 report modification proposals,  records of congressional consultations, and selected agencies\u2019 complete  lists of reports for Congress (see next paragraph for a list of selected  agencies). To determine whether each agency met the percent threshold  established in the first year of implementation as required by GPRAMA,  we calculated the percentage of all reports that were published in 2012  for each agency that the agency believed to be unnecessary. We  interviewed staff from OMB and selected agencies to learn about their  methodology and process for developing proposals to eliminate or modify  reporting requirements.

Specifically, GPRAMA requires OMB annually to determine  a minimum percentage of reports to be identified as unnecessary, and to  compile a list of agencies\u2019 report modification proposals and then include  it in the President\u2019s Budget. GPRAMA also provides OMB the option of  concurrently submitting legislation to Congress for eliminating or  modifying proposed reports on this list, as appropriate.", "Most executive branch agencies are subject to GPRAMA requirements  for identifying and developing report modification proposals. GPRAMA  requires the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at each agency annually to  complete the following four activities:  1.  Compile a list that identifies all reports the agency produces for  Congress, in accordance with statutory requirements or as directed in  congressional reports.  2.  Analyze the list compiled to identify which reports are outdated or  duplicative of other required plans and reports, and refine the list to  include only the plans and reports identified to be outdated or  duplicative.  3.  Consult with the congressional committees that receive the agency- proposed outdated or duplicative reports to determine whether they  could be eliminated or consolidated with other reports.  4.  Provide a total count of reports compiled and the list of outdated and  duplicative reports identified to the Director of OMB.", "These requirements are also included in OMB\u2019s Circular A-11 guidance to  agencies, along with additional directions for agencies to follow when  implementing the law. For example, OMB clarifies that agencies\u2019 full list of  plans and reports should be available to OMB and Congress upon  request. Furthermore, OMB\u2019s A-11 guidance provides a timeline,  describes the information that agencies should include in their report  modification proposals, and delineates a process for submitting proposals  to OMB. Figure 1 outlines the process OMB uses to implement GPRAMA  requirements.", "As the coordinating agency, OMB developed a template for agencies\u2019  report modification proposals. Each proposal is to include the report title,  statutory requirement, proposed action for modification, and a justification  that explains why the agency identified the report as unnecessary.  Agencies can propose one of six recommended modifications: eliminate,  consolidate, reduce frequency, streamline, modify the due date, or modify  the report language. Figure 2 provides three examples of agencies\u2019  proposals. OMB maintains a current list of proposals on  Performance.gov.", "In addition to the GPRAMA process for developing report modification  proposals, agencies can use a number of other mechanisms or  authorities to identify duplicative or outdated reports and eliminate or  modify them, as appropriate. For example, agencies in our review  described efforts to work directly with congressional committees to  develop legislation to eliminate or modify reports. Agencies have also  provided report modification proposals in their annual budget submission  to OMB or directly to their authorizing committees, as part of a periodic  reauthorization process. In some instances, congressional committees  have initiated their own efforts to streamline reporting requirements. For  example, Congress passed the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 which  authorized executive agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, to  consolidate or adjust the frequency and due dates of certain statutorily  required reports that focused on financial management and government  performance. At other times, executive branch leaders have chosen to  undertake internal efficiency reviews that have included efforts to identify  and eliminate duplicative or outdated reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB and Agencies Developed Hundreds of Proposals for Report Elimination or Modification", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Proposed to Eliminate or Modify Hundreds of Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Since the passage of GPRAMA, OMB has publicly posted 788 report  modification proposals, which includes 523 new proposals and 265  proposals that were published a second time in 2016.

This report (1) reviews  the information included in agencies\u2019 report modification proposals, and  identifies the number of proposals published by the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), (2) assesses the extent to which OMB and agencies  are implementing GPRAMA requirements regarding the elimination or  modification of unnecessary plans and reports, and (3) describes how  selected federal agencies determined which plans and reports are  outdated or duplicative.", "To review the information included in agencies\u2019 report modification  proposals and identify the number of proposals published by OMB, we  reviewed selected agencies\u2019 full lists of reports for Congress; all agencies\u2019  report modification proposals (from 2012, 2014, and 2016); and OMB  guidance and instructions. We interviewed OMB staff to ensure that we  obtained the complete lists that OMB published on Performance.gov. To  assess the reliability of information contained in agencies\u2019 published  report modification proposals, we reviewed the completeness of report  modification information provided by agencies and asked selected  agencies to describe their internal controls and related quality assurance  practices for validating information provided to OMB. We determined the  information on report modification proposals by agency was sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. To determine whether there was an association  between the number of reports the agencies produced for Congress in  2012 and the number they marked as unnecessary, we performed a  simple correlation, and found a relatively high degree of association (R =  .76 for all observations). However, we also noted that the percentage of  all reports marked as unnecessary varied considerably by agency, from 0  percent to almost 40 percent. See appendix II for the percentages by  agency. For all agencies apart from DOD, we determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of calculating the percentage of  reports proposed for modification as a percentage of reports the agencies  identified as being for Congress. However, DOD informed us that the  number of reports in OMB\u2019s database identified as being for Congress  was incorrect. We could not determine the source of the error because of  the amount of time that had elapsed and because of staff turnover at both  OMB and DOD. Moreover, DOD could not provide us with the correct  number due to the time that has elapsed since 2012, and instead  informed us that that they likely had produced between 600 and 800  reports for Congress at around that time. For that reason, we do not  report the percentage of DOD reports proposed for modification as a  percentage of all their reports for Congress, and do not include DOD in  the correlation between these two data elements that we report in  appendix II.  It was beyond the scope of this engagement to determine if  the agencies had consistently and completely identified all of their reports  for Congress.", "We analyzed agencies\u2019 report modification proposals to determine the  number of proposals submitted from each agency and to categorize the  recommended actions and justifications provided by agencies. To  categorize agencies\u2019 recommended actions, we sorted agencies\u2019  proposals based on the action they proposed to Congress. Actions  included elimination, consolidation, reduction in frequency, streamline, or  modification of report language or due date. For reports agencies  proposed to eliminate, we developed seven themes (as shown in table 3)  and categorized a random sample of 133 justifications into one or more of  those themes. To develop these themes, analysts independently  reviewed a portion of the randomly selected justifications and identified  potential themes. After developing potential themes, the analysts  reconciled their lists of draft themes and reached agreement on a final set  of themes to use for categorization. We focused on reports proposed for  elimination because they constituted 72 percent of all agencies\u2019  proposals. The remaining 28 percent of proposals that were not included  in our sample consisted of proposals for consolidating, reducing the  frequency, or otherwise modifying a report.", "In order to categorize justifications used in proposals to eliminate reports,  we selected a generalizable stratified random sample of 133 report  proposals from the population of 379 identified from OMB from 2011  through 2016. We selected the 33 proposals associated with reports that  had been eliminated through the 2014 Government Reports Elimination  Act with certainty and randomly selected 100 proposals from the  remaining 346 proposals. Two coders independently coded each of the  133 justifications and reconciled any initial differences in the coding  results to reach agreement on the categories for each justification. As  some report modification proposals contained more than one justification,  we coded each justification and our totals are based on the justifications  rather than the number of reports identified. All percentage estimates  generated for this report have a margin of error of plus or minus 8  percentage points or fewer at the 95 percent confidence level (as shown  in table 3). We did not independently assess the agencies\u2019 justifications.  In some instances, agencies provided very short and even one word  justification; however, we were able to categorize short or one word  justifications, such as \u201cunfunded,\u201d because they consisted of a term or  synonym for a term from one of our justification themes.", "To assess the extent to which OMB and agencies are implementing  GPRAMA requirements, we reviewed all relevant GPRAMA requirements  and relevant agency documents including OMB guidance, selected  agencies\u2019 total lists of reports for Congress, records of congressional  consultations, all agencies\u2019 report modification proposals, and related  legislation passed by Congress to eliminate or modify reports. We also  interviewed OMB staff to determine how they operationalized these  requirements. We evaluated whether OMB\u2019s email guidance and related  correspondence was consistent with Circular A-11 guidance and  GPRAMA requirements. We interviewed staff from OMB and responsible  officials at selected agencies to learn about their methodology and  processes for developing proposals to eliminate or modify reporting  requirements. Generally, the officials responsible for coordinating report  modification submissions were senior staff from the agencies\u2019 chief  operating office, budget office, general counsel, the office of legislative  affairs, or a combination of these. We also spoke with staff from the  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to gather their  perspectives on consultations with agencies. We selected these  committees because they oversee GPRAMA implementation  government-wide.", "To describe how selected federal agencies determine which reports are  outdated or duplicative, we selected a non-generalizable sample of six  agencies for review based on the number of proposals that were  submitted to Congress for elimination or modification between fiscal years  2011 and 2016. We selected the two agencies that submitted the greatest  number of proposals (Department of Defense and Department of  Homeland Security), two that published one proposal (Consumer Product  Safety Commission and the Federal Communications Commission), and  the two closest to the average (National Aeronautics and Space  Administration and the Department of the Treasury). Our findings based  on these selected agencies are not generalizable. We interviewed  officials at these agencies responsible for developing and submitting  proposals to OMB. We also reviewed relevant agency documents such as  agencies\u2019 lists of all reports they produce for Congress, their report  modification proposals, congressional correspondence, and internal  guidance or instructions provided to the offices or components that were  involved in generating and reviewing proposals.", "We conducted our work from June 2016 to July 2017 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.
