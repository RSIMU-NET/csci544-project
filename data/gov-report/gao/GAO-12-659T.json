DOE\u0092s management of contractors, who operate DOE sites and represent 90 percent of DOE\u0092s budget, has historically been decentralized, or fragmented.

Congress also passed the America Creating  Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology,  Education, and Science Act of 2007 (America COMPETES Act), with the  overall goal of increasing federal investment in scientific research. In this  context, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2007 budget proposed doubling  funding for DOE\u2019s Office of Science by fiscal year 2016, in part under the  goals of the America COMPETES Act.

At that time, Congress had  authorized DOE to guarantee approximately $42.5 billion in section 1703  loans. Although Congress had provided funds to DOE to cover the  program\u2019s administrative costs, it had not appropriated funds to pay the  \u201ccredit subsidy costs\u201d of these guarantees.

As  of February 28, 2012, we found that DOE had awarded 58 state-level  grant recipients approximately $4.84 billion to implement the  Weatherization Assistance Program under the Recovery Act, and these  recipients reported spending about $4.22 billion and weatherizing  709,138 homes, exceeding the program\u2019s production target of 607,000  homes. Table 4 shows the program\u2019s budget requests and  appropriations since fiscal year 2007.", "In December 2011, we reported that some grant recipients had been able  to exceed their production targets because of a lower average cost of  weatherizing homes and lower training and technical assistance  expenses than anticipated.

In response to concerns about whether or not program requirements were  being met, our May 2010 report included recommendations to DOE to  clarify its guidance, production targets, funding deadlines, and associated  consequences.

These higher credit  subsidy costs were, in part, a reflection of the risky financial situation of  the automotive industry at the time the loans were made. As a result of  the higher credit subsidy costs, we reported that the program may be  unable to loan the full $25 billion allowed by statute. We also reported that  the ATVM loan program had set procedures for overseeing the financial  and technical performance of borrowers and had begun using the  procedures to oversee the loans; at the time of our report, however, it had  not yet engaged the engineering expertise needed for technical oversight,  as called for by its procedures.
