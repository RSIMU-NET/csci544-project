While the federal government owns the surface lands in the system, in many cases private parties own the subsurface mineral rights and have the legal authority to explore for and extract oil and gas. GAO was asked to determine the extent of oil and gas activity on refuges, identify the environmental effects, and assess the Fish and Wildlife Service's management and oversight of oil and gas activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About one-quarter (155 of 575) of all refuges have past or present oil and gas activity, some dating to at least the 1920s. Activities range from exploration to drilling and production to pipelines transiting refuge lands. One hundred five refuges contain a total of 4,406 oil and gas wells--2,600 inactive wells and 1,806 active wells. The 1,806 wells, located at 36 refuges and many around the Gulf Coast, produced oil and gas valued at $880 million during the last 12 month reporting period, roughly 1 percent of domestic production. Thirty-five refuges contain only pipelines. The Fish and Wildlife Service has not assessed the cumulative environmental effects of oil and gas activities on refuges. Available studies, anecdotal information, and GAO's observations show that the environmental effects of oil and gas activities vary from negligible, such as from buried pipelines, to substantial, such as from large oil spills or from large-scale infrastructure. These effects also vary from the temporary to the longer term. Some of the most detrimental effects of oil and gas activities have been reduced through environmental laws and improved practices and technology. Moreover, oil and gas operators have taken steps, in some cases voluntarily, to reverse damages resulting from oil and gas activities. Federal management and oversight of oil and gas activities varies widely among refuges--some refuges take extensive measures, while others exercise little control or enforcement. GAO found that this variation occurs because of differences in authority to oversee private mineral rights and because refuge managers lack enough guidance, resources, and training to properly manage and oversee oil and gas activities. Greater attention to oil and gas activities by the Fish and Wildlife Service would increase its understanding of associated environmental effects and contribute to more consistent use of practices and technologies that protect refuge resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System, as expressed in its  governing legislation, is to \u201cadminister a national network of lands and  waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate,  restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats  within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations  of Americans.\u201d The system is unique in that the 95 million acres of land in  the system are the only federal lands managed primarily for the benefit  of wildlife, providing habitat for native plants and animals, including  endangered or threatened species, as well as important way points for  migrating species, such as ducks, cranes, and eagles. The system, which  represents more than 14 percent of all federal lands and has a presence  in every state, is administered by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish  and Wildlife Service and includes both land that has always been federally  owned and land that has been acquired from others. While the federal  government owns almost all the surface lands in the system, in many  cases the federal government does not own the subsurface mineral rights.  Subject to some restriction, owners of subsurface mineral rights have the  legal authority to explore for mineral resources such as oil and gas and,  if such resources are found, to extract them.", "In October 2001, we reported that the Fish and Wildlife Service recognized  some type of oil and gas activity on 77 of the 567 refuges and wetland  management districts within the National Wildlife Refuge System in calendar year 2000. However, our report recognized that this accounting  of activities might be incomplete because the data were based on refuges\u2019  self-reporting. Therefore, to gain a more complete assessment of oil and  gas activities, you asked us to (1) determine the nature and full extent of  oil and gas activities in the National Wildlife Refuge System, (2) identify  environmental effects of oil and gas activities on refuge resources, and  (3) assess the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s management and oversight of  these activities.", "Our updated information on the extent of past and present oil and gas  activities within current wildlife refuge boundaries is based on a variety of  sources. Using national geographic information databases, we determined  how many documented oil and gas wells and transit pipelines were located  within or immediately proximate to refuge boundaries. We also used  Fish and Wildlife Service records to identify other evidence of oil and  gas activities. Premier Data Services, a firm with extensive experience in  computer-based geographic information systems and oil and gas leasing,  aided our data acquisition and analysis (see app. IV). Our analysis is more  extensive than any undertaken by the Fish and Wildlife Service or the  Department of the Interior, and at their request, we are providing our  database to them for future use.", "We visited 16 refuges, representing a range of type and scale of oil and gas  activities and environmental effects.

The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) owns the  surface lands and, in some cases, the mineral rights of National Wildlife  Refuges and Waterfowl Production Areas, while conservation easements  and coordination areas are owned or managed by others. Day-to-day  management of wildlife refuges is the responsibility of local refuge  managers, subject to the direction of seven regional refuge chiefs and  the Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System (see fig. 1 for a map of  FWS regions). Of FWS\u2019s nearly $1.3 billion budget in fiscal year 2002,  about $319 million was devoted to the operations and maintenance of the  refuge system. In fiscal year 2002, $99.13 million from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund was used for the acquisition of additional refuge lands.", "Over the years, we and others have examined the effects on the refuge  system of secondary activities, such as recreation, military activities,  and oil and gas activities\u2014which include oil and gas exploration, drilling  and production, and transport. Exploring for oil and gas involves seismic  mapping of the subsurface topography. Seismic mapping, regardless of the  technology employed, requires surface disturbance, often involving small  dynamite charges placed in a series of holes, typically in patterned grids.  If seismic mapping reveals potential oil or gas deposits exploratory drilling  begins. Oil and gas drilling and production often requires constructing,  operating, and maintaining industrial infrastructure, including a network of  access roads and canals, local pipelines to connect well sites to production  facilities and dispose of drilling wastes, and gravel pads to house the  drilling and other equipment. In addition, production may require storage  tanks, separating facilities, and gas compressors. Finally, transporting  oil and gas to production facilities or to users requires transit pipelines.  Typically buried, these pipelines range in size, with some as large as  30 inches in diameter. Pumping stations and storage tanks may also be  needed for pipeline operations.", "Under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966,  as amended, FWS is responsible for regulating all activities on refuges.  The act requires FWS to determine the compatibility of activities with the  purposes of the particular refuge and the mission of the refuge system and  not allow those activities deemed incompatible. However, FWS does not  apply the compatibility requirement to the exercise of private mineral  rights on refuges. Department of the Interior regulations also prohibit  leasing federal minerals underlying refuges outside of Alaska, except in  cases where federal minerals are being drained by operations on property  adjacent to the refuge.", "Nevertheless, the activities of private mineral owners on refuges are  subject to a variety of legal restrictions, including FWS regulations.  A variety of federal laws affect how private mineral rights owners  conduct their activities. For example, the Endangered Species Act of 1973  prohibits the \u201ctake\u201d of any endangered or threatened species and provides  for penalties for violations of the act; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act  prohibits killing, hunting, possessing, or selling migratory birds, except in  accordance with a permit; and the Clean Water Act prohibits discharging  oil or other toxic substances into waters of the United States and imposes  liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge.", "Also, FWS regulations require that oil and gas activities be performed in  a way that minimizes the risk of damage to the land and wildlife and the  disturbance to the operation of the refuge. The regulations also require  that land affected be reclaimed after operations have ceased. Whether  FWS has authority to impose permitting requirements on private oil and gas  activities is discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Oil and Gas Activities in Refuges", "paragraphs": ["At least 155 of the 575 refuges of the National Wildlife Refuge System  have some past or present oil and gas activities\u2014exploration, drilling and  production, or transit pipelines.

While pipelines cannot be  constructed across refuge lands unless FWS determines that the pipelines  are compatible with the purposes of the refuge and issues a right-of-way  permit, some pipelines were constructed before FWS acquired the  property.

Routine oil and gas activities can  contaminate a refuge and reduce the quantity and quality of habitat  available for wildlife. Over the years, new environmental laws and  improved industry practices and technology have reduced some of the  most detrimental effects of oil and gas activities; however, some harm  to refuges continues to occur and some effects from earlier events have  not been reversed and continue to diminish refuge resources.

Some damage, such as habitat loss because  of infrastructure development and soil and water contamination, may  last indefinitely while other damage, such as wildlife disturbance during  seismic mapping, is of shorter duration. Also, while certain types of  damage are readily visible, others, such as groundwater contamination and  reduced habitat quality from infrastructure development, are difficult to  observe, quantify, and associate directly with oil and gas activities. Finally,  oil and gas activities may hinder FWS\u2019s ability to manage or improve refuge  habitat, such as seasonal flooding of wetlands or prescribed burns, or  hinder public access to parts of the refuge."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spills", "paragraphs": ["Spills of oil, gas, and brine have harmed refuge wildlife and habitat. Oil  and gas can injure or kill wildlife by destroying the insulating capacity of  feathers and fur, depleting oxygen available in water, or exposing wildlife  to toxic substances. Long-term effects of oil and gas contamination are  difficult to determine, but studies suggest that effects of exposure include  reduced fertility, kidney and liver damage, immune suppression, and  cancer. Even small spills may contaminate soil and sediments if they  occur frequently. For instance, a study of Atchafalaya and Delta NWRs in  Louisiana found that levels of oil contamination near oil and gas facilities  are lethal to most species of wildlife, even though refuge staff were not  aware of any large spills. Figure 5 shows an ongoing clean up of a  relatively small oil spill that occurred at Delta NWR in 2002. Brine spills  can also be lethal to young waterfowl, damage birds\u2019 feathers, kill  vegetation, and decrease nutrients in water. Based on well data from  Premier Data Services, over 19.8 million gallons of brine were produced  from active wells on NWRs during the most recent 12-month reporting  period as of January 2003. Much of this brine was reinjected back into the  ground to prevent surface damage.", "The 16 refuges we visited reported oil, gas, or brine spills, although the  frequency and effect of the spills varied widely. For instance, Hopper  Mountain NWR in California reported two oil spills in 1990, the only spills  since 1974, and refuge records indicated that the operator cleaned up each  spill quickly and that refuge staff detected no effect on wildlife. In contrast,  Anahuac NWR in Texas reported at least 7 oil spills since 1991, including  1 pipeline spill that killed over 800 large fish such as mullet and redfish  and over 180,000 menhaden, a small but ecologically important fish. FWS  officials said that natural gas leaks generally pose a lower risk to habitat  than oil spills, but a gas leak in 2000 at Sabine NWR in Louisiana killed  fish, crabs, and amphibians. Brine spills have also damaged refuges. For  example, Atchafalaya and D\u2019Arbonne NWRs in Louisiana reported that  brine spills had killed vegetation in the area of the spill. At these refuges,  salt concentrations in the soil have remained high and continued to spread  for decades after a spill, and some sites do not support vegetation  years afterwards.", "The exact number and size of oil and gas spills on NWRs is not known.  Nationally, FWS reported that 348 oil and gas spills were located on or  near refuges during fiscal year 2002, although there are limitations to this  figure. First, it includes spills resulting from activities not associated with  oil and gas production or transit pipelines, such as shipping accidents.  Second, FWS calculated the number of spills by reviewing spill reports  from the National Response Center and other parties that did not always  identify if a refuge is affected. Third, not all spills are required to be  reported. Clean Water Act regulations require operators to report spills of  any quantity if they cause a sheen to form on waters subject to federal  jurisdiction. Other spills are subject to state reporting requirements,  which vary. For instance, Texas requires operators to report spills over  210 gallons, while Louisiana requires operators to report spills over  42 gallons. Finally, refuge staff told us that they knew of spills that  operators never reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Constructing, operating, and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to  produce oil and gas can harm wildlife by reducing the quantity and quality  of habitat. At Kenai NWR in Alaska, for instance, oil and gas wells and  associated facilities have eliminated at least 524 acres of habitat, while  other infrastructure, such as access roads and pipelines, has eliminated an  additional 424 acres. While this loss of habitat represents a very small  proportion of total refuge acreage, refuge staff determined that it  eliminated food sources that would have supported between 41 and  136 cow moose and 411 snowshoe hares. In other instances, habitat lost  to infrastructure development is negligible\u2014for example, the presence  of a wellhead or pipelines, such as the wellhead at Delta NWR shown in  figure 6.", "Infrastructure development can reduce the quality of habitat by  fragmenting it and, in some cases, by changing the hydrology of the  refuge ecosystem or contaminating it with toxic substances. Habitat  fragmentation occurs when a network of roads, canals, and other  infrastructure is constructed in previously undeveloped areas of a refuge.  Fragmentation increases disturbances from human activities, provides  pathways for predators, and helps spread nonnative plant species. For  example, the endangered California condor is particularly susceptible to  disturbances from human activities. Condors have been observed landing  on oil pads on the refuge, which poses a safety risk to the birds and reduces  their fear of humans. In addition, FWS estimated in 1980 that oil and gas  activities at Hopper Mountain NWR eliminated about 63 percent of the  potential feeding habitat for condors on the refuge. The current refuge  manager said that the effect of this loss on the condor population may  not be significant because the importance of the feeding habitat provided  by the refuge may not be as great as previously thought. Corridors that  oil and gas operators have developed assist predation\u2014for example,  among songbirds, and allow a pathway for invasive species, a significant  management problem for FWS. Finally, officials at Anahuac and  McFaddin NWRs in Texas said that disturbances from oil and gas activities  are likely significant and expressed concern that bird nesting may be  disrupted. However, no studies have been conducted at these refuges to  determine the effect of these disturbances.", "Infrastructure networks can also damage refuge habitat by changing the  hydrology of the refuge ecosystem, particularly in coastal areas. For  instance, tens of thousands of acres of freshwater marsh at Sabine NWR,  and elsewhere in Louisiana and Texas, have been lost due to saltwater  intrusion. Saltwater intrusion may change the types of plants in the  marsh and can cause erosion that creates an open water habitat that  is less biologically productive than the marsh. While several factors  contribute to the saltwater intrusion, construction of canals to access oil  and gas facilities is considered by many scientists to be significant. Seismic  studies for oil and gas exploration in coastal marshes can also contribute  to saltwater intrusion. Seismic studies are typically conducted in a grid  pattern and may cover large portions of a refuge. Preparing and conducting  seismic studies may require heavy equipment that can compress the marsh,  which changes the plant community and could allow saltwater to intrude  into the marsh, particularly during droughts that decrease freshwater  flows. At McFaddin NWR, the grid pattern from a 1995 seismic study was  clearly visible from infrared aerial photographs taken after the seismic  study was completed (see fig. 7).", "Moreover, industrial activities associated with extracting oil and gas have  been found to contaminate wildlife refuges with toxic substances such  as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). D\u2019Arbonne, Kenai, and  Upper Ouachita (Louisiana) NWRs reported mercury contamination, and  Kenai NWR reported PCB contamination from oil and gas activities that  must still be cleaned up by FWS if the responsible parties cannot be  found. Mercury and PCBs were used in equipment such as compressors,  transformers, and well production meters, although generally they are no  longer used. Mercury has been linked to brain, kidney, and reproductive  system damage, and PCBs are known animal carcinogens."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legal and Industry Changes Have Reduced Some of the Environmental Effects of Oil and Gas Activities", "paragraphs": ["New laws prohibiting some of the most harmful industry practices have  helped diminish the adverse effect of current and recent oil and gas  activities on refuge resources. For example, Louisiana now generally  prohibits using open pits to store production wastes and brine in coastal  areas or discharging brine into drainages or state waters. Another example  is Texas, which requires operators to install screens or nets over open  tanks and pits to protect birds from contacting hazardous fluids. Texas also  now requires operators to remove oil and gas infrastructure, such as tanks,  which will not be actively used in the continuing operation of a lease and to  contour closed sites to reduce water contamination.", "Improvements in industry practice, including improved technology,  have also reduced the damage caused by oil and gas activities. For  example, where feasible, directional drilling allows (1) operators to  avoid placing wells in sensitive areas such as wetlands and (2) several  wells to be drilled from the same pad, thus reducing the amount of habitat  damaged. Another example is improved geologic mapping through 3-D  seismic technology. While 3-D seismic studies require more vehicle traffic  and may damage more vegetation than 2-D studies, improved geologic  mapping may reduce the number of wells drilled that do not produce oil or  gas and ultimately reduce the amount of habitat damaged. Furthermore,  the impact of 3-D seismic studies has been reduced through other  improvements, including using vehicles less damaging to the surface,  reducing the number of vehicle trips necessary, hand carrying seismic lines  to avoid vehicle damage altogether, and scheduling seismic operations to  avoid sensitive times.", "While the relative impacts of the activities have been reduced in  recent years, the effects have not been eliminated. For instance, oil and  gas infrastructure continues to diminish availability of refuge habitat for  wildlife, and spills of oil, gas, and brine that damage fish and wildlife  continue to occur. In addition, several refuge managers reported that  operators do not always comply with legal requirements or follow best  industry practices such as constructing berms (earthen barriers) around  tanks to contain spills, covering tanks to protect wildlife, and removing pits  that temporarily store fluids used during well maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reversing Environmental Damages Is Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["Environmental damage from oil and gas activities may be partially reversed  by remediating contamination or by reclaiming a site to its prior condition  after oil and gas activities cease. However, oil and gas operators have not  consistently taken steps to reverse environmental damages that have  occurred from oil and gas activities on NWRs. In some cases, officials do  not know if remediation following spills is sufficient to protect refuge  resources, particularly for smaller oil spills or spills into wetlands. In other  cases, FWS has been satisfied with the response. According to refuge  officials and industry representatives, when small oil spills occur, operators  may contain the oil and then remove the oil and the contaminated soil, but  in some cases operators leave the oil and cover it with dirt. In contrast, the  effects of larger spills may be evaluated systematically and remediated by  the operator. For example, in 2000, a ruptured pipeline spilled nearly  200,000 gallons of crude oil at John Heinz NWR in Pennsylvania, damaging  several species of wildlife and covering a frozen pond. In response, the  operator removed the oil and the contaminated soil, replanted damaged  vegetation, funded scientific studies to determine the effect on refuge  wildlife, compensated the refuge for the value lost to visitors during the  spill; and the operator is negotiating with FWS to identify an appropriate  restoration project to compensate for the ecologic value of refuge  resources lost while the refuge recovers from the spill.", "Similar to spill remediation, reclamation of oil and gas facilities following  their use is also inconsistent. For instance, an operator at McFaddin NWR  removed a road and a well pad that had been constructed to access a new  well site and restored the marsh damaged by construction after the well  was no longer needed. Figure 8 provides an aerial view of the road and the  well pad shortly after they were constructed and a photo of the same site  following reclamation. Other refuges, however, reported that storage tanks,  debris, and access roads remained long after use (see fig. 9). Refuge staff  cited several reasons for some sites not being reclaimed, including  difficulty identifying the responsible parties, operator insolvency, potential  future use because other locations in the same field remained in operation,  and uncertainty of their authority to require operators to reclaim sites.  Finally, several states do not require operators to reverse the effects of oil  and gas activities. For instance, Texas law does not require operators to  remove all buried flowlines or access roads. Several states, such as  Oklahoma and Texas, have established programs to clean up abandoned oil  and gas sites, but funds are limited.", "Because operators do not consistently or entirely reverse environmental  damages resulting from oil and gas activities, FWS has had to clean up sites  at its expense or leave sites unreclaimed. FWS spent $387,100 to clean up  14 oil- or gas-related sites between fiscal years 1991 and 2002 and is  planning to spend an additional $108,000 at 3 sites in fiscal year 2003. These  cleanup projects included removing oil- and gas-related debris, plugging  unused gas wells, and addressing mercury contamination at 9 refuges in  Arkansas and Louisiana. Other sites remain to be addressed. There are  2,600 inactive wells on refuges, including an unknown number that have  been abandoned but not plugged, and some sites also have unused tanks,  flowlines, and debris that should be removed. The estimated cost of  cleanup at a site at Anahuac NWR is $1.1 million and currently is deferred  until fiscal year 2009. Refuge managers at some refuges we visited  expressed concern that as oil and gas production declines, operators will  abandon more infrastructure and FWS will have to reclaim these sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FWS Documentation of Environmental Effects Is Limited and Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["FWS has conducted few studies to quantify the extent of the damage  caused by oil and gas activities. FWS identifies and assesses contaminant  threats to refuges by conducting Contaminant Assessment Process (CAP)  studies and other studies of contamination. Although CAP studies are  FWS\u2019s primary formal mechanism for identifying potential sources of  contaminants on refuges, the studies do not quantify the extent of any  contamination or its biological effects. Moreover, CAP studies have not  been conducted at all refuges with oil and gas activities, including  many refuges that have significant activities. FWS established the CAP  process in 1996, and to date studies have been completed at about  193 refuges (about 34 percent of all refuges), including 67 of the  155 refuges (43 percent) with oil and gas activities. The number of refuges  with oil and gas activities that have completed CAP studies varies by  region. For instance, in Region 2, which includes Texas, 20 of 28 refuges  (71 percent) had completed CAP studies, while in Region 4, which includes  Louisiana, 11 of 45 (24 percent) had completed CAP studies. The national  coordinator for CAP said that the studies are sequenced to coincide with  each refuge\u2019s comprehensive conservation planning process, which, in  turn, is prioritized within each region based on factors including primary  threats, staffing levels, and funding. Finally, the comprehensiveness of the  studies varies widely. The CAP for Kenai NWR lists over 330 known spills  and describes other potential contamination sources from oil and gas  activities. In contrast, the CAP study for Deep Fork NWR did not list oil and  gas activities as a potential source of contamination, even though there are  over 360 wells on the refuge and the refuge\u2019s comprehensive conservation  plan previously identified concerns over oil and gas activities, including  unplugged wells. The CAP program manager stated that, in this case,  FWS staff did not follow the procedures established in the CAP manual,  which requires that all potential sources of contamination be identified.", "If contaminants are identified at a refuge, FWS may conduct additional  studies through its contaminants program. Since 1988, FWS has funded  at least 33 studies at 47 national wildlife refuges nationwide that have  examined the effects of oil and gas activities. The scope of the studies  ranged from general investigations to document the presence and  concentration of a variety of contaminants, including those associated  with oil and gas activities, to specific studies to examine the impact of  oil and gas activities on particular refuges. In some cases, contamination  concerns identified in a general investigation may lead to a more detailed  study. For instance, a contaminants survey at Hagerman NWR identified  contaminants from oil and gas activities, but the survey was insufficient  to determine the effects on fish and wildlife. A later study determined  that brine and oil contaminant levels did not appear to be of concern.", "In addition to conducting its own studies, FWS uses studies conducted by  other government agencies and universities, in some cases at its request.  For instance, the U.S. Geological Survey is studying the effects of a 3-D  seismic study at Sabine NWR to determine the long-term effects of seismic  activities on refuge plant species, and Drexel University is studying the  impact of an oil spill on wildlife at John Heinz NWR, including any effects  on a rare turtle species.", "The lack of information on the effects of oil and gas activities on refuge  wildlife hinders FWS\u2019s ability to identify and obtain appropriate mitigation  measures and to require responsible parties to address damages from  past activities. For instance, the Chief, Division of Environmental Quality,  stated that FWS does not always know the effects of oil and gas activities  on wildlife or habitat and, therefore, does not know what actions should  be required of operators to reduce those effects. Lack of sufficient  information has also hindered FWS\u2019s efforts to identify all locations  with past oil and gas activities and to require responsible parties to  address damages. FWS does not know the number or location of all  abandoned wells and other oil and gas infrastructure or the threat of  contamination they pose and, therefore, its ability to require responsible  parties to address damages is limited. While recognizing the value of this  type of information, the Chief, Division of Environmental Quality, said that  in some cases FWS lacked the budget to fund environmental studies and  that, in other cases, the cost of obtaining the information was  disproportionate to its management value. In those cases where FWS  has performed studies, the information has proved valuable. For example,  FWS funded a study at some refuges in Oklahoma and Texas to inventory  locations containing oil and gas infrastructure, to determine if they were  closed legally, and to document their present condition. FWS intends to  use this information to identify cleanup options with state and federal  regulators. If this effort is successful, FWS may conduct similar studies on  other refuges. In other cases, refuges have requested studies that have not  been funded. For instance, proposals to examine the effects of oil and gas  activities on a wetland management district in Montana and to identify  unknown oil and gas locations at Kenai NWR have not been approved, in  part, due to lack of funds. In the case of Kenai NWR, refuge staff said that  current operators may be responsible for cleaning up historic sites but that  FWS had to identify the sites before it could make this determination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FWS Management and Oversight of Oil and Gas Activities Varies Widely", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019s management and oversight of oil and gas activities varies widely  from refuge to refuge. Effectively managing these activities across the  refuge system would entail, at a minimum, identifying the risks posed by  the activities, establishing operating conditions to minimize damages, and  monitoring the activities with trained staff to ensure compliance. While  some refuges have adopted comprehensive management and oversight  practices, others have done little. Variation in refuges\u2019 management and  oversight of oil and gas activities stems from differences in FWS\u2019s  regulatory authority depending upon the nature of the mineral rights and  from inadequate guidance, resources, and training for refuge staff. In  addition, on a related management issue, FWS\u2019s policy requiring a complete  and thorough assessment of potentially contaminated property prior to  acquisition is not always adhered to because of inconsistent interpretation  of the requirements by FWS, placing the federal government at risk of  assuming unknown cleanup costs in the future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management and Oversight Varies Among Refuges", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019s objective in managing oil and gas on refuge lands is to protect  wildlife habitat and other resources while allowing oil and gas operators  to exercise their mineral rights. Meeting this objective requires basic  management controls. Under the Federal Manager\u2019s Financial Integrity  Act of 1982, we have issued management control standards that apply  to all federal agencies. These standards require agencies to identify risks,  develop procedures to protect against these risks, and monitor adherence  to the procedures. For refuges, doing so would mean identifying the nature  and extent of oil and gas activities on a refuge and the risks they pose to  refuge resources, adopting risk-reduction procedures such as issuing  access permits with conditions to protect refuge resources and securing  financial assurance that reclamation will occur, and overseeing oil and gas  operations with trained and dedicated staff to ensure compliance with laws  and permits.", "The refuges we examined varied in the extent to which they identified  risks, adopted procedures to minimize those risks, and monitored oil and  gas activities. First, some refuge staff did not have complete information on  the extent of oil and gas activities occurring on their refuges. For example,  at Deep Fork NWR refuge staff estimated that there were 600 or more  abandoned wells but knew the location of very few of these wells. Further,  as noted earlier, only 67 of the 155 refuges with oil and gas activities and  10 of the 16 refuges we visited (see table 6) had completed CAP studies  identifying the possible sources and types of contamination on the refuges.  In contrast, at Kenai NWR refuge staff had detailed information on oil and  gas wells and activities on the refuge, had completed an exhaustive CAP  study, and was completing an Environmental Impact Statement on the  effects of oil and gas activities.", "Second, permits, which grant oil and gas operators access to specified  areas of a refuge and contain conditions to protect refuge resources, such  as seasonal or vehicle restrictions, to protect air quality, soil, water and  wildlife habitat, were applied to varying degrees at 11 of the 16 refuges we  visited. FWS can require permits if the mineral rights are federally owned,  the property deed allows it to, or the operator voluntarily agreed to one.  In the other five cases, refuge staff did not believe they had authority to  require permits. In addition, five refuges obtained financial assurance in  the form of bonds for the future costs of reclamation, or rely on bonds  administered by another federal agency. The other 11 refuges rely instead  on state bonds, which are allowed under FWS guidance, but may provide  different degrees of financial assurance than federal bonds. For example,  the bonds in some states may or may not cover damages caused by oil  and gas activities if the effects are considered to be reasonable impacts  to the land. Reasonable impacts are not consistently defined among  states because impacts to property are determined by what is usual and  customary practice in the area.", "Finally, we found little correlation between the scale of oil and gas  activities on refuges and the presence of dedicated staff to oversee them.  Two of the refuges we visited have a fully dedicated staff person to oversee  oil and gas operators\u2014two of the only three in the entire refuge system.  These two refuges in Louisiana collect fees from operators to help pay for  these staff. In contrast, refuges with greater levels of activity do not have  dedicated staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FWS\u2019s Authority to Require Permits Varies, Depending on the Nature of the Mineral Rights", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019s legal authority to require oil and gas operators to obtain permits  varies considerably, depending upon the nature of the mineral rights.  Permits granting access to specified areas of a refuge can be used to  establish reasonable operating conditions for private mineral owners to  exercise their rights while protecting refuge resources. Variation in  authority to require such permits, and the uncertainty that this sometimes  creates among refuge staff, partly accounts for differences in management  and oversight we found at refuges. At one end of the spectrum, FWS has  broad authority to deny or regulate access to oil and gas on wildlife refuges  when the federal government owns the mineral rights. Under Department  of the Interior regulations, access to federal mineral rights  underlying refuges requires the approval of the Secretary of the Interior  with the concurrence of FWS as to the time, place, and nature of the  activities. These regulations also prohibit leasing of federal minerals  on refuges outside of Alaska, except in cases where federal minerals are  being drained by operations on property adjacent to the refuges.", "In contrast, FWS\u2019s authority is not nearly as broad or as clear with respect  to private owners of mineral rights. FWS\u2019s authority to require permits from  private mineral owners depends on the nature of the private rights and, in  some cases, whether the property deed contains specific language. Private  mineral rights may be either \u201creserved\u201d or \u201coutstanding.\u201d Reserved rights  are created when the property owner retains the mineral rights at the time  that the surface property is transferred to the federal government.  Outstanding rights are created when the mineral rights are severed from  the surface lands prior to the surface property\u2019s transfer to the federal  government and, thus, a third party owns the rights. FWS\u2019s authority to  regulate oil and gas activities of private owners of reserved mineral rights is  limited under current law. The Department of the Interior takes the  position, with which we agree, that FWS can require permits for reserved  rights only if the deed transferring surface ownership to the federal  government contains language that subjects these rights to permitting  requirements. The department\u2019s position was first expressed in a 1986  opinion by the Office of the Solicitor, which, that office recently advised  us, continues to reflect the department\u2019s position. The department\u2019s  position is largely based on a section of the Migratory Bird Conservation  Act that makes reserved rights subject to government regulation if the deed  includes specific requirements, such as permitting requirements, or states  that the rights are subject to regulations prescribed by the Department  \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d Any expansion of FWS\u2019s authority over the owners  of reserved mineral rights, to include cases in which deeds do not contain  such provisions, would thus require a change in the law.", "By contrast, it does not appear that the Department of the Interior has  taken a formal position, and the Solicitor\u2019s Office recently declined to take  a position, regarding FWS\u2019s authority to require a permit for private owners  of outstanding mineral rights. The Solicitor\u2019s Office advised us that it would  only provide an opinion on FWS\u2019s authority over outstanding mineral rights  if FWS requested one. Nonetheless, we believe that FWS has broad general  authority, similar to that of the Forest Service and the National Park  Service, to require owners exercising outstanding mineral rights to obtain permits that contain conditions to protect a refuge and its wildlife. Both  amendments to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act  of 1966 (1966 Act) and court decisions since the department issued its  1986 opinion support this conclusion. The National Wildlife System  Improvement Act of 1997 (1997 Act) amended the 1966 Act to provide  for a more effective process for determining which secondary uses would  be compatible with refuges and to allow refuges to be managed more like  national forests and parks. The 1997 Act established as a mission of the  National Wildlife Refuge System \u201cconservation, management, and where  appropriate, restoration of [fish and wildlife] for the benefit of present and  future generations of Americans.\u201d In separate cases involving the Forest  Service and the National Park Service, federal courts relied on language  similar to that in the 1997 Act to find that these agencies had authority to  require private owners of outstanding mineral rights to obtain permits  before conducting oil and gas activities. We believe the same conclusion  follows with respect to FWS\u2019s authority.", "As a result of these differences in legal authority, there is a considerable  gap in FWS\u2019s management and oversight of oil and gas activities, but  neither FWS nor we know precisely at how many refuges this is occurring.  Because some refuges may consist of hundreds of individual deeds, it is not  possible without considerable investigation to determine the relative  prevalence of reserved and outstanding mineral rights or the extent to  which property deeds allow FWS to require owners of reserved mineral  rights to obtain a permit, according to FWS officials. FWS officials also said  that differences in FWS\u2019s authority to require permits do not provide for a  consistent way of managing and overseeing oil and gas activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Refuges Lack Sufficient Guidance, Resources, and Training to Manage and Oversee Oil and Gas Activities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to FWS\u2019s inconsistent or undefined authority to require permits  and oversee oil and gas activities, FWS cannot improve its management  and oversight of those activities without better guidance, resources, and  training. According to refuge managers and officials in the Department of  the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, national guidance is insufficient for  refuge staff to know what authority they have to manage oil and gas  activities, or how to carry out that authority. To supplement the national  guidance, three of FWS\u2019s seven regions have developed more detailed  guidance to assist in managing and overseeing oil and gas activities. For  instance, while the national guidance describes only FWS\u2019s authority to  require permits, guidance in Regions 2 and 6 provides specific examples of  conditions the refuge manager should include in a permit to protect refuge  resources. Staff at Sabine NWR have also drafted, in conjunction with  headquarters staff, more detailed national guidance on managing and  overseeing oil and gas activities, including a detailed description of FWS\u2019s  authority to require permits and many specific conditions to include in  permits. However, FWS has not approved this draft guidance.", "Refuge staff we interviewed also cited a lack of staff resources as an  obstacle to properly managing oil and gas activities because staff do not  have time to become familiar with federal and state laws or manage and  oversee oil and gas operations. For example, when FWS purchased  property for Deep Fork NWR, the property deed contained assurances that  FWS would be able to issue permits governing private mineral rights, yet  that information was never conveyed to refuge staff. To determine FWS\u2019s  permitting authority, refuge staff would have to research each individual  property deed. Refuge staff said that they do not have time to do this  research because they must address other management concerns, such as  law enforcement. In contrast, Sabine NWR has a staff person dedicated to  managing oil and gas activities. As a result, this person has sufficient time  to become familiar with applicable laws and to work with operators and  state regulators to manage and oversee oil and gas activities to reduce their  effects on the refuge. This oversight has encouraged the operator to  identify and restore sites damaged by past oil and gas activities.", "Refuges that have access to their own funding mechanisms to recover  damages are better able to manage and oversee oil and gas activities. It is  standard industry practice for operators\u2019 conducting seismic activities to  pay exploratory fees to surface landowners. However, only refuges in  Louisiana and Texas have authority to assess and retain such fees to  cover potential damages caused by seismic activity. Refuges in  Louisiana routinely collect these fees to aid management and oversight  and fund restoration efforts, but Region 2 has retained existing policy  preventing refuges in Texas from assessing these fees. To address this  lack of consistency, FWS headquarters officials told us they are drafting  guidance to clarify how these regions should apply their authority to collect  and retain fees. One of the refuges that collects these fees is Sabine NWR,  which uses these fees to fund a staff person specifically dedicated to the  management and oversight of oil and gas activities and to fund mitigation  projects to reduce the effect of oil and gas operations. Figure 10 shows a  recent mitigation project, funded by oil and gas operators at Sabine NWR,  that is designed to restore a marsh damaged by saltwater intrusion due in  part to earlier oil and gas activities. Officials in the Department of the  Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor support the use of fees as a more efficient  mechanism than litigation to compensate for damages.", "Trained staff are integral to effective oversight, yet refuge staff we met with  said their principal duties and training as wildlife managers do not prepare  them for managing oil and gas activities. FWS has offered only one  workshop in the last 10 years for refuge staff nationwide that is specific to  managing oil and gas activities on refuges. This 3-day workshop in June  2001, attended by 36 FWS officials, provided information on possible  sources of spills, effects of oil on wildlife, enforcement avenues, and  damage recovery; however, there was limited discussion of FWS\u2019s  regulatory authority. Refuge staff lack training on standard industry  practices, state and federal laws, and identification of oil- and gas-related  problems. For example, at Atchafalaya NWR, the refuge manager has not  been able to enforce special use permits, citing a lack of training about  applicable state and federal laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquired Property Is Not Always Adequately Assessed for Contamination", "paragraphs": ["FWS has not always thoroughly assessed property for possible  contamination from oil and gas activities prior to its acquisition.

Some regions consistently conduct adequate assessments,  while other regions\u2019 investigations are not as thorough. For example,  Region 6 assesses both the subsurface and surface properties for  contamination, even when acquiring only the surface portion. In two  cases, Region 6 did not acquire property, even when offered as a  donation, because of subsurface contamination from oil and gas activities.  In contrast, FWS Regions 2, 3, and 4 do not always thoroughly investigate  all properties for contamination prior to acquisition. For example, not  examining the subsurface soils for contamination or investigating further  if there is some indication of the presence of contaminants.

At the Patoka River NWR in Indiana (Region 3), during an  acquisition, FWS staff conducted an initial contamination investigation  and used a state certification of well closure as assurance that the land  was cleaned and closed and did not investigate further, even though they  were aware that the land had contained oil wells and an oil storage facility.  After acquiring the property, FWS found that large amounts of soil were  contaminated with oil.

While federally  owned mineral rights underlying refuge lands are generally not available  for oil and gas exploration and production, that prohibition does not  extend to the many private parties that own mineral rights underlying  refuge lands. The scale of these activities on refuges is such that some  refuge resources have been diminished, although the extent is unknown  without additional study.", "Some refuges have adopted practices\u2014for example, developing data  on the nature and extent of activities and their effects on the refuge,  overseeing oil and gas operators, and training refuge staff to better  carry out their management and oversight responsibilities\u2014that limit  the impact of these activities on refuge resources. If these practices were  implemented throughout the agency, they could provide better assurance  that environmental effects from oil and gas activities are minimized. In  particular, in some cases, refuges have issued permits that establish  operating conditions for oil and gas activities, giving the refuges greater  control over these activities and protecting refuge resources before  damage occurs. However, FWS does not have a policy requiring owners  of outstanding mineral rights to obtain a permit, although we believe  FWS has this authority, and FWS can require owners of reserved mineral  rights to obtain a permit if the property deed subjects the rights to such  requirements. Expanding or confirming FWS\u2019s authority to require  reasonable permit conditions and oversee oil and gas activities, including  cases where mineral rights have been reserved and the property deed does  not already subject the rights to permit requirements, would strengthen  and provide greater consistency in FWS\u2019s management and oversight. Such  a step could be done without infringing on the rights of private mineral  owners.

The comments of the department as expressed by the Acting Assistant  Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks were mixed. The department  agreed that FWS\u2019s acquisition policy and guidance should be improved.  However, the department was silent on our recommendations that the FWS  should collect and maintain better data on oil and gas activities and their  effects and that it should ensure that staff are adequately trained to oversee  oil and gas activities. We continue to believe these recommendations are  still warranted. The department did raise a concern in regards to two of  our recommendations. First, the department questioned whether hiring  additional dedicated staff would be the most cost-effective solution to  improving oversight. However, the department apparently misinterpreted  our recommendation for FWS to determine what level of staffing necessary  to oversee these activities as a call to hire additional dedicated staff. If the  department determines that there are more cost-effective means to ensure  adequate staffing, such as the use of contractors or temporary staff, it could  pursue those actions and be responsive to this recommendation. Second,  while the department was silent on whether it would review the FWS\u2019s  authority to regulate surface access to refuges for owners of outstanding  mineral rights, the department did raise concerns about GAO\u2019s  recommendation that it seek additional authority from Congress to  regulate reserved mineral rights. According to the department, it would be  unconstitutional for it (as an executive branch department) to make such  a request to Congress, because doing so would infringe upon the  President\u2019s authority to recommend legislation to Congress under the  U.S. Constitution\u2019s Recommendations Clause. We fully anticipated in  making this draft recommendation that the department would coordinate  its legislative proposals with the President. In order to make this explicit,  we clarified the recommendation to recognize that the department  should coordinate its legislative request to Congress through appropriate  Administration officials, including those within the Executive Office of  the President.", "Further, as a legal matter, while the Recommendations Clause explicitly  provides for the President to make recommendations to Congress, it  does not deny that same freedom to others.

The department asked that  we cite the source for this characterization and include additional  clarification and explanation of the effect of oil and gas activities on the  condor reintroduction program at this refuge. FWS itself, in 1980, made the  determination that 70 percent of critical condor habitat was lost due to oil  and gas development at Hopper Mountain NWR. However, this calculation  included both refuge and off-refuge lands. Considering only refuge lands,  lost habitat totaled 63 percent and the report has been revised accordingly.", "In an attachment to the letter, the Department of the Interior raised  three additional concerns with our report. These involve our  characterizations of FWS\u2019s land acquisition practices, our inclusion of oil  and gas pipelines in the scope of the report, and the significance of  problems associated with oil and gas activities. First, FWS concurred that  its acquisition policy and guidance could be improved and that regional  implementation has at times been inadequate. Nevertheless, FWS took  exception to our citing problems we found at Patoka River NWR and with  that region\u2019s adherence to established policy in conducting its site  assessment. However, our review clearly indicated that the FWS failed to  conduct additional contamination investigation of lands that FWS officials  knew had supported oil and gas extraction and storage, as required by their  policy. As a result, the FWS acquired lands that are contaminated and has  incurred expenses to remediate that contamination.", "Second, the department\u2019s Office of the Solicitor raised a concern that  including oil and gas pipelines as an oil and gas activity overstates the  prevalence of oil and gas activities. We disagree; pipeline leaks have  contributed to refuge contamination and affected refuge operations in  other ways. We believe that inclusion of oil and gas pipelines on refuges is  an important factor in assessing the overall scale of oil and gas activities  on refuges. Nevertheless, we have added additional information to the  report that allows readers to differentiate among the types of activities  on refuges, including pipelines.", "Third, the department\u2019s Office of Policy Analysis expressed the view that  our reporting of refuge-based oil and gas activities not previously known to  FWS overstated the problem because we did not link these activities to  \u201csignificant detrimental\u201d effects. The department also suggested that any  problems associated with oil and gas activities on refuges should be  considered relative to other problems faced by these refuges. However, our  report already states that FWS has not conducted a cumulative assessment  of the effects of oil and gas activities on individual refuges or the refuge  system as a whole. Identifying the presence of these activities should be the  first step toward any such assessment. Comparing these impacts relative to  other threats to refuges is outside the scope of this report.", "Finally, the department included a number of technical comments from the  FWS and various department offices that have been incorporated within  the report as appropriate.

FWS\u2019s  authority over owners of outstanding mineral rights is limited in the sense  that FWS\u2019s regulations do not currently require permits. Two of FWS\u2019s  sister land management agencies\u2014the National Park Service and the  United States Forest Service\u2014have regulations that require outstanding  mineral rights owners to obtain permits before engaging in oil and gas  activities on federal lands they manage. FWS, on the other hand, has no  such regulations. As discussed below, while it appears that the Department  of the Interior has not taken a formal position on whether FWS has legal  authority to promulgate such regulations, we conclude it has such  authority, under its statutes and related case law.", "Privately owned mineral rights within wildlife refuges may be \u201creserved\u201d or \u201coutstanding.\u201d  Reserved mineral rights are those that were reserved by the owner when ownership of the  surface land was transferred to the federal government. Outstanding mineral rights are  those that were reserved before the surface was transferred to the federal government, and  thus are owned by someone other than the party making the transfer to the government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reserved Rights", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Interior believes, and we agree, that FWS has legal  authority to require private owners of reserved mineral rights located  within \u201cacquired federal refuges\u201d to obtain \u201centry permits\u201d only in limited  circumstances, in order to obtain access to the refuge for minerals  exploration and removal. The department\u2019s position was originally set out  in a 1986 legal opinion issued by the department\u2019s Office of the Solicitor  (1986 Opinion), and the office recently advised us that the 1986 Opinion  continues to reflect the department\u2019s position. The 1986 Opinion concluded  that FWS generally lacks statutory or other authority to require entry  permits for reserved rights owners and can do so only when the deed  transferring the surface property to the federal government has included  either specific permitting requirements or language subjecting the exercise  of the reserved mineral rights to regulations promulgated by the  department, including permitting regulations. The department\u2019s position is  based on language in the Migratory Bird Conservation Act that was added  by amendment in 1935, making reserved rights subject to requirements  specifically set out in the deed or, if the deed so states, to regulations  prescribed \u201cfrom time to time\u201d by the Secretary of the Interior. If the deed  does not contain such provisions, the exercise of the reserved rights cannot  be subjected to permitting requirements.", "As the 1986 Opinion explains, prior to the 1935 amendment, the Migratory  Bird Conservation Act had made all reserved rights subject to regulations  that were prescribed by the department \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d The House  Report associated with the 1935 amendment explains that \u201csome owners of  very desirable tracts are unwilling to convey  on such indefinite  and uncertain terms as regulations made \u2018from time to time.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 The purpose  of the change was to provide those who reserved rights in lands they  transferred to the United States with some contractual certainty, and to  protect them from being required to abide by permitting regulations that  were not in effect when the deed was issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outstanding Rights", "paragraphs": ["The foregoing limits in the Migratory Bird Conservation Act on how the  department may regulate reserved mineral rights do not apply to the  department\u2019s regulation of outstanding mineral rights. A number of other  legal authorities in related areas indicate, in our view, that FWS has  statutory authority to regulate the exercise of outstanding mineral rights on  federal lands.", "In Dunn McCampbell Royalty Interest, Inc. v. National Park Service,  964 F. Supp. 1125 (S.D. Tex. 1995), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 112 F.3d 1283  (5th Cir. 1997), the court ruled that the National Park Service has authority  to reasonably regulate private owners\u2019 access to their oil and gas interests  located beneath park system lands, by requiring approval of a plan of  operations before commencement of exploration or production activities.  The court relied on language in the National Park Service Organic Act  directing the Park Service to \u201cprotect and regulate\u201d national parks so as to  \u201cconserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife  therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and  by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future  generations,\u201d as well as language directing the Department of the Interior to issue regulations \u201cas . . . deem necessary or proper for the use of the  parks . . . under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.\u201d", "Similarly, in Duncan Energy Co. v. United States Forest Service,  50 F.3d 584 (8th Cir. 1995), the Eighth Circuit court ruled that although the  Forest Service may not completely deny access to private owners of  mineral interests located within National Forest System lands, the Forest  Service may impose reasonable conditions on the use of the federally  owned surface and thus may require mineral owners to obtain approval  before exploring for or developing minerals. The court relied on language  in the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act that directs the Department of  Agriculture (the Forest Service\u2019s parent agency) \u201cto develop a program of  land conservation and land utilization\u201d and to issue regulations necessary  to \u201cregulate the use and occupancy of property acquired [for the National  Forest System] in order to conserve and utilize it.\u201d The court also relied  on the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cspecial use\u201d regulations providing that \u201cll uses of  National Forest System lands . . . are designated \u2018special uses\u2019 [and must be  approved by an] authorized officer.", "The statutes addressed in Dunn McCampbell and Duncan bear a number  of similarities to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act  (Refuge System Administration Act), which governs the National Wildlife  Refuge System. Notably, language added to the Refuge System  Administration Act by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement  Act of 1997 is very similar to the language of the National Park Service  Organic Act relied upon by the Dunn McCampbell court. As amended in  1997, the Refuge System Administration Act now provides that the mission  of the NWRS is to administer lands for the \u201cconservation, management, and  where appropriate, restoration of  for the benefit of  present and future generations of Americans\u201d and directs the Secretary of  the Interior to \u201censure that the biological integrity, diversity, and  environmental health of the System are maintained for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.\u201d The Refuge System  Administration Act also explicitly authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  issue regulations to carry out the act. Similarly, as in the statute relied on  by the Duncan court regarding the Forest Service\u2019s permitting authority,  the 1997 amendments to the Refuge System Administration Act added  language directing the Secretary of the Interior to \u201cprovide for the  conservation of fish, wildlife, and plants, and their habitats within the   System.\u201d", "Thus, as with the statutes at issue in Dunn McCampbell and Duncan, the  1997 amendments to the Refuge System Administration Act authorize the  Department of the Interior to manage the National Wildlife Refuge System  with the same type of policy direction and management standards with  which the Park System and the Forest System are managed, including  issuance of permitting regulations. The legislative history of the Refuge  System Administration Act confirms Congress\u2019s concern for ecosystem and  fish and wildlife conservation and for ensuring that uses of the refuges are  compatible with their purposes. Although neither the Administration Act\u2019s  1997 amendments nor their legislative history specifically refers to  regulation of the activities of private oil and gas operators, the overriding  purpose of the amendments\u2014providing better management to protect  the refuges\u2014together with the reasoning of the courts addressing similar  statutes in Dunn McCampbell and Duncan indicate that FWS has current  authority to require private owners of outstanding mineral rights to obtain  permits before conducting oil and gas operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify the nature and extent of oil and gas activities resident within  the National Wildlife System, we relied on several sources of information.  We began with our 2001 report, which identified 77 units with oil and  gas activities based on the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s reported activities  in the year 2000. We used the same information source, FWS\u2019s Refuge  Management Information System (RMIS), and reviewed exploration,  production, and pipeline activities for the years 1994-2001. This  information is self-reported by refuges and, by FWS officials\u2019 admission,  incomplete. In addition, RMIS does not indicate the scale of activities  present on a refuge\u2014for example, whether there is one well or hundreds  of wells. Therefore, we contracted Premier Data Services of Englewood,  Colorado, to provide more accurate and comprehensive data on the extent  and type of oil and gas activities occurring on refuges. Premier maintains  a national database of oil and gas wells collected from well permit data  compiled by each state\u2019s oil and gas regulators. Premier recently  contributed to a study for the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, and  Energy under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, providing a  comprehensive review of oil and gas resources and constraints on their  development in five basins in the interior West.", "To determine the number of wells residing on FWS lands, Premier  compared a county-by-county listing of wells against a list of counties with  refuge system lands provided by FWS. For those refuges in counties with at  least one well, Premier either obtained digital maps of the refuges\u2019 current  land status from FWS or, in those cases where FWS had not digitized the  refuge boundaries, converted paper maps into digital format. Premier then  overlaid the geographic plots of wells nationwide with the digitized maps  to identify wells within refuge boundaries and to identify wells within  \u00bd mile outside the boundaries. (See fig. 11 for a sample plot of the Butte  Sink Wildlife Management Area.) In addition to obtaining information on  the location of oil and gas wells, we also obtained information on the  status, type, and amount of production of oil, gas, and water (brine) from  each well. We eliminated from the database permitted wells that were not  drilled, while wells with any production in the most recent reporting period  we categorized as active; all other wells we categorized as inactive.", "To identify pipelines transiting refuge lands, we relied on the National  Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS), which is maintained by the Office of  Pipeline Safety in the Department of Transportation and on FWS\u2019s RMIS.  We overlaid the NPMS data on the 138 refuges for which we had digital  refuge boundary data because they also had wells inside or just outside  their boundaries. The FWS had not finished digitizing refuge maps for the  other refuges in the system. NPMS is based on data reported to the Office  of Pipeline Safety by pipeline owners. NPMS includes 99 percent of the  nation\u2019s hazardous liquids (including oil and other petroleum products)  pipelines and 61 percent of natural gas pipelines in the United States.", "NPMS does not include local gathering lines or pumping and storage  facilities that supplement these lines. To supplement this information, we  included refuges identified in RMIS as having transit pipelines. However,  there may be other refuges with pipelines, not recorded in NPMS, RMIS, or  for which we did not have digital maps.", "As part of FWS\u2019s review of this report, they identified additional refuges  that may have oil and gas activities or updated the status of activities at  the refuges listed, but did not offer corroborating documentation. While  this information may have been more current than the Premier or the  Department of Transportation databases, we chose to keep these data  intact and did not make additional adjustments.", "We attempted to identify information regarding the overall environmental  effects of oil and gas activities on national wildlife refuges. However,  because FWS had conducted few studies and did not have information  regarding what the overall environmental effects of oil and gas activities  on refuges were and how those effects have changed over time, we  selected at least one refuge in each of FWS\u2019s seven regions for physical  inspection. In making these selections, we attempted to choose a cross  section of refuges considering the type and scale of oil and gas activities,  range of environmental effects, and extent and type of management and  oversight. In total, we visited 16 refuges containing 1,510 active and 2,695  total oil and gas wells, about 84 percent and 61 percent, respectively, of all  oil and gas wells we identified on refuges. For a complete list of refuges we  visited, see appendix II. At each refuge visited, we asked the refuge  manager to describe the effects of oil and gas activities on the refuge,  obtained any available studies of these effects, and visited locations of oil  and gas activity selected by the refuge manager to represent a range of  effects. In addition, we contacted state regulators and industry and  environmental representatives and reviewed state laws, FWS contaminant  reports, and scientific and industry and environmental group reports. To  identify reclamation and remediation performed at the refuges visited, we  reviewed files at each refuge, discussed actions taken with refuge officials,  and reviewed information FWS provided from its cleanup and maintenance  databases. To identify steps FWS has taken to document the environmental  effect on refuge resources, we reviewed Contaminant Assessment Program  studies and additional information FWS provided from its contaminants  database. We also discussed these efforts with FWS officials.", "To assess FWS\u2019s management and oversight of oil and gas activities in the  National Wildlife Refuge System, we obtained information on policy,  guidance, and practices from headquarters and the seven regional offices  and documented the actual practices in use at the 16 refuges we visited.  To determine the authority of the FWS to require private mineral owners  to obtain permits containing conditions to protect refuge resources from  damage and to oversee oil and gas activities, we obtained information  from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and reviewed  the laws and regulations pertaining to the FWS and other federal land  management agencies and recent court cases concerning private mineral  rights on federal lands. We also identified the type and amount of training  the FWS staff had received and reviewed mechanisms for funding positions  to manage and oversee oil and gas activities. In addition, we interviewed  officials and obtained documentation on FWS\u2019s coordination with, and the  involvement of, other federal and state agencies in the oversight of oil and  gas activities on refuges. Finally, we reviewed the acquisition policies and  practices used by FWS for adding lands to the refuge system, especially  those that contain current or historical oil and gas activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Interior and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
