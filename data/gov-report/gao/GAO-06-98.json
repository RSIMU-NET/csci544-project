The Valles Caldera Trust (Trust), a wholly owned government corporation, is to become financially self-sustaining and to manage the Caldera for multiple purposes while sustaining the land's valuable natural resources. GAO was mandated to assess the progress the Trust is making in meeting its statutory goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Trust has made progress in meeting its goals to preserve and protect the Caldera for future generations as well as to provide for public recreation and sustained yield management. Specifically, it has (1) established a basic organization with about 25 staff; (2) drafted policy and procedures and contracted with the Department of the Interior's National Business Center for accounting services; (3) begun engineering and construction efforts to address infrastructure problems--roads, water systems, fences, and buildings; (4) established interim grazing and recreation programs; and (5) implemented an adaptive management approach that focuses on making management decisions based on scientific data. The Trust, however, still has much work to do to meet its goals, including achieving a financially self-sustaining operation. Strategic and performance plans with measurable goals and objectives: For example, the Trust must decide on the level of activities (e.g., grazing, hiking, and hunting) that will be allowed without seriously harming the land's resources, and yet will still provide sufficient recreational activity and sustained yield management. The Trust also must select additional opportunities for generating revenues, such as securing private donations. Plans to manage program risks: The Trust has not addressed program risks, including fire and legal liabilities. For example, the Trust lacks a fire plan, which would outline a decision-making process for responding to fires, and has not obtained liability coverage. Because it did not have a fire plan, the Trust spent about $338,000 in May 2005 to suppress a fire, which, in the opinion of the Forest Service Region 3 Fire Manager, could have been left to burn because the fire did not threaten any key resources or public infrastructure. Also, because it has not obtained liability coverage, the Trust has restricted the number of Caldera visitors. Mechanisms for monitoring progress: Among other things, the Trust has not had annual financial audits and has not prepared performance reports that would help it assess its progress toward meeting its financial and other goals. The Trust's efforts to raise the revenues needed to bring it closer to meeting its financial self-sustainability goal could be undermined by one or more of these issues. Frequent turnover in Board members and key staff has contributed to the problems experienced to date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Valles Caldera Preservation Act (Preservation Act) of 2000 authorized  the federal government\u2019s purchase of about 89,000 acres of privately owned  land in north-central New Mexico, known as the Baca Ranch.  The federal  government acquired this property, referred to as the Valles Caldera  (Caldera) for about $97 million. Scientifically, the Caldera has served as a  model for geological studies of this and other volcanic areas around the  world. Culturally and historically, the Caldera has had religious significance  for Native Americans since prehistoric times because of its plentiful water  resources in an otherwise arid region and because it provided a major  source of black volcanic glass (obsidian), which was widely used for tools  and weapons. Recreationally, the Caldera\u2019s landscape is noted for its  opportunities for hiking, cross-country skiing, backpacking, bicycling,  hunting, and fishing. Commercially, it provides ranchers with forage for  livestock. Since the Caldera\u2019s acquisition through fiscal year 2005, the  Valles Caldera Trust (Trust), established under the Preservation Act, has  received about $16 million in federal funding to operate and maintain the  Caldera.", "As stated in the Preservation Act, the Trust is to be governed by a Board of  Trustees (Board) responsible for managing the Caldera as a national  preserve. Until the Trust could be organized, however, management of the  Caldera was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest  Service. The Secretary of Agriculture was to transfer management  responsibility to the Trust once the Board was able to conduct business and  provide for essential management services. The transfer occurred in  August 2002. The Preservation Act also charged the Trust with managing  the land to achieve a number of goals, including the following:  protecting and preserving the Caldera\u2019s scientific, scenic, historic, and  natural values, including rivers and ecosystems, and archaeological,  geological, and cultural resources for future generations;  providing opportunities for public recreation;  providing for sustained yield management of the ranch for timber  production and domesticated livestock grazing insofar as those were  consistent with its other responsibilities; and   becoming financially self-sustaining within 15 years of the purchase  date\u2014that is, by 2015.", "The Preservation Act also established the Trust as a wholly owned  government corporation subject to the Government Corporation Control  Act (Control Act).  The Trust is also subject to the Government  Performance and Results Act (Results Act).  Under the Control Act, the  Trust must obtain independent annual financial audits and report annually  to Congress. Under the Results Act, the Trust must prepare a strategic plan  and an annual performance plan with measurable goals and objectives, and  submit annual performance reports to Congress and the President.", "The Preservation Act requires GAO to provide two reports to Congress on  the Trust\u2019s activities: an interim report 3 years after the Trust assumed  management responsibility and a final report 4 years later. For this interim  report, we examined the (1) Trust\u2019s accomplishments since its inception  and (2) work that remains for the Trust in order to meet its goals under the  act, including the goal of becoming financially self-sustaining.", "To address these issues, we analyzed information and interviewed officials  from the Forest Service and the Trust on the programs and activities the  Trust has initiated since assuming management of the Caldera. We also  analyzed documents, financial records, and other information, and visited  the site to observe the actions taken to date toward meeting the Trust\u2019s  statutory obligations. In addition, we analyzed the requirements of the  Control Act and the Results Act for government corporations. The financial  statements of the Trust have not been independently audited. We  conducted limited testing of these data and discussed these data with key  Trust officials. We describe issues related to these financial data in the  body of this report. We assessed and determined that the nonfinancial data,  such as participation in recreation activities and levels of livestock grazing,  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

In October 2001, the  Board hired its first employee, an executive director. During that year, the  Trust\u2019s office was located at the Santa Fe National Forest offices. The Trust  officially assumed management of the Caldera in August 2002, after it  provided for essential management services, including establishing staff,  beginning business operations, and adopting management policies and  procedures. During 2002, the Board drafted personnel and procurement  policies and procedures as well as policies for environmental protection. It  also drafted a tribal access and use policy to ensure access to the Caldera  for religious and cultural purposes, as authorized by the Preservation Act.  By the end of fiscal year 2002, the Trust had 7 employees, including  business and resource managers.

The  Trust began the rehabilitation work in 2002.", "Roads. The Caldera has an estimated 1,200 miles of roads, including 200  miles for the main access roads. Most of these roads had been constructed  with little planning or engineering and had been used to support logging  operations. They could not be readily used to support administration,  ranching, recreation, and other needs. In 2002, 3.5 miles of Road 1, the main  access road, and five key bridges were upgraded to all-weather commercial  gravel standards; work on the this road was completed in 2003. Road 2\u2014a  10.2-mile access road\u2014was upgraded in 2004 and 2005. Road work will  continue as needs are identified and resources become available.

From 2002 to 2005, the Trust  conducted minor maintenance on the ranch buildings used to house  employees. In 2002 and 2003, the Trust repaired the Caldera\u2019s 54 miles of  boundary fence and installed restricted access signs. In 2004, it assessed  the layout and condition of 64 miles of interior fences. The height of the  fences was shortened in many areas to allow for elk movement. The Trust  also installed scenic vistas and kiosks on New Mexico Highway 4, the main  access road to the Caldera, to allow public viewing of the Caldera.

The grazing program,  begun in 2002 as a 5-week drought-relief program, has been operating  under an interim livestock management plan, which is effective through  calendar year 2005. Until it can develop a more comprehensive strategy, the  Trust has established an interim grazing program that allows grazing for  between 1 and 2,000 cattle, depending on the condition of the forage.

Under the stewardship program,  which replaced the cow-calf program, applicants have to demonstrate that  they will implement projects on their own lands to improve the condition of  the range while their cattle graze on the Caldera. The largest participant in  the program, the Pueblo of Jemez, implemented major range improvements  on its own lands, such as reseeding and resting rangeland. The  Replacement Heifer Program allows ranchers to graze heifers on the  Caldera and have the heifers bred with the Trust\u2019s registered bulls, which  are certified to produce calves with low birth weights.

Recreation activities offered have included, for example,  hunting, fishing, hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, sleigh rides,  wagon rides, and horseback riding. In most cases, the Trust charged fees  for access to the Caldera. Table 2 shows the level of public participation in  the various recreation programs from calendar years 2002 through 2004.  Participation in recreation activities is expected to increase for 2005. As  shown in table 2, the Trust offered limited recreational opportunities in  2002\u2014a total of 1,920 participants. However, in 2004, participation in  recreation activities increased more than fourfold over the 2002 level. The  fishing program hosted the most visitors over the period, or approximately  26 percent of total visitors. Elk hunting/antler collection and hiking were  also popular, each representing about 21 percent of visitor participation,  followed by wagon/sleigh rides at about 15 percent.", "Fishing and fishing clinics. Two streams on the Caldera are suitable for  fishing. In 2003, the Trust granted fishing access to 1,785 participants on a  first-come, first-served basis. With increased demand in 2004, the Trust  used a lottery system to award access to 2,107 participants. In addition, the  Trust hosted youth and adult fishing clinics in both years.", "Elk hunting and antler collection. The Trust worked with the New Mexico  Department of Game and Fish to set the numbers of available elk-hunting  licenses and used a lottery and auction to award licenses. Participation in  elk hunts has declined each year because of the New Mexico Department  of Game and Fish decided to decrease the number of hunting licenses  available to sustain a viable elk herd. In addition to the elk hunt, the Trust  has offered area youth groups the opportunity to collect antlers shed by elk  each year. These groups sell the antlers, which are generally used to make  decorative items, such as lamps, and the groups use the proceeds to  support nonprofit programs.", "Hiking. Beginning in 2002, the Trust provided guided hiking through a  contractor to enable public access to the Caldera before it developed the  infrastructure needed for general public access. In 2003 and 2004, the Trust  implemented its own hiking program, expanded the activity boundaries for  hiking, and established unguided hikes as an option. In 2005, the Trust  increased the number of trails available for hikers on the Caldera. In total,  the Trust now has 24 miles of trails available for hikers.", "Wagon and sleigh rides. The Trust offered horse-drawn wagon and sleigh  rides to visitors. The horse-drawn rides allow greater access to areas in the  Caldera. Wagon rides can occur year-round, while sleigh rides, of course,  need sufficient snowfall. Participation in wagon and sleigh rides has  increased more than sixfold, from 250 in 2002 to 1,520 in 2004. Also in 2004,  the Trust donated wagon rides on the Caldera as a prize for a charity  auction.", "Other recreation. In 2003, the Trust added van tours, snowshoeing, cross- county skiing, bird watching, and stargazing lectures. In 2004, the Trust  implemented an equestrian program, so that riders could transport their  own horses to the Caldera for rides on designated trails. Over 200 riders  participated.

Under this approach, the Trust will make land  management decisions on the basis of scientific research and monitoring,  taking into account the public\u2019s views and federal environmental  requirements. The foundation of this management approach is inventorying  natural resources, monitoring environmental changes that result from the  Trust\u2019s programs, conducting research that will primarily help manage the  Caldera\u2019s resources, and complying with federal environmental  requirements.", "Inventories. Little information was available about the Caldera\u2019s resources  when the federal government acquired the Caldera. As a result, in 2001, the  Trust\u2014using volunteers and employees detailed from other federal  agencies\u2014began to inventory the Caldera\u2019s vegetation and forest, wildlife  and fisheries, geology, and other resources. Some of these baseline  inventories have several components. For example, the wildlife inventory  includes components by species, such as mammals, reptiles, and fish. Some  inventory components have been completed, while others are still ongoing  and are scheduled to be completed during 2007. Figure 6 shows the current  inventory and monitoring locations on the Caldera.", "In addition, about 5 percent of the Caldera has been surveyed for cultural  resources. As a result of recent surveys, 25 previously unknown historic  properties have been discovered. For example, scientists have identified  prehistoric sites showing evidence of toolmaking using obsidian. The  cultural inventory is ongoing, and its completion date has not been  established because future construction plans are uncertain. According to  the Caldera\u2019s cultural program coordinator, planned surveys can be delayed  because of the need to survey areas slated for construction, such as roads.", "Monitoring. The monitoring program is intended to assess the impact that  grazing, fishing, forest thinning, prescribed fire programs, and other  activities have had on the Caldera. For example, the Trust is monitoring  areas it has fenced along streambeds to prevent elk and cattle grazing in  order to better understand the impacts of grazing on areas that are not  fenced off. Figure 7 shows a fenced riparian area on the Caldera. The Trust  is also monitoring the effects of natural and nonprogrammatic factors, such  as changes in climate and species populations, especially nonnative  populations. For example, as part of this program, the Trust established  five weather stations to monitor rainfall, snowfall, wind, and temperature  as well as five stations to monitor stream water quality.", "Research. The research program benefits both the management of the  Caldera and public land management. For example, hydrological research  funded by the National Science Foundation through the University of  Arizona will provide information to aid in the day-to-day management of  the Caldera and will also contribute to the understanding of hydrologic  systems overall. This research will enable scientists to understand how  much rain the Caldera\u2019s lands absorb and predict the amount of runoff into  streams and rivers. As more data become available, scientists can predict  the impact of rain and drought on water quality and forage availability on  the Caldera and use the information to drive future management decisions  for grazing and recreation.", "Environmental compliance and public participation. The Trust must  comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which  requires federal agencies to assess the likely environmental impacts of any  major actions they propose. If the agency determines that a proposed  activity will significantly affect the quality of the human environment, it  must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). An EIS specifies,  among other things, the purpose of and need for the proposed action, its  environmental consequences, and the comparison of alternatives to the  proposal.", "Federal agencies, in addition to complying with the Council on  Environmental Quality\u2019s regulations for implementing NEPA, develop  agency-specific procedures. Before the Trust adopted its NEPA procedures  in July 2003, it used the Forest Service\u2019s procedures to ensure NEPA  compliance.  Under the Forest Service procedures, the Trust categorically  excluded interim fishing, hiking, road maintenance, and hazardous-fuel  reductions from the general requirement to develop an environmental  assessment or impact statement because it was determined that the actions  would have no significant impact on the human environment. Under the  Forest Service regulations, the Trust conducted environmental  assessments of the interim grazing, noxious-weed eradication, and  prescribed burns and did not find that these activities significantly affected  the Caldera. The Trust expects to complete an environmental impact  statement before establishing a permanent grazing program in 2007.", "The 2003 procedures are intended to efficiently and effectively implement  NEPA and create a collaborative working relationship between the Trust  and tribal governments, citizens, and federal, state, and local authorities.   To obtain public views and to track and report the Trust\u2019s land management  actions, the Trust is developing an Internet-based system\u2014the Stewardship  Action Record System (StARS). Once functional (expected at the end of  2005), StARS will allow public review and comment on all actions taken  and provide the public with opportunities to monitor the results of ongoing  efforts. StARS proposals have been developed for public recreation,  grazing, infrastructure development, research projects, and fire  management. The Trust is also exploring ways to distribute information to  the public and obtain comments without using the Internet.", "According to the President\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality, the Trust\u2019s  NEPA procedures clearly integrate progressive NEPA compliance with  principles of adaptive management and environmental management  systems.

With total revenues of about $500,000 and total  expenditures in excess of $5 million in fiscal year 2004, it is apparent that  programs were operating at a loss. The Board does not plan to change the  operation of revenue-generating programs until the Trust complies with  NEPA.", "According to the Valles Caldera National Preserve Framework and  Strategic Guidance for Comprehensive Management, the Trust considers  the financial self-sustainability goal as one of many goals of equal priority.  Furthermore, according to the framework, the Trust cannot set a date for  achieving financial self-sustainability\u2014established as a goal to be  accomplished by 2015 in the Preservation Act\u2014because its federal land  stewardship obligations do not allow it to operate grazing and recreation  activities at a level that puts natural resources at risk. Therefore, the  framework states, it may be reasonable to continue appropriations to cover  environmental stewardship costs, such as those for environmental  assessments and resources inventories, while the balance of the Trust\u2019s  programs operate in a self-sustaining manner. While financial self-  sustainability may not be attainable in the long run, we believe it is  premature to assume that appropriations will continue to be needed after  the Trust\u2019s 15th year of operation\u2014the time period established to achieve  the goal of self-sustainability. Moreover, the Trust is directed to report to  Congress in its 14th year if the achievement of self-sustainability by its 15th  year is unrealistic. In the meantime, the Trust has an obligation to continue  to develop a strategy and implement a plan to become financially self- sustaining.", "The Preservation Act also requires the Trust to report to Congress on how  and when the Trust will become financially self-sustaining. That is, the  Trust is to provide Congress with a schedule of decreasing appropriations  that demonstrates how it will achieve financially self-sustaining operations  by 2015. Such a schedule should, at a minimum, quantify the annual  appropriations as well as other projected revenue sources needed through  2015 and demonstrate that these sources of income will meet or exceed the  expected program operations and maintenance costs during that time  frame. However, the Trust has only presented the three-phased strategy  shown in table 4 to achieve that goal. As the table shows, the Trust\u2019s  Schedule of Decreasing Appropriations does not include financial  information to show how the appropriations will decrease each year.", "The Preservation Act also authorized the Trust to solicit and accept  donations of funds, property, supplies, and services. The Trust has received  some donations, primarily volunteer labor. Through 2005, cash donations  totaled about $56,000, $50,000 of which was earmarked to pay the salary of  a full-time employee to coordinate volunteer efforts. However, the Trust  has not developed a plan for outreach to philanthropic organizations. For  example, charitable organizations supporting national parks have been  established to solicit donations to help support park needs. The Trust has  discussed this option but has not actively pursued it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Trust Has Not Addressed Risks Potentially Posed by Fire and Legal Liabilities", "paragraphs": ["The Trust has not addressed program risks, including fire and legal  liabilities that could undermine its ability to meet its financial obligations.   The Trust completed a fire management plan in 2004 that adopts, by  reference, the federal National Fire Plan. According to the National Fire  Plan, agencies need a fire management plan to outline a decision-making  process for responding to naturally occurring fires.  Such a plan lays out  the conditions under which fires must be suppressed or allowed to burn to  benefit resources.  The Caldera\u2019s plan, however, has not addressed fire  management to benefit resources, only the management of prescribed fires.  Without a plan to manage fires for resource benefits, all naturally occurring  fires on the Caldera must be suppressed, and suppression can be costly.   For example, in May 2005, a fire on the Caldera burned about 82 acres  before being suppressed\u2014at a cost of about $338,000. In the opinion of the  Forest Service Region 3 Fire Manager, this fire could have been left to burn  because it did not threaten any key resources or public infrastructure.  Extended periods of drought and high fire risk in northern New Mexico  could easily deplete the Caldera\u2019s financial resources because suppression  costs are high.", "The Trust does not have liability coverage to protect against injuries on the  Caldera because it was uncertain whether it could acquire such insurance  using appropriated funds. Moreover, as a government corporation, the  Trust did not believe it could access the federal judgment fund, a fund in  the U.S. Treasury used for the payment of final judgments against the  United States. This lack of liability coverage and uncertainty led the Trust  to take a cautious approach to implementing programs and increasing  public access. According to the Board, in June 2005 the Trust clarified these  issues with its legal counsel, who determined that legislation might be  necessary to access the judgment fund but that it could use its own funds to  purchase liability insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Trust Has Not Developed Required Mechanisms for Monitoring Progress in Meeting Financial and Other Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Trust has yet to develop the mechanisms needed to monitor progress  in meeting its financial and other obligations under the Preservation,  Control, and Results Acts.

The Trust agreed with this recommendation. As of October 2005,  the Trust had not contracted with an independent firm to audit its annual  financial statements. Also in 2003, the Trust contracted with another firm to  review the payroll process and controls for each of the revenue sources  and to recommend improvements.

Such a program would  include strategic and performance plans, measurable goals and objectives  and monitoring plans, annual performance reports, and a strategy for  achieving financial self-sustainability. These mechanisms would help  provide greater accountability for achieving results and enhancing decision  making. Furthermore, an effective management control program\u2014to  include human capital initiatives designed to retain needed skills and  provide timely replacement of lost skills\u2014can ease the effects associated  with turnover in the Board and staff.", "Achieving financial self-sustainability by 2015 is only one of many goals and  objectives set forth in the Preservation Act, but it is key to the Trust\u2019s  success in managing and operating the Caldera without federal funds. The  Trust assumes that it may have to continue to rely on federal funding after  2015, but this assumption is premature because the Trust has not focused  on the actions it needs to take to become self-sustaining, such as expanding  or establishing new revenue-generating programs or identifying other  nonfederal revenue sources (donations). Furthermore, without developing  programs to minimize risks associated with implemented programs, the  Trust cannot manage the uncertainty surrounding liability and fire  suppression costs, which could undermine its efforts to achieve financial  self-sustainability.

The Board provided written comments that are  included in appendix I. The Board generally agreed with the accuracy of  the findings, validity of the conclusions, and soundness of the  recommendations. It also provided additional insights into four specific  areas. First, it stated that it has, over the last several years, engaged in  extensive strategic planning sessions to lay the foundation for developing  more detailed operating plans once the highest level strategic planning  work is completed and sufficient experience has been obtained in  conducting interim programs. It also said that it has adopted, in 2005, a set  of strategic goals, the achievement of which is both measurable and time  specific. We acknowledge that in 2005 the Board announced four broadly  stated strategic goals. However, as stated in the report, the Trust has not  developed strategic and performance plans that include all required  elements of the Results Act, which provides a methodical and analytical  approach to strategic planning.", "Second, with regard to risks posed by fire and legal liabilities, the Board  said it was in the process of completing a Fire Use Plan that addresses the  use of management-ignited fire as well as the use of fire originating from  natural ignitions and that Congress has adopted legislation to provide the  Board with access to federal fire suppression funds. These actions will  enhance the Board\u2019s ability to evaluate natural ignitions and apply the  appropriate management response. We agree that it is important to  complete the Fire Use Plan, which, according to the Board, will be finalized  by May 2006. As mentioned in the report and in the Board\u2019s comments,  having a sound fire management plan will provide greater assurance that  proper management actions are taken in the event of a wildland fire. The  Board also said it has pursued clarification of whether the Board can  access the federal government\u2019s judgment fund and has obtained a legal  opinion from an independent firm that concludes that legislation might be  necessary to access the judgment fund but that the Trust could use its own  funds to purchase liability insurance. We revised the report to include this  clarification and agree that the Trust should use its own funds to purchase  liability insurance.", "Third, the Board agreed that the timely appointment of Board members and  the management of its human resources are essential to achieving positive  results. In this regard, it mentioned that it has revised its bylaws to effect  the orderly transition of Board members, so as to mitigate the impact of  possible delays in the appointment process. It also said it had adopted a  new organizational structure and performance review process for  employees. The change in the Board\u2019s bylaws has the effect of allowing the  Board to make important decisions in the absence of a full Board due to  delays in appointments of Board members. We agree this is important given  that the replacement of Board members is out of its control. The Board also  recognized that it has experienced a relatively high level of Trust employee  turnover, which it said has \u201coccurred in a constructive fashion, void of  grievances or formal complaints.\u201d  Nonetheless, the fact remains that high  turnover, particularly of key employees, can cause disruption to an  organization and affect its ability to accomplish established goals. As the  report states, an effective management control program has a process in  place for the timely replacement of key personnel lost to turnover.  Establishing such a process is within the purview of the Board and  important to effective management of an organization\u2019s human capital.", "Finally, the Board stated that while the Trust was fully committed to the  goal of financial self-sustainability, the Trust recognizes that to obtain that  goal, it needs to streamline required federal overhead stemming from  compliance with federal laws and statutes and to control administrative  and operating costs. It said it was committed to developing the  management plans required for conversion of financially attractive  programs to regular status and acquiring capital resources. Furthermore, it  stated that the Board takes the goal of financial self-sustainability seriously  and on par with other provisions of the Preservation Act and thus disagreed  with the implication in the report that it did not consider the financial self- sustainability goal as a priority. Because the Board\u2019s published  management framework, entitled Valles Caldera National Preserve  Framework and Strategic Guidance for Comprehensive Management,  states that the Trust considers the financial self-sustainability goal as only  one of many goals, to avoid ambiguity, we revised the report\u2019s language to  state that the Trust considers the self-sustainability goal as one of many  goals of equal priority. Regardless, the seriousness of the Board\u2019s actions in  addressing this goal would, as mentioned in the report, be further enhanced  by demonstrating a more aggressive approach to identifying additional  revenue sources that would help the Trust come closer to achieving  financial self-sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We obtained and analyzed information from the Trust on its activities,  relevant laws, regulations, program documents, and related materials, and  met with Trust officials responsible for major activities, such as recreation,  resource inventorying, construction, and financial management.
