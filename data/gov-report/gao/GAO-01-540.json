The TVA Act established TVA to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee River Valley by improving navigation, promoting regional agricultural and economic development, and controlling the floodwaters of the Tennessee River. To those ends, TVA erected dams and hydroelectric power facilities on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.", "To meet the need for more electric power during World War II, TVA expanded beyond hydropower, building coal-fired power plants. In the 1960s, TVA decided to add nuclear generating units to its power system. Today, TVA operates one of the nation\u2019s largest power systems, having produced about 152 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in fiscal year 2000. The system consists primarily of 113 hydroelectric units, 59 coal-fired units, and 5 operating nuclear units. TVA sells power in seven states\u2014Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.", "TVA sells power at wholesale rates to 158 municipal and cooperative utilities that, in turn, distribute the power on a retail basis to nearly 8 million people in an 80,000 square mile region. TVA also sells power to a number of directly served large industrial customers and federal agencies.", "In 1959, the Congress amended the TVA Act to authorize TVA to use debt financing to pay for capital improvements for power programs. Under this legislation, the Congress required that TVA\u2019s power program be \u201cself- financing\u201d through revenues from electricity sales. For capital needs in excess of internally generated funds, TVA was authorized to borrow by issuing bonds. TVA\u2019s debt limit is set by the Congress and was initially established at $750 million in 1959. Since then, TVA\u2019s debt limit has been increased four times by the Congress: to $1.75 billion in 1966, $5 billion in 1970, $15 billion in 1975, and $30 billion in 1979. As of September 30, 2000, TVA\u2019s outstanding debt was $26.0 billion.", "TVA\u2019s bonds are considered \u201cgovernment securities\u201d for purposes of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. All of TVA\u2019s bonds are publicly held, and several are traded on the bond market of the New York Stock Exchange. Since TVA\u2019s first public issue in 1960, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s have assigned TVA\u2019s bonds their highest credit rating\u2014Aaa/AAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether TVA\u2019s bonds are explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the federal government, we analyzed various documents, including Section 15d of the TVA Act, as amended, the Basic TVA Power Bond Resolution, TVA\u2019s Information Statement, and the language included in TVA\u2019s bond offering circulars. We also discussed this issue with bond analysts at two credit rating firms (Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s) and TVA officials.", "To determine the opinion of bond analysts regarding the effect of an implicit or explicit guarantee on TVA\u2019s bonds, we interviewed officials at two credit rating firms that rate TVA\u2019s bonds to discuss their rating methodology for TVA and other electric utilities\u2019 bonds.

Both of the credit rating firms stated that this perception of an implicit federal guarantee is one of the primary reasons that TVA\u2019s bonds have received the highest credit rating. One of the firms cited two other factors\u2014TVA\u2019s legislative protections from competition and its strong operational performance\u2014as additional reasons for assigning TVA\u2019s bonds its highest rating.", "The TVA Act specifically states that the federal government does not guarantee TVA bonds. TVA includes similar \u201cno federal guarantee\u201d language in its Basic TVA Power Bond Resolution, Information Statement, and bond offering circulars. The relevant language is as follows:   Section 15d of the TVA Act, as amended, 16 USC \u00a7 831n-4\u2014\u201cBonds issued by the Corporation  hereunder shall not be obligations of, nor shall payment of the principal thereof or interest thereon be guaranteed by, the United States.\u201d", "Basic TVA Power Bond Resolution, Section 2.2 Authorization and Issuance of Bonds\u2014\u201cThey  shall be payable as to both principal and interest solely from Net Power Proceeds and shall not be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America.\u201d", "Information Statement\u2014\u201cEvidences of Indebtedness are not obligations of the United States of America, and the United States of America does not guarantee the payment of the principal of or interest on any Evidences of Indebtedness.\u201d", "TVA bond offering circulars\u2014\u201cThe interest and principal on the Bonds are payable solely from Net Power Proceeds and are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America.\u201d", "Although TVA\u2019s bonds expressly disclaim a federal guarantee, the two bond rating firms we contacted perceive TVA\u2019s bonds to be implicitly backed by the federal government. This perception of an implied federal guarantee is one of the primary reasons that TVA\u2019s bonds have received the highest credit rating. For example, Standard & Poor\u2019s, in its January 2001 analysis of TVA\u2019s global power bonds, stated that \u201cthe rating reflects the US government\u2019s implicit support of TVA and Standard & Poor\u2019s view that, without a binding legal obligation, the federal government will support principal and interest payments on certain debt issued by entities created by Congress.\u201d", "Further, in its June 2000 opinion update on TVA, Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s) reported that \u201cthe Aaa rating on Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power bonds derives from its strong operational performance and its status as a wholly owned corporate agency of the US Government.\u201d In addition, Moody\u2019s reported that although the federal government does not guarantee TVA\u2019s bonds, the government would not allow a default on TVA\u2019s debt because of the impact it would have on the cost of debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.6, 7 As in the case of TVA, the government does not guarantee the debt of these enterprises. Also as with TVA, there is a perception in the investment community that the federal government would not allow these enterprises to default on their obligations.", "In its January 2001 analysis of TVA\u2019s global power bonds, Standard & Poor\u2019s acknowledged that its rating of these bonds did not reflect TVA\u2019s underlying business or financial condition and that the rating of these bonds would have been lower without TVA\u2019s ties to the federal government. In addition, a Moody\u2019s official stated that financial statistics and ratios for other electric utilities are significantly stronger than those for TVA in each rating category and that government ownership was a fundamental underpinning of the Aaa rating it assigned to TVA\u2019s debt.", "Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s generally use a complex methodology involving both quantitative and qualitative analyses when determining ratings for electric utilities. For example, Moody\u2019s examines the volatility and reliability of cash flows, the contributions of the utility to the profits of its corporate parent (if any), and how the utility is positioning itself to operate in a competitive environment. Also included in Moody\u2019s analysis is the utility\u2019s ability to balance business and financial risk with performance. Similarly, Standard & Poor\u2019s measures financial strength by a utility\u2019s ability to generate consistent cash flow to service its debt, finance its operations, and fund its investments. In addition, Standard & Poor\u2019s analyzes business risk by examining the utility\u2019s operating characteristics such as regulatory environment, reliability, and management.", "Opinion Update: Tennessee Valley Authority, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, June 22, 2000.", "Government-sponsored enterprises are federally established, privately owned corporations designed to increase the flow of credit to specific economic sectors. categories, using A, B, and C, with Aaa/AAA being the highest rating. Triple, double, and single characters distinguish the gradations of credit/investment quality. For example, issuers rated Aaa/AAA indicate exceptional financial security, Baa/BBB indicate adequate financial security, and Ba/BB or below offer questionable to poor financial security. Debt issues rated in the four highest categories, Aaa/AAA, Aa/AA, A, and Baa/BBB, generally are recognized as investment-grade. Table 1 describes the investment-grade rating categories used by Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s. Debt rated Ba/BB or below generally is referred to as speculative grade.", "In addition, Moody\u2019s applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2, and 3, and Standard & Poor\u2019s uses \u201cplus\u201d and \u201cminus\u201d signs in each rating category from Aa/AA through Caa/CCC in their corporate bond rating system. The modifier 1 and \u201cplus\u201d indicate that the issuer/obligation ranks in the higher end of a rating category; 3 and \u201cminus\u201d indicates a ranking in the lower end.", "According to a Moody\u2019s official, the firm places less significance on financial factors in analyzing TVA debt than in analyzing the debt of other electric utilities. Because of TVA\u2019s ties to the federal government, Moody\u2019s considers other factors more important in its assessment of TVA. Specifically, Moody\u2019s looks at how TVA will react to its changing operating environment and places \u201cconsiderable value\u201d on the legislative framework in which TVA operates. For example, in its June 2000 analysis of TVA, Moody\u2019s reported that key provisions in the TVA Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) provide credit protection for bondholders. Under the TVA Act, TVA\u2019s Board of Directors is required to set rates at levels sufficient to generate revenues to cover operating and financing costs. EPAct provides TVA with certain protections from competition. Under EPAct, TVA is exempt from having to allow other utilities to use its transmission lines to transmit power to customers within TVA\u2019s service territory. Further, the Moody\u2019s official stated, as long as TVA is able to set its own rates and to benefit from legislative and other competitive advantages over other utilities, Moody\u2019s will continue to assign TVA\u2019s bonds a Aaa rating.", "As shown in figure 1, of the 119 electric utilities rated by Moody\u2019s as of October 2000, TVA was the only utility rated Aaa. The ratings of other electric utilities range from a high of Aa1 to a low of Ba2, with an average rating at A3. Figure 1 shows the number of utilities in each rating category compared to TVA.", "As noted previously, the TVA Act authorizes TVA to issue and sell bonds to assist in financing its power program. Investor-owned electric utilities also use debt financing, but unlike TVA, they can and do issue common and preferred stock to finance capital needs. Figure 2 shows the capital structure of electric utilities by rating category. It also shows that, in general, electric utilities that have obtained a greater portion of financing through debt have lower credit ratings. However, even though the capital structure of TVA consists entirely of debt, and, as illustrated in our February 2001 report, it has higher fixed financing costs and less financial flexibility than its likely competitors, TVA remains the only AAA-rated electric utility in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TVA\u2019s High Bond Ratings Result in Lower Interest Expense", "paragraphs": ["As a result of TVA\u2019s high bond ratings, the private lending market has provided TVA with access to billions of dollars of financing at low interest rates, an advantage that in turn results in lower interest expense than if its rating had been lower.", "To determine the impact of TVA\u2019s bond rating on its interest expense, we estimated what TVA\u2019s annual interest expense on its bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, would have been if the debt had been given lower investment-grade ratings. Using two different methodologies, we obtained similar results. In the first methodology, we compared the coupon rate of each of TVA\u2019s bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, to the average bond yield rates applicable to public utility bonds with similar terms at the time of issuance for each investment-grade rating category. For example, TVA\u2019s Aaa-rated 2000 Series E Power Bonds that were outstanding at September 30, 2000, have a coupon rate of 7.75 percent. When these bonds were issued on February 16, 2000, the average bond yields for public utility debt averaged 8.16 percent. In total, using the first methodology, we found that the annual interest expense of TVA\u2019s bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, would have been between $137 million and $235 million (about 2 to 3 percent of fiscal year 2000 total expenses) higher if the debt had been given lower investment-grade bond ratings.", "In the second methodology, we categorized TVA\u2019s bonds into long-term (at least 20 years to maturity at time of issuance) and intermediate-term (less than 20 years to maturity at time of issuance) debt issues. We then identified the difference between TVA\u2019s average coupon interest rates grouped as long-term and intermediate-term on its bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, and the average bond yield rates grouped as long-term and intermediate-term for public utilities for the various investment-grade rating categories. Specifically, we compared the average coupon interest rate on TVA\u2019s long-term bonds to the 9-year (1992\u20132000) average bond yield rates for long-term public utility bonds. Similarly, we compared the average coupon interest rate on TVA\u2019s intermediate-term bonds to the 5-year (1996\u20132000) average bond yield rates for intermediate-term public utility bonds. The years used (maturities and time of issuance) for public utility long-term and intermediate-term debt are, in general, comparable to TVA\u2019s bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000. For example, the average coupon interest rate for TVA\u2019s bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, with at least 20 years to maturity at time of issuance was 6.96 percent. In comparison, the average bond yield rates for the period 1992\u20132000 for public utility debt with at least 20 years to maturity averaged 7.82 percent. Using this methodology, we estimated that the annual interest expense on TVA\u2019s bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000, would have been about $141 million to $245 million (about 2 to 4 percent of fiscal year 2000 total expenses) higher if its bonds had been rated lower.", "Table 2 shows the impact of lower bond ratings on annual interest expense using both methodologies. It is important to note that our analyses assumed that TVA\u2019s coupon rates on its bonds corresponded to the bond yield rates of other lower-rated public utilities at the time TVA issued its bonds. Assuming that were the case, we estimated that TVA\u2019s interest expense would have been higher by the amounts shown in table 2. If TVA\u2019s debt were no longer perceived to be implicitly guaranteed by the federal government, the resulting impact on TVA\u2019s interest expense would relate to future bonds and refinancings rather than to its bonds outstanding at September 30, 2000.", "TVA\u2019s high bond rating results in lower interest expense, enhancing TVA\u2019s competitive prospects by providing it with more financial flexibility to respond to financial or competitive challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["While the criteria used to rate the bonds of TVA and other electric utilities are the same, they are weighted differently and, as a result, the basis for TVA\u2019s bond rating is more nonfinancial in nature than that for other electric utilities.
