Sexual assault incident data are input into DSAID through both manual and automated data entry processes and include, as applicable, victim and referral support information, investigative and incident information, and case outcome data for certain incidents of sexual assault that involve a servicemember. Additionally, in some instances DSAID includes sexual assault cases involving a servicemember spouse, an adult family member, and DOD civilians and contractors. Further, DOD has taken several steps to standardize DSAID's use through the development of (1) policies, processes, and procedures for using the system; (2) training for system users; and (3) processes for monitoring the completeness of data.", "DSAID users have identified technical challenges with the system and DOD officials stated that they have plans to spend approximately $8.5 million to implement modifications to DSAID that address most of these challenges in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Some of the key technical challenges users have identified experiencing with the system relate to DSAID's system speed and ease of use; interfaces with other external DOD databases; and users' ability to query data and generate reports. DOD has plans in place to implement modifications to DSAID that are expected to alleviate these challenges; however, officials stated that they will not be approved to fund these modifications until they have conducted an analysis of alternatives that is in line with DOD's acquisition policy framework. This framework, as well as the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide , outline key elements of this analysis, such as relative lifecycle costs and benefits and the effect and value of cost and schedule, among others. Conducting an analysis of alternatives including these elements is key to ensuring that DOD appropriately manages its modifications to DSAID. In 2010, GAO found that DOD had failed to demonstrate adherence to these key elements in the initial development and implementation of DSAID, and, DOD projects it will have spent a total of approximately $31.5 million on implementing and maintaining DSAID through fiscal year 2018. This is approximately $13 million more than the 2012 estimate. DOD's plan to conduct an analysis of alternatives that adequately considers key elements should position DOD to more accurately assess whether planned modifications to DSAID can be implemented within budget and result in the desired outcome.", "DOD manages modifications to DSAID through its change management process, which GAO found substantially aligns with key applicable elements established in the industry standards that GAO reviewed. Specifically, DOD has established processes for managing change requests, such as developing a process to evaluate requested changes to the database and establishing a board that approves, tracks, and controls changes to the database. DOD has also established processes for configuration management, including a process to track, communicate, and deliver changes to the database."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Sexual assault undermines the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) core  values, mission, and combat readiness. In 2008 we reported that  historically, DOD has not collected uniform data on the incidence of  sexual assaults involving members of the armed forces. We concluded  that without consistent, accurate, and reliable department-wide data on  incidences of sexual assault in the military, DOD was limited in its ability  to identify trends in sexual assault and develop targeted prevention and  response efforts. Also, in 2008, Congress required the Secretary of  Defense to implement a centralized, case-level database for the collection  and maintenance of information regarding sexual assaults involving a  member of the armed forces, including information, if available, about the  nature of the assault, the victim, the offender, and the outcome of any  legal proceedings in connection with the assault.", "In 2008, the House Armed Services Committee noted that it intended for  DOD to use the database to improve the quality and utility of the analysis  and recommendations included in DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress on  sexual assault. In response to statutory requirements, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness assigned  responsibility for developing the Defense Sexual Assault Incident  Database (DSAID) to DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response  Office (SAPRO), and required that the military services use DSAID to  collect sexual assault data. In 2012, DSAID became operational and the  military services started to use it to capture incident, investigation, and  subject disposition data for certain incidents of sexual assault that  involved a service-member.", "In 2010, we made six recommendations aimed at ensuring that DOD  followed key practices for the acquisition and implementation of  information technology systems\u2014such as developing an economic  justification and system requirements\u2014were followed when developing  DSAID. DOD concurred with these recommendations, but did not fully  implement them prior to the implementation of DSAID. Our assessment of  DOD\u2019s efforts to address these recommendations is discussed further in  the background section of this report.", "House Report 112-479, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, included a provision for us to  conduct a review of DSAID once the database had been certified by the  Secretary of Defense.

Specifically, we reviewed processes to train DSAID users and monitor  DSAID data quality. We limited our review to the processes DOD and the  services have to monitor data quality, and did not assess the accuracy  and completeness of the data contained in DSAID because, at the time of  our review, DSAID contained data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 that had  undergone extensive review by DOD to ensure they were accurate and  complete prior to their inclusion in DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress.  Lastly, we reviewed DOD\u2019s DSAID quality assurance tool\u2014the primary  tool used to identify errors and omissions in DSAID data\u2014and its  methodology for identifying significant errors in DSAID data.", "For our second objective, we reviewed DOD documents, which included  all DSAID help desk tickets generated between January 2015 and April  2016 (which was approximately 600 tickets). We selected this time period  because we found that help desk tickets prior to January 2015 were  generally related to the user\u2019s inexperience with the system, whereas  tickets after that date largely related to technical issues with the system  and thus were more germane to our review. We also reviewed all change  requests that were submitted between August 2013 and May 2016 by  DOD and service officials to the DSAID Change Control Board but had  not been implemented (which was approximately 40 change requests).  We chose this time period because of our interest in system changes that  had been requested and still under consideration, and all change  requests submitted prior to August 2013 had already been closed. We  also interviewed DOD officials as well as DSAID users and program  managers for the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force at   both service headquarters and at selected installations. Installations  were selected to represent a range of user experience with DSAID  including (1) number of cases in DSAID, (2) number of Sexual Assault  Response Coordinators (SARC), (3) number of DSAID data errors  identified by SAPRO\u2019s quality assurance tool, and (4) geographic  diversity. Specifically, we selected 9 installations\u2014Joint Base Langley- Eustis, Virginia; Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia; Goodfellow Air Force  Base, Texas; Fort Hood, Texas; Naval Base San Diego, California; Naval  Base Coronado, California; Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California;  Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia; and Fort George G. Meade,  Maryland. At these locations, SARCs representing the following 4  additional installations were in attendance as well\u2014Marine Corps Base  Camp Pendleton, California; Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego,  California; Presidio of Monterey, California; and Naval Base Point Loma,  California.", "During site visits, we met with 42 SARCs representing 13 installations in  the United States. Views we obtained from these SARCs were not  generalizable. We evaluated the information we obtained from these  documents and interviews to identify any technical challenges users  faced in operating DSAID, as well as any systemic challenges DOD had  identified with DSAID. We interviewed DOD officials to determine whether  they had plans to address any challenges identified, and how costs for  these plans were determined. To assess the process DOD used for  estimating costs to modify DSAID, we compared the process DOD used  to estimate the costs of any planned modifications with best practices for  cost estimating and assessment in the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. We reviewed DOD documents and interviewed  DOD officials to obtain information on its costs incurred since the initial  DSAID contract was granted in August 2010 through October 2016.", "For our third objective, we reviewed elements of DOD\u2019s change  management and configuration management processes that were  applicable to our scope. Specifically, we focused on elements that are  managed by DOD, such as processes for, managing change requests  and configuration control activities for configuration status accounting,  interface control, and release management. We compared these  elements with the Project Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide), Fifth Edition, 2013  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\u2019 (IEEE) Standard  for Configuration Management in Systems and Software Engineering to  determine how DOD\u2019s process for managing changes to DSAID aligned  with project management and information management industry  standards applicable for implementing and monitoring change and  configuration management in established information technology  systems. We selected the Project Management Institute\u2019s criteria  because it provides guidelines that are relevant to project managers and  project teams on the requirements and responsibilities of sound change  management and configuration management systems for their project.  We have used the PMBOK\u00ae Guide in multiple reports that address a  variety of topics for which project management standards are  applicable. We selected IEEE\u2019s criteria because it establishes minimum  process requirements for configuration management in systems and  software engineering and because it can be applied to any form, class, or  type of software or system. We have used IEEE standards as guidance  for information technology best practices in previous reports that address  a variety of topics.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2015 to January  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 that required the  Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive policy for DOD on the  prevention of and response to sexual assaults involving members of the  armed forces. In part, the legislation required DOD to develop a uniform  definition of \u201csexual assault\u201d for all the armed forces and submit an  annual report to Congress on reported sexual assault incidents involving  members of the armed forces. The statute also required the Secretaries  of the military departments to prescribe procedures for confidentially  reporting sexual assault incidents.", "DOD issued its first annual report to Congress in May 2005, and in  August 2008 we conducted a review that, among other things, evaluated  the extent to which DOD had visibility and exercised oversight over  reports of sexual assault involving servicemembers. We found that  DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress may not effectively characterize  incidents of sexual assault in the military services because the  department had not clearly articulated a consistent methodology for  reporting incidents and because the means of presentation for some of  the data did not facilitate their comparison. Further, we found that while  DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress included data on the total number of  restricted and unrestricted reported incidents of sexual assault,  meaningful comparisons of the data could not be made because the  offices providing the data to DOD measured incidents of sexual assault  differently. As a result, we recommended that DOD improve the  usefulness of its annual report as an oversight tool by establishing  baseline data to permit analysis of data over time. DOD concurred with  this recommendation and has taken steps to develop baseline data  through the development of DSAID.", "Also, in 2008, Congress mandated that DOD implement a centralized,  case-level database for the collection and maintenance of information  regarding sexual assault involving a member of the armed forces.  Additional mandates have since required the DOD-wide collection of  additional data, such as case disposition and military protective orders for  annual reporting purposes. We conducted a review of DOD\u2019s efforts to  implement a centralized sexual assault database, and in 2010 we  reported that while DOD had taken steps to begin acquiring a centralized  sexual assault database it did not meet the statutory requirement to  establish the database by January 2010. Moreover, we found that  DOD\u2019s acquisition and implementation of DSAID did not fully incorporate  key information technology practices related to the following: economic  justification, requirements development and management, risk  management, and test management. DOD concurred with all of our  findings and recommendations and has taken some actions to address  them.", "Economic justification: We found that DOD\u2019s cost estimate for DSAID  ($12.6 million) did not include all costs over the system\u2019s life cycle and  had not been adjusted to account for program risks. In 2012, DOD  reassessed DSAID\u2019s costs to include additional expenses not  included in the original estimate; however, as of November 2016,  DOD has not been able to provide DSAID life cycle documentation  that would demonstrate that DOD had taken steps to ensure that all  costs and program risks were accounted for.", "Requirements development and management: We found that DOD  had taken initial steps to engage some users in the development of  DSAID requirements and in 2009 had developed its initial  requirements management plan. DOD\u2019s initial requirements  management plan established processes and guidelines for  requirements management activities. This plan has been updated  three times with the latest update in January 2016. DOD has some  systematic methods in place for tracking user feedback, which is a  key step in identifying system requirements. In addition, DOD has  elicited feedback on users\u2019 experience with DSAID since the  database\u2019s implementation. For example, in 2012, 2013, and 2015  DOD collected non generalizable feedback from DSAID users,  including SARCs, SAPR program managers, and the military services  legal officers.", "Risk management: We found that during development of the system,  DOD had begun to identify key risks such as staffing shortages and  competing priorities among the military services. In 2011, DOD  developed a risk management plan that identified risks associated  with DSAID. In the risk management plan, DOD assigned probability  and impact ratings to some of the identified risks. In addition, DOD  reported discussing program risks and technical risks to the database  at its management meetings and has an issues tracker to track,  among other things, risks to the database. However, as of August  2016, DOD had not demonstrated that it had established and  implemented defined processes for mitigating risks identified in its risk  management plan.", "Test management: At the time of our review in 2010, DOD officials  told us that they were planning, but had not started to work with a  development contractor to establish an effective test management  structure, develop test plans, and capture and resolve problems found  during testing.

Similarly,  three of the services have added and officials from one of the services  told us that they are in the process of adding language to their military  service- specific sexual assault guidance requiring the use of DSAID. To  assist users, DOD also developed a DSAID user manual that is revised  with each new system update. Further, DOD\u2019s instruction on the  investigation of adult sexual assault requires MCIOs to ensure that data  obtained through unrestricted reports of sexual assault, such as the  investigative case number, are available for incorporation into DSAID.

These challenges are related to, DSAID\u2019s system speed and  ease of use; interfaces with MCIO databases; DSAID\u2019s utility as a case  management tool; and users\u2019 ability to query data and generate reports.", "System speed: According to our review of DSAID help desk tickets  and interviews with service SAPR officials and SARCs, DSAID\u2019s slow  system speed presented a challenge in efficient use of the database.  Specifically, users report that slow system speed caused them to  spend an inordinate amount of time on data input, and limited their  ability to save data and run reports because the system is  programmed to time out after a certain period. In our review of the  DSAID developer\u2019s monthly system performance reports from  December 2014 through January 2016, we learned that DSAID is  rebooted on an almost daily basis to prevent or minimize system slow  down. Further, in our review of nearly 600 help desk tickets, we found  that DSAID\u2019s slow system speed was one of the challenges cited by  users. Users reported that, due to issues with system speed, it was  cumbersome to perform their required DSAID functions along with  other job responsibilities. For example, SARCs we interviewed  representing 7 of the 13 installations said that in their estimation,  DSAID\u2019s slow system speed regularly resulted in data input taking up  to two to three times longer than it should have. Additionally,  according to interviews with military service officials and SARCs  representing 8 of the 13 installations, computers would frequently time  out during the lengthy period of time it took to input and save data in  DSAID and, if all required fields to save were not complete, the time- out would result in the need to reenter the data. In addition, officials  from the Department of the Army told us they were unable to run all- Army reports during the last half of 2015 because DSAID would time- out before a full report could be generated. Therefore, according to  DOD SAPRO officials, they ran the Army\u2019s reports for them on a  regular basis, and in February 2016, they resolved this immediate  issue by implementing a report scheduler capability in DSAID.  According to DOD SAPRO officials, this capability allowed the Army  and the other military services to run the full report without timing out.  DOD SAPRO officials acknowledge the latency issue overall and are  addressing it with software and server upgrades that are designed to  reduce page load time and ease the burden of data entry on SARCs.  DOD SAPRO officials stated that the software upgrades are  scheduled for completion in December 2016 and server upgrades in  early 2017, but DOD officials emphasized that when DSAID users  experience DSAID slow system speeds it can also be an issue with  the user\u2019s local network, and not with DSAID.", "Ease of use: DSAID users we interviewed and DOD documents that  we reviewed cited the inability to easily navigate DSAID as a  challenge. According to a DSAID user feedback report, in 2015 the  biggest issue SARCs reported to their military service headquarters  officials was that the DSAID user interface and navigation could be  improved. This was supported by SARCs we met with from 7 of the 13  installations who said that it is easy to miss or skip data fields and  pages because the logic flow from one page to the next in DSAID is  not intuitive, often leaving those SARCs unsure of how much progress  they have made in completing a case record. For example, during our  site visit to one installation, we observed instances in which the  selection of certain data elements would trigger other data fields that  needed to be completed, but the system did not prompt the user that  additional data were required. Additionally, Army headquarters  officials raised concerns with DSAID\u2019s ease of use, stating that  improvements to the system\u2019s flow would increase data accuracy by  ensuring that users enter relevant information when a case was  initiated and also decrease the frequency that \u201crelevant data missing\u201d  is noted in DOD\u2019s annual report. However, DOD officials stated that  they are limited in their ability to make some changes to DSAID\u2019s  workflow because DSAID is a commercial-off-the-shelf system, which  does not allow for such customization.", "Automated interfaces with military service investigative databases:  Based on DSAID quality assurance tool reports generated by the  military services for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016 and  discussions we had with DSAID users, we found that DSAID data that  are populated through interfaces with MCIO databases vary in  completeness. According to military service officials and SARCs, this  is because MCIO data systems are not required to capture the same  information that is required for DSAID. For example, an official from  one MCIO said that investigators are not required to complete the  data field in their database for whether alcohol was used by the  subject or victim; however, this same data field in DSAID is designed  to be populated automatically with data from the MCIO databases.  Further, in September 2014, DSAID was modified to address  technical issues with the interface by allowing SARCs or program  managers to manually enter these data in instances where MCIO data  are regularly omitted. However, according to DOD officials, any  additional data received from the MCIOs during the weekly interface  will overwrite what the SARC or program manager has entered as the  MCIO is the authoritative source for such data.", "Utility as a case management tool: According to DOD documents,  DSAID is intended to be a case management tool, and according to  DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2015 annual report, DSAID enhances a SARC\u2019s  ability to provide comprehensive and standardized victim case  management; however, users of DSAID told us that the system is of  limited usefulness for case management. According to the DSAID  user manual, the system allows for case management in that it  enables a victim\u2019s incident and referral data to seamlessly transition  between locations or SARCs. While DSAID is DOD\u2019s system of record  and the only system in which SARCs are permitted to maintain case  data, according to headquarter-level officials from the Army, the Navy,  and the Air Force, and according to Marine Corps SARCs, DSAID is  of limited usefulness to the personnel working with victims.  Specifically, officials stated that DSAID does not provide the requisite  functionality, such as the ability to input case notes to manage  individual cases. Officials from one service\u2019s headquarters-level  SAPR office said that this functionality would be helpful in ensuring  continuity of victim case management. However, according to DOD  SAPRO officials, as of December 2016, a change request to the  change control board to add the functionality has not been submitted.", "SARCs we met with from 9 of the 13 installations similarly stated that  DSAID is missing basic elements of standard case management  systems, such as the ability to document victim outreach or record  unique incident details that may inform referrals for care or other  support services. Further, SARCs we interviewed from 8 of the 13  installations indicated they would, at a minimum, like the ability to  document how and when they met with victims to track the level of  service victims were provided. DOD officials told us that the decision  to limit narrative information in DSAID was by design to protect the  victim. According to DOD officials, there is concern that their phrasing  of narrative information could inadvertently harm the victim were  DSAID data subpoenaed in the course of legal proceedings.  Additionally, DOD officials noted that there have not been any change  requests made to the change control board for the addition of case  management elements to DSAID.", "Data query and reporting: According to DOD officials, DSAID has  been used to provide data for congressionally mandated reports,  produce ad-hoc queries, facilitate trend analysis, and support program  planning analysis and management. However, officials from three  services\u2019 headquarters-level SAPR offices told us that DSAID\u2019s  reporting capabilities are limited. As a result, many users told us they  have developed their own tools to track sexual assault outside of  DSAID. For example, the Army\u2019s and the Marine Corps\u2019 SAPR offices  have each developed \u201cdashboard\u201d systems that use raw data from  DSAID to identify specific trends that are useful to their leadership and  accessible by SARCs for their military service. Further, SARCs we  met with from 11 of the 13 installations told us that they keep informal  \u201cdatabases\u201d or hard copy documents on their cases in order to brief  their leadership, because they cannot run ad-hoc queries and reports  of cases in DSAID for which they are responsible. According to the  SARCs, these trackers duplicate key data points input into DSAID  (e.g., victim demographics, type of assault, involvement of alcohol,  etc.), but do not include any personally identifiable information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Officials Have Plans to Modify DSAID in Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018 to Alleviate Most of the System\u2019s Technical Challenges, and Plan to Conduct an Analysis of Alternatives of System Changes", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials, they have planned to spend $8.5 million in  funding for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 for DSAID modifications, which  officials stated will allow them to implement specific modifications that  should alleviate most of the technical challenges identified by users. See  table 2 for a complete list of DOD\u2019s initiatives planned for fiscal years  2017 and 2018 and the purpose of these initiatives.", "DOD plans to spend $3.59 million in fiscal year 2017 and $4.916 in fiscal  year 2018 for specific modifications to DSAID to support these initiatives,  and officials are in the process of beginning to conduct a formal analysis  to identify the costs and benefits of alternative options for implementing  each modification. (See app. I for a list of modifications to DSAID that  DOD plans to implement to support the initiatives in fiscal year 2017.) For  example, a DOD official stated that DOD plans to implement an encrypted  file storage mechanism for DSAID, but they have not yet determined how  they plan to do this. Rather, this DOD official stated that the analysis of  alternatives will establish options for this mechanism and weigh the costs  and benefits. This DOD official also stated that the Defense Human  Resources Activity\u2014which is responsible for funding DSAID\u2014will not  approve DOD to spend resources on the individual modifications until an  analysis of alternatives addressing each modification is conducted.  According to this DOD official, the initial draft of this analysis will be  completed by the end of November 2016, and all planned modifications  can be implemented within the planned available budgetary resources.  DOD officials based these budgets on rough-order-of-magnitude cost  estimates that were derived from costs they have experienced in recent  years. For example, costs for adding a module in DSAID to document  reports involving retaliation were based on DOD\u2019s costs for building  DSAID\u2019s legal officer module, which was purchased in 2013.The GAO  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that rough-order-of- magnitude estimates are useful to support \u201cwhat-if\u201d analyses and can be  developed for a particular phase or portion of an estimate, but unlike an  analysis of alternatives, they do not rise to the level of analysis  recommended by best practices to support an investment decision and  are not considered budget-quality estimates.", "In addition to DOD acquisition requirements, an analysis of alternatives is  supported by the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. These  documents identify key elements that should be included in this analysis.  For example, an organization should identify relative lifecycle costs and  benefits; methods and the rationale for quantifying the lifecycle costs and  benefits; the effect and value of cost, schedule, and performance  tradeoffs; sensitivity to changes in assumptions; and risk factors. Further,  according to GAO guidance, a comparative analysis of alternatives is  essential for validating decisions to sustain or enhance a program.  Because these elements are part of DOD\u2019s acquisition requirements, if  DOD\u2019s analysis of alternatives complies with these requirements, it  should incorporate these key elements.", "Conducting a comparative analysis of alternatives, including identifying  and quantifying lifecycle costs and benefits and weighing the cost,  schedule, and performance tradeoffs, is key to ensuring that DOD  appropriately manages its modifications to DSAID. In 2010, we found that  DOD had failed to demonstrate adherence to these key elements in the  initial development and implementation of DSAID. By the end of fiscal  year 2018, DOD spending on DSAID will exceed initial cost estimates by  over $13 million. In 2010, we reported that DOD estimated development  and implementation of DSAID to cost $12.6 million, but DOD\u2019s estimate  did not include costs for program management or sustainment and for  lifecycle costs such as operations and maintenance. In December 2012,  DOD documentation shows that DOD had adjusted its estimate to $17.9  million to reflect research and development costs for fiscal years 2011  and 2012 and operations and maintenance costs for fiscal years 2013  through 2018. DOD projected it will have spent a total of approximately  $31.5 million as of November 2016 on implementing and maintaining  DSAID through fiscal year 2018. This is approximately $13 million more  than the revised 2012 estimate. If DOD conducts an accurate and  complete analysis of alternatives, it should result in more precise cost  estimates for planned enhancements. DOD\u2019s plan to conduct an analysis  of alternatives that adheres to the department\u2019s acquisition framework  and adequately considers key elements identified in the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, as DOD officials have stated that their  analysis will do, should position DOD to more accurately assess whether  planned modifications to DSAID can be implemented within budget and  with the desired outcome."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Process for Managing Changes to DSAID Substantially Aligns with Key Elements of Industry Standards", "paragraphs": ["DOD manages modifications to DSAID through its change management  process, which we found, based on our review of DOD documentation,  substantially align with the elements described in the project management  and information technology industry standards that we reviewed.  \u201cChange management\u201d is the process of controlling changes requested to  work products to help ensure that project baselines are maintained.  According to the PMBOK\u00ae Guide, the activity of change control allows for  documented changes within the project to be considered in an integrated  fashion while reducing project risk, which often arises from changes made  without consideration to the overall project objectives or plans.  Configuration management activities can be included as part of an  organization\u2019s change control process. While change control is focused  on managing project change such as identifying, documenting, and  approving or rejecting changes to the project documents, deliverables, or  baselines, configuration management is typically focused on managing  changes to a configuration item or system. Industry standards include  descriptions of the following elements of change and configuration  management that are applicable to DOD\u2019s efforts to manage DSAID: (1)  managing change requests; (2) configuration status accounting, tracking  and communicating to stakeholders the changes made to the database;  (3) interface control, managing the database interfaces; and (4) release  management, managing the publication and communication of updates to  users.  (1) Managing change requests: According to the PMBOK\u00ae Guide,  changes may be requested by any stakeholder involved with the  project. Although changes may be initiated verbally, they should be  recorded in written form and entered into the change management  and/or configuration management systems. Every documented  change request\u2014which may include corrective actions, preventive  actions, and defect repairs\u2014needs to be either approved or rejected  by a responsible individual who is identified in the project  management plan or by organizational procedures according to the  PMBOK\u00ae Guide. When required, the change control process includes  a change control board, which is a formally chartered group  responsible for meeting and reviewing the change requests and  approving, rejecting, or otherwise disposing of those changes and for  recording and communicating such decisions. According to the  PMBOK\u00ae Guide, the roles and responsibilities of this board are to be  clearly defined and agreed upon by appropriate stakeholders and  documented in the change management plan. Further, the disposition  of all change requests, approved or not, are to be updated in the  change log that is used to document changes that occur during a  project.", "DOD has established a change request process in the DSAID change  control management plan and DOD has documented and formally  chartered its Change Control Board. The board\u2019s roles and  responsibilities are defined in the DSAID Change Control Board  charter and board members include representation from SAPRO and  each military service\u2019s SAPR office. Change requests can be  submitted only by board members or their designees. The board  meets monthly to evaluate and vote on change requests.", "The DSAID Change Control Board charter outlines the requirement  that change requests will be captured through a change request form,  which will then be uploaded to the board\u2019s website and made  available to the DSAID community. Both the DSAID Change Control  Board charter and the DSAID change control management plan  outline DOD\u2019s procedures for evaluating these change requests.  During its evaluation of each proposed change request, DOD  conducts an impact analysis that includes an assessment of the  change\u2019s potential impact on requirements, development, training,  communications, policy, and testing. This impact analysis also  assesses the expected level of effort to implement the request.  Documentation from the Change Control Board meetings shows that  DOD considers approximate costs and time to implement in change  request discussions.", "DOD also documents and tracks testing and implementation of  approved changes in a requirements log. The log includes the  approval status, prioritization, and tracking notes for each change  request as each moves through the approval process. Once a change  request is implemented, DOD updates the requirements log to note  which baseline requirement was affected and which system release  was included the change. In the requirements log, DOD also  documents baseline requirement changes associated with the change  requests that have been disapproved and closed.  (2) Configuration status accounting: According to the IEEE standard  on configuration management, the purpose of configuration status  accounting is to track the status of configuration items. In this process,  organizations track baseline requirements and total changes  requested and implemented. This information should provide objective  insights into a system\u2019s performance overtime and the status of the  system as changes are implemented.", "DOD has documented and established baseline requirements for  DSAID and, through the change request tracker, DOD tracks total  changes requested, implemented, disapproved, deferred, and  pending. As previously discussed, DOD conducts an impact analysis  of each proposed change request as part of the evaluation process.  DOD tracks DSAID\u2019s requirements and change requests until release  and monitors and documents identified defects at each stage until  they are resolved, which allows DOD to monitor the system\u2019s status  as changes are implemented.  (3) Interface control: According to the IEEE standard on configuration  management, organizations use interface controls to manage the  interfacing effects that hardware, system software, and other projects  and deliverables have on the project. Interface control activities  include identifying the product\u2019s key interfaces and controlling the  interface specifications.", "DOD is currently managing interfaces between DSAID and the MCIO  databases to collect sexual assault case information, and DOD plans  to incorporate additional interfaces with other DOD systems to collect  more case information. DOD documentation shows that the  department has identified DSAID\u2019s key interfaces and specifications.  Specifically, DOD SAPRO has established a memorandum of  understanding with each service investigative agency that describe  roles and responsibilities and data mapping parameters, which  includes a technical description of the fields and types of data that will  be interfaced between DSAID and each service investigative agency\u2019s  system. Through these mechanisms, DOD manages the parameters  of these interfaces that provide key information to DSAID. While DOD  has met industry standards for identifying key interfaces and  controlling interface specifications, as discussed earlier in this report,  some DOD users reported some technical challenges with data from  the MCIO database interfaces overwriting manually input DSAID data.  According to DOD documentation, DOD is taking steps to mitigate  them in enhancement efforts, which include improving how  investigative data transferred into DSAID, and adding additional  database interfaces.  (4) Release management: According to the IEEE standard on  configuration management, release management allows an  organization to ensure that the proper deliverables such as changes  and fixes to a system are delivered to the designated receiving party,  in the designated form, and to the designated location. Release  management activities include delivering approved releases and  defining the following: a release policy, release planning, release  contents, release format and distribution, and release tracking.", "In line with defining release policy, DOD\u2019s change control board  charter defines board members as the authority for establishing  DSAID release schedules and prioritize and assign changes to a  release. With respect to release planning, we found that DOD has  defined the types of releases it delivers and the activities conducted  during DSAID\u2019s formal release process. DOD has also defined the  content, format, and distribution materials to be included in each  release. Communication of the release follows a defined process  starting with limited distribution to select users and then distribution to  the full user community.
