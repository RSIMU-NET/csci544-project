In contrast, family child care is offered by individuals in their homes to a small number of children\u2014usually fewer than six. These providers can be neighbors, friends, or someone families learn about through friends or advertisements. Relative care is care provided by a person related to the child other than a parent.", "The flexibility of family child care makes it an attractive choice for parents. In contrast to most centers, family child care providers accept infants and young toddlers. Approximately 23 percent of employed women use family child care for children between the ages of 1 and 2, while 20 percent of employed women use it for children under 1.", "Family child care providers also usually have longer hours, may provide weekend and evening care, and may accommodate the hours of parents working shifts. They are also more likely to offer part-time care. These features are important to many lesser skilled and lower paid employees who tend to work shifts or other untraditional schedules. Part-time care is useful for those in the type of job-training activities in which AFDC mothers participate. Hence, family child care is a frequent choice among low-income families.

A study done by the Families and Work Institute, which found 35 percent of the family care providers in their sample were giving inadequate care, recently highlighted these concerns about quality.", "Although family child care is used by many employed mothers with young children, states and localities generally do not regulate it as they do center care. One study estimated that approximately 82 to 90 percent of family child care is unregulated in the United States. Hence, many family child care providers operate legally but do not have to meet any standards to protect the children\u2019s safety and health. Experts believe that meeting at least some minimal child care standards as a precondition to providing care is an important step in building quality into all child care settings.", "If a family child care provider wants to become registered or licensed, the process can sometimes be intimidating and costly, especially relative to the low wages most providers earn. Incentives to become registered or licensed are few and providers may encounter barriers and be uncertain that they can charge parents higher fees if they meet requirements that help them provide higher quality of care.", "Family child care providers also have difficulty getting the information and resources they need to run a successful business and to enhance the quality of care they provide. For instance, family child care providers may be unaware of child care training available in their communities because they usually are not part of a professional organization or linked to other networks that would keep them informed of training opportunities. If they do learn of such training, barriers may prevent them from participating, especially if they are low-income providers. Barriers include the cost of the training, training schedules that conflict with providers\u2019 hours of operation, training tailored to center care rather than family child care, or language differences.

This program leads to the completion of requirements for the American Montessori Society diploma. Similarly, DOD\u2019s family child care system has an extensive entry-level and ongoing training system.", "Support network staff usually make regular visits to provide technical assistance, bring supplies and toys, or conduct training.

The food program also provides regular training and monitoring visits. The five network initiatives also help or encourage providers to become members of local family child care associations or informal support groups. Given the large number of family child care providers, the development of associations\u2014seen by experts as an important way to reach, support, and help train providers\u2014is a key strategy in many initiatives focused on family child care.", "Research on child care quality shows that the types of activities support networks conduct contribute to enhancing the level of professionalism of the provider and, thus, improve the quality of child care.", "The funding for these initiatives comes from a full range of sources: private, state, and federal.

The initiative identified an organization in each community that would be responsible for implementing and institutionalizing the strategies in the community during the life of the grant. It also launched a nationwide consumer education campaign to help parents recognize quality child care. In doing this, the initiative wanted to create a demand for quality care, thereby prompting the child care market to supply it.", "We visited one of the initiative\u2019s first sites, located in Salem, Oregon. Staff involved with the project told us that before the Family-to-Family initiative, little work had been done with family child care in the state. For example, Oregon had only a voluntary registration system for family care providers, and provider associations were not very strong or active. According to the staff, the initiative acted as a catalyst in building supports for family child care as evidenced by the birth of the Oregon Child Development Fund, development of a statewide resource and referral system, and state enactment of minimum requirements for family child care settings.", "The California initiative and the Oregon fund also focus on training and recruitment and, as mentioned earlier, have successful fundraising components. These initiatives use a five-part model that consists of assessing community child care needs, recruiting providers to meet those needs, offering technical assistance so providers can become licensed, providing ongoing training to providers, and giving them ongoing support. These components are implemented by a statewide resource and referral system. However, it became apparent early in the initiatives\u2019 development that more funding was essential to carry out the model, particularly to support the recruitment, training, and networking activities of the various family child care projects. By continually developing funding partnerships with local and nationwide businesses, foundations, and governments, the California initiative has raised $6.8 million in the last 9 years to fund its family child care projects.
