The Farm Service Agency (FSA) experienced significant cost overruns and schedule delays, deferred the majority of the envisioned features, skipped key tests, and deployed software in April 2013 that was slow and inaccurate. In addition, FSA struggled to establish a new program baseline as estimates grew from $330 million to $659 million and time frames were delayed from early 2014 to late 2016. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FSA did not approve three different baseline proposals by the time the program was halted. By March 2015, MIDAS had overrun its baseline cost estimate by $93 million.", "FSA has delivered about 20 percent of the functionality that was originally planned for MIDAS. FSA envisioned MIDAS as a single platform to host data, tools, and applications for administering farm program benefits that would be integrated with USDA financial, geospatial, and data warehouse systems. However, FSA delivered a platform that hosts data for administering farm program benefits and is integrated with USDA's geospatial system; it does not host tools and applications for administering benefits, and is not integrated with USDA's financial system or data warehouse.", "FSA did not have key program management disciplines in place for MIDAS, and lacks the capacity to effectively manage successor programs. Of 18 key practices associated with sound IT acquisition and investment management and required by USDA or FSA policy, FSA implemented 2, partially implemented 7 practices, and did not implement 9 others. For example, USDA and FSA did not establish a complete set of requirements, perform key tests before deploying the system, or provide effective oversight as the program floundered for 2 years. Moving forward, FSA has begun planning how it will continue to automate, integrate, and modernize its farm program services through additional system development initiatives. However, the agency has not yet established plans to improve its management capabilities. Until FSA establishes and implements such a plan, the agency will continue to lack the fundamental capacity to manage IT acquisitions.

We agree that the decision to halt MIDAS was a  sound one, and that it allowed the agency to focus on the residual  deliverables provided by release 2. However, we identified several  management shortfalls that continued to persist after release 1 was  deployed in April 2013. For example, FSA did not update its baseline  cost, schedule, and scope plans from March 2012 to October 2014,  even though it made significant decisions affecting scope and  schedule. Also, from November 2012 through October 2014, the  program did not have a project plan for monitoring progress due to  numerous scope and schedule changes and relied on status reporting  from draft schedules.

We will continue to monitor the agency\u2019s efforts  to implement our recommendation.", "With respect to our recommendation to adhere to recognized best  practices and agency policy in system testing, FSA stated that it  established renewed commitment to MIDAS testing efforts and  implemented all of the key practices for release 2. As previously  stated, our report acknowledges that FSA improved selected practices  in developing and deploying release 2. However, we do not believe  that the scope or timeframe associated with this initiative provide  sufficient evidence that FSA has improved its capacity to manage  large, complex acquisitions. Moving forward, FSA noted that it plans  to adhere to recognized best practices and agency policy in pursuing  consistent or increased rigor around system testing to demonstrate  the agency\u2019s testing capabilities are consistent and repeatable across  all IT projects. We will continue to monitor the agency\u2019s efforts to  implement our recommendation.", "Regarding our recommendation to adhere to best practices and  agency policy in executive-level IT governance before proceeding with  any further system development, FSA stated that it is evaluating its  governance structure to potentially include establishing work groups  that would evaluate IT initiatives at a more granular level of detail.  FSA also stated that it is working with USDA\u2019s Office of the CIO to  determine how MIDAS will align with the department\u2019s governance  framework and to identify the appropriate gate reviews, artifacts, and  level of oversight. We will continue to monitor the agency\u2019s efforts to  implement our recommendation.", "Overall, FSA\u2019s poor performance and lack of results for more than 2 years  contributed to its inability to deliver most of the intended functionality and  led the Secretary of Agriculture to direct the agency to halt further  development after release 2. The efforts that continued after USDA  decided to halt further development on MIDAS in July 2014 and through  the delivery of release 2 in December 2014 were to salvage a feature  (customer records) that was almost fully developed by the time the  department made this decision. Our assessments of project planning and  monitoring and executive IT governance practices already include FSA\u2019s  efforts to manage the overall program and to continue developing  customer records through October 2014. Nonetheless, if we were to  consider FSA\u2019s efforts on release 2 beginning in October 2014, we would  have altered just 1 of the 18 key practices (conducting user testing) due  to weaknesses that persisted beyond the deployment of release 1 in April  2013.", "To its credit, FSA has (1) acknowledged that management improvements  are needed and identified steps the agency plans to take; (2) made  changes in key leadership positions; and (3) committed to delivering  smaller, iterative IT projects going forward. However, our experience in  reviewing federal IT acquisitions has shown that it takes time to build  repeatable, robust processes. Implementing improvements during the last  few months of a 3-year effort is not enough to demonstrate repeatable IT  management capacity. As we recommended, FSA needs an improvement  plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and  following agency policy as well as a long-term institutional commitment to  comprehensively build these processes going forward. Given the  complexity and challenges in reengineering and improving FSA services,  the agency also needs to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that it can  follow policy, manage acquisitions, and deliver needed functionality.", "FSA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III. The agency also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, and other interested parties.

We identified key events and decisions from the program\u2019s  December 2011 requirements review through the July 2014 decision to  halt further development on MIDAS. We analyzed the impact of these  events and decisions on MIDAS\u2019s cost, schedule, scope, and  performance.

We confirmed the delivered functionality by reviewing  program artifacts\u2014including system test reports; program design  documentation; requirements traceability matrices; change request logs;  system architecture illustrations; status reports to the program\u2019s Senior  Management Oversight Committee, the Office of Management and  Budget, and Congress; Exhibit 300 updates; budget requests;  assessments by the program\u2019s independent verification and validation  contractor; and proposals to rebaseline program scope\u2014for evidence that  the features had been implemented, deferred, or removed from scope.  We also obtained a live demonstration of the MIDAS system in a FSA  service center.
