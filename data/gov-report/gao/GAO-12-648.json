GAO also assessed CMS steps thus far to help states enroll children and related state challenges. GAO applied proposed and final 2014 PPACA eligibility rules to nationally representative 2009 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and interviewed officials from CMS and IRS, two federal agencies responsible for implementing relevant PPACA provisions, and six states that received federal funds for enrollment efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO estimates that under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), about three-quarters of approximately 7 million children who were uninsured in January 2009 would be eligible for Medicaid, the State Children\u0092s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or the new premium tax credit. The remaining children had family incomes too high to be eligible, were noncitizens, or would be ineligible for the premium tax credit because they would be considered to have access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance per the Internal Revenue Service\u0092s (IRS) proposed affordability standard, in which IRS interpreted PPACA as defining affordability for an employee\u0092s eligible family members based on the cost of an employee-only plan. Some commenters raised concerns that IRS\u0092s interpretation was inconsistent with PPACA\u0092s goal of increasing access to affordable health insurance as it does not consider the higher cost of family insurance and could result in some children remaining uninsured. Under PPACA, CHIP is not funded beyond 2015, and states may opt to reduce CHIP eligibility or eliminate programs in fiscal year 2020. Without CHIP, more children could become uninsured. In May 2012, IRS finalized its rule but deferred finalizing the proposed affordability standard.", "GAO estimates that about 14 percent of children in January 2009 who met 2014 PPACA eligibility criteria for these programs experienced a change in household income that would affect eligibility within 1 year. Changes in eligibility among children in states without policies allowing them to remain eligible for Medicaid and CHIP for a full year were estimated to be higher than in states with such policies. Frequent eligibility changes could deter enrollment if the process for changing enrollment is burdensome.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided states with financial incentives and technical guidance to improve enrollment and to implement PPACA provisions.

What steps has CMS taken thus far to help states enroll eligible  children, and what challenges have states encountered?", "To examine the extent to which uninsured children would be eligible for  Medicaid, CHIP, or the premium tax credit under PPACA, we analyzed  2009 data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)\u2014 a nationally representative survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The SIPP follows households over a multiple-year period and collects  relevant information for each individual on a monthly basis, such as type  of health insurance (if any), amount and types of income, age, citizenship  status, and state of residence. To determine the reliability of SIPP data,  we reviewed related documentation and conducted electronic testing for  missing data, outliers, and apparent errors, and determined that the SIPP  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For purposes of this  analysis, we used final or proposed 2014 eligibility rules in place as of  April 2012. To estimate the percentage of uninsured children that would  be eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or the premium tax credit, we applied final  CMS and proposed IRS 2014 PPACA eligibility rules to SIPP data  representing the United States population of noninstitutionalized children  ages 0 through 18 in January 2009. Specifically, we calculated  household income expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty level  (FPL), based on IRS and CMS rules for counting household income and  family size for Medicaid, CHIP, and the premium tax credit. We compared  these calculations to federally specified FPL eligibility levels for the  premium tax credit and Medicaid and to state-specific Medicaid and CHIP  FPL eligibility levels, accounting for variation in eligibility levels for  children of specific ages. We also considered other eligibility criteria, such  as citizenship status, in our analyses. The estimates are based on 2009  data and do not project forward to 2014; rather, they illustrate what  uninsured children\u2019s eligibility for health insurance assistance would be  had 2014 PPACA eligibility rules as issued by CMS and IRS to date been  in place in 2009.

In developing our estimates, we considered  whether states had policies\u2014known as continuous eligibility\u2014that  allowed children to remain eligible for Medicaid and CHIP for a full year,  regardless of changes in household income.

In August 2011, CMS and IRS  separately issued three proposed rules to implement key PPACA  provisions related to eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid, CHIP, and the  premium tax credit; the CMS rules were finalized in March 2012.  According to CMS, more detailed guidance, such as the specific  information to be collected in the uniform application or the nature of the  data available from the federal hub, will be distributed at a later date. The  IRS proposed rule specified how to calculate household MAGI for  determining premium tax credit eligibility, and the CMS rules adopted  these methods for determining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, with certain  exceptions. IRS finalized its proposed rule in May 2012 with minimal  change to these methods. The IRS proposed rule also described the  standard for determining whether an individual has access to affordable  employer-sponsored insurance for purposes of determining eligibility for  the premium tax credit. Under the proposed affordability standard,  employer-sponsored insurance is considered affordable if the cost of a  self-only plan\u2014meaning a plan that only covers the employee\u2014does not  exceed 9.5 percent of household income. Under the proposed standard, if  one family member has access to affordable self-only employer- sponsored insurance, all other family members who are eligible to enroll  in the employee\u2019s plan are also considered to have access to affordable  insurance and are therefore ineligible for the premium tax credit. In this  manner, the proposed rule applied the same standard to all family  members eligible for the employee\u2019s plan, even if the cost of enrolling the  family as a whole exceeds the 9.5 percent threshold. In the preamble to  its proposed rule, IRS stated that the PPACA statute specifies using the  self-only insurance affordability standard for employees as well as for  spouses and dependents of an employee, citing a report issued by the  Joint Committee on Taxation that similarly interpreted the law. Some who  commented on the proposed rule suggested that it would be more  consistent with congressional intent to interpret the statute to require the  use of the cost to an employee of insuring all eligible family members in  determining access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance. In its  final premium tax credit rule, IRS confirmed that the proposed self-only  insurance affordability standard would apply to employees, but it deferred  a decision on the affordability standard for other eligible family members,  such as children, to future rule making.

They explained that although a self-only plan for the employee  may cost less than the 9.5 percent threshold, a family plan that would  also insure the employee\u2019s eligible family members could exceed it. As a  result, some employees would not be able to afford the higher premiums  to insure their family members, who therefore could remain uninsured.  We did not estimate the cost associated with defining the affordability  standard based on the cost of a family plan. The cost of such a change  would depend on multiple factors, many of which remain uncertain, such  as the availability of CHIP funding beyond 2015, the extent to which  eligible families avail themselves of the premium tax credit, employer  decisions, and the extent to which additional enrollees could affect the  aggregate cost of premiums. The Congressional Budget Office has  commented on the high degree of uncertainty inherent in projecting the  future actions of employees and employers under PPACA as well as  other factors that may affect federal costs, such as the number of  individuals and families who will have household income in specific  eligibility ranges in future years.", "We did not examine how many of the children estimated to be ineligible  for the premium tax credit because of access to affordable employer- sponsored insurance would become eligible if the affordability standard  were instead based on the cost of a family plan; the cost of family plans  available to employees who chose not to purchase them was not  available in the data we analyzed. However, separate data on the cost of  family plans among employees who purchased a family plan suggest that  some of these uninsured children, particularly those in families facing  higher-than-average premium contributions, could become eligible for the  premium tax credit if the affordability standard were based on the cost of  a family plan. For example, in a 2011 survey, the Kaiser Family  Foundation and Health Research & Education Trust found that on  average, employees contributed $4,129 annually for a family plan, or   28 percent of the total cost to the employer of an annual family premium,  which averaged $15,073. For a family of four with household income  equivalent to 250 percent of the FPL, $4,129 represents about 7 percent  of household income. However, the percentage of the annual premium  paid by employees ranged widely around this average, and 15 percent of  employees with family plans paid more than 50 percent of the annual  premium. For a family of four with household income equivalent to   250 percent of the FPL, paying 51 percent of the average annual  premium (or $7,687) would represent just over 13 percent of household  income, exceeding the 9.5 percent threshold.

Yet the cost of insuring other eligible family members could be  higher and potentially unaffordable for some families. One implication of  this proposal is that some families in which one member has an offer of  self-only, employer-sponsored health insurance could be less likely to  obtain family insurance than if no employer insurance were offered,  because of their ineligibility for the premium tax credit. We recognize that  in finalizing the affordability standard for an employee\u2019s eligible family  members, IRS must weigh many complex factors, such as costs to the  federal government and effects on employers and families, some of which  are difficult to predict, as well as the scope of its authority. However,  under the proposed standard, an offer of affordable employer-sponsored  health insurance to one family member could impede other family  members\u2019 access to affordable insurance\u2014an outcome which would not  further the broader goals of PPACA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In the Department of the Treasury\u2019s future rule making, we recommend  that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Commissioner  of Internal Revenue, consider the impact of the proposed standard for  determining affordability of employer-sponsored insurance on children  and other family members who are eligible to enroll, and whether it would  be consistent with the goals of PPACA to adopt an alternative approach  that would consider the cost of insuring eligible family members, or as  necessary, seek clarification from Congress regarding its intent with  respect to this standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to HHS and the  Department of the Treasury.

We  identified the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a  nationally representative, longitudinal survey conducted by the U.S.  Census Bureau, as a useful data set for our purposes because it provides  detailed monthly information over a multiyear period about specific types  of income, family relationships, and health insurance status of individuals  and households representing the civilian, noninstitutionalized population  of the United States. We analyzed data from the most recently available  SIPP, which began in 2008, and surveyed the occupants of approximately  42,000 households.", "Our analysis of SIPP data is subject to limitations. The analysis uses  2009 data to illustrate the extent to which uninsured children would be  eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or the premium credit program had proposed  and final 2014 PPACA eligibility rules been in effect at that time. To the  extent that patterns in household income, insurance status, or other  eligibility criteria differ in 2014, eligibility in 2014 will also differ. In  addition, the estimates are based on a sample of the population and may  differ from estimates that would be obtained if the full population had  been surveyed using the same methods, and the estimates are based on  self-reported information that may contain errors because of factors such  as differing interpretation of survey questions, inability or unwillingness of  survey participants to provide correct information, or data processing  errors. The Census Bureau reported that quality control and edit  procedures were used to reduce such errors.data have shown that the SIPP captures less income compared to other   Studies of SIPP income  surveys, particularly for higher-income survey participants.analysis focuses on lower-income survey participants, to the extent that  the SIPP data underrepresent income in this population as well, our  estimates would indicate that more children meet income requirements  for Medicaid or CHIP versus the premium tax credit, and for the premium  tax credit versus being ineligible for any type of assistance, than other  surveys might suggest. Our analysis variables approximate but do not  always fully capture key PPACA eligibility criteria, such as household  income or citizenship status, as described further below. To determine the  reliability of SIPP data, we reviewed related documentation and  conducted electronic testing for missing data, outliers, and apparent  errors. For example, we tested whether persons who reported being  uninsured in January 2009 had reported having health insurance in the  prior and following month. We also compared our results to estimates  based on data from another Census Bureau survey, the American  Community Survey, and to other studies that addressed related research  questions.

A child\u2019s eligibility for these programs is also based  on citizenship or legal residence, and, for the premium tax credit, on  whether the child is considered to have access to other affordable  insurance. From the available SIPP data, we developed variables for our  analysis based on these eligibility rules.", "Household composition. We created two household composition  variables for children on the basis of final CMS and proposed IRS rules  for determining household composition for the premium tax credit and for  Medicaid or CHIP.

Households of tax-dependent children included the child, the  child\u2019s taxpayer parents or guardians, and any other tax dependents of  the taxpayers, such as the child\u2019s siblings. When children lived with two  unmarried parents, the parent with the higher income was designated as  the taxpayer parent. This household composition variable did not account  for children who may be claimed as tax dependents by a noncustodial  parent or for spouses who choose to file taxes separately.", "The Medicaid household composition variable was the same as the  premium tax credit household composition variable, with certain  exceptions. When a tax-dependent child did not live with a taxpayer  parent or lived with two parents who were not married to one another, or  had household income below tax filing thresholds, the child\u2019s household  for purposes of determining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility was composed  of the child, the child\u2019s parents, siblings under age 19 (or ages 19 and 20  who were full-time students), and any children of the child.
