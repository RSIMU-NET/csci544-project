The Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) established end-use monitoring programs to ensure that these arms are used as intended. This report assesses the extent to which DOD and State (1) safeguard U.S. military technologies sold or exported to the Gulf countries, (2) provide similar or differing levels of protection for the same military technologies, and (3) vet recipients of U.S.-funded military training and equipment for potential human rights violations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws and regulations, analyzed data and documentation, and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and the Gulf countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Gaps in implementation limit the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to safeguard military equipment sold or exported to the Persian Gulf. Under the Golden Sentry program, DOD did not document its efforts to verify host country security and accountability procedures for sensitive military equipment, and DOD personnel in five of six Gulf countries did not document their activities to monitor less sensitive items. Under its Blue Lantern program, State officials conducted postshipment checks without visiting end-users of U.S. military equipment in 10 of 13 cases GAO reviewed, and delays in requesting and conducting checks have prevented State from verifying receipt of some items. In addition, State closed post-shipment checks without receiving confirmation of receipt in 2 of 13 cases GAO reviewed. DOD and State both treat night vision devices (NVD) as a sensitive technology, but their end-use monitoring for these items varies markedly, leaving them prone to diversion. Man-portable NVDs sold through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) must be tracked by serial number, inventoried following delivery, and inventoried periodically thereafter. In contrast, State does not track NVDs by serial number or conduct regular inventories for NVDs exported through direct commercial sales (DCS). As a result, less advanced NVDs purchased through FMS have received more rigorous monitoring than more advanced NVDs purchased through DCS. In Saudi Arabia, DOD officials inventoried thousands of second-generation NVDs that were purchased through FMS in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, State approved licenses for the sale of thousands of advanced, third-generation NVDs to Saudi Arabia since 2005, which are subject to less rigorous end-use monitoring. State has conducted human rights vetting for hundreds of individuals and units that were nominated for U.S.-funded training in the Gulf countries, but has not conducted comparable vetting for anticipated recipients of about $188 million in U.S.-funded equipment for Bahrain and Oman. Such vetting is especially critical given Bahrain's use of its security forces to quell public demonstrations since Spring 2011. In November 2010, State established a new system for human rights vetting in the Gulf countries and has since vetted almost 800 individuals and units nominated for U.S.-funded training. However, recipients of equipment are not screened through this system. According to State, it does not vet recipients of equipment at the individual or unit level because the recipients are not generally known at the time that the assistance is approved, and State does not have procedures in place to conduct vetting later in the acquisition process. DOD and State should harmonize their end-use monitoring for NVDs and strengthen procedures to verify compliance with security and accountability requirements, among other things. Also, State should implement individual- and unit-level human rights vetting for recipients of equipment. DOD agreed with all of the recommendations. State agreed with two of the recommendations, but disagreed that it should develop guidance on the use and timing of site visits and closure of Blue Lantern cases. GAO believes the recommendations remain valid on the need for policies, procedures, and guidance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Persian Gulf remains a region of significant national security concern  to the United States as Iran pursues nuclear weapons, the United States  continues to withdraw forces from Iraq, and political upheaval threatens  the stability of governments in the region.

If no derogatory information is found, State  notifies the embassy that the candidates have been approved, and  training may proceed.", "Under State\u2019s policy, the political section is the only section at post required to conduct  vetting.

U.S.-funded equipment provided  through certain programs is subject to the same human rights provisions  that apply to U.S.-funded training programs. State has conducted human  rights vetting for hundreds of individuals and units that received U.S.- funded training in the Gulf countries, but has not conducted comparable  vetting for the anticipated recipients of more than $188 million in U.S.- funded equipment for Bahrain and Oman. From fiscal years 2005 through  2010, Bahrain and Oman received about $148 million through the U.S.- funded Foreign Military Financing program to purchase military equipment  from the United States, including NVDs, missile systems, helicopters, and  small arms (see table 7). In addition, Bahrain was authorized to receive  equipment valued at about $40 million through the Excess Defense  Articles program. According to State officials, recipients of U.S.-funded  equipment would only be vetted if the same entities that received the  equipment also received U.S.-funded training.", "According to State, vetting for the anticipated recipients of equipment  currently takes place through memos drafted by State and cleared by the  relevant regional bureaus at the time that funding is allocated for the  countries that will receive assistance. In these memos, State regional  bureaus confirm, in consultation with the respective embassies, that they  are not aware of credible evidence of gross human rights violations by  any units that might receive assistance under the funding authorization.  However, according to State, the exact items to be financed and the exact  units or individuals to receive the items are not generally known at the  time the funding is obligated, and may not be known until many months or  even years later. The official that oversees human rights vetting at State  said that the anticipated recipient of equipment listed in the funding  allocation memos is typically not a specific unit or individual, but rather a  much higher-level entity, such as the Ministry of Interior, in the country  slated to receive assistance.", "State does not currently have procedures in place to conduct vetting later  in the acquisition process when the exact recipient unit or individual is  known. However, according to State, it is developing policy guidance and  identifying procedures to standardize the collection of timely information  on recipient units of equipment in order to conduct equipment vetting  through INVEST and improve the effectiveness of its vetting process. The  procedures will likely incorporate a two stage process. The first stage of  vetting would be initiated when State receives a formal request for  equipment. During this stage, the embassy, regional bureau, and the  Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor would sign off on a  memo similar to the current method of vetting for U.S.-funded equipment.  The second stage would occur near the end of the acquisition process  and before shipment of the equipment when the exact recipient of the  equipment is known.

However, gaps in implementing these programs in the  Gulf countries may limit the ability of DOD and State to adequately  safeguard defense articles upon their arrival, storage, and eventual use in  those countries. For example, both DOD and State view NVDs as a  sensitive technology sought by terrorists, but their approaches to  monitoring NVDs varies widely. Paradoxically, more modern third- generation NVDs sold to Gulf countries through direct commercial sales  receive less rigorous end-use monitoring than older, less advanced NVDs  purchased through FMS. Gaps in implementing State\u2019s Blue Lantern  monitoring program have resulted in State not physically verifying receipt  of some items or confirming some end-users\u2019 compliance with license  conditions\u2014even though State has identified the need for a postshipment  check\u2014thus reducing confidence in the security of arms exported to  these entities. Also, the absence of DOD documentation of its efforts both  to verify host country security and accountability procedures for sensitive  military equipment and to monitor less sensitive items limits assurance  that equipment sold through FMS is being used as intended. Moreover,  DOD\u2019s inability to obtain a required compliance plan from the UAE,  outlining its security and accountability procedures for more than 300  NVDs purchased since 2008, erodes confidence in the security of arms  sold to a country that has been used by illicit actors to transship sensitive  equipment. If the UAE does not provide a compliance plan, DOD could  consider not recommending further NVD sales through FMS.", "State and DOD have developed policies to prevent U.S. assistance from  being used to provide training for units or individuals who have committed  gross violations of human rights. However, State\u2019s absence of procedures  to conduct individual- and unit-level human rights vetting of recipients of  U.S.-funded equipment increases the risk that such equipment may  ultimately be used by violators of human rights.

DOD stated  that it welcomed this recommendation and offered to provide any  assistance needed to State to provide consistent monitoring of sensitive  technology regardless of the method through which the transfer is made.  State said that it intends to increase the number of end-use checks on  NVDs that are comparable to those sold through FMS. However, State  noted that human resource constraints in Washington, D.C., and at its  embassies around the world will pose the greatest challenge to achieving  full harmonization. Accordingly, it plans to explore how existing DOD  resources in-country may be leveraged to support end-use monitoring for  sensitive items exported through DCS.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to develop guidance requiring its  personnel to document efforts to verify host country security and  accountability procedures for sensitive equipment and activities to monitor  less sensitive equipment. DOD noted that forthcoming revisions to the  Security Assistance Management Manual will include new requirements  that address this recommendation. DOD also agreed with our  recommendation that it obtain from the UAE government an NVD  compliance plan, as required under the conditions of sale through FMS,  or develop an appropriate response. DOD stated that it has continued to  work with the UAE to obtain the plan and, on October 24, 2011, met with  UAE officials to inform them that NVD exports through FMS may be  affected if the UAE Ministry of Defense does not provide an NVD  compliance plan by December 31, 2011.", "State disagreed with our recommendation to issue policies and  procedures stipulating that U.S. embassy personnel conduct site visits to  end-users as part of requested postshipment checks. State said that we  misinterpreted data from certain cases to reach the conclusions that led  to this recommendation and that we based our conclusion on several  isolated examples of Blue Lantern checks conducted in the Gulf  countries. However, our recommendation is based on our finding that  when postshipment checks were requested, State inconsistently used site  visits to verify whether defense articles had been received by an end-user  and whether items were being used in accordance with the terms of their  licenses. We drew this conclusion by analyzing a sample of 13  postshipment checks which State requested for the Gulf countries from  fiscal years 2005 through 2010 and determining that U.S. embassy  officials conducted site visits to end-users for only 3 of these 13 checks.  Embassy officials did conduct site visits to private companies acting as  intermediaries in order to confirm that they were reliable recipients of U.S.  defense equipment in some cases, but the risk that U.S. equipment could  be lost or diverted is not limited to intermediaries. Separately, our report  cited specific examples of Blue Lantern checks to highlight State\u2019s  inconsistent use of site visits. For example, embassy officials did not  conduct site visits to verify receipt and confirm compliance with license  conditions in the UAE, even though they were requested to do so in their  tasking from State, whereas they did in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In its  comments, State also noted that it accepts host government official  assurances that equipment was received and inventory control and  accounting systems were working in certain appropriate instances.  However, without conducting a site visit, State was not able to verify that  items were being used in accordance with the terms of their license, a key  objective of the Blue Lantern program. Therefore, we continue to believe  that our recommendation on the need for policies and procedures on  using site visits remains valid.", "State also disagreed with our recommendation to provide guidance to its  Compliance Specialists on when to request embassy personnel to  conduct postshipment checks and when to close checks. We note that  our recommendation is not prescriptive and is designed to allow State  flexibility on when to request and close checks, but without losing the  opportunity to close them successfully. State commented that the Blue  Lantern checks cited in our report gave a misleading impression and led  to incorrect conclusions. Our report cited two instances when State could  not confirm receipt of NVDs or physically verify compliance with security  and accountability conditions for the recipients of these items because it  waited several years before requesting a check. In the first instance,  embassy officials in Qatar could not verify the location of a shipment of  NVDs, in part, because State waited three years after shipment to request  a check. State\u2019s comments on this draft did not explain why State waited  three years to request this check. In the second instance, State  intentionally waited until after the second and last of two NVD shipments  to Saudi Arabia to request a check, at which point the items had been  issued to different units located throughout the country and were not  available for inventory. However, State offered no explanation for why it  waited 18 months after final export to request the check. As we noted in  the report, State lacks internal guidance that would help inform its  decision of when to conduct a postshipment check.", "We continue to believe that State Compliance Specialists could benefit  from guidance on when to close Blue Lantern cases and, therefore, we  have not modified our recommendation. In our report, we also cite 2  examples of postshipment checks among the 13 we reviewed in which  State closed Blue Lantern cases as favorable before receiving  confirmation from embassy officials that the end-user had received the  items. In its written comments, State noted that in both of these cases  embassy officials confirmed the bona fides of the transactions. We have  added language to the report to reflect State\u2019s comments. While this  statement is accurate, it misses our point. In both instances, State also  explicitly requested that embassy officials verify receipt of the items by  the end-user. Although embassy officials reported back to State that they  were not able to verify receipt by the end-user, State closed both cases  as favorable instead of leaving these cases open until embassy officials  could confirm receipt.", "State agreed with our recommendation to implement individual- and unit- level human rights vetting for recipients of U.S.-funded equipment and  noted that it is already working on plans to improve human rights vetting  procedures with the aim of more effectively screening recipients of  equipment.

For DOD\u2019s Golden Sentry end-use monitoring program, we reviewed  relevant program guidance in the Security Assistance Management Manual  and standard operating procedures used by the Security Cooperation  Organizations in the Gulf countries. We also reviewed reports summarizing  the findings from DOD\u2019s Compliance Assessment Visits in the Gulf  countries. We interviewed and obtained documentation from U.S. officials  in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Defense Technology Security  Administration, and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). We also  interviewed officials representing military departments that implement  Foreign Military Sales (FMS), including the Navy International Programs  Office, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Defense  Exports and Cooperation, and the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of  the Air Force for International Affairs. We traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,  and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and interviewed U.S. officials  in the respective Security Cooperation Organizations responsible for  conducting end-use monitoring. We observed U.S. officials conducting end- use monitoring for night vision devices (NVD) and Advanced Medium  Range Air-to-Air Missiles in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, respectively. We  also interviewed host country officials in these two countries to discuss their  end-use monitoring procedures. We conducted phone interviews with U.S.  embassy officials responsible for Golden Sentry end-use monitoring in the  other four Gulf countries.", "To determine the total number of defense articles requiring enhanced end- use monitoring in the Gulf countries and their inventory status, we obtained  and analyzed data from DOD\u2019s end-use monitoring database\u2014the Security  Cooperation Information Portal (SCIP). Specifically, the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency queried the SCIP to provide us with \u201cAd Hoc\u201d reports  for each of the Gulf countries, which included information on the defense  articles purchased by each country; the date that these items were last  inventoried; and their \u201cdisposition status,\u201d that is, the status of their  inventories. We cross referenced these data by comparing the total count  for each defense article in the \u201cAd Hoc\u201d report to the \u201cSCIP Quantity\u201d in  each country\u2019s Enhanced End-Use Monitoring Reconciliation Report, which  includes all the sensitive defense articles that have been purchased by the  Gulf countries and entered into the SCIP database, and were able to  confirm most quantities. As a result, we determined the SCIP data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this engagement. To determine the  total number of sensitive defense articles in the Gulf countries that require  enhanced end-use monitoring and the inventory status of these defense  articles, we collapsed the 12 \u201cdisposition status\u201d categories into 4 new  categories\u2014\u201dobserved or inventoried;\u201d \u201cnot observed or inventoried;\u201d  \u201cdisposed, demilitarized, or expended in training;\u201d and \u201cinventory loss.\u201d We  excluded defense articles that had been purchased by the Gulf countries  but had not yet been delivered to these countries.

We interviewed officials in State\u2019s  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls who administer the Blue Lantern  program and review export licenses. We also interviewed U.S. embassy  officials in the Gulf countries that conduct Blue Lantern checks. We  traveled to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to interview Blue Lantern points of  contact and conducted phone interviews with embassy officials in the  other four Gulf countries. In Saudi Arabia, we observed a Blue Lantern  postshipment check for NVDs. We also interviewed host country officials  in Saudi Arabia and the UAE to discuss their end-use monitoring  procedures. We obtained information from State on \u201cunfavorable\u201d Blue  Lantern checks in the Gulf countries that were referred to enforcement  and we reviewed State\u2019s Compliance Office Reports detailing  enforcement actions taken as a result of Blue Lantern checks. Finally, we  received a briefing from State officials on potential violations of the Arms  Export Control Act of 1976 involving the Gulf countries, which have been  communicated to Congress through section 3 reports.", "To summarize the number and type of Blue Lantern checks conducted in  the Gulf countries, we obtained and analyzed data from State on checks  conducted in the Gulf countries from fiscal years 2005 through 2010.  These data included 23 checks classified as \u201cno action,\u201d in which U.S.  embassies were not tasked by State to conduct a check, and 8 checks  classified as \u201cno response,\u201d in which State either did not receive a  response from post or State deemed the response unsatisfactory. We  excluded these 31 checks from our analysis. To determine the reliability  of these data, we cross-referenced license numbers between State\u2019s Blue  Lantern and licensing databases, and we used State cables to  corroborate various fields in the Blue Lantern database. We determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To more closely  examine how State carries out Blue Lantern checks, we drew a  nongeneralizable sample of 34 Blue Lantern checks\u2014including 25  selected randomly and 9 selected judgmentally\u2014and requested State  cables for these checks. First, we selected a random sample of 25 checks  out of 77 that State initiated involving the Gulf countries during fiscal  years 2009 and 2010. We limited our sample to checks during these  years to increase the likelihood that the embassy officials who conducted  these checks would still be in their current positions, thereby enabling  further discussion about the specific details of the checks. We stratified  our sample by the results of the checks. Specifically, we sampled 100  percent of the \u201cunverifiable\u201d cases, 50 percent of the \u201cunfavorable\u201d cases,  25 percent of the \u201cfavorable\u201d cases, and 25 percent of the \u201cno action\u201d  cases. Our random sample included both prelicense and postshipment  checks and included at least one case from each country. We also  judgmentally selected an additional six cases for our sample that involved  checks on NVDs that were conducted during fiscal years 2005 through  2010. We included checks on NVDs in our sample because they are a  sensitive military technology and are the only item sold through both FMS  and DCS to the Gulf countries that are on DOD\u2019s list of items requiring  enhanced end-use monitoring. In addition, we judgmentally selected three  cases from fiscal years 2005 through 2010 that were designated by State  as priority level 2, or higher priority, Blue Lantern checks. Priority level 2  checks are based on more substantial indications that a violation of the  International Traffic in Arms Regulations may have occurred or will be  attempted. We requested both the cables from State to the embassy and  the embassy\u2019s response cable to State for each of our sample cases.  State was unable to provide us with the cables for 11 of the 34 cases  because officials decided not to send a cable requesting the embassy to  conduct a Blue Lantern check in those cases. Our final sample included  23 cases\u20146 prelicense checks and 17 postshipment checks. Of those 17  postshipment checks, 4 involved checks on brokers, and were not  associated with verifying the delivery of specific items on a license. The  remaining 13 postshipment checks consisted of 8 we selected randomly  and 5 we selected judgmentally. We then analyzed and recorded  information about each case, including the subject of the check, the  commodity checked, the time it took post to conduct the check, license  conditions, whether or not site visits were requested and conducted,  inventories requested and conducted, and any follow-up that post  indicated was necessary.", "To assess the extent to which DOD and State provide similar or differing  levels of protection for the same military technologies sold or exported to  the Gulf countries, we interviewed DOD and State officials in Washington,  D.C., and the Gulf countries, as well as host country officials in Saudi  Arabia and the UAE. This included the Defense Security Cooperation  Agency and State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, who oversee  end-use monitoring for NVDs purchased by the Gulf countries through  FMS and DCS, respectively, and the Defense Technology Security  Administration, which is responsible for setting policy and reviewing  requests for the sale or export of NVDs. We received a briefing on, and  practiced using various types of image intensification and thermal NVDs  at the Army\u2019s Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate in Fort  Belvoir, Virginia. Additionally, we observed DOD and State officials  conduct a serial number inventory of NVDs in Saudi Arabia as part of a  Blue Lantern postshipment check. We reviewed DOD and State end-use  monitoring program guidance, DOD polices regarding the transfer and  end-use monitoring for NVDs, and NVD security and accountability  requirements included in DCS license provisos and FMS Letters of Offer  and Acceptance. We obtained and analyzed DOD end-use monitoring  data on the number of NVD systems subject to enhanced end-use  monitoring in the Gulf countries, and we reviewed Blue Lantern data and  cables associated with checks conducted on NVDs in these countries.", "In order to identify export licenses for NVDs and determine the extent to  which State has conducted Blue Lantern postshipment checks on  shipments associated with these licenses, we requested State\u2019s defense  exports licensing data for the Gulf countries from fiscal year 2005 through  May 2011. We checked the licensing data for duplicate records and  cross-referenced selected licenses for NVDs with information from the  Blue Lantern database and determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of identifying licenses for NVD exports to the Gulf  countries. To determine the universe of licenses for exports to the Gulf  countries that included NVD technology, we first conducted a key word  search on terms associated with NVD technology\u2014including \u201cimage  intensifiers,\u201d \u201cthermals,\u201d \u201cnight vision,\u201d \u201cinfrared,\u201d and \u201cForward Looking  Infrared (FLIR)\u201d systems\u2014in pertinent database fields. To ensure that we  captured all relevant licenses for NVD technology, we also manually  reviewed all licenses for exports to the Gulf countries that included U.S.  Munitions List Category XII(c) items\u2014the category that includes NVD  technology. Next, we pared down our master list in several ways. First,  we limited our list to licenses that were approved from fiscal years 2005  through 2010 to maintain consistency with the Blue Lantern data we  received. Second, we limited the licenses to those with security and  accountability provisos for permanent export to the Gulf countries by  checking the relevant fields in State\u2019s licensing data and then vetting the  list of licenses we developed with the Defense Technology Security  Administration to ensure that they all had security and accountability  provisos. Third, with the exception of image intensifier tubes, we excluded  licenses that were exclusively spare parts for NVD systems, rather than  full NVD systems. Finally, to make an appropriate comparison with NVDs  sold through FMS that are subject to enhanced end-use monitoring, we  further limited the DCS licenses to those that may be used as man- portable systems. We identified 45 licenses for nonthermal NVDs and 6  licenses for thermal imaging systems that met all of our criteria. We  shared our list of NVD licenses with the Army\u2019s Night Vision and  Electronic Sensors Directorate to confirm that the licenses were all NVDs  and distinguish those that were man-portable from those that were  platform-mounted. We also provided our list to State in order to verify  whether shipments had been made on these licenses as of September 9,  2011. State verified that complete shipments had been made on 34 of the  45 licenses for man-portable NVDs authorized for export to the Gulf  countries.", "To assess the extent to which DOD and State vet recipients of military  training and equipment for human rights concerns, we reviewed relevant  laws, including the \u201cLeahy Law\u201d in the Foreign Assistance Act and DOD\u2019s  2011 appropriations bill, the most recent version of DOD\u2019s \u201cLeahy\u201d  provision. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s and State\u2019s vetting policies and  procedures, including State\u2019s Guide to the Vetting Process; State\u2019s  International Vetting and Security Tracking (INVEST) User Guide; and  standard operating procedures used by the U.S. embassies in Kuwait,  Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to conduct vetting. We interviewed officials in  State\u2019s Bureaus of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and Near  Eastern Affairs that oversee and conduct vetting, respectively, in  Washington, D.C., and U.S. embassy officials that conduct human rights  vetting in the Gulf countries. To determine the amounts of U.S.-funded  training and equipment provided to the Gulf countries that are subject to  human rights vetting, we reviewed State\u2019s annual Congressional Budget  Justification documents, DOD\u2019s and State\u2019s jointly-developed Foreign  Military Training reports, and DOD data on the value of Excess Defense  Articles authorized for Bahrain. To determine the number of individuals and  units in the Gulf countries that have been vetted through INVEST, we  obtained data from State\u2019s INVEST database. These data included  information on the type of training provided, the agency sponsoring the  training, the funding source, the event date, and the status of vetting,  among other things. We cross referenced these data with documentation of  vetting we obtained from U.S. embassies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to describe the number  of individuals and units in the Gulf countries for which State had completed  human rights vetting. To determine State\u2019s process for vetting recipients of  U.S.-funded equipment in the Gulf countries for human rights concerns, we  interviewed officials from State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and  Labor, and received written responses to questions from State\u2019s Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 to November  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

We did not recommend that State conduct a 100 percent check on all  NVD exports; rather, we recommended that State and DOD take steps  to harmonize their approaches to end-use monitoring for NVDs to  ensure that these sensitive items receive equal levels of protection  regardless of how they are obtained. Nonetheless, in DOD\u2019s comments  on this draft it offered to provide any assistance needed to State to  ensure that sensitive items are appropriately monitored by both  agencies.     2.  State asserted that our report does not consider that the number and  type of NVDs sold through FMS may vary from those exported through  DCS. However, we accounted for this possible difference by limiting our  analysis to a comparison of State\u2019s and DOD\u2019s end-use monitoring for  man-portable NVDs\u2014the primary focus of DOD\u2019s end-use monitoring  for NVDs. Specifically, DOD conducts enhanced end-use monitoring  (i.e., delivery verification by serial number and regular follow-up serial  number inventories) for man-portable NVDs, whereas it conducts  routine end-use monitoring (i.e., observations in conjunction with other  duties) for platform-mounted NVDs, such as the larger infrared devices  cited by State. Accordingly, we did not recommend that State or DOD  conduct a 100 percent check on every NVD sale or export, but rather  that they harmonize their approaches to end-use monitoring for NVDs  to ensure equal protection for these sensitive items regardless of the  method of transfer.   3.  State asserted that our conclusion on State\u2019s inconsistent use of site  visits is based on isolated Blue Lantern cases that give a misleading  impression. However, we drew our conclusion based on an analysis  of a sample of 13 postshipment checks that State requested in the  Gulf countries from fiscal years 2005 through 2010. We determined  that U.S. embassy officials conducted site visits to end-users for only  3 of these 13 checks. Separate from this analysis, we cited examples  in our report of instances in which State did and did not conduct site  visits to end-users to verify receipt and confirm compliance with  license conditions for sensitive defense articles. For example, we  noted two instances in which embassy officials in Saudi Arabia and  Qatar conducted site visits to end-users to verify receipt and confirm  compliance with license conditions. In contrast, we cited another  example to illustrate an instance when embassy officials in the UAE  did not conduct a site visit, as requested by State.         4.  State\u2019s assertion that it did not request a site visit in this instance  differs from our documentary evidence. For this postshipment check,  State requested that embassy officials verify the serial numbers for a  shipment of NVDs and confirm that all of the devices were secure,  functional, and being used only for the purpose stated on the license.  Moreover, State explicitly asked in its tasking cable that embassy  officials conduct a site visit to gather and verify this information.  However, as State notes in its comments, embassy officials did not  conduct a site visit in this instance. Instead, the embassy received a  fax from the UAE Armed Forces 14 months after the check was  requested stating that all the items had been fully received. The fax  did not comment on whether the NVDs were being used in  accordance with the authorized end-use and license provisos.   5.  We cited this Blue Lantern check as an example of an instance in  which delays in requesting and conducting a check prevented State  from conducting a serial number inventory of a shipment of NVDs or  verifying that these items were being stored in secure facilities. State  said that it did not request a site visit because it was sufficiently  satisfied with assurances from the Saudi authorities that the items had  been received and were being used according to the provisions of the  export license. However, during our fieldwork in Saudi Arabia, we  accompanied an embassy official on the Blue Lantern check in which  he attempted to conduct a serial number inventory of the 766 NVDs  shipped on this license. However, the Saudi authorities informed the  embassy official that the devices had been issued to units located  throughout the country. As a result, he was unable to independently  verify that the NVDs had been received and were being used in  accordance with the provisions of their license. State further asserts  that it intentionally waited until final export before initiating the  postshipment check for these NVDs in order to make optimal use of  resources by conducting a single check to cover all of the items  exported. However, rather than initiate the check immediately  following final export, State waited an additional 18 months to conduct  the check (more than three years after the first of two shipments of  NVDs). State\u2019s comments on this draft did not explain why State  waited 18 months after final export to conduct the check.  6.  While State\u2019s written comments noted that, in both of these cases,  embassy officials confirmed the bona fides of the transactions, this  misses our point. We cited these two cases as examples of Blue  Lantern checks that were closed as favorable before receiving  confirmation that the end-user had received the items. In both of the  cases cited in our report, State explicitly requested in its tasking  cables that embassy officials verify receipt of the items by the end- user. Although embassy officials reported back to State that they were  not able to verify receipt by the end-user, State closed both cases as  favorable instead of leaving these cases open until embassy officials  could confirm receipt.   7.  We agree that officials from Embassy Abu Dhabi visited the  intermediary and confirmed the bona fides of this transaction.  However, State explicitly requested in its tasking cable that U.S.  officials verify receipt of the thermal imaging camera by the UAE  Armed Forces. In this instance, embassy officials were unable to  confirm receipt by the UAE Armed Forces because the camera was  still being held by the consignee. Rather than leave the Blue Lantern  case open until embassy officials could verify receipt, State closed the  case as favorable and did not request that Embassy Abu Dhabi  conduct any additional follow-up.    8.  We agree that officials from Embassy Muscat visited the intermediary  and confirmed the bona fides of the transaction. However, State  asked in its tasking cable that Embassy Muscat verify that the Royal  Court received the firearms. When Embassy Muscat notified State  that the firearms had not yet been received by the Royal Court, State  closed the case as favorable. It was not until later that State received  written confirmation from the Omani intermediary that it had received  the firearms and delivered them to the Royal Court.   9.  We agree and did not intend to imply that INVEST was implemented  only in the Persian Gulf countries. We revised the report to clarify that  INVEST was implemented worldwide in 2010 and 2011 to facilitate  human rights vetting.   10. We list the six Persian Gulf countries that are included in the scope of  this study in the Highlights page and on the first page of the report.  We do not believe any additional clarification is necessary.    11. While Bahrain is the only Gulf country included in the scope of this  study to have experienced ongoing public demonstrations, Oman and  Saudi Arabia have also experienced some degree of political unrest in  2011. We have modified the language in the report to clarify this  distinction.   12. We agree and have revised the report to refer more broadly to  Bahrain\u2019s security forces, rather than Bahrain\u2019s military."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Key contributors to this report were Joseph A.
