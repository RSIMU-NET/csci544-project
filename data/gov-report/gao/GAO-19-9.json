Under the Act  generally, it is a federal crime for any person to knowingly or intentionally  manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess marijuana. As part of its  marijuana enforcement efforts, DEA began providing financial assistance  to state and local law enforcement agencies to support their efforts to  eradicate and suppress illegal, domestically-grown marijuana in 1979.  DEA formally established this assistance through its Domestic Cannabis  Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) in 1981.

The August  2013 guidance instructed DOJ\u2019s prosecutorial and law enforcement  components to focus marijuana enforcement efforts on priorities that were  particularly important to the federal government, leaving all other  enforcement of state law pertaining to marijuana-related activity to state  and local law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies. We  recommended that DOJ document a plan specifying its monitoring  process, and share the plan with DOJ components. DOJ concurred with  the recommendations.

He stated that the  completeness of supporting documentation he collects varies by  participating agency within his region. For example, one participating  state agency in his region submits supporting documentation to DEA  for pre-approved equipment purchases only, but maintains supporting  documentation for other expenditures internally as required.

However,  among the six states we contacted, officials from participating agencies in  four states and a DCE/SP coordinator from a fifth state told us that they  also include information on activities from nonparticipating agencies in the  information reported to DEA. As a result of this broadening of  information being reported, DEA does not have a fully accurate  representation of the activities being performed by agencies receiving  DCE/SP funding. Officials from these five states told us that they  included this information to provide DEA with a more comprehensive  assessment of the illegal domestic marijuana cultivation issue in their  area. DEA headquarters officials were not aware of this reporting  practice. Moreover, officials said that participating agencies should only  report information resulting from their DCE/SP-funded operations, which  may include results from support they provide to nonparticipating  agencies. For example, if a participating agency provides support to a  nonparticipating agency in the form of aircraft surveillance to help identify  illegal grow sites, or additional officers to assist with an eradication  operation, the participating agency should report the results from those  activities to DEA. However, these expectations are not defined in DEA  guidance.", "DEA guidance also states that participating agencies should make every  effort to not report eradication and suppression information resulting from  interdiction activities, which are not considered DCE/SP-funded  operations. For example, marijuana seized by a participating agency  during a routine traffic stop\u2014a type of interdiction activity\u2014should not be  reported. However, we found that participating agencies had varying  understandings of whether or not to report this information to DEA. As a  result, information DEA collects from these officials is not consistent.  Specifically, we identified three different practices that participating  agencies followed to report eradication and suppression information  resulting from routine traffic stops:  report marijuana seized during routine traffic stops only if the  marijuana can be linked back to a domestic source;  report all marijuana seized during routine traffic stops irrespective of  source; and do not report any marijuana seized during routine traffic stops.", "Further, we found that DEA field officials responsible for providing  guidance to participating agencies had varying understandings of whether  participating agencies should report information on marijuana seized  during routine traffic stops to DEA. For example, two DCE/SP  coordinators told us that information resulting from routine traffic stops  should not be reported because DCE/SP is focused on the eradication of  illegal marijuana grow sites. However, 3 of the 4 DEA regional contractors  we spoke with said that participating agencies should report information  resulting from routine traffic stops only if the marijuana seized can be  tracked to a domestic source.", "DEA headquarters officials were not aware of these differing reporting  practices and varying understandings. Headquarters officials told us that  they expect participating agencies to report information on marijuana  seized during routine traffic stops only if the marijuana can be linked to a  domestic source. However, our assessment is that this expectation is not  consistent with DEA\u2019s written guidance. Officials explained that  interdiction activities, such as routine traffic stops, are relevant to  marijuana suppression, especially in light of recent changes in illegal  marijuana cultivation and trafficking trends. For example, according to  DEA officials, Kansas\u2014a state without marijuana legalization\u2014has  recently experienced a decrease in the number of illegal outdoor  marijuana grow sites in conjunction with an increase in the amount of  illegal domestic marijuana being trafficked into the state from Colorado\u2014 a state with recreational and medical marijuana legalization.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should use quality information\u2014including accurate and  consistent information\u2014to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.

Baselines  enable decision makers to assess the program\u2019s performance over time.  Identifying and reporting deviations from the baseline as a program  proceeds provides valuable oversight by identifying areas of program risk  and their causes to decision makers. Measurable targets help decision  makers conduct assessments of whether program goals were achieved.

However, officials said that setting measurable targets  would be challenging because of factors outside of DEA\u2019s control that  may affect eradication efforts, including extreme weather events and  changes in illegal marijuana cultivation and trafficking trends. However,  DEA currently has performance measures with measurable targets for  some of its drug enforcement-related programs and activities. For  example, DEA has a performance measure with a measurable target for  its agency-wide objective related to dismantling drug trafficking  organizations\u2014maximizing the monetary value of currency, property, and  drugs seized. This performance measure reflects the outcomes of  multiple activities across DEA, including DCE/SP. Further, while we agree  that developing drug enforcement-related performance measures with  measurable targets may be difficult, targets can help DEA evaluate past  performance and make informed decisions about future operations,  including allocating resources or developing strategies for the purpose of  maintaining or improving performance.", "GPRAMA directs agencies to develop and document goals, as well as  performance measures to assess progress towards their goals. While  those requirements are applicable to the department or agency level  (e.g., DOJ), we have previously reported that they can serve as leading  practices at other organizational levels, including the program, project, or  activity level. Agencies can use performance measurement to make  various types of management decisions to improve programs and results,  such as developing strategies and allocating resources, including  identifying problems and taking corrective action when appropriate.
