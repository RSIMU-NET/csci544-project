Policy, Plans, and Engagement (PPE) is to develop and coordinate security policies, programs, directives, strategies, and initiatives, while overseeing industry engagement. In fiscal years 2017 through 2019, TSA reported using surface program resources for non-surface activities. For example, in fiscal year 2018, TSA reprogrammed $5 million from the Surface Programs account to the Mission Support account to address security requirements and increase hiring of transportation security officers.

Surface transportation systems generally rely on an open  infrastructure that can be difficult to monitor and secure due to its multiple  access points and lack of access barriers. Securing these modes can be  further complicated by the number of private and public stakeholders  involved in operating and protecting them and the need to balance  security with the expeditious flow of people and goods.", "Within the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the primary entity  responsible for securing surface transportation modes. TSA\u2019s surface  domain includes nearly 140,000 miles of railroad track, over 2.7 million  miles of pipeline, and 4 million miles of roads. There are 10 billion annual  passenger trips on mass transit systems, including 25 million students on  school buses each day.

TSA receives funding each fiscal year  to protect the surface transportation modes and allocates these resources  to support programs and personnel.", "We previously reported that TSA\u2019s role in surface transportation security  varies by mode. Unlike the aviation environment where TSA has  operational responsibility for screening passengers and baggage, TSA  has a limited operational role for securing surface transportation  systems. TSA mainly provides guidance and encourages voluntary implementation of security best practices to surface transportation  entities, and relies on cooperation from system operators, and local,  state, and federal security partners. For example, TSA engages with  system operators and governmental security partners through its  voluntary Intermodal Security Training and Exercise Program (I-STEP) to  enhance surface transportation security. In addition, TSA plays a  regulatory role in passenger and freight rail through inspections to ensure  operators are complying with regulatory requirements.", "The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for us to  review TSA\u2019s surface transportation resources and coordination between  relevant entities related to surface transportation.
