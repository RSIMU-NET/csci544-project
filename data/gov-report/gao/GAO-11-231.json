The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required GAO to review the use of these funds. GAO reviewed (1) what is known about the utilization and effectiveness of DOD Impact Aid funds, (2) the challenges faced by school districts in serving military dependent students, and (3) how DOD and Education have collaborated on their assistance. To address these issues, GAO conducted a Web-based survey of all 154 school districts that received DOD Impact Aid in any year from 2001 to 2009, with a response rate of 77 percent. GAO also interviewed officials from DOD and Education and seven school districts in five states, ranging in school district size, location, and percentage of military dependent students. The findings from these visits cannot be projected nationwide, but illustrate valuable perspectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD Impact Aid has three distinct funding components, with more than three quarters of the funds provided through the DOD Impact Aid Supplemental program. Eighty five percent of the 87 responding school districts that received funds for the 2009-2010 school year reported placing these funds into their general fund to use for overall maintenance and operations. Because there are no reporting requirements on districts' use of the funding, it is difficult to assess how the funds are used and to what extent military dependent students benefit. Further, there are no data available on these students that could be used to assess their academic achievement or educational outcomes, or determine where funding needs are greatest. Such reporting requirements exist for certain other groups of students, such as economically disadvantaged students and students with disabilities. Federal agency officials acknowledged this need for information, and Education has begun discussing how to address this need. School districts GAO contacted reported that issues related to the mobility of military dependent students and serving students with special needs were among the greatest challenges they faced in serving these students. Mobility increased academic needs due to differences in state and district curricula and behavioral and emotional issues in the classroom. To address challenges in serving military dependent students, school districts reported adopting a range of strategies, including additional counseling for students with a deployed parent and flexibility on academic requirements for newly transferred students. Guided by a memorandum of understanding signed in 2008, DOD and Education have implemented practices that facilitate their collaboration to assist military dependent students, according to practices GAO has identified that enhance collaboration. For example, beginning in 2008, the departments completed eight joint site visits to high-growth military installations, which helped them advise school districts on preparation for an influx of military dependent students. To monitor these collaborative efforts, DOD and Education have developed a strategic plan that tracks their progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Education determine whether to require school districts to report data on the academic outcomes of military dependent students, and if so, to determine the need for any additional legislative authority.

The majority of these  students are estimated to attend public schools. Military dependent  children often move multiple times throughout their school careers and  sometimes have a parent absent due to deployment, creating unique  challenges for their school districts. In recent years, appropriations for the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Impact Aid program has been  more than $1 billion a year. Since the early 1990s, Congress has authorized  and provided additional funds for school districts that serve a significant  number of military dependents. One of several Department of Defense  (DOD) programs to assist these students\u2014DOD Impact Aid, with funding  totaling approximately $342.3 million since fiscal year 2002\u2014helps to  ensure that school districts with significant numbers of military dependent  students have additional funding in order to maintain certain educational  standards. Education of military dependent students is becoming an  increasingly important issue with recent growth in and moves of military  personnel at some military installations located in the United States. These  changes are due to several factors, including implementation of  recommendations from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)", "Commission, relocation of U.S. forces in overseas locations back to the  United States, global rebasing, and other force structure changes.

To do this, we  reviewed (1) what is known about the use and effectiveness of DOD  Impact Aid funds, (2) the challenges faced by school districts in serving  military dependent students and the strategies they have in place to  address these challenges, and (3) how DOD and Education have  collaborated on their assistance to districts.", "To address these issues, we conducted a Web-based survey in August and  September 2010 of all 154 school districts that received DOD Impact Aid in  any year from 2001 through 2009\u2014we received responses from 118, for a  response rate of 77 percent. We conducted site visits to four school  districts in Colorado and Virginia and phone calls with officials in three  school districts in California, Missouri, and Texas. We selected these  districts based on recommendations from DOD and national organizations  involved in the education of military dependent students, and attempted to  include diversity in geographic location, school district size, and the  percentage of the district made up of military dependents from different  branches of military service. During the visits we interviewed  superintendents, assistant superintendents, budget office officials,  guidance counselors, and, in some locations, military school liaisons,  teachers, and students. In one school district, we met with a group of  parents. We also interviewed officials from DOD and Education who are  involved with the implementation of DOD Impact Aid and the related  memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two agencies. Finally,  we reviewed key agency documents and relevant literature, including prior  GAO reports on elementary and secondary education, military  restructuring, and practices that can help to enhance collaboration.

DOD  Impact Aid was established in the early 1990s to supplement the Education  Impact Aid program which, as we testified at that time, was underfunded  (i.e., meaning that appropriations did not fully fund authorizations).  Together, the programs are intended to compensate school districts for  revenue losses resulting from federal activities and to maintain  educational standards for all students. Federal activities that can affect  revenues or the ability to maintain standards include federal ownership of  property within a district as well as the enrollment of children whose  parents work or live on federal land (e.g., military bases).", "Education Impact Aid funds are awarded in formula grants based on  various types of federally connected children in the school district and  other measures. If appropriations are not sufficient to provide funding at  the level for which all districts qualify, funding is reduced with more  heavily impacted districts receiving higher percentages of their maximum  payments than less impacted districts. Of the more than 14,000 school  districts nationwide, 902 received Education Impact Aid payments for  federally connected children in fiscal year 2009. Because Impact Aid  payments are not aimed at specific educational goals, accountability  requirements for the use of funds or for specific outcomes are minimal.", "DOD Impact Aid, administered by DOD\u2019s Education Activity (DoDEA)  Educational Partnership office is intended to supplement the much larger  Education Impact Aid program. All districts that receive DOD Impact Aid  also receive Education Impact Aid. There are no statutory requirements  mandating that school districts report on the use of these funds. DOD  Impact Aid has three distinct funding components for school districts with  military dependent students. These funding components are:    Supplemental assistance. These funds are allocated to school districts in  which military dependents made up at least 20 percent of average daily  attendance during the previous school year. Data from Education\u2019s  Impact Aid application are used to determine a district\u2019s eligibility. About  120 districts receive funds from DOD Impact Aid Supplemental assistance  annually. Total amounts awarded to all districts combined have ranged  from $30 to $40 million in each fiscal year from 2002 through 2010, and  the funding has been included by Congress in DOD\u2019s annual appropriation  for operation and maintenance for defensewide activities.", "Assistance for children with severe disabilities. Funds are allocated to  school districts with at least two military dependent children with severe  disabilities where the costs exceed certain criteria. The funding is a  reimbursement for expenses paid, and is sent to the school districts after  the expenses are incurred. According to a DOD official, approximately 40\u2013 50 school districts that apply and meet the cost criteria are awarded funds  each year out of the 400\u2013500 school districts that are potentially eligible.  Total amounts awarded to all districts combined have generally ranged  from $4 to $5 million in each fiscal year from 2002 through 2010.", "Assistance for districts significantly affected by BRAC. Funds are  allocated to school districts that have been heavily impacted as a direct  result of large scale military rebasing. Beginning in the late 1980s, the U.S.  military has attempted to streamline the nation\u2019s defense infrastructure  through a series of base realignments and closures. For example, as part of  the 2005 BRAC round, DOD has relocated or plans to relocate more than  120,000 military and DOD civilian personnel by September 2011. In  addition, DOD and local community officials expect thousands of  dependents to relocate to communities near the BRAC 2005 growth bases.  Thus, several U.S. bases could each see the addition of more than 10,000  military and DOD civilian personnel, along with their families and  children. To qualify for these DOD Impact Aid BRAC funds, districts must  have had at least 20 percent military dependent students in average daily  attendance during the previous school year and have had an overall  increase or decrease of 5 percent or more of these students, or an increase  or decrease of no less than 250 military dependent students at the end of  the prior school year. No school district is permitted to receive more than  $1 million in assistance in a fiscal year. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, 45  districts received BRAC funding from DOD Impact Aid totaling $15  million.

Unlike the  Supplemental Impact Aid program, the DoDEA grants are targeted for  specific uses and have specific evaluation requirements. The competitive  grant program aims to enhance student achievement, provide professional  development for educators, and integrate technology into curricula at  schools experiencing growth in numbers of military dependent students.  The invitational grant program aims to enhance student achievement and  ease challenges that military dependent students face due to their parents\u2019  military service.

Further, there are no tracking or reporting requirements on the  expenditures of funds and, as a result, there is no way to determine  specifically how the funds are used. However, school districts that expend  $500,000 or more are subject to a financial audit in accordance with the  Single Audit Act. Fewer than 20 percent of the districts that responded to  our survey reported using a separate accounting code to track  expenditures of DOD Impact Aid Supplemental funds.", "School districts that completed our survey had mixed opinions regarding  how easy or challenging it is or would be to track how they spend DOD  Impact Aid Supplemental funds. Thirty-nine percent of districts receiving  these funds said it would be easy for them to track the funds\u2019 use. For  example, some districts already put their DOD Impact Aid Supplemental  funds into a separate fund or have an accounting system that can track  spending using a unique code. One school district official said in the  survey that the district would simply designate its DOD Impact Aid  Supplemental funds for a particular expenditure, such as 25 percent of its  total expenditures for counseling services, if tracking and reporting were  required. However, an equal percentage of districts in our survey said that  tracking exactly how funds are spent would be challenging and time  consuming because their accounting systems are not set up to do so, and  their funds are used for multiple programs and needs (see fig. 4). In  addition, we heard from several district officials that the amount of money  received by districts is so small\u2014less than 2 percent, on average, of a  district\u2019s total budget\u2014that additional resources to account for the funds  would not be justified. One district official from Colorado said that DOD  Impact Aid funding is too small and too unpredictable to dedicate  specifically to military dependent students or to fund special staff or  programs.", "Officials in four of the seven school districts that we interviewed and 19  survey respondents commented on the flexibility afforded by DOD Impact  Aid funding. Many of these districts appreciated the flexibility of these  funds because they can spend the money how they deem most beneficial  for their district. Flexible funding is particularly important now, some  school officials said, because of state cuts to education budgets in recent  years. In another 2010 GAO survey of school districts on stimulus  spending, an estimated one-third reported budget cuts in the 2009\u20132010  school year and nearly one in four reported cutting jobs, even with  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds. Several school  districts we contacted reported using DOD Impact Aid Supplemental funds  to pay for necessities that would have otherwise been cut due to less  funding from the state. Fifty-one percent of survey respondents said if they  did not receive DOD Impact Aid Supplemental funds for the 2010\u20132011  school year, they would likely or very likely make cuts or adjustments to  instructional staff (see fig. 5). Forty-six percent reported that they would  likely or very likely make cuts or adjustments to technology expenditures,  and 42 percent reported that supplies and classroom materials would  likely or very likely be cut. One school district official said if his district  did not receive the funds, it would prioritize expenditures and any  consideration of possible staff reductions would be taken very seriously,  but used as a last resort. Another school district reported that since this  funding is small, a one-year loss would impact technology and supplies,  but staffing would only be affected if the funds were lost going forward.", "When we asked school district officials in our survey if the DOD Impact  Aid Supplemental funding is effective in improving the quality of education  provided to military dependent students, 66 percent strongly agreed. One  district official from Texas told us that while DOD Impact Aid  Supplemental funding is not a significant amount of money compared to  that of the Education Impact Aid program, it is \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d for  addressing the unique needs of their military dependent students. In  addition, several school district officials we contacted said the funding is  very important and allows the district to improve the quality of education.  For example, the funds enabled one school district to make enhancements  to their educational programs, offer new programs, and upgrade facilities.  Sixty-seven percent of the districts responding to our survey strongly  agreed that DOD Impact Aid Supplemental funding serves its purpose by  compensating them for some of the tax and other revenues lost due to a  federal presence in the district.

Senior representatives from Education and the  Military Child Education Coalition explained that without more specific  data, educators, base commanders, and community leaders are not able to  provide military dependent students with appropriate resources because  they do not have information on their specific educational needs or the  effectiveness of the schools and programs serving them. Further, these  data could help military families make more informed decisions about  where to enroll their children by identifying how well specific schools  educate military dependent students. For example, military families may in  some cases choose whether to live on or off a base, and may choose which  school district their children will attend, depending on the quality of the  schools. A senior Education official also emphasized that this information  could shed light on practices that work well generally in educating other  highly mobile students, such as homeless or migrant students. In addition,  using data on military dependent students in a longitudinal database  would allow researchers to better understand these students\u2019 academic  achievement and educational outcomes over time and the factors that  might affect them.", "At the same time, some groups representing school districts have  expressed concerns about making military dependent students a  reportable subgroup.

In  addition, 58 percent reported meeting the needs of military dependent  students with disabilities was moderately, very, or extremely challenging.  In our survey of these school districts, three of the top four challenges  reported by districts responding to our survey were related to the mobility  of military families. Mobility increased academic needs due to differences  in state and district curricula, lack of connectedness with school, and  behavioral issues in the classroom. Serving students with special needs  was another important challenge faced by the school districts in our  survey. These challenges, as well as the emotional toll faced by students as  a result of frequent moves, were echoed in the interviews we held with  selected school districts. A smaller percentage of survey respondents also  reported lack of participation by parents, transportation to and on bases,  and transitioning of teachers and staff who are in military families, among  other challenges (see fig. 6).", "Key issues associated with the mobility of military dependent students  identified by school districts we contacted were different state and district  academic curricula and standards, lack of student and family  connectedness to school, and behavioral and emotional issues of students,  most often related to a parent\u2019s deployment or absence.", "Different Academic Curricula and Standards  The largest challenge reported by school districts in our survey was the  increased academic need of children in military families who transfer to a  school with different curricula or academic standards than those in their  previous school and thus need additional support. Forty-one percent of  school districts rated increased academic needs due to differences in  curricula between districts and/or states as extremely or very challenging,  and 32 percent said it was moderately challenging. States use different  curricula and have different graduation and academic standards and  assessment practices, sometimes making it difficult for a receiving school  to integrate new students. For example, one school district official we  interviewed noted the state requires 25 classes to graduate from high  school, whereas other states require only 20 classes, which has created  challenges for incoming juniors and seniors. These inter-district  differences can extend to the placement of students in special education  or gifted programs. A school district official in one state, for example, told  us that some students who received special education services in their  previous state no longer qualified for these services. While the district  works to provide adequate supports within the classroom, the official said  it is sometimes difficult to explain to students and their families why they  no longer qualify for services to which they are accustomed. These  challenges are compounded when the records from the sending district do  not arrive on time or are incomplete\u2014an issue identified as a challenge by  some districts.", "In addition, mobility often results in classes with a high degree of student  turnover each year, creating an extra burden on teachers to orient new  students to class material, assess their academic abilities, and provide  extra support, as needed. Officials at five of the schools we interviewed  told us that each year at least one-third of their student population turns  over. A principal of an elementary school in Colorado told us only one out  of 57 fifth graders has been with the school since kindergarten. Because  this turnover takes place throughout the school year, teachers must spend  time continually absorbing and integrating new students into their  classrooms, which reduces the time available for instruction.", "We found very few generalizable studies that systematically examined the  academic and behavioral effects of mobility for military students  specifically. National student level achievement data on military  dependent students are also not available, so it is difficult to link  achievement and mobility. However, we recently reported that mobility is  one of several interrelated factors, including socio-economic status and  lack of parental education, which have a negative effect on academic  achievement. In addition, some of the studies we reviewed found that the  effect of mobility on achievement also varied depending on such factors as  the student\u2019s race or ethnicity, special needs, grade level, frequency of  school change, and characteristics of the school change\u2014whether it was  between or within school districts, or to an urban district from a suburban  or rural one.", "Lack of Connectedness with School  Military dependent students\u2019 lack of connectedness with their school due  to frequent moves was reported as extremely or very challenging by 24  percent of school districts in our survey, and moderately challenging by 34  percent. Frequent moves make it difficult, for example, for students to get  involved with extracurricular activities or sports if they move after the  tryout season. Officials we interviewed from one school in Texas said they  allowed children to try out for extracurricular activities by sending a video  before they arrived, and another allowed newly arrived military dependent  students to try out for teams mid-season. Students are not guaranteed their  same position (e.g., quarterback) which can be disappointing, but they will  be given an opportunity to try out for the team. Officials also said limited  child care options and lack of transportation to the military base limit  students\u2019 ability to attend after-school events. School liaison officers in  another school district similarly attributed the lack of public  transportation on base to families feeling isolated and having difficulty  attending extracurricular activities. Officials in 23 percent of districts  responding to our survey reported transportation was at least moderately  challenging. Related to a student\u2019s lack of connectedness is lack of  parental involvement. School principals we interviewed in Colorado said  military parents tend to avoid school involvement partly because they  anticipate leaving in a few years. The lack of parental involvement is  particularly troubling for district officials because they feel that parents  need to be part of the school community for success in educating their  students.", "Finally, related to mobility, 13 percent of survey respondents reported that  transitioning of teachers and staff from military families who work at  schools when military families are reassigned was extremely or very  challenging, and 27 percent reported this was moderately challenging.  Officials in two school districts told us that hiring military spouses is  advantageous because they have first hand experience with military issues  and can relate well to military dependent students. However, when the  military spouses leave the school district it creates more inconsistency in  the education of military dependent students.", "Officials in 24 percent of school districts in our survey said behavioral  issues in the classroom, such as aggression\u2014which may be attributable to  frequent moves and parent deployment\u2014were extremely or very  challenging, and 31 percent said they were moderately challenging.  Officials we interviewed in six of the seven districts said there is an  emotional toll faced by students as a result of frequent school transfers. In  one school district in Virginia, approximately 60 percent of students who  started at a school are no longer there at graduation. Officials in this  district found that frequent moves are a significant hindrance to the  academic and emotional success of military dependent students. Some  officials said mobility-related emotional issues tend to be more challenging  for high school students, who may have more trouble fitting in and  meeting academic requirements for graduation. The students we spoke  with at one high school, many of whom were military dependents and had  moved frequently, agreed that transitioning to new schools was most  difficult during high school because social groups are already firmly  established.", "School district officials we interviewed also identified emotional and  behavioral challenges connected to parent deployment, absence, and in  some cases, the death of a parent. In particular, officials we interviewed at  two school districts near Army bases noted an increase in emotional and  behavioral issues, including student truancy and tardiness, in recent years.  Specifically, school officials near Army bases in Colorado and Missouri  agreed that students\u2019 misbehavior and acting out has increased in recent  years and is currently at chronic levels. One superintendent noted that her  county has lost more than 300 soldiers in the Afghanistan and Iraq  conflicts. A school counselor added that reintegration when the absent  parent returns can also be stressful as families re-establish rules and  dynamics. Some districts noted that the leave soldiers take upon return  from deployment resulted in long student absences. While district officials  we spoke with wanted to be accommodating to reunited families, they  noted that these student absences were taking an academic toll. Officials  in these two districts said that teachers have found themselves fulfilling  the role of social worker for military dependent students, a position they  felt underqualified to fill.", "A 2010 study examining the well-being and deployment difficulties of more  than a thousand families with military children aged 11\u201317 found they  tended to have more emotional difficulties compared to national  samples. The study found that older children had a greater number o school, family, and peer-related difficulties during deployment, and girls of  all ages reported more challenges during both deployment and deployed parent reintegration.

Serving  students with disabilities in public schools is a challenge for many school  districts nationwide because these students are increasingly taught in  mainstream classrooms. In 2009 we found that state and local school  district officials believed classroom teachers were generally unprepared  for teaching students with disabilities and a number of state and district  officials wanted a stronger focus in teacher preparation programs on  instruction of children with disabilities.", "DOD Impact Aid\u2019s Children with Severe Disabilities program reimburses  school districts serving military dependent students with severe  disabilities, but a number of school districts we contacted said the  application for reimbursement is burdensome, in some cases taking  numerous hours for school districts to complete. According to a DoDEA  official, approximately 10 percent of the school districts that serve two or  more military dependent children with special needs and establish that  they meet the cost criteria submit an application each year. In accordance  with statutory requirements, payment calculations require, among other  things, determinations of average per pupil expenditure in the state as well  as nationally. According to some school districts, calculations and  application requirements are time consuming and require them to list  specific costs expended on services for each eligible child. One director of  special education told us that the process of applying for the Children with  Severe Disabilities reimbursement takes about 80\u201390 hours of staff time.  She explained that collecting the information requires obtaining data from  occupational and physical therapists, and from other offices including  transportation and special education. When there is staff turnover among  any of these contacts, the process takes even longer. Officials from two  districts we interviewed said the amount of the reimbursement was very  small compared to the difficulty with completing the application. Officials  in 10 of the 39 school districts responding to the survey that have received  these funds said the application is difficult to complete in an open-ended  survey question. DoDEA officials told us they are aware that the  application can be difficult to complete, and one official was concerned  that some districts that could benefit from the funds may not apply for  them given the burden of the application. In response, DoDEA plans to  issue more guidance in the form of frequently asked questions for the next  application process in spring 2011.

However,  because most school districts receiving DOD Impact Aid Supplemental  funds deposit the funds in the district\u2019s general fund and do not separately  track their spending, we could not assess the extent to which any of these  strategies were funded through DOD Impact Aid Supplemental funds  rather than other funding sources. Some of the strategies school officials  described are funded by other DOD programs or nonmilitary sources.", "Eighty percent of school districts in our survey reported using additional  counseling as a key strategy to address the emotional needs of military  dependent students, and many provided services such as deployment  support groups and student peer support groups. One district hired a full- time psychologist to address the emotional and social needs of students  due to both frequent school moves and recurring deployments of parents.  Counseling and support often extend to other members of the family who  are also struggling to cope with a deployed parent. For example, a home  liaison in one district told us she holds training sessions on discipline with  the at-home parent. Military parents we interviewed at one school district  explained that sometimes the stigma associated with mental health  services deterred military families from seeking help on base, raising the  importance of supports at schools. Officials we interviewed at several  school districts said they provided extra training for teachers and  counselors on issues specific to military dependent students. In Texas, all  counselors in one district received training in how to respond to needs of  these students and their families in transitioning to a new area and how to  help students cope with the loss of a parent.", "Officials in six of the seven school districts we interviewed told us they  provided deployment support groups, typically led by school counselors,  to provide military dependent students an opportunity to share feelings  and solutions. Sixty-five percent of the schools in our survey offered peer- to-peer support programs. For example, \u201cStudent 2 Student\u201d is a peer  program promoted by the Military Child Education Coalition in which a  team of volunteer students, supervised by a school counselor, teacher, or  other school staff, assists both incoming and outgoing students to cope  with or prepare for changes in academics and relationships. Further, 33  percent of survey respondents reported using military or deployment- focused bulletin boards to provide support for military dependent  students. For example, one school we visited posted a \u201cheroes wall,\u201d  which contained pictures and text the children created about their parent  who was deployed. School district officials also highlighted the  involvement of members of the military in supporting military dependent  students. Sixty-one percent of districts responding to our survey said they  involve members of nearby installations, and 64 percent reported taking  advantage of counseling and other support offered by base  representatives.

In our previous work, we have  identified practices that help enhance and sustain interagency  collaboration. These practices include articulating common objectives and  resources, agreeing on compatible operating procedures and  responsibilities, and reinforcing accountability through monitoring. The  agencies have worked together, for example, to distribute guidance to  schools on best practices for addressing military dependent students\u2019  needs and to assist school districts located in areas experiencing influxes  of military families.", "DOD and Education officials have a history of collaborating on education  issues for children of military families through the Impact Aid programs  and formalized and broadened these efforts with a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) they signed in June 2008. The MOU identifies five  focus areas for collaboration:  1.  Quality education. Share educational best practices at schools serving  military dependent students, and implement policies to support those  with special needs. 2.  Student transition and deployment. Encourage school district and  state policies that minimize the impact of military dependent students\u2019  frequent moves and parental deployments. 3.  Data. Consider approaches for the collection, disaggregation, and  analysis of education data on military dependent students. 4.  Communication and outreach. Devise joint communication strategies  to reach parents, educators, students, and military leaders about  resources available from DOD and Education. 5.  Resources. Support school districts affected by military growth  through the DOD and Education Impact Aid programs, as well as other  programs.", "To address these five areas, DOD and Education outlined 13 specific  objectives in the MOU, including coordinating the DOD and Education  Impact Aid programs. (See appendix III for a complete list of the  objectives.) DOD and Education have carried out a number of  collaborative activities within the five focus areas. For example, to address  the area of resources, DOD and Education have collaborated to respond to  the challenges from the 2005 military base closure and realignment actions  that the BRAC Commission reported will result in 55 major closures and  realignments by September 2011. These actions, once completed, would  relocate large numbers of military families, which in turn will affect an  increasing number of school districts. Officials from both agencies have  made eight joint site visits, beginning in 2008, to high-growth military  installations to better understand the specific education issues arising  from mission changes and growth. The officials shared their findings with  cognizant federal agencies, affected state and local governments and  school districts, and made recommendations for how the districts can best  prepare for influxes of military dependent students. These  recommendations included improving coordination between districts and  federal agencies to better estimate military dependent student growth in a  district. DOD and Education are also collaborating on a study mandated in  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 that required  DOD, in consultation with Education, to examine, among other things, the  educational options available to military dependent children who attend  schools in need of improvement as defined under ESEA. The study was  also required to address the challenges military parents face in securing  quality schooling for their children when the schools they attend are  identified as needing improvement.", "To address student transitions and parental deployment, DOD and  Education issued guidance to school districts about best practices to  minimize the impact on military dependent students\u2019 attendance records  and academics when they are absent upon a parent\u2019s return from  deployment. Further, DOD, in cooperation with Education, published a  book for military families and military and school leaders called \u201cStudents  at the Center,\u201d which provides information on resources and best  practices for meeting the needs of military dependent children.", "DOD and Education have also taken steps to improve interagency  communication and develop compatible operating procedures and  responsibilities\u2014key elements of effective collaboration identified in our  prior work. An MOU working group meets monthly and is in the process of  writing protocols for communication between the agencies. In addition, a  military liaison position was established at Education in 2008 to serve as  the primary contact between the agencies for coordinating program  development, management, and outreach related to improving the  academic condition of military dependent children. A senior DoDEA  official said this new position has been beneficial because it provides a  single point of contact. Education officials told us the working group\u2019s  efforts have increased communication with DOD and have led to a better  understanding of the needs of children in families from all military  branches. DOD officials also highlighted increased interest by Education  officials to visit military installations. DOD officials said that prior to the  MOU, they had working relationships only with officials from Education\u2019s  Impact Aid office; they now have relationships with officials in other  offices in Education, such as its Office of Special Education and  Rehabilitative Services and its Office of Elementary and Secondary  Education. As a result, DOD officials have worked with representatives  from those offices on several efforts. For example, according to a DOD  official, Education officials provided technical support to DOD by  reviewing school districts\u2019 applications for the 2009 DoDEA grants, and  the working group has hosted guest speakers from both Education and  DOD. In addition, an official from Education\u2019s Office of Safe and Drug- Free Schools spoke to the group about how its grant programs can assist  military dependent students, and an official from DOD\u2019s Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family  Policy spoke to the group about progress on the Interstate Compact.", "In May 2010, the White House announced a Presidential Study Directive on  Military Family Policy, which requested that executive agencies develop a  coordinated governmentwide approach to support and engage military  families. According to senior Education officials, the directive has led  Education to place an even greater priority on its collaborative efforts with  DOD. The directive has provided another framework under which DOD  and Education have worked together to improve the quality of education  for military dependent children. Education developed a work plan that  details initiatives the agency will undertake to address the goals of the  directive. Specifically, senior Education officials have also visited military  communities and schools to raise awareness of the challenges military  dependent children face and the contributions their families make to the  country. In addition, Education proposed that priority be given to its  competitive grant proposals that could benefit military dependent  students.", "The working group monitors its progress through a strategic plan  developed in 2010 that aligns the MOU\u2019s five focus areas for collaboration  with initiatives the working group has accomplished or plans to carry out.  Our prior work has found monitoring to be a key practice for effective  interagency collaboration because it allows agencies to obtain feedback  and improve effectiveness. DOD and Education officials told us the  strategic plan helps them to examine and prioritize their areas of  collaboration to plan for future efforts, and reflect on the extent to which  they are meeting the original intent of the MOU. For example, to address  the focus area of student transition and deployment, working group  members outlined plans in their strategic plan for a resource guide about  best practices for school attendance. As a result of their work, they  contributed to a pamphlet, published by the Military Child Education  Coalition in 2010, called \u201cMilitary-Connected Students and Public School  Attendance Policies\u201d that is meant to assist school administrators, base  commanders, and parents. Specifically, the pamphlet includes examples of  districts around the country upholding their attendance policies while  ensuring military dependents receive a quality education when absent  from school.

Programs such as DOD Impact Aid provide funding to assist  school districts with a significant percentage of military dependents, but  the outcomes and effectiveness of their activities are difficult to assess.  This is due in part to the structure of the DOD Impact Aid program, which  does not require any reporting on the use of the funds. Further, DOD,  Education, states, and other parties concerned about the education of  military dependents lack appropriate data to monitor the progress of  military dependent students and the effectiveness of the schools and  programs serving them.
