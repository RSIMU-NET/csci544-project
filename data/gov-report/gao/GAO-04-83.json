GAO strongly supports the need to expand pay for performance in the federal government. How it is done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful. High-performing organizations continuously review and revise their performance management systems. These demonstration projects show an understanding that how to better link pay to performance is very much a work in progress at the federal level. Additional work is needed to strengthen efforts to ensure that performance management systems are tools to help them manage on a day-to-day basis. In particular, there are opportunities to use organizationwide competencies to evaluate employee performance that reinforce behaviors and actions that support the organization's mission, translate employee performance so that managers make meaningful distinctions between top and poor performers with objective and fact-based information, and provide information to employees about the results of the performance appraisals and pay decisions to ensure reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms are in place."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To successfully transform themselves, high-performing organizations have  found that they must fundamentally change their cultures so that they are  more results-oriented, customer-focused, and collaborative in nature, and  have recognized that an effective performance management system can  help them drive internal change and achieve desired results.  Our prior  work, done at your request, has identified nine key practices for effective  performance management based on experiences in public sector  organizations both in the United States and abroad.  The key practices are  as follows: 1. Align individual performance expectations with organizational goals.  2. Connect performance expectations to crosscutting goals.  3. Provide and routinely use performance information to make program  improvements.  4. Require follow-up actions to address organizational priorities.  5. Use competencies to provide a fuller assessment of performance. 6. Link pay to individual and organizational performance.  7.

Maintain continuity during transitions.", "Among these practices, there is a growing understanding that the federal  government needs to fundamentally rethink its current approach to pay  and better link pay to individual and organizational performance.  To this  end, Congress has taken important steps to implement results-oriented pay  reform and modern performance management systems across government.   Most recently, Congress provided the Department of Defense (DOD)  flexibility to revise its performance management system to better link pay  to performance and required DOD to incorporate employee involvement,  provide ongoing performance feedback, and include effective safeguards to  ensure fairness and equity, among other things, in DOD\u2019s revised system.", "Congress also established a Human Capital Performance Fund to reward  agencies\u2019 highest performing and most valuable employees.  To be eligible,  agencies are to submit plans for approval by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) that incorporate a link between pay for performance  and the agency\u2019s strategic plan, employee involvement, ongoing  performance feedback, and effective safeguards to ensure fair management  of the system, among other things.  In the first year of implementation, up  to 10 percent of the amount appropriated is to be available to train those  involved on making meaningful distinctions in performance.  In addition,  Congress created a wider, more open pay range for senior executive  compensation, thus allowing for pay to be more directly tied to individual  performance, contribution to the agency\u2019s performance, or both, as  determined under a rigorous performance management system that as  designed and applied, makes meaningful distinctions based on relative  performance.", "Further, in November 2002, Congress established the Department of  Homeland Security and provided it human capital flexibilities to design a  performance management system and specifically to consider different  approaches to pay.  We reported that the department\u2019s effort to design its  system could be particularly instructive in light of future requests for human capital flexibilities. Legislation is currently pending, which you  sponsored and introduced, that would provide GAO additional authority to  more fully link employees\u2019 annual salary increases to performance.", "Federal agencies have been experimenting with pay for performance  through OPM\u2019s personnel demonstration projects.  Over the past 25 years,  OPM has approved 17 projects, 12 of which have implemented pay for  performance systems.

Discriminators further define each factor.  For  example, discriminators for problem solving include scope of  responsibility, creativity, complexity, and independence.  Descriptors  identify contributions by pay band.  For example, a descriptor for problem  solving at one pay band level is \u201cresolves routine problems within  established guidelines,\u201d and at a higher level, a descriptor is \u201canticipates  problems, develops sound solutions and action plans to ensure  program/mission accomplishment.\u201d", "All factors must be used and cannot be supplemented.  While the pay pool  manager may weight the factors, according to an official, no organization  within AcqDemo has weighted the factors to date.  Managers are  authorized to use weights sparingly because contributions in all six factors  are important to ensuring AcqDemo\u2019s overall success as well as to  developing the skills of the acquisition workforce.  If weights are used, they  are to be applied uniformly across all positions within the pay pool.  The six  factors are initially weighted equally and no factor can be weighted less  than one-half of its initial weight.  Employees are to be advised of the  weights at the beginning of the rating period.", "While AcqDemo applies organizationwide competencies across all  employees, NRL has established \u201ccritical elements\u201d for each career path  and allows supervisors to add individual performance expectations.  The  critical elements are the key aspects of work that supervisors are to  consider in evaluating employee performance.  Each critical element has  discriminators and descriptors.

Further, pay pool panels  may weight the critical elements, including a weight of zero.  Weighted  elements are to be applied consistently to groups within a career path, such  as Bench Level, Supervisor, Program Manager, or Support for the Science  and Engineering Professionals career path.

Supervisors are to assign a weight to each critical  element on the basis of its importance, the time required to accomplish it,  or both.  According to NIST and DOC officials, weighting is done at the  supervisory level and is not tracked at the organizational level.", "To evaluate the accomplishment of critical elements, DOC uses its  organizationwide Benchmark Performance Standards.

First,  supervisors are to rate employees as \u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201cunacceptable.\u201d   Employees rated as unacceptable are not eligible for pay increases or  awards.  Employees rated as acceptable are to be further assessed on their  performance relative to their salaries.  Supervisors assess acceptable  employees into three rating categories: contributors, major contributors, or  exceptional contributors.  Supervisors also make recommendations for the  number of pay points to be awarded, from 0 to 4, depending on the rating  category and the employees\u2019 salaries.  Pay pool managers review and  department heads finalize supervisor recommendations.  A pay point  equals 1.5 percent of the midpoint salary of the pay band.  Pay points may  be permanent pay increases or one-time awards.", "Newport allows for some flexibility in deciding whether employees receive  permanent pay increases, one-time awards, or both.  Newport\u2019s guidelines  state that those who make greater contributions should receive permanent  increases to base pay, while employees whose contributions are  commensurate with their salaries receive one-time awards.  In addition,  employees whose salaries fall below the midpoint of the pay band are more  likely to receive permanent pay increases, while employees above the  midpoint of the pay band are more likely to receive one-time awards.", "NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division made some distinctions in performance across  employees\u2019 ratings.  As shown in figure 4,  about 80 percent of employees were rated in the top two categories  (exceptional contributor and major contributor) and   no employees were rated unacceptable.", "In addition, at NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division, the average pay increase and  award amount rose with performance, as shown in table 3.", "The average permanent pay increase ranged from 1.6 to 2.9 percent.", "The average performance award ranged from $1,089 to $2,216.", "Delegating pay decisions to pay pools.  Some demonstration projects,  such as NIST and DOC, delegate the flexibility to individual pay pools to  determine how ratings translate into permanent pay increases and one-time  awards.

Because Dahlgren implemented its new  system in 2002, performance data were not available.  Less systematically,  China Lake and NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division consider current salary in  making pay and award decisions.  For example, at Newport, supervisors  within each pay pool are to list all employees in each pay band by salary  before a rating is determined and then evaluate each employee\u2019s  contribution to the organization considering that salary.

When the demonstration projects converted  employees from the GS system to the pay for performance system, they  compensated each employee for the portion of the WGI that the employee  had earned either as a permanent increase to base pay or a one-time lump  sum payment.  Four of the six demonstration projects (China Lake, NRL,  NAVSEA, and AcqDemo) gave employees permanent increases to base pay,  while the remaining two demonstration projects (NIST and DOC) gave  employees one-time lump sum payments.", "Both methods of compensating employees have benefits and drawbacks,  according to demonstration project officials. Giving permanent pay  increases at the point of conversion into the demonstration project  recognizes that employees had already earned a portion of the WGI, but a  drawback is that the salary increases are compounded over time, which  increases the organization\u2019s total salary costs.  However, the officials said  that giving permanent pay increases garnered employees\u2019 support for the  demonstration project because employees did not feel like they would have  been better off under the GS system.", "Considering fiscal conditions and the labor market.  In determining  how much to budget for pay increases, demonstration projects considered  the fiscal condition of the organization as well as the labor market.  For  example, China Lake, NIST, NRL, and NAVSEA receive a portion of their  funding from a working capital fund and thus must take into account fiscal  conditions when budgeting for pay increases and awards.  These  organizations rely, in part, on sales revenue rather than direct  appropriations to finance their operations.  The organizations establish  prices for their services that allow them to recover their costs from their  customers.  If the organizations\u2019 services become too expensive (i.e.,  salaries are too high), they become less competitive with the private sector.", "A demonstration project official at NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division said that as  an organization financed in part through a working capital fund, it has an  advantage over organizations that rely completely on appropriations  because it can justify adjusting pay increase and awards budgets when  necessary to remain competitive with the private sector.  Newport has had  to make such adjustments.  In fiscal year 2002, the performance pay  increase and award pools were funded at lower levels (1.4 percent and 1.7  percent of total salaries for pay increases and awards, respectively) than in  2001 (1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively) because of fiscal  constraints.  As agreed with one of its unions, Newport must set aside a  minimum of 1.4 percent of salaries for its pay increases, which is equal to  historical spending under GS for similar increases.", "NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division also considers the labor market and uses  regional and industry salary information compiled by the American  Association of Engineering Societies when determining how much to set  aside for pay increases and awards.  In fiscal year 2001, Newport funded  pay increases and awards at a higher level (1.7 percent and 1.8 percent of  total salaries, respectively) than in fiscal year 2000 (1.4 percent and 1.6  percent, respectively) in response to higher external engineer, scientist,  and information technology personnel salaries.", "Managing movement through the pay band.  Because movement  through the pay band is based on performance, demonstration project  employees could progress through the pay band more quickly than under  the GS.  Some demonstration projects have developed ways intended to  manage this progression to prevent all employees from eventually  migrating to the top of the pay band and thus increasing salary costs.", "NIST and DOC manage movement through the pay band by recognizing  performance with larger pay increases early in the pay band and career  path and smaller increases higher in the pay band and career path.  Both of  these demonstration projects divided each pay band into five intervals. The  intervals determine the maximum percentage increase employees could  receive for permanent pay increases.  The intervals, shown in figure 8, have  helped NIST manage salary costs, according to a NIST official.", "Similarly, some of the demonstration projects, including China Lake and  NAVSEA\u2019s Dahlgren division, have checkpoints or \u201cspeed bumps\u201d in their  pay bands intended to manage salary costs as well as ensure that  employees\u2019 performance coincides with their salaries as they progress  through the band.  These projects established checkpoints designed to  ensure that only the highest performers move into the upper half of the pay  band. For example, when employees\u2019 salaries at China Lake reach the  midpoint of the pay band, they must receive ratings of highly successful,  which are equivalent to exceeding expectations, before they can receive  additional salary increases.  A Performance Review Board, made up of  senior management, is to review all highly successful ratings.", "Providing a mix of awards and pay increases.  Some of the  demonstration projects intended to manage costs by providing a mix of  one-time awards and permanent pay increases.  Rewarding an employee\u2019s  performance with an award instead of an equivalent increase to base pay  can reduce salary costs in the long run because the agency only has to pay  the amount of the award one time, rather than annually.  For example, at  NAVSEA\u2019s Newport division, as employees move higher into the pay band,  they are more likely to receive awards than permanent increases to base  pay.  According to a Newport official, expectations increase along with  salaries and thus it is more likely that their contributions would meet,  rather than exceed, expectations.", "To manage costs, China Lake allows pay pools to transfer some of their  budgets for permanent pay increases to their budgets for awards.  A China  Lake official said that because China Lake receives a portion of its funding  from a working capital fund, it is not only important to give permanent  salary increases to high-performing employees, but also to give increases  China Lake can afford the next year.  China Lake does not track how much  funding is transferred from performance pay increase budgets to awards  budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training Costs", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that agencies will need to invest resources, including  time and money, to ensure that employees have the information, skills, and  competencies they need to work effectively in a rapidly changing and  complex environment.  This includes investments in training and  developing employees as part of an agency\u2019s overall effort to achieve cost- effective and timely results.  Agency managers and supervisors are often  aware that investments in training and development initiatives can be quite  large.  However, across the federal government, evaluation efforts have  often been hindered by the lack of accurate and reliable data to document  the total costs of training efforts.  Each of the demonstration projects  trained employees on the performance management system prior to  implementation to make employees aware of the new approach, as well as  periodically after implementation to refresh employee familiarity with the  system.  The training was designed to help employees understand  competencies and performance standards; develop performance plans;  write self-appraisals; become familiar with how performance is evaluated  and how pay increases and awards decisions are made; and know the roles  and responsibilities of managers, supervisors, and employees in the  appraisal and payout processes.", "Generally, demonstration projects told us they incurred direct and indirect  costs associated with training.  Direct training costs that the demonstration  projects reported included costs for contractors, materials, and travel  related to developing and delivering training to employees and managers.   As shown in table 6, total direct costs that the demonstration projects  reported for training through the first 5 years of the projects\u2019  implementation range from an estimated $33,000 at NAVSEA\u2019s Dahlgren  division to more than $1 million at China Lake.  (NIST reported no direct  costs associated with training.)  Training costs, as indicated by the cost per  employee, were generally higher in the year prior to implementation,  except for AcqDemo\u2019s, which increased over time.", "While the demonstration projects did not report indirect costs associated  with training employees on the demonstration project, officials stated that  indirect costs, such as employee time spent developing, delivering, or  attending training, could nonetheless be significant.  Likewise, the time  spent on the \u201clearning curve\u201d until employees are proficient with the new  system could also be significant.  For example, although NIST did not  capture its indirect training costs, agency officials told us that prior to  implementation, each NIST employee was in training for 1 day.  Since its  implementation, NIST offers optional one-half day training three times a  year for all employees.  AcqDemo offered 8 hours of training for employees  prior to implementation and a minimum of 4 hours of training after  implementation.  All potential new participants also received eight hours of  training prior to implementation at their site.  Supervisors and human  resources professionals at AcqDemo were offered an additional 8 hours of  training each year after the demonstration project was implemented.   According to a DOC official, prior to conversion to the demonstration  project, DOC provided a detailed briefing to approximately 400 employees  to increase employee understanding of the project.  In addition, employees  could schedule one-on-one counseling sessions with human resources staff  to discuss individual issues and concerns.", "Some of the demonstration projects, including China Lake, DOC, and  NAVSEA\u2019s Dahlgren and Newport divisions, managed training costs by  relying on current employees to train other employees on the  demonstration project.  According to demonstration project officials, while  there are still costs associated with developing and delivering in-house  training, total training costs are generally reduced by using employees  rather than hiring contractors to train employees.  For example, China Lake  took a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d approach by training a group of employees on the  new flexibilities in the demonstration project and having those employees  train other employees.  According to a demonstration project official, an  added benefit of using employees to train other employees is that if the  person leading the training is respected and known, then the employees are  more likely to support the demonstration project.  The official said that one  drawback is that not all employees are good teachers, so their skills should  be carefully considered.", "AcqDemo used a combination of contractors and in-house training to  implement its training strategy.  According to an AcqDemo official, the  relatively higher per demonstration project employee costs in years 4 and 5  are a result of AcqDemo\u2019s recognition that more in-depth and varied  training was needed for current AcqDemo employees to refresh their  proficiency in the system; for new participants to familiarize them with  appraisal and payout processes; as well as for senior management, pay pool  managers and members, and human resources personnel to give them  greater detail on the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Automation and Data Systems Costs", "paragraphs": ["As a part of implementing a pay for performance system, some of the  demonstration projects installed new or updated existing automated  personnel systems.

For example, NAVSEA\u2019s divisions worked  together to modify DOD\u2019s existing Defense Civilian Personnel Data System  to meet their needs for a revised performance appraisal system.  Similarly,  DOC imported the performance appraisal system developed by NIST and  converted the payout system to a Web-based system.  While NIST reported  that it incurred no direct costs for automation and data systems, officials  told us it used in-house employees, NIST\u2019s Information Technology  Laboratory staff, to develop a data system to automate performance  ratings, scores, increases, and awards.", "NRL used a combination of in-house employees and contractors to  automate its performance management system.  While reported  automation and data systems\u2019 costs were higher for NRL than for most  other demonstration projects, NRL reports that its automated system has  brought about savings each year of an estimated 10,500 hours of work,  $266,000, and 154 reams of paper since the demonstration project was  implemented in 1999."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Providing Information to Employees about the Results of Performance Appraisal and Pay Decisions", "paragraphs": ["We have observed that a performance management system should have  adequate safeguards to ensure fairness and guard against abuse.

According to the  evaluation, focus group and survey results indicated the need for increased  understanding on topics such as how pay pools work, how salaries are  determined, and how employees are rated.  Employees were also interested  in knowing more about the results of the performance appraisal process.   One union representative told us that a way to improve the demonstration  project would be to publish information.  In past years, according to  employee representatives, some employees and union representatives at  DOC have used the Freedom of Information Act to request and obtain the  information.

As Congress, the administration, and federal agencies  continue to rethink the current approach to federal pay to place greater  emphasis on performance, the experiences of personnel demonstration  projects can provide insights into how some organizations within the  federal government are implementing pay for performance.  The  demonstration projects took different approaches to using competencies to  evaluate employee performance, translating performance ratings into pay  increases and awards, considering employees\u2019 current salaries in making  performance pay decisions, managing costs of the pay for performance  systems, and providing information to employees about the results of  performance appraisal and pay decisions.  These different approaches  were intended to enhance the success of the pay for performance systems  because the systems were designed and implemented to meet the  demonstration projects\u2019 unique cultural and organizational needs.", "We strongly support the need to expand pay for performance in the federal  government.  How it is done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is  done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful.   High-performing organizations continuously review and revise their  performance management systems to achieve results, accelerate change,  and facilitate two-way communication throughout the year so that  discussions about individual and organizational performance are integrated  and ongoing.  To this end, these demonstration projects show an  understanding that how to better link pay to performance is very much a  work in progress at the federal level.", "Additional work is needed to strengthen efforts to ensure that performance  management systems are tools to help the demonstration projects manage  on a day-to-day basis.  In particular, there are opportunities to use  organizationwide competencies to evaluate employee performance that  reinforce behaviors and actions that support the organization's mission,  translate employee performance so that managers can make meaningful  distinctions between top and poor performers with objective and fact- based information, and provide information to employees about the results  of the performance appraisals and pay decisions to ensure that reasonable  transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms are in place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided drafts of this report to the Secretaries of Defense and  Commerce for their review and comment.
