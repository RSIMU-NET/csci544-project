For each patient, hospices are paid a per diem rate corresponding to one of four payment categories, which are based on service intensity and location of care. Since implementation in 1983, the payment methodology and rates have not been evaluated. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 directed GAO to study the feasibility and advisability of updating Medicare's payment rates for hospice care. In this report, GAO (1) compares freestanding hospices' costs to Medicare payment rates and (2) evaluates the appropriateness of the per diem payment methodology.

However, the relationship between payment rates and costs varied across the payment categories and types of hospices. For all hospice care provided in the home, which accounted for about 97 percent of care in 2001, GAO estimates that the per diem payment rate was almost 10 percent higher than average per diem costs in 2000, and over 12 percent higher in 2001. Small hospices, however, had higher estimated average per diem costs than medium or large hospices overall and for each of the four per diem payment categories in 2001. GAO's analysis indicates that the hospice payment methodology, with rates based on the historical mix and cost of services, a per diem amount that varies only by payment category, and a cap on total Medicare payments, may not reflect current patterns of care. For example, GAO determined that the relative costs of services, such as nursing care, provided during routine home care (RHC) have changed considerably since the rates were calculated. Using limited patient-specific hospice visit data, GAO found that more visits were provided during the first, and especially last, week of a hospice stay than during other times in the stay. Finally, few hospices reached the payment cap, which was intended to limit Medicare hospice spending."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the Medicare hospice benefit was implemented in 1983, neither the  payment methodology nor the payment rates for hospices have been  evaluated; however, there are indications that hospice services and  patients have changed. The payment methodology and rates for the benefit  were developed using cost data collected from 26 hospices providing care  to Medicare patients with terminal cancer under a 1980 to 1982 Health  Care Financing Administration (HCFA) demonstration. Since then,  advances in medical technology, such as new palliative drugs,  chemotherapy, and radiation, have influenced the mix of hospice services  provided. In addition, the mean length of a hospice stay has declined since  1983, and the number of patients with noncancer diagnoses has grown  considerably, representing approximately one-half of all patients receiving  hospice care in 2000.", "In addition to changes in the delivery of hospice care, there has been  substantial growth in the hospice program. From 1992 through 2002,  Medicare payments for hospice care increased fivefold, to about   $4.5 billion, and the number of Medicare patients increased fourfold, to  approximately 640,000. During the same period, the number of Medicare- participating hospices grew by almost 90 percent to 2,275.", "The Medicare hospice benefit was designed to provide patients who have a  terminal illness with comfort and pain relief, as well as emotional and  spiritual support, generally in a home setting. By law, Medicare hospice  services include nursing care, counseling, and home health aide services,  as well as drugs and medical supplies. Hospice services are delivered by  providers that operate as freestanding entities or are based in hospitals,  home health agencies, or skilled nursing facilities. Under the law,  Medicare pays hospices a daily rate that covers all services provided to  the patient, except for physician services. HCFA developed four payment  categories, with corresponding per diem payment rates to reflect variation  in service intensity and the location of service. These categories, as set  out in Medicare regulations, are routine home care (RHC), a typical day of  home care; continuous home care (CHC), home care that is provided  during periods of patient crisis for at least 8 hours in a 24-hour period;  inpatient respite care (IRC), care in an inpatient facility for a short period  to provide respite for primary caregivers; and general inpatient care (GIC),  inpatient care to treat symptoms that cannot be managed in other settings.  In 1986, annual updates to the rates for the four payment categories were  set in law. A hospice is paid for each day that a patient is under its care,  regardless of whether the patient receives a visit or other service on that  day. Medicare pays the RHC payment category rate for days when a  patient does not receive CHC, IRC, or GIC. In 2001, RHC days accounted  for 96 percent of all days provided to hospice patients. By law, each  hospice is subject to an aggregate payment cap, which limits its total  annual Medicare payments to a specified amount based on the number of  Medicare patients it served.", "The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of  1999 (BBRA) directed us to study the feasibility and advisability of  updating Medicare\u2019s payment rates for hospice care. Specifically, we   (1) compared hospices\u2019 costs to the Medicare payment rates and   (2) evaluated the appropriateness of the per diem payment methodology.", "To compare hospices\u2019 costs to Medicare payment rates, we used 2000 and  2001 Medicare hospice cost reports, the most recent data available at the  time of our analysis. We confined our analysis to cost reports of  freestanding hospices. Hospital-based and home health agency-based  hospices must allocate overhead costs between the hospice and the  hospital or home health agency, which may distort the costs of providing  hospice services. For freestanding hospices, the only costs incurred are  for delivering hospice care to patients. We verified the reliability of the  cost report data by comparing descriptive statistics calculated using the  cost reports with those calculated using the Medicare hospice claims for  all hospices from the same years, and we verified the reliability of the  claims data by comparing descriptive statistics we calculated using the  claims with statistics published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS). We excluded certain cost reports; for example, those with  fewer than 11 total patients or an average of less than 1 patient per day.  We determined the remaining data were suitable for our purposes. For  freestanding hospices, we estimated average per diem costs by summing  the total costs for all hospices and dividing by the total number of days of  care for all hospices. We compared the estimated average per diem cost  for freestanding hospices to an unadjusted payment rate based on national  payment rates for each category. We also determined average per diem  costs for each payment category using the same methodology and  compared each to the unadjusted payment rate calculated for that  category. Because RHC and CHC costs are reported in aggregate on the  hospice cost report, we could only report hospices\u2019 average combined  RHC and CHC per diem costs. We refer to combined RHC and CHC  hospice costs and payment rates as home care costs and payment rates.  Because of data limitations in the Medicare hospice cost report and claims  data, we could not compare actual payments to costs. We did not apply  the wage adjustment, which generally adjusts payments up for urban areas  and down for rural areas to account for geographic differences in wages,  to the payment rates. We estimated per diem costs for all freestanding  hospices; for freestanding hospices of different sizes, with size defined by  the number of days of care a hospice provided during the year; and for  rural and urban freestanding hospices.", "To evaluate the appropriateness of the per diem payment methodology, we  compared the proportion of total costs attributable to different services  provided during RHC days when the payment rate was first determined, in  1983, to the proportion in 2001. We used the 2001 freestanding hospice  cost reports to calculate proportions of cost for 2001. Our estimates of  RHC costs in 2001 include CHC costs because RHC and CHC costs are  reported in aggregate on the hospice cost report. Using 2002 proprietary  data on patient visits collected by a large, for-profit hospice with multiple  freestanding facilities, which we refer to as patient-specific visit data, we  analyzed the types of visits provided to patients over the course of their  hospice stays. We used these proprietary data because Medicare hospice  cost reports and claims do not contain information on the visits hospices  provide to Medicare patients each day. We confirmed that the distribution  of visits in 2002 was consistent with the distribution in 1997 and 1999 for  this hospice. We also calculated descriptive statistics for this hospice and  compared them to statistics calculated using the Medicare hospice claims.  We determined these data were suitable for our purposes. We interviewed  officials at CMS, two national hospice associations, 18 hospices and  several national independent and academic hospice researchers, and we  conducted a site visit to a freestanding hospice with an inpatient unit.

Volunteers are an important resource in delivering hospice care; Medicare  requires each hospice to have volunteers provide services equal to at least  5 percent of the total paid patient care hours.

A typical day of care provided in a patient\u2019s  residence is paid as RHC, and in 2001, the vast majority of hospice care  days, 96 percent, were billed as RHC (see table 1). Unless a hospice  provides CHC, IRC, or GIC, it is paid the RHC rate for each day the patient  is under its care. Hospice care delivered during periods of crisis can be  paid as CHC if the care is provided in the home for at least 8 hours within  a 24-hour period beginning at midnight and at least half the care hours are  delivered by a nurse. To provide respite for primary caregivers, IRC can be  provided for up to 5 consecutive days in an inpatient setting. Inpatient care  for symptoms that cannot be treated in the patient\u2019s residence is paid as  GIC. Hospices provide the care in their own inpatient units or arrange with  hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or other inpatient facilities to provide  these services. The payment rate is adjusted by a wage index, which varies  based on the patient\u2019s residence, to account for geographic differences in  wage costs.", "The hospice payment categories and their corresponding payment rates  were developed from cost data from the 26 hospices that participated in  the 1980 to 1982 Medicare demonstration.

Total annual payments to a hospice  may not exceed a per-patient amount multiplied by the number of  Medicare patients who received care from that hospice during the year.

We have clarified  our conclusion to indicate the need for comprehensive, patient-specific  data on the visits and services delivered by hospices and the costs of these  services to inform any changes to the payment methodology.", "In response to our recommendation that CMS should submit a legislative  proposal to the Congress to implement those modifications that would  require a change in Medicare law, CMS stated that should it determine  changes are necessary, it would evaluate those changes as part of its  overall legislative strategy.", "CMS also made technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The external reviewers generally agreed with our findings and  recommendations. Comments on specific portions of the draft report  centered on two areas: our scope and methodology and the hospice  payment methodology.", "Regarding our scope and methodology, HAA and NHPCO were concerned  that we based our findings on Medicare freestanding hospice cost reports  that had not been audited. The large, for-profit hospice noted that the cost  report is complex and that hospices\u2019 accounting systems are not generally  compatible with its structure. Similarly, HAA and NHPCO stated that  hospices may not have had sufficient experience with completing the cost  reports at the time of our review. NHPCO stated that our exclusion of  hospice cost reports with fewer than 11 total patients or an average of less  than 1 patient per day might have excluded a substantial number of cost  reports. In addition, HAA and NHPCO recommended that we include  bereavement counseling costs in our per diem cost calculation. They  stated that although Medicare is precluded from paying hospices for  bereavement counseling, it is a required service, and excluding it from the  per diem cost calculation may misrepresent the amount by which payment  rates exceeded hospice costs.", "Regarding reviewers\u2019 concerns about our use of unaudited cost reports,  BBRA directed us to examine hospice cost factors. Information on these  factors is available only from cost reports, which CMS has not audited. As  stated in the draft report, we assessed the reliability of the cost reports by  comparing descriptive statistics calculated using the cost reports with  those calculated using the Medicare hospice claims, and found the data  suitable for our purposes. Regarding reviewers\u2019 concerns about data we  excluded from our analysis, we excluded 51 of 992, or 5 percent, of  freestanding hospice cost reports in 2000, and 48 of 975, or 5 percent, of  freestanding hospice cost reports in 2001, because they had fewer than   11 total patients or an average of less than 1 patient per day. We excluded  these cost reports because we believe that these hospices either had too  few patients to be representative of all hospices, or may have been  reporting data incorrectly. We do not believe that these represent  substantial numbers of cost reports and consider our exclusion criteria  appropriate. Concerning the comments that we should include  bereavement costs in our per diem cost calculation, as stated in the draft  report, we included only Medicare-reimbursable costs in our calculations.  If Medicare cannot, by law, pay hospices for bereavement services, it is  inappropriate to include them in a per diem cost that is compared to a  payment rate that is not designed to cover these costs. In 2001, in  comparison to total Medicare-reimburseable costs, bereavement costs  were small; they were equal to less than 2 percent of total Medicare- reimburseable costs.", "Reviewers also commented on the hospice payment methodology. NHPCO  stated that costs on the cost report may not reflect the provision of all  services that could potentially be provided because hospices may manage  their costs to more closely approximate the per diem rate. Although the  provision of additional services may be warranted, hospices cannot pay  for them and therefore do not provide them. HAA and NHPCO stated that  instances of CHC provision that fall close to 8 hours may not seem to  occur often because hospices avoid providing CHC if they know they will  not be able to provide at least 8 hours. However, HAA and NHPCO also  stated that data to determine whether this is the case are not available.", "Regarding industry comments on hospice costs and the hospice payment  methodology, we acknowledge that hospices may manage their costs to  closely approximate the per diem rate, and that hospices may not provide  CHC if they know they will not be paid for that level of care. Data are not  available to evaluate whether either of these situations occur.", "Reviewers also made technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Administrator of CMS and  appropriate congressional committees.

Richmond."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To examine hospice costs and Medicare payments, we used 2000 and 2001  Medicare hospice cost reports, the financial documents that hospices  submit annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  and 2000 and 2001 Medicare hospice claims data, bills submitted by  hospices to receive Medicare payment. We also used proprietary 2002  patient-specific visit data from a large for-profit hospice, which has been  collecting these data for its internal use since 1994. We interviewed  officials from CMS and one regional home health intermediary, a  contractor responsible for processing and paying Medicare hospice claims,  in addition to officials from AARP, the Hospice Association of America,  the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, and the Visiting  Nurse Associations of America. We also spoke with representatives from  18 hospices, several national independent and academic hospice  researchers, and two physicians who provide hospice care. Finally, we  conducted a site visit to a freestanding hospice with an inpatient unit.", "To assess the reliability of the cost report data, we compared descriptive  statistics calculated using the cost reports with those calculated using the  Medicare hospice claims data. Because hospices began submitting cost  reports in 1999, we also compared our calculations from the 2000 cost  reports to those from the 2001 cost reports to ensure that hospices had  provided consistent data. To assess the reliability of the claims data, we  compared descriptive statistics calculated using the claims with statistics  published by CMS. To assess the consistency of the 2002 patient-specific  visit data, we verified that the distribution of visits in the 2002 data was  similar to the distribution of visits in 1997 and 1999. In addition, before  releasing these data to us, the hospice performed quality assurance edits,  which consisted of confirming that the data provided to us were identical  to the data in its database for more than 20 randomly selected patients.  Finally, we calculated descriptive statistics and compared them with  statistics for all hospices calculated using the Medicare hospice claims. We  determined that the cost report, claims, and patient-specific data were all  suitable for our purposes.", "The 2000 and 2001 hospice cost reports were the most recent data  available at the time of our analysis. The Medicare payment methodology  is the same for freestanding and facility-based hospices; however, we  confined our analysis to cost reports of freestanding hospices. We  excluded hospital- based and home health agency-based hospices because  we found that their per diem costs were generally much lower than those  of freestanding hospices, which may result from decisions made by these  providers in allocating overhead costs between the hospital or home  health agency and the hospice. For freestanding hospices, the only costs  incurred are for delivering hospice care to patients. We excluded  freestanding cost reports that reported no or low Medicare utilization,  those that had cost reporting periods of fewer than 10 or greater than   14 months, and those outside the 50 states or District of Columbia. We also  excluded cost reports that had fewer than 11 total patients or an average  of less than 1 patient per day, those with no costs, and those reporting  costs outside three standard deviations of the mean. Our final sample  included 82 percent of all freestanding hospice cost reports in 2000 and   80 percent in 2001.", "We calculated freestanding hospices\u2019 total Medicare-reimburseable costs  by subtracting nonreimburseable costs, such as bereavement and fund- raising, from total costs. To obtain average per diem costs, we summed  total Medicare-reimburseable costs across all providers and divided by  total hospice days across all providers. In addition, because of the cost  report design, certain inpatient respite care (IRC), general inpatient care  (GIC), and physician costs may be included in our estimate of combined  routine home care (RHC) and continuous home care (CHC), or home care,  costs. As a result, home care costs may be overestimated, which would  result in our understating the amount by which the unadjusted home care  payment rate exceeds average home care per diem costs. Because of the  way cost centers are defined on the cost reports, the costs of IRC and GIC  may be underestimated.", "We based the size of a hospice in each year on the number of days of care  it provided that year. Small hospices were those that reported total days of  care less than the 25th percentile of all hospices\u2019 total days of care.  Medium hospices were those that reported total days of care equal to or  greater than the 25th percentile and less than or equal to the 75th  percentile of all hospices\u2019 total days of care. Large hospices were those  that reported total days of care greater than the 75th percentile of all  hospices\u2019 total days of care. We defined a hospice as urban if it was  located in a county that was in a metropolitan statistical area and as rural  if it was located in a county that was not in a metropolitan statistical area,  as determined by the Office of Management and Budget as of June 30,  1999.", "We could not compare the 2000 and 2001 per diem costs we calculated to  actual payments because hospice cost reports do not report Medicare  payment information. In addition, Medicare hospice claims contain only  the total payment for all services provided during the billing period,  including physician services, not the payment for each payment category.  Therefore, we calculated a 2000 and 2001 unadjusted payment rate that  encompassed all payment categories. We did so by weighting the  individual rates of the four payment categories by their respective  utilization in the freestanding hospice cost reports in our final sample in  each year. The costs for home care, combined RHC and CHC, are reported  in aggregate on the hospice cost report. Therefore, we calculated a 2000  and 2001 unadjusted payment rate that encompassed RHC and CHC. We  did so by weighting the individual rates of these two categories by their  respective utilization in the freestanding hospice cost reports in our final  sample in each year. In addition, we weighted the overall unadjusted  payment rate and the unadjusted payment rate for each payment category  to account for the different payment rates in effect during the year. The  majority of freestanding hospices report costs using a calendar year  reporting period, while payment rates are updated on a fiscal year basis,  that is, on October 1 of each year. Therefore, during a calendar year, one  payment rate is in effect from January 1 through September 30 and  another from October 1 through December 31. Our unadjusted payment  rates do not account for the wage adjustment Medicare applies to  payments.", "To determine the proportion of total cost in 2001 accounted for by each  service, such as nursing or home health aide services, that was included in  the 1983 RHC rate, we grouped the services on the cost report into  categories similar to the 1983 services, and divided by the total cost. Our  estimates of the proportions of 2001 RHC costs include CHC costs because  the costs of RHC and CHC are reported in aggregate on the hospice cost  report. It is likely that CHC costs were a very small proportion of  combined RHC and CHC costs, as CHC days accounted for just over 1  percent of total hospice days in 2001.", "To determine the percentage of total hospice days accounted for by each  payment category and the mean CHC hours per CHC day for all hospices,  we used 2000 and 2001 Medicare hospice claims data, the years that  matched most closely with the cost reports used for our analysis. We  excluded from our analysis patients who were younger than 20 or older  than 110 years of age, who lived outside of the 50 states or the District of  Columbia, and who had total hospice payments that fell below 1 day of  care at the lowest wage-adjusted RHC payment rate and above 1 year of  care at the highest wage-adjusted RHC payment rate. Our final sample  included over 98 percent of all claims in both 2000 and 2001.", "To analyze the frequency and types of visits to hospice patients, we used  proprietary 2002 data on Medicare hospice patients collected by a large,  for-profit hospice with multiple freestanding facilities. We determined the  number of visits per day and the number of nurse, home health aide,  counselor, and other caregiver visits per day for all days and for days  within each of the four payment categories. We also analyzed whether  there were differences in the number of visits per day provided by patient  length of stay, patient residence, diagnosis, number of secondary  conditions, and age and determined the number of visits in the first and  last week of a stay and for the remaining days of a stay.", "We conducted our work from January 2003 through October 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
