Staff are encouraged to apply the factors consistently, but there is no formula for applying them quantitatively. FEMA officials stated that FEMA relies most heavily on how the assessment of a state\u2019s capability compares with the costs entailed by the disaster. However, they acknowledged that \u201ccapability\u201d is not precisely defined and that determining a state\u2019s capability is subjective.", "The flexibility and generally subjective nature of FEMA\u2019s criteria have raised questions about the consistency and clarity of the disaster declaration process.

We previously reported that disclosing the process for evaluating requests would help state and local governments determine the circumstances that warrant federal assistance.

Furthermore, the situation was not life threatening. The governor waited until the damage assessments were completed for most of the affected counties before asking for a declaration.", "Conversely, a preliminary damage assessment was completed more quickly than usual following a 1993 earthquake in a very rural Oregon county. The speed with which the assessment was completed contributed to the governor\u2019s requesting a disaster declaration from SBA in less-than-average time.", "Another factor affecting the timing of requests to SBA is whether or not the governor first requests a presidential declaration for the same disaster incident. For example, following 1994 floods and tornadoes in North Carolina, the governor first requested a presidential disaster declaration. The same day that FEMA denied this request, the governor requested a declaration from SBA\u2014more than 4 weeks after the disaster incident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Period Between Gubernatorial Request and Declaration Decision", "paragraphs": ["The factors that affected the length of time between a gubernatorial request and a declaration decision included (1) the extent of documentation in the governor\u2019s request and (2) in the case of requests for SBA\u2019s assistance, whether or not the request was included in a request for a presidential declaration.", "Gubernatorial requests that are well documented generally can be processed more quickly, while missing documentation can contribute to delays, as in the following example. South Dakota experienced severe storms and flooding from March through July 1994, and in June the governor requested a disaster declaration from SBA. SBA required additional documentation showing that the incident was \u201csudden\u201d (the Small Business Act does not authorize assistance for \u201cgradual\u201d incidents), lengthening the time required before reaching a decision.", "Conversely, state officials credited the clarity of SBA\u2019s criteria for the agency\u2019s relatively quick decision on a request for assistance following a 1994 flood in a very urban Pennsylvania county. Because the criteria were clear, the governor could clearly address them in the disaster declaration request. Also contributing to SBA\u2019s quick declaration was that the damage occurred in a concentrated area, and it is easier to evaluate damage when it is concentrated than when it is more widely dispersed.", "The time that elapses between a governor\u2019s request and SBA\u2019s decision can be affected by whether or not the governor has requested a presidential declaration for the same disaster incident.

First, he suggested that we clarify that the time that elapses between a request for SBA\u2019s assistance and SBA\u2019s decision may be influenced by whether the request is made directly to SBA or is included in a request for a presidential declaration.

SBA suggested using the state as the unit of analysis. Our unit of analysis was the county because that enabled us to better distinguish between \u201crural\u201d and \u201curban\u201d areas. Accordingly, our analysis treats each county in a request equally, and our computed median times reflect the effects of the number of counties in each population density category and the length of time that elapsed between the request and SBA\u2019s decision. We do not believe that using states as the unit of analysis would allow us to distinguish between the experiences of rural and urban areas.", "The third point SBA raised was that for the gubernatorial request date, we used the date of the governor\u2019s request for assistance rather than the actual receipt of the governor\u2019s letter by SBA. SBA provided a sample of requests showing, on average, a 2-day difference between the date of the governor\u2019s letter and the actual date SBA received the request. We used the date of the letter to ensure consistency with FEMA\u2019s data set. We included SBA\u2019s sample in the final report.", "SBA\u2019s fourth comment was that the report should clarify that in those cases in which SBA denied the governor\u2019s request for a declaration, the requests were denied because they did not meet the agency\u2019s criteria.

FEMA\u2019s records show the incident date as January 2; however, a more accurate incident date might be later because the storm intensified starting January 8. The event period was never fully defined because the request was denied.", "A second potential factor was the nature of the incident. The request was unique because it was the first snow-removal request FEMA had received in nearly 15 years. FEMA\u2019s \u201csnow\u201d policy had become inactive, and confusion prevailed over matters such as determining which costs were eligible.

Since the road and bridge repair costs incurred by this disaster appeared to be relatively inexpensive, FEMA, in determining state and local government capability, scrutinized the request more closely than events with more obvious and expensive damage. FEMA officials noted that although the costs may be less, they recognized that the impact was not necessarily less.", "In addition to the request to the President for public assistance, the governor requested an SBA declaration for assistance to households and businesses in the same 15 counties as requested in the presidential request.

SBA\u2019s first comment was that for requests for SBA disaster assistance, our data on median elapsed times did not distinguish between (1) requests that are made directly to SBA and (2) requests that are referred by FEMA in cases in which requests for a presidential disaster declaration have been turned down. Our draft report stated that SBA\u2019s policy is to suspend action on requests it receives if the governor has requested a presidential declaration that includes individual assistance and that SBA does not act on such requests until the President has made a decision on the request for a presidential declaration.", "To respond to SBA\u2019s comment, we disaggregated requests for SBA assistance between (1) requests that are made directly to SBA and (2) requests that are referred by FEMA. We then computed the median and mean elapsed times for each group and included these data in appendix II. Among other things, the data show that for the requests that were made directly to SBA during 1993 and 1994, the median number of days between the gubernatorial request and SBA\u2019s decision was 7, or 34 days fewer than the median of 41 days for requests referred by FEMA. We added language to the letter noting this distinction. 2. SBA\u2019s second comment was that we used counties rather than states as the units of analysis and that governors\u2019 requests are on a \u201cstate basis.\u201d We used counties because doing so enabled a somewhat better distinction between \u201crural\u201d and \u201curban\u201d areas. Our report noted that (1) in cases of requests for a presidential disaster declaration, FEMA determines which counties within a declared state will receive assistance and (2) in the absence of a presidential declaration, the SBA Administrator may declare that counties struck by disasters are eligible to receive some types of SBA assistance. Our analysis treats each county in a request equally. Our computed median times reflect the effects of the number of counties in each population density category and the length of time that elapsed between the request and SBA\u2019s decision. We do not believe that using states as the unit of analysis would allow us to distinguish between the experiences of rural and urban areas. 3. SBA\u2019s third comment concerned our definition of \u201cdate of governor\u2019s request\u201d for SBA assistance. We used the dates that appeared on the governors\u2019 letters to ensure a data set consistent with FEMA\u2019s records. Our draft report noted that according to SBA officials, a gubernatorial request letter may not necessarily be mailed on the date of the letter and that any delays in mailing would help account for the time lapse between a gubernatorial request and an SBA decision, as shown by our analysis. We added the figures cited in SBA\u2019s comments to the final report. 4. SBA\u2019s fourth comment was that the report should clarify that any counties that were denied SBA assistance did not meet the agency\u2019s published criteria. Our draft report stated that SBA uses criteria, published in the Code of Federal Regulations, to determine whether or not a county is eligible for disaster assistance; therefore, we do not believe any change is necessary on the basis of this comment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Federal Emergency Management Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine if FEMA\u2019s and SBA\u2019s disaster declaration policies and procedures differ for requests for rural, as compared with urban, areas, we reviewed the Robert T.
