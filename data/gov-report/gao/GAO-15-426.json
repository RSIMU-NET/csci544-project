While the use of  interconnected electronic information systems allows the corporation to  accomplish its mission more quickly and effectively, this also exposes  FDIC\u2019s information to threats from sources internal and external to the  agency. Internal threats include errors, as well as fraudulent or  malevolent acts by employees or contractors working within the agency.  External threats include the ever-growing number of cyber-based attacks  that can come from a variety of sources such as hackers, criminals,  foreign nations, terrorists, and other adversarial groups.", "Potential cyber attackers have a variety of techniques at their disposal,  which can vastly enhance the reach and impact of their actions. For  example, cyber attackers do not need to be physically close to their  targets, their attacks can easily cross state and national borders, and they  can preserve their anonymity. Additionally, advanced persistent threats\u2014 where an adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and  significant resources can attack using physical and cyber methods to  achieve its objectives \u2014 pose increasing risks. Further, the  interconnectivity among information systems presents increasing  opportunities for such attacks. Indeed, reports of security incidents from  federal agencies are on the rise. Specifically, the number of incidents  reported by federal agencies to the United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team  (US-CERT) has increased dramatically in recent years:  from 5,503 incidents reported in fiscal year 2006 to 67,168 incidents in  fiscal year 2014.", "Compounding the growing number and types of threats are the  deficiencies in security controls on the information systems at federal  agencies, which have resulted in vulnerabilities in both financial and  nonfinancial systems and information. These deficiencies continue to  place assets at risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse, financial  information at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction, and critical  operations at risk of disruption. Accordingly, we have designated  information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997, a  designation that remains in force today.", "Federal law and guidance specify requirements for protecting federal  information and information systems. The Federal Information Security  Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) provides a comprehensive framework  for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over  information resources that support federal operations and assets. To  accomplish this, FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and  implement an agency-wide information security program to provide  information security for the information and systems that support its  operations and assets, using a risk-based approach to information  security management. Such a program includes assessing risk;  developing and implementing cost-effective security plans, policies, and  procedures; providing specialized training; testing and evaluating the  effectiveness of controls; planning, implementing, evaluating, and  documenting remedial actions to address information security  deficiencies; and ensuring continuity of operations.", "FISMA also assigned to the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) the responsibility for developing standards and  guidelines that include minimum information security requirements.

In  addition, FDIC had implemented and strengthened many information  security controls over its financial systems and information. For example,  the corporation had taken steps to improve controls for segregating  incompatible duties, identifying and authenticating users, restricting user  access to only what has been authorized, encrypting of sensitive data,  and auditing and monitoring systems for potentially malicious activity, by  addressing many of the weaknesses that we previously reported.", "However, management attention is still needed to address shortcomings  in the corporation\u2019s information security program. For example,  shortcomings in certain security policies and procedures led to  weaknesses in conducting and documenting reviews of user access.  Additionally, further actions are needed to address weaknesses in  identification and authentication, authorization, and audit and monitoring  controls. Given the important role that information systems play in FDIC\u2019s  internal controls over financial reporting, it is vitally important that FDIC  address the remaining weaknesses in information security controls\u2014both  old and new\u2014as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate the risks from cyber  attacks and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its  financial and sensitive information. Although we do not consider these  weaknesses individually or collectively to be either a material weakness  or a significant deficiency for financial reporting purposes, we are  nevertheless making five recommendations in a separate product with  limited distribution for FDIC to address new weaknesses we identified in  this review. Until FDIC takes further steps to mitigate these weaknesses,  the corporation\u2019s sensitive financial information and resources will remain  unnecessarily exposed to increased risk of inadvertent or deliberate  misuse, improper modification, unauthorized disclosure, or destruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the corporation\u2019s implementation of its information  security program, we recommend that the Chairman of FDIC direct the  Chief Information Officer to take the following two actions:", "Ensure that physical access policies require periodic review of access  to all FDIC data centers.", "Update existing procedures to require that access verifications to the  system supporting the marketing of failed banks\u2019 assets be  documented.", "Additionally, in a separate report with limited distribution, we are making  five recommendations consisting of actions to implement and correct  specific information security weaknesses related to identification and  authentication, authorization, and audit and monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments (reprinted in app. II) on a draft of this  report, FDIC stated that corrective actions for the two new  recommendations have already been or will be completed during 2015.
